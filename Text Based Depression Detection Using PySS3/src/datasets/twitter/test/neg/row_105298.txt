I keep having these delusions that before I shoot myself, I tell all 2 contacts in my phone that I was sorry I could never reciprocate their emotions. I get so lost in my head, though, I get scared that the person who wants to apologize might not come back and the person who feels only loathing, hate, and revenge might return. I never felt 'not in control' of my actions, but when you have so many other possible worlds where people try to screw you over, it's hard to identify where ideas and motives come from. 

I always prided myself on my sense of awareness, but I have learned that it might either be schizophrenia or just lame ass anxiety. That being said sometimes when that other part of who I am forces other realities- and I won't call that part human because I have reasoned that humans have an innate drive to live which ***it*** doesn't - on me, I can feel goosebumps on my skin which to me feel pleasurable. Normally, ***I*** don't feel many emotions so when I do, I appreciate it despite it finally catching up to me after 3 years of not knowing I could get hooked on goosebumps.

Its funny how ***I***  don't feel much, but the other thing can process every facial gesture, tone of voice, and implied meanings yet manages to extract nothing but resentment and ill-will.

I just found out thought that in Texas, you are only allowed to buy a handgun at 21 which means that my life just got extended by one year. I promised myself that I wouldn't off myself before 20 so that time would fix me, but it just turned into an endpoint.
