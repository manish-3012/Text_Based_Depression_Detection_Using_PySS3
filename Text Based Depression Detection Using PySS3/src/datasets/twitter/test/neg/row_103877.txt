Getting lied to hurts so much I want to off myselfI'm crying so much as I'm typing this right now. In april and may I asked 10 girls to go to prom with me and all of them rejected me. I didn't even expect anything from them expect to have someone to go with and have fun. I would've treated them nice and even driven my dad's bmw to prom. I looked up sites for help to ask girls out. I started lowering my standards after the 6th rejection and started asking girls out that I knew for sure did not have a prom date and wanted to go to prom. One of the girls told me she didn't plan on going to prom with a date but with her group of friends instead.
I ended up driving two of my friends with their prom dates and they only talked to me because they needed a ride to the after party where I ended up having a drink with my group before they went on to do their own things and I just said fuck it and left because no one was talking to me. On the way to my car I just had the luck of seeing one of the girls I got rejected by making out with a guy in the car right behind mine and it was the girl that said she did not plan on going to prom with a date and now she's making out with a lucky bastard that some how convinced her to change her mind in the span of a few weeks? They didn't even notice me staring at them before I regained my composure and got in my car and left. Am I so undesirable that I can't even get one girl to go on a date with me. I asked over 10 girls and have a 100% failure rate. If I leave this world today I know I'll be the only person in human history to fail at being a human being because I have no worth to anyone that would make them want to be with me.
Summer is half over and most of the time when I ask my friends to do something they always reply back saying they might be going on a date with their girlfriend without even offering an alternative date or putting aside time for me.

Originally I posted this 2 weeks earlier but it didn't pass the filter because I mentioned a subreddit that's filtered. Just a small update as to what I've been doing. I've started playing a couple of new games I've brought from steam summer sale. Most of these are single player games because I'm not very good in multiplayer games such as csgo which honestly makes me want to kill myself because of how toxic some people in that game are. I also try limiting the amount of time I spend on facebook because I've found myself looking through people's photo albums for hours trying to see what other people are doing in their lives.

I haven't tried asking any girls out since because I'm still depressed thinking about getting rejected so many times. Every day I play the rejection scenarios through my head. If I were to off myself now it would be very easy because my dad is a cop and he doesn't know I know the entry key for his vault. It scares me to hold a gun in my hand because I can end it so quickly.
