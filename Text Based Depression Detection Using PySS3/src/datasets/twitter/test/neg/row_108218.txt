ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠNo matter how famous you are, or how much you have, friends or family, there are really things that can never satisfy someone, even if you are rich or everybody pleases you, it just isnâ€™t the same, no one would understand, or nobody can understand whatâ€™s going on in someoneâ€™s mind, they probably just want to have the happiness they had before, or something, others simply keep you, to prevent you from killing yourself....

Not even money can satisfy you, all the actors, streamers that get a lot of donations, they arenâ€™t satisfied with earthly desires..

You know I just got out of the hospital after trying to kill myself with acetaminophen overdose, I nearly died, my family saved me, I didnâ€™t do it for them to notice me, I didnâ€™t do it for my girlfriend to see me and feel pity on me and come back to me, from time to time I feel depressed, itâ€™s just coming back.. I might decide for real this time to just end it after I help my girlfriend pay the debts of her credit card we used, things just donâ€™t keep me happy anymore, I am very grateful, and I tried so much but right now Iâ€™m about to tear up as I type this message. I might go to strip later to try and get covid, if not then I might go to mt. Charleston and tie a noose around my head, I am very grateful to the Lord for everything, I just sometimeâ€™s donâ€™t understand anymore...
