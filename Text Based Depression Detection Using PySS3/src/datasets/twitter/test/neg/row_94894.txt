I made the first step to getting help, it was difficult.I didnt know where to start, I mean how do you tell your Parents that you want to die at only 15? I felt guilty, like it was my fault for feeling like this. I'm getting counselling in school starting Monday and I'm sorta nervous about that, I don't know why I feel like this, and in a sense that makes me feel worse, I've got a loving family and a good life yet I want it all to end? Trust me though if you haven't told anyone about it yet, do it now, it seems like a big deal but once the words are out it just gets better, everyone was so loving and helpful. Thank you everyone on here for telling me to tell someone, you just saved my life &lt;3
