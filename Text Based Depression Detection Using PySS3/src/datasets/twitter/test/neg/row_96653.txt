Human to human...Ive been here on this app and group for 2 days. In those 2 days i have had multiple suicide tendencies and made half a suicide note.

But the things im most proud of being here:
Giving others a chance to be heard.
I have provided some form of support even if its little conversation.
Knowing that i have interrupted their thoughts of suicide.
That by reading their story it has interfered with my own thoughts of suicide.

To those still thinking you have no purpose... read the previous sentence, and for that I thank you. Im still a long way from my suicidal journey. I will be back. Im thankful for this platform.
