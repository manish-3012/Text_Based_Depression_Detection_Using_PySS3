Tomorrow is the big day...I have my plan worked out perfectly itâ€™s my boyfriends day off tomorrow, and he always sleeps in, so Iâ€™m going to down all the pills in the house my antidepressants, sleeping pills, kolonopin, ibprophen, and a bottle of wine, then just climb into bed with him and my puppy and enjoy some last moment cuddles before the pills take me. It will be like I passed in my sleep, I of course wrote a note, itâ€™s six pages long. I donâ€™t want to leave him and my animals but life just isnâ€™t bearable anymore, I know he will understand and so will everyone else. They know how much I suffer and they will know Iâ€™m at peace now. I thought about jumping but I donâ€™t want to be alone when I die so Iâ€™m choosing to die next to what I love.
