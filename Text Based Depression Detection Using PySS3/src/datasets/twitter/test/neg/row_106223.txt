I want to give upJesus Christ I feel like everything is slow. I'm mad and sad and angry at the same time. I feel like a waste of space and completely worthless to everyone around me. Friends, family and those that do care I continually push away. I used to be smart get straight A's. Now I mostly get B's and C's. I feel like nothing I want nothing.
