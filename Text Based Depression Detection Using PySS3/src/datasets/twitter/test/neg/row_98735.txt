Perfectionism &amp; No WorthSo you know what's fun?  


I played the game.    


I struggled in my first year of University, I did.  Shortly after switching programs I was in a horribly abusive relationship and was diagnosed with multiple psychiatric conditions. This obviously affected my GPA.  I came back with a 1.3 - like conditional.  Since i have come back to school, I have maintained steady 3.9+ GPAs for two years.  

I might not be eligible because of the switching/program going to therapy few years.  I don't know what to do.  I was told I would get this financial award if I met the eligibility.  What if my suicidality and two years of therapy hold me back and prevent me from getting the award?  I feel like resiliency should count but fuck.  Fuck.  I brought my GPA up from a 1. something to over a 3.8 while dealing with therapy and organizing funerals so fuck.  Fuck.  Why fucking bother if everyone will hold that awful 12-24 month crisis against you?  Why struggle against anything if the rest of society, once you try to re-join, just says "fuck you, weirdo."  


I'm feeling very lost right now.
