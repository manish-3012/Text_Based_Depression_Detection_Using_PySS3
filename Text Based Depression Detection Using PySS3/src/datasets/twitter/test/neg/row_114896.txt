I've been legitimately considering it latelyI'm 22, still live at home, super depressed with no car, job or schooling. I have no motivation to get any of those things and I hate everything about myself. My dad is emotionally abusive, my mom ignores and doesn't care about me and my brother is old enough that the doesn't need me anymore. I can't picture myself going any further. If I could snap my fingers and be able to drive (anxiety keeps me from doing so, and no i can't go to therapy) then things might be better cause I could get a job and go to college. But that obviously can't happen so a rope and the closet keeps getting closer and closer to the only way out of this shitty life.
