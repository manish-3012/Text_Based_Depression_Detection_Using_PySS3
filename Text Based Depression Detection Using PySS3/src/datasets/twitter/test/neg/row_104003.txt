Here's my suicide note. I hope i actually do it (one day) and not be a cowardI finally did it. I decided to end my life, and now you know all of the years i was talking about it i was serious. What makes you so surprised? I can't remember a chapter in my life that things worked in my favor, even with the effort i put in, or perhaps i was a lazy sad sap after all. Please don't come to my funeral if you remember treating me like shit. That would be sad for us. Just don't show up, if you were an asshole to me, you don't enjoy my company, and you know it, then respect me for once and don't come to my funeral. Now, i see i don't actually have a worth in life, that makes life important for me to stay. So why not go? Anyway, i never achieved an intelligent brain, being that i was disruptive in school, it never being for me. Im finally ready for death, as it was waiting for me early on, due to the learning difficulties and such. I guess i kind of took the pill, that is, if you put your efforts into something, try your best, then you will get the result you want. For me, that's someone who loves me, a special woman who would be with me through the best and worst of times. But she needs a man that actually has some good moments, which has never happened for me. I've tried a change of attitude, etc but im just ruminating now, so i took the painless route which should be beneficial for all of us as economically I've been unhelpful with being a productive citizen. Mom, dad, bro, and the rest of you... We're all humans, maybe we fought and disagreed, perhaps i wasn't an exemplary character, or you weren't good to me. I don't know. Im sorry im killing myself but i do think it's time i must go. I love you all, and genuinely hope it works out better for you than it did for me. Don't fucking say i was a sweet and kind soul too, that's super obnoxious. I've done some evil shit. I think we all have, but yes, i have been bullied and cheated frequently because they see me as a doormat. Yes, you may donate my organs.
