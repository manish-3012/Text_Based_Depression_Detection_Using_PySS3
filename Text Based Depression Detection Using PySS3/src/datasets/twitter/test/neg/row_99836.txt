Iâ€™ve ruined my lifeYesterday I tried to kill myself. It didnâ€™t work obviously. I hung myself in my closet and woke up on the floor. 
I drove drunk with my friend and her kids in my car. I was blacked out. She knew I was drinking. I donâ€™t even remember the kids getting in my car. Someone pulled out in front of me and we wrecked. Everyone was fine. Thankfully. I already know how much of a pos I am. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. 
I just graduated school with my RN just started my new life. And now itâ€™s all over. 
Iâ€™m getting a felony charge that carries a life sentence.   I donâ€™t know what else to say here except that Iâ€™ve ruined my life.
