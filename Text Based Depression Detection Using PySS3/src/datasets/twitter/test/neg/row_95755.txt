I feel fine until suddenly I don't.I've been depressed and suicidal for many years, I made 3 attempts a few years back (nobody ever really found out until way later). Recently it's felt like... idk, I'm fine, I'm happy, except that I randomly wanna kill myself. Really, really bad. Like I'll be chilling out and suddenly I'm making a detailed suicide plan.

It really feels like once I'll be just bored or inebriated enough that I'll randomly do it. Honestly I'd be tempted to do it now. 

What. The fuck? I'm not even that depressed anymore? Things have been looking up? So many people would be crushed if I died, yet I don't fucking care??? All I want to do is fucking kill myself.

I'm so confused.
