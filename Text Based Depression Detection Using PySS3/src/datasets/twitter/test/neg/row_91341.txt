Still feeling suicidalI ended up in emergency again. Another fail suicide attempt that no one will know or care about. I'm so alone, I have no more friends, I no longer have a girlfriend. My parents hate me and don't want me, they blame me for their fighting. No one cares about me, everyone just hates me. People would be happy if I where to die. I have a job interview tomorrow, I think I'm going to kill my self after it. I just can't live life anymore. I can't bare it anymore.
