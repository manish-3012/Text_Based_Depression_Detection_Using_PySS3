the life i wanted to have isnt an option anymoreTwo weeks ago i was accused of hitting my mom after drinking, im not guilty. shes not even pressing charges, the DA is. she she fell and hit her head, as shes has done in the past while drunk, and she started screaming. i got frustrated so i covered her mouth, she started screaming louder. she tried running away so i ran to grab her and we fell to the floor and i put my hands over her mouth. the neighbors came in and i was on top of her with my hands over her mouth. they called the cops and i was accused of hitting her, causing the injury. i was brought to jail where i had the worst experience of my life. i was placed in cells with insane people, treated like an animal, i told someone what happened and they tried to beat me up thinking i was lying and i actually hit my mom. 

now i am charged with aggravated battery,which ia an automatic disqualification for any military branch, so now i cant do the thing ive wanted to do my whole life, and will most likely go to jail again. i was kicked out of my moms house, im treated differently by family and friends, i cant get a job because of the charge. once im convicted the job issue will continue, and ill have trouble renting a house. 

my brother tried to confront me tonight and make me admit that i hit her and when i didnt he broke a glass on the counter cutting his hand. 

i cant go back to jail, that place is fucked. 

i wont be able to join the military, which i had been trying to get medically cleared for for 6 months. people thought i was faking trying to join. 

i wont be able to get a decent job. 

i wont be able to get a decent apartment without paying a premium.

the life i was going to have is being fucked. 

i know i could just start a new after all is said and done but i dont even like the world we live in now a days, so whats the point in going though all of this shit to be unhappy either way. 

too tired to explain everything but im jut over this world. who knows where ill be in the next couple days. later.
