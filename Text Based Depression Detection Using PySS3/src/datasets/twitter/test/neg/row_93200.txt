Nearly every day I fantasize about killing myself and I'm afraid I'll do it. I'm close to it now.To everyone else, I'm a happy go lucky jackass. I'm typically the one making everyone laugh. Most people think I don't give a fuck. 

But I do. Deep down I'm sad. Growing up I was always blown off by my family and friends and never had the attention I crave. And now with my new face I show I've become the clown. People only want to be around me for a laugh. I've never had any deep friendships and I feel alone. Soul crushingly alone. I won't be missed when I die. And it hurts. 

Nearly everyday I dream of hanging myself from a tree deep in the woods with a pair of jumper cables I have in my car. And it would be done - I'd never feel lonely again. Never feel unimportant. Never feel like a joke.
It sounds like a beautiful release...but it also scares me. 

I might just do it. 

EDIT: I'm  a 19 year old male and doing well in life.
