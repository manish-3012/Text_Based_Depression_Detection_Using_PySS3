just fuck lifeI've fallen too far behind and I don't have the energy to backtrack and do what I should've done 10yrs ago. My job is undignified. I can't make enough to get by. I moved back in with my mum who's struggling too. I've fallen out of touch with friends. I don't even know how close we were. I've never felt a deep connection with everyone. I can't relate to anyone I interact with on a regular basis. The world is falling apart. Everything is going extinct. I'm part of this horribly ramped surplus human population I should at least have the honor to take myself out for the greater good. I've left very little impact on those around me and my absence from this world would be relatively easy for everyone who thinks they know who I am to get over.
