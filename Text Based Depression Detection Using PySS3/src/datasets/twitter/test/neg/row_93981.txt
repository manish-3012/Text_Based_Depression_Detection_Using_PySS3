*happily* thinking of euthanasiaI havenâ€™t felt myself lately since sh*t has fell apart. Everything has been completely ruined because of my craziness, stupidity, and blah blah blah. Everything I had done has been thrown in my face. Making me look like a prisoner. I donâ€™t deserve anything at all. Iâ€™ve realised Iâ€™m totally a waste of oxygen. Whatever I have done is wrong. 

Iâ€™ve tried to be positive. Iâ€™ve tried not to pull myself down. Iâ€™ve been seeking help, but itâ€™s like, whatâ€™s the point then when I constantly drag myself down to hell. Iâ€™ve tried to move on and forward. But memories still haunt me. 

I donâ€™t actually want to die, I just donâ€™t want to be in pain anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. 

Iâ€™m just too close to the edge. Iâ€™m just too close to the cliff. Iâ€™m just too close to death. 

Iâ€™ve happened to google about euthanasia, telling my close friend about it, sheâ€™s tried to convince me not to, but yet she still respected my decision. 

Iâ€™m questioning myself why Iâ€™m posting this. Iâ€™m not trying to seek attention, and I know this may sound really stupid, and I may get told off for this, but I just really, seriously, want to know how I can get euthanised, what I need to do, etc. 

Thank you for reading/commenting.
