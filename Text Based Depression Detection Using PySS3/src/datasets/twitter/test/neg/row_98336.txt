I wish i could stop thinking (tw; sexual abuse)I feel like I am surrounded by rape and sexual violence. 

I've not been raped...I think. I blacked out once at a party 2 years back and to this day I don't know what this girl did, but the last thing I recall was her locking the door of the bedroom and leaning into me as I was laying down on the bed having a bad trip and wasted. She then spread varying rumours saying I came onto her and attacked her like a crazy person, even though I couldn't walk. She stalked me online and told people that we were in a secret relationship. It was creepy. So...

I don't know. 

Otherwise, I have been groped at through out my entire life. The other boys in my school when I was only 10ish used to grab at me, and the adults just brushed it off as "rough housing", but I know what it was. Children understand more than adults give them credit for. 

I've had girls come at me too, drunk and slobbish. I used to think I was bisexual, but I've never had an experience with a girl that was sexual that I wanted and I think I lean towards men now because of that trauma. 

The one I love was raped in the past multiple times. My friend's ex tried to rape her only a few weeks ago. fuck.

The town I live in now is notorious for rapes. In the new school year over a dozen people were raped on my uni campus. 

We have a dark sense of humour about it though. That's how we deal with it, but it's suffocating how often the subject is on my mind because of how it's in everyone i care about's past and on the news all the time and in films and....

I feel sick. 

I want to stop thinking about it. 

But I can't.
