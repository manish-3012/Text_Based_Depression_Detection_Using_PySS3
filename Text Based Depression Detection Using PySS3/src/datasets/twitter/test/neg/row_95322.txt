Ready to Give UpI don't think I can take any more suffering. I was sexually abused when I was five. Emotionally abused by my family. Gender dysphoria nearly killed me in high school. I've been struggling with crippling mental illnesses, substance abuse, and homelessness since. I finally met someone I love, who truly makes me happy, but she's in the UK. I tried to visit her but was turned away at the border. We were both pushed back into sex work because of how much money we lost. I was raped by a 'friend' just a few weeks ago at my own birthday party. Sometimes I really believe that this world is actually hell. I'm not sure I can keep going. The pain never seems to stop.
