Ugh!So Iâ€™ve been having suicide thoughts recently. They come and go. Either I feel numb and I canâ€™t hear my thoughts, or I finally can and they basically tell to kill myself. I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t really want to tell others though because if I donâ€™t end up going through with it theyâ€™ll look at me as being lame..a coward..and theyâ€™ll know Iâ€™ll just be a drag. If I do it, at least Iâ€™ll be able to show people I am brave. I can just imagine everyoneâ€™s faces who hurt me. Oh now you feel bad for hurting me? Thatâ€™s wonderful. Too late though..if only I could be there
