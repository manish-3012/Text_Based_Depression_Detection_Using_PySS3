Please don't!5 years ago my father committed suicide and it still hurts so, so, so terribly. I miss him so much. Please don't put other people through what I and many others have had to go through. :(    I have also at times seriously considered suicide, but don't only because I wouldn't want to put my family through that misery again. Please, please, please don't -- I am so sorry that you are feeling that depressed and my heart really does go out to you. I will talk to you. No matter what, you are not alone. You are never alone.
