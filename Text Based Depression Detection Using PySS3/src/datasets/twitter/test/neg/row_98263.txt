Every night I want to kill myself, and every morning it's goneEvery night, without fail, I have the urge to begin planning my suicide, and sometimes I do, and then I wake up in the morning and it's like amnesia strikes me, and I rip up my plans and carry on, only to end up in the same place again. It's been a constant cycle and I'm worn out by it...nothing ever changes. Nothing ever improves. I find myself in bed having accomplished nothing in the past three years and with no hope on the horizon.
