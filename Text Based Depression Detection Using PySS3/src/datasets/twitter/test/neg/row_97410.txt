Friend is deeply suicidal. How can I help?Thanks for your time, SW: I'm not in any personal danger, feel free to point me to more appropriate places if needed.

My friend is in a really bad place right now. Struggling with grades, issues at home, boy issues, depression. She brought herself off antidepressants recently, and last night (for the second time, though first time was a while ago), she tried to commit suicide. I clicked soon enough what was happening to go round and stop her, but she told me this morning that she had "not more than 20 pills" of paracetamol before I arrived. So, SW:

1. What do I do?
2. What sort of risk is she in? (NHS says 16 pills is dangerous, I'm hoping this is conservative, but at the same time, she's a small girl)
3. What's the best way to keep her going? I'm worried she's still suicidal, and getting her to talk to me today about it has been tricky. I'm stepping lightly to try and keep the trust she has in me (she's frightened I'll call an ambulance, and it's certainly what I'm screaming to do inside but if I do, there's nothing to stop her trying again later if I do, and then she won't tell me at all)
4. I've reviewed the paracetamol toxicity page on wikipedia, but I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to keep an eye on her. The flatmates don't know. Is there anything behavioural above and beyond the trust thing I've described above that might help me see what's going on even if she won't say outright?

I'm really worried, and I want to help, even though it's not what she wants. Please help me find how to help her without causing her to retreat away.
