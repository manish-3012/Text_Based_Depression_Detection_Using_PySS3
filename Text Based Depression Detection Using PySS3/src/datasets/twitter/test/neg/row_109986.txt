I need someone. Long post sorry, on mobileMy wife and our two young kids are leaving me. I did some bad things, never to my wife or kids, oh i protect them with my life. My wife doesnt trust me anymore, and what I did was in a mental haze of depression and panic/mania.

Its all my fault, i know.

I am with them now in bed, she said it's over.

This has happened before 6 months ago and i was kicked out of the home , came back 7 days later and made up, our kids  are very young, happy healthy,  we have a house, i make a lot of money a travel the world and am a fit, young guy in Australia. Perfect life.

The stuff I did was dating site related, but no cheating (physical cheating) happened. 

My wife knows this but has lost all trust, and with two kids we have been drifting apart, dont have time together and i have had depression. Our good days are perfect. My wife is controlling and has her bad days and is sometimes rude, but that's normal, she didn't go on a dating site like i did. She has the right to tell me to leave and never see them again. But I know she is sayingbthis out of anger and fear, and to punish me.

My wife's wants me to leave and thinks all of us will be happier, including me, when we are not a family. She think i just want to fuck around.

I told her this, but without my kids and her, i have nothing to fight for. It was hard enough when everything was perfect, or nearly perfect.

In was onnverge of suicide when i had  everything   I can't live another 50 years being reminded of what I could have had and showing me what I there away.

And people say stay to raise yours kids etc. I can't. If ii am not with my family full time, i will lose my job, i will go into non reversible depression, and i know I will kill myself. The only way I can sleep without medication for the past 7 years is to envision about me killing myself which is the only way I find peace
 
I have planned it, no bullets or poison or drugs, 100% success, no one else will get hurt


I am giving her a week, i am trying my best and loving her and won't give up ever! She knows this. But if i have absolutely 100% lost her I will go for good. I will not be a good father, no income, i will not be tha best man and husband i can and need to be and i could not exist. I would hate my kids to see me lower into a homeless drug addict and would hate for them to remember their successfully fit and hero father like that.

I told my wife family is my only purpose and the only thing that makes me smile.

I could not live if we don't stay, i have come so close to suicide for years even with the perfect happy family and life. I always knew i would die from suicide since I was 5. The panic and depression is not worth the good times.

I am sorry son, i am sorry daughter, but if mum and dad arent together i can't be a good model for you and i will have to kiss you goodbye and leave you my wishes. It will be for the best.

February 5th is the date.

I have planned this for 6 years, and i guess i might of done the tinder thing hoping she would find out through a friend (which what happened ) as i know that i would die if we aren't together. I knew the risk i would lose her and i still did it.

Maybe this was all fate.

I don't want to and cannott be talked out of it. My decision is final. I just wanted to know if someone had been though this, being caught flirting with other girls as when you have kids, the romance and sex goes. I started going gym and got swole,  and i love this new attention, it made me feel alive, like a man and gave me happiness (falsely) of being wanted. My wife was always there its nothing she has done

I knew if i got caught i couldn't live without them,  but I did it. 

As anyone been in this situation? Not the suicide but losing your family from a silly mistake. I don't have anyone to talk too.
