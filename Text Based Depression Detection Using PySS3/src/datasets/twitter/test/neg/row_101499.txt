I don't see any purpose of my lifeI've been depressed half my life. I believe it all started before i went to highschool. Anxiety came later on. Parents destroyed my self-esteem always telling me im not worth shit which led to a boring high school life. I'm that guy who's always alone in the corner of the room and when it's breaktime i disappear.

Everything that i do is wrong into their eyes. Just me eating a food in the house is enough to make them furious to beat me up.

My depression probably got worse when my mother took me to another country. I felt how lonely i was. I was always alone in the house.. doing all the chores, no one to talk to... even my "friends" didn't bother contacting me via facebook or skype.. i wanted them to atleast ask how im feeling there.. but no one asked..

And when i came back to my coutry a year later... they all flocked up to me like im some kind of a celebrity... and they started asking for a souvenir.

I know im only telling my life story here and im sorry for that...

I just dont know what to do anymore

My whole life has been full of regret

Regrets that i wish i could've undone

I dont know what im suppose to do in my life.. it doesn't have any purpose.. no one loves me... even the one person i thought i could trust betrayed me..

Now tell me why death isn't the best option at this point of life...

Im just tired of all these shit that's happening to me.. i want to rest
