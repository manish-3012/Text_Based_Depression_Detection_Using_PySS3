I just found out I probably can't go back to college this fallJust got my bill for the term today and found out that not only has my tuition gone up despite financial aid and my family's income having gone down this past year, but that I owe $4100 by the 15th. I don't have that money and neither do my parents, so I am fucked. I can't go back to college all thanks to my stupid dad not paying it in the spring. I rode his ass to get the money and he didn't listen and now I have to suffer. Why me? I can't not go back to college this fall. It was my only escape from this hell they have created here at home. I have to die. I can't take it anymore. I need to end it all ASAP so I can finally be free from this hell since the other alternative has no end in sight for said hell.
