Today, I feel like the gears have been set in motionI have been having suicidal thoughts for a while now. In my mind I've crafted letters I want to leave my family and friends (it's the first thing I think of when I wake up most mornings), but I've been putting off actually writing them in an attempt to prevent/delay me actually conducting it. But today, for some reason, the urge to write them was so strong I couldn't stop myself. Granted, I only ended up writing one out of a few that I've planned to write, but still... I feel like the wheel is starting to turn, I'm one step closer to the end, and I feel nothing about it.
