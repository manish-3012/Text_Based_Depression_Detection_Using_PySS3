Anyone else lost family members? And so it justifies it in a way.Iâ€™m a bit of an anomaly. Well not really since thereâ€™s 7 billion humans and Iâ€™m just 1 of them. But, my grandpa, PTSD from WW2, shot himself in the head when my dad was 5. My uncle (dads brother) went on to lead a solitary life. He worked at Fed Ex for 25 years then there was a small mishap where he was laid off for 2 weeks. He hung himself, left all his money to a female pen pal that he didnâ€™t even have a physical relationship with. My dad, on the other hand, is the true anomaly, he went on to become a self made multi millionaire, an ultimate achiever and ran 30 marathons.

Then thereâ€™s my brother and me. My brother became a huge failure, I was the only hope. Not to sound shallow but I was highly intelligent coupled with bipolar disorder. I completed some fantastic works of creativity, I wanted to be a comedian and wrote 6K one liner jokes and 1,000 poems and some YouTube videos. I knew about ASMR and bitcoin in their infancy but never got involved enough and now that theyâ€™ve blown up Iâ€™m left in the dust.

So here I am, drunk, 29 y/o, trying so hard to be sober, but when I have days like today where Iâ€™m so inundated with depression I just need a dude and thatâ€™s alcohol. 

Iâ€™m 2 months from 30 y/o and on my birthday, Iâ€™m going to go sit by the train tracks a half mile from my dads million dollar beach house and think about jumping in front of it. I really donâ€™t want to but what else is there? I have literally nothing. If it werenâ€™t for him Iâ€™d be a homeless nobody loser. 

Sorry Iâ€™m just rambling. Itâ€™s all about extremes. You post to depression and nobody gives a fuck. You post here and maybe somebodyâ€™s watching. Iâ€™m drunk if you couldnâ€™t tell by my disarray in this post. I have nothing. Want to die constantly. Schizoaffective bipolar type 2. Good looking but itâ€™s such a shallow way to validate myself. I can only imagine what love is like, I havenâ€™t had sex in 7 years. Want to spend all my money on Chinese food right now for a temporary bliss. The world of money equates to relationships, joy, everything. My dad doesnâ€™t care if I succeed, neither do I to be frank. I just want love. But thereâ€™s no way. Maybe Iâ€™ll die young, maybe by some miracle things will change.
