Fuck you allIâ€™ve always been excluded. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m â€œthat guyâ€ who people always joke about and deliberately avoid. Iâ€™m the invisible person. Iâ€™ve never been part of a group. I have never had anyone love me intimately. Iâ€™ve never been to a party.  I have never had anyone ask me how I was doing. Iâ€™ve kept to my studies and thatâ€™s about all there is that Iâ€™m proud about. If I finish my academic career I hope to be on top of society. I want every single person who has ever excluded me, every single person who had fun while I suffered through school to suffer themselves. I want them scrubbing toilets in some rathole because thatâ€™s what they deserve. I will have worked harder than them. I do. They can enjoy life while it lasts. If I donâ€™t make it all the way through university, then I will probably go off and live in the woods or something. But I want to study and make a career off of what I love, and I want to make everyone regret their stupid choices in school. I want my family to be healthy. I just want to be at peace. Just for once
