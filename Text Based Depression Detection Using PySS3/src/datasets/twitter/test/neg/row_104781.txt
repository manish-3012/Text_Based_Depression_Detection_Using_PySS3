I feel LESS suicidal now that God has blessed us with a Biden/Harris victory, soon to be a Harris/Michelle Obama leadership.Biden will unfortunately retire soon due to senility and dementia.

BUT, God is revealing that diversity truly is a strength. (Harris/Obama)

What could go wrong?

I  say, who cares what goes wrong. We must PRAY to make diversity work at  all costs, even if it is only the West that ends up diversifying.
