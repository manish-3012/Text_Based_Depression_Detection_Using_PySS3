no one will ever love meim 22 and i dont know what it feels like to be loved. yeah i have friends and a family i guess but i still feel lonely. no one wants to listen to me talk about the things i like. ive been called "annoying" all my life and isolated by everyone. everyone my age has fallen in love or knows what its like to have someone fall in love with them, but the only person who has ever told me that they "love" me was my thirty year old stalker when i was fourteen. i feel like i have been ruined. i dont know what the point of continuing on is. the same shit will keep happening and ill die alone.
