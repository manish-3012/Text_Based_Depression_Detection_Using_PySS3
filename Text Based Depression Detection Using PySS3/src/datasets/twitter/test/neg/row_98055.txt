I'm scared of the futureI'm a fuckup. This is irrefutable and truly terrible. But, at least I still have this summer before everything goes to hell again. (16M)

What scares me is the future. I care about the people in my life, I don't want to watch them grow old and then die, or be forced to think about when 'they were young'. I don't want to see any of this. The march of time never stops and I can't keep up. Yeah, I love science and technology, and I want to be a scientist, but that's probably ruined. Don't you love procrastinating by just sitting there and begging yourself to do it and just failing?

Decay scares me, I hate decline. It fills me with horror to think about the fact that one day, my friends and I will no longer be young and be fighting broken bodies. What was once glorious and about to hit its prime will be... out of date. Gone, even. I can't handle that, so what if I just ended it now and escaped having to watch this?

Quite frankly I'm a bitch-ass pussy who can't handle the real world. Everything scares me no matter how much I try to push out of my comfort zone, the zone itself started out so tiny that despite constantly trying to expand it, it's still barely big enough to live in. Hell sometimes it just shrinks for no good reason. That's no way to live, I don't want to be scared of everything. What's the point of living if I'm going to die decrepit, if I could die without having to see the damage and ruin left in the wake of time?

I can't see myself alive past my twenties. Sometimes, I can even imagine thirties, but never forties. I want to kill myself so badly, but I'm trying to figure out how and the least painful way to do it. Fucking up would only be more depressing. I'll never have a second shot like the first, and I don't want to be any less functional than I already am.

I know others can handle loss and decay way better than I can. Is it so bad to try and take myself out of the game before the ending turns ugly?
