I'm going to die because I'm an awful failure who can't improveThis is my first time on reddit, so sorry if I mess things up. I think you're supposed to use a throwaway account for stuff like this??

For reference, I'm 14, nearly turning 15. But I don't want to turn 15, because I'm a bad person.

I've been a failure for a while, and today was the day I failed the most at the one thing I didn't want to fail in.

This year, I have failed everything imaginable. I used to be an A student, yet somehow I'm getting F's now. I've gained a lot of weight and haven't worked out. I moved this year, and today I lost all of my friends.

I have a lot of online friends, but I've removed them all. Today, I made my best friend hate me. They were the only ones who believed in me and were the only ones who were there for me.

Today, we stopped being friends. They were the only ones I ever felt comfortable venting to or being myself around. I wanted to be there for them too in return, since they've been dealing with mental health stuff.They used to vent to me, but then they stopped, A couple of days ago they started venting, so I listened and asked them to keep going, but I pushed them too far and now they hate me.

I thought they blocked me over email, so i started to vent there. I didn't think they could see it, since I thought they blocked me, but they didn't. I talked about how I wished I was still friends with the, how I felt lonely and guilty, and talked a little about wanting to die.

They said they hated me now after I asked them.

I didn't want to fail in being a friend, it was the only thing I didn't want to fail in. And yet I failed. They haete me now.

The only ones left who would care are my family, but that doesn't feel like enough. I don't want to live to 15 anymore. The only thing stopping me is that I'm not sure how to die yet, but I think I can figure it out.

I don't want friends anymore. I'll hurt them too. I don't think I can improve, since if i could have, I would've at this point, I can recognize everything I've been a failure in, yet I have only gotten worse this year.

I can't vent to anyone anymore. I'm completely alone except for my family, who even though they care for me, I can't trust them anymore.

I'm going to die before I turn 15. I'm a failure in every way imagineable now. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this now since I know I can't be helped. I genuinely want to die now. I'm awful.
