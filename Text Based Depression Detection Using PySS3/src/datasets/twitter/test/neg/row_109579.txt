Random thoughts.When I was a child.. a 9th grader.. i was molested.. I was'nt raped but terrible things was done to me.
I was bullied to.. up to highschool.
I was the odd ball at college.. 
I did'nt managed to graduate because .. life happens.
Sometimes there's too much shit going i dont know how to pass through it..
My mother had a cronic illness..
I was .. at the depth of despair for some reason .. there was a lot more I can note here about the things that I dont like with my life but theres no need for that.
I powered through and somehow things get better.
I was'nt totally happy and thats ok. You're not supposed to be happy all the time.
When i said i powered through i didnt mean I suddenly had a will to live.. it's a constant battle with myself.. i had to help myself and i had to accept help from other people. I worked hard to stablish myself ar work.. 

Now I'm living on a girls dormitory. And i dont talk with anyone there. Coz i'm socially alward.
One time this girl collapsed due to fatiuge. We panicked and helped her.. till she was ok. Then after that we became a bit close.
Then.
Last week I was rushed to the hospital  due to hypokalemia. Thats shit is painful and if not treated can be deadly i think.   My flatmates helped me recover and stayed awake and fix my food. I was in so much fear because my body is in pain.. it was a moment that .. made me realize i dont want to just  die.. i realized i want to do something more. 
And I've been also thinking.. what if i killed myself or my flatmate killed herself and we were'nt there for each other.. is'nt it heartbreaking. 


I dont know if this will make sense to you but as what i said this is a random thought coz its 1:35am and i cant fall asleep.. i am working at home tomorrow.
I hope evryone can find strenght in whatever way possible..
