I honestly believe I'm destined to be a loser foreverI really don't have much going for me. I'm 30, still live with my parents, can't make money to save my life, no charisma, extreme social anxiety.

I honestly think I'm fundamentally broken, things seem to "click" for everyone else, even if it takes some time to understand things. Me? No such experience, it's failure after failure after failure. I want out, I don't care anymore.
