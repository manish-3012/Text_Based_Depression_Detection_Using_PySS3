I keep having this fantasyI wake up one day, grab a shotgun, go to work, walk in and just blow my fucking head off in front of everyone.  I don't want to kill anyone, just myself.  And I want them all to see it.  To see what was behind the mask the whole time.  I'm not fucking happy dammit I'm falling apart and it takes everything I have to hold it together at work sometimes.

Realistically there's little to no chance that it would ever happen, I'd probably just kill myself in solitude.  Still fun to think about sometimes.
