Haven't suffered for years but I still get odd moments...So I was severely depressed for years, have tried to and accidentaly almost taken my own life a few times. Been about 2 years since I even had any incling of depression due to giving up drugs, other than being put on ADHD medication and using it correctly, eating healthier, exercising and having something to work towards such as my uni.  


Things seem all well and good, I don't even get "down" moments and yet, I still have the occasional though about killing myself. I can often dismiss it but it is worrying that this even happens, I don't know why, I don't feel sad... not in any way that I can recognise... but I sometimes just think "man, I want to kill myself" not 'die' to actually kill myself.  


It's illogical, it makes no sence at all and it's got no cause that I can find! I don't drink, smoke or do anything any more and as I have said it's been 2 years. So why do I still get these feelings? Is this normal, just in-build reactions or conditions that I've still yet to shake? It seems like it's an idle thought as well, it's not followed by any sadness, depression or anything, more apathetic. Maybe it's just old habits and coping mechanisms left over from those years but I would still like to know others thoughts on this.   


Oh and HELL NO will I speak to my doctor or go back to any psychologist, they always just say "Oh have these SSRI-gunnafuckinggohyperdepressedmate drugs" or other anti-derps, but I hate all of them and they only make me feel worse if nothing else the withdrawl is a bitch and I want to be as drug free as possible. Apparently actual help does not exist where I live, just everyone goes right for the drugs as first-line rather than second or even third.
