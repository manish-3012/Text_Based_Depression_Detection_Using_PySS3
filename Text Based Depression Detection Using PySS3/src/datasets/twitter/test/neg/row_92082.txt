My friend.She's sick and I'm scared. I don't know how to help her anymore and I don't think she wants to help herself. 
I wrote her a song.
I wrote what I'd say at her funeral. 
I'm going to pay for her to get another tattoo (she loves them). 
I want to take her on holiday. 
I want to help more but nothing seems to work and I'm so scared of losing her. 
I've been there too so its not like I don't get it. I've attempted 4 times but I'm getting better now. I don't know how to make her happy. 

I cant lose her. I cant. 

If she goes I don't think I'll last much longer.
