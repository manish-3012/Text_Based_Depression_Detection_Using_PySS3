Feeling helpless, but not suicidalHey guys, this is my first post on here, and sorry if there's a better subreddit for this, but I just really need help.

I'll give you the basics. I'm 17 and when I was 15, I tried to kill myself. I've been in the hospital 2 times for suicide attempts/self-injury. I've gotten a lot better since that year. I haven't cut in a few months and I'm very proud of myself for that. But that isn't my issue tonight.

I've been in this relationship for almost 9 months, and I am so deeply in love with this girl. More than words can describe. She's my everything. I recently found out (almost for certain) that she kissed another guy. I told myself I could just get over it. She tried really hard to convince me it didn't happen, but in the end, her excuses fell short. So almost a month later (tonight actually) I explained to her that it still bothers me. She got EXTREMELY defensive. She said that she was going to leave me and everything. That it's over, just because I bothered to share the way I feel about it with her. She's tried hard to show me otherwise, and I get that, but I just can't get past it. I don't know what to do. I know I'm 17. I know I have my whole life ahead of me. But for 9 months, I haven't been able to picture my future without her. I can't think of living without getting to see her beautiful face everyday. I don't know what to do. I'm not suicidal. Just want everything to be okay.

Sorry if any of this doesn't make sense. I'm a mess currently.
