I don't know how long I can last at this point.I probably killed my liver between meds and alcohol. I'm desperate for any drug that will make this feeling stop. Maybe if I just stop existing they'll all feel better. Love feels like a lie. My body is nothing but scarred and disgusting. I'm not enough for anyone.
