Not sure what to put, so :)So, I've spent a lot of time in this thread, trying to help as many people as I can. I struggle myself, but I still find it so upsetting that so many other people want to end their lives, I truly love all of you. You all deserve true happiness and to be content in your lives, and I hope that one day you all reach that. That you all reach a moment where you realise, "oh fuck, I'm actually happy." And for some that may seem like wishful thinking, I understand that it can seem like there's no light, that there's absolutely no way out of the rut you're in. But hold hope, there's a future for all of us. A future brimming with life, and I hope to see you all there.
Please do not hesitate to reach out if you're struggling, that's what we're all here for.
Sending love and light x
