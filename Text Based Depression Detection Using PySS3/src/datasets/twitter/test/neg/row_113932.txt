is it really that easy to buy a gun in the US?i want to shoot myself in the head. i am a canadian, i did some research it doesn't seem that easy to buy a gun in this country. my plan is to take a little road trip to the US and either bringing the gun back here (would save anyone the hassle of getting my body back to canada) or just do it down there. i do feel bad because my parents are going to be sad. but i can't do it anymore.
