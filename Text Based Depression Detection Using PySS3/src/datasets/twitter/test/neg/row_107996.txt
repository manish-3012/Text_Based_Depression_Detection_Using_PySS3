17M extreme anxiety17M just finished school. Anxiety is ruining me. Constant pain in my chest. keep thinking about shit that wont happen and that I did multiple years ago that I think will haunt me. Been experiencing extreme depersonalization the world just seems so fuzzy and just awkward. I've been exercising dieting taking supplements on medication been to a counciller and yet nothing helps it seems one anxiety is gone another comes in. Idk if I can take it anymore Its making me severely depressed and I'm doing everything right. Why cant my brain just be wired like a normal person's. Save me please
