I'm losing itI've had suicidal thoughts everyday for the past ~7 months. Today was the first day I actually strongly considered hurting myself, or worse. I'm considering not going back to school this coming semester. I look in the mirror and feel hatred. I have so much trouble connecting with people. I feel so alone.
