A message to all of usI been lurking and posting for sometime now. I am able to say this is the only place I was able to talk about how I am feeling. I know how it feels to be brushed aside because of the struggles of something we cannot control, of a sadness so overwhelming that it consumes us on our waking hours and on our sleep. Of the shame we have to carry when we thought that someone is there for us then left us abandoned or feeling betrayed. Of no matter how hard we try is never enough. Someone told me that people like us are in love with our despair. The only thing that came to mind that our despair is the only thing that kept us company when no one else did. As I am writing this I am contemplating slashing my wrists, and with my own blood write on the walls what is truly wrong with me. On how I have been decades of trying, of that I fell in love with someone who will never love me, how useless and dumb I feel must of the time, on how hard is opening up and then to be left alone or be treated like a charity case. I won't judge anyone of their life choices, I am not in your shoes to do that, only here to tell the world how its feels to be one of us. Before I become silent again and become another statistic. Everyone will be on my thoughts. Have a nice day
