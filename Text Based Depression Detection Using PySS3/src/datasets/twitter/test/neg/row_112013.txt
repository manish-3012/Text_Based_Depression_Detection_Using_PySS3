I'm smarter than this.I know this is temporary. I know this isn't me. I know (well sort of) that things will get better. Things aren't even that bad outside of my own head. Why do these thoughts still happen? I can't tell anyone. I couldn't deal with the pain it would cause people who care about me, to know that this is on my mind. And I don't want them to misunderstand. I'm not going to DO anything. I don't think. I don't plan to. So no one needs to know it's this bad. I don't want them to be wondering in the future, to be worrying.
