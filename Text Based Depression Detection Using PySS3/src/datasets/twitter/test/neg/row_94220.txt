How common is it to casually consider suicide?Whenever I disassociate my thoughts automatically stray to fantazies of me killing myself and I have to consciously shake them off. These fantazies have gotten more specific and detailed over time and this scares me.   
I have no particular reason to feel this way apart from maybe school anxiety and I'm not sure how to confront this.   
I feel guilty over it. I shouldn't make light of suicide with my mindless fantasies.
