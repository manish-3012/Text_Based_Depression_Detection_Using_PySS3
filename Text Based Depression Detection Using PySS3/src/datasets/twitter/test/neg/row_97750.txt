I don't know what to sayI think it's time i end it but I don't know what to say before I go. Im tired of feeling emotions of constant dread and hollowness. Constant pressure on my chest feeling like i don't belong or i should not be here. I can't handle it anymore, it's starting to physically hurt me. 

It's a rainy day today...
