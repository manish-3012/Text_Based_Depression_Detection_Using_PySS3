I don't really understand the point of this sub, or any suicide hotline either. I just want to get it over with.I probably need help, i'm not real receptive to it though. I don't know how to ask? I know all the same old supportive bullshit by heart.

I'm fat, i'm tired, everything hurts. Everything I put myself to fails and falls apart in my hands. The few friends I have, i know keep me around to make themselves feel better, or they are forced office friendships.

I'm broke, I'm sorry, I just don't want to wake up again.

I'm so tired of wishing tomorrow will never arrive.

I worry about my cat (she's an elderly 17yo) and I worry about my elderly father. My death would essentially kill them both.

No one else would ever really notice my absence.

I'm just another fat worthless neck beard.

I've called hotlines before, the one time they didn't hang up on me, the police showed up, and I was involuntarily committed. How the fuck that was supposed to help anything, i haven't a clue.

My ideal plan is ending it near a morgue, so i won't be too much of a bother to clean up and haul away.

fuck.
