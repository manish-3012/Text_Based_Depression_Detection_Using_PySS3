I triedOn Sunday, I tied a noose and tried to hang myself.  I'd tied it to a chin-up bar on a doorway.  When I tightened it around my neck, however, the rope was too long and I was able to support my own weight.  I leaned into it but was unable to lose consciousness before my stupid instincts kicked in.  I was trying to reconfigure the rope to be at a better height when I had a knock at the door.  I don't know what made me answer it.  A friend had figured out by my tone over messages that morning that I was struggling and had come around.  I let them in, took down the noose and sobbed.  There were marks on my neck which faded before my partner came home from work so nobody other than my friend knows that I tried.  I don't know what to do.  I feel lost and numb, and now I feel like a failure, too.  I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this because the stigma surrounding attempted suicide and surviving is often worse than when someone's just feeling suicidal.
