I've stopped thinking about killing myself.GUYS! GALS! I AM ALMOST A WEEK FREE OF ANY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS! 

Before everything, happy new year, there's always something awaiting for you to stay alive, love you all.

So, there's this girl who I've been talking since 2019 November. We've been chatting daily since may and, oh boy, she has helped me A FUCKING LOT. Of course I still wanted to die, I had a terrible crisis almost every month when I didn't want to stay alive but... 

She came to my city to celebrate my birthday, that was the 22nd. The last day I still wanted to kill myself was the 24th. SHE STAYED TO DINNER AT CHRISTMAS WITH MY FAMILY! And everything goes... Smooth, my mind is plenty of her, she is making me SO FUCKING HAPPY, but the best of all: She makes me a better person, her existence makes me want to be... Better. Stronger. 

On Monday, the 28th, I became her boyfriend. She left my city that same day. Now, in a long distance relationship, I just think of when are we going to see each other again, to kiss her, to hug her and there's simply no time to think... In killing myself. 

Maybe it is just something that my depression will end using against me, maybe I'm becoming a little codependent but... If I'm alive, it is for her. I'm absolutely in love, I'll absolutely try to be alive... 

For her.
