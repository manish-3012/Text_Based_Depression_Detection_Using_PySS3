Everything I do is wrong. Iâ€™m literally good for nothing.Everyone hates me. People can only stand me for ~4 before I do something that absolutely fucks it up. Iâ€™m always doing the wrong thing. Iâ€™m such a fucking idiot and now Iâ€™m alone. I deserve it. I try to make friends, but everyone thinks Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m a mistake of a human being and thereâ€™s nothing good about me. Iâ€™ve always said Iâ€™d kill myself on my 18th birthday because I know it would only be downhill from there. My birthday is on May 2nd and I canâ€™t wait. For a second I actually thought I was worth something, that I could have a great future. I was just being stupid. All my dreams are unachievable and stupid. I hate who I am.
