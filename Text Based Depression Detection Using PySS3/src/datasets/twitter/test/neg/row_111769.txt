hi.i don't want to hurt my mother. i love her so much. but i don't want to end up like her. she has nothing. i have nothing. there's one person i talk to maybe once a week, maybe once a month, whenever. sometimes he's the reason i decide to stay. but i just hate myself so much right now. i hate how much time i've wasted. i hate how i've ruined my body. every time i look at myself it reminds me of how weak i was and how ugly i feel now. it's my fault. everything is. some nights i can get used to it but tonight i just feel so lonely. i feel disgusting. i don't know what to do anymore.
