Not Good Enough3 different girls have told me I'm not good enough and I can't help but think it's not a coincidence. I texted my last girlfriend 2 days ago hoping we could get back together but it turns out when we broke up i pushed her away by trying to get her to stay. She was the only person that kept me going. She was all I had, and I pushed her away and made her move on. She was my future and without her I have nothing to look forward to. There's nothing motivating me to stay alive and I don't know what to do.
