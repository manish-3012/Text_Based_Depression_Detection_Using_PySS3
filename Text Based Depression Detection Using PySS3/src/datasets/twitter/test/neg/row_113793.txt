I will never dieI will never die you ignorant, insufficient stupids. I will be there, alive, making you suffer. I will never give you the satisfaction to kill myself. You can do whatever you find fit with me but you have to kill me in order to die. You can judge me, you can say whatever. You can prosecute me, you can bellitle me, you can do whatever but unless you kill me I will be there everliving and you will suffer as you must. I will never kill myself. You don't deserve me. If I die you must kill me. If you don't kill me I will be here, alive.
