Everyone probably thinks I'm gay and the fact that I think that probably makes me gayI was ignorant about people of diferent religions/sexual preference/race just because of how I was raised (sheltered and pumped full of bullshit hate).  Since a few months ago (when I found reddit) I consider everyone shit...no desrimination neccessary :).

I'm pretty sure I'm gay and most of my peers know it.  My dad might think so but my mother would never consider it because of her strong beliefs.

The way I see homosexuality is that everyone is a little gay.  I don't believe there is one person out there that has not thought of same sex shit.  Because since I can remember it has crossed my mind, even since I was just young ignorant and innocent.  I don't know about a relationship, though.  I've never had a girlfriend or boyfriend in my life.  I've never been sexually attracted to a man before, but if given the chance where no one else would know about it, hell I would probably bang him lol.

I'm a bit drunk and this feels weird actually writing it down.  I've never said anything like this to anyone EVER (even my therapist of 2 years).

Either way, I am confused as fuck.  I go through enough pain on a daily basis because of my anxieties, deppression, and anger, and horrible social skills.  To top it all off with homosexuality? I would lose all support from my parents who seem to be the only ones that care at the moment.

I've been planning for a while now.  Next month I turn 21 and I will be able to purchase a handgun.  I will shoot myself in the heart just after the sunsets on the Clearwater beach.  I don't think things will ever get better whether I hide my sexual intentions or if I let them out.  Sometimes the intentions are very...very violent.  Sometimes I think that's just from the suppression.  I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't want to be alone.
