44 too much painSo here I am crying again by myself wondering how I ever got here.
Im 44 saw my best friend die at 7 in a boat accident and have felt guilty to be alive ever since. My friend and I fought over the seat he was killed in and because my mother was on the boat she made me give in to my besty even though I was there first. We lived together and were practically brothers both being raised my single mothers. After Donnie died I never felt the same as anyone else, I was and am always trying to figure out if people are lying like the drunk boater that took Donnies life and the lawyers who defended him. I have always been very intelligent and very athletic but never fit in. I use to have friends before I pushed them away.Still cant figure out which ones my wife has or hasn't had sex with. I have 4 kids. I have a wife who hates me and I hate very much.The only reason Im still here is because I have a wonderful beautiful 9 year old baby girl with Crohns disease. My wife and I fight over just about everything including how to raise kids. I am extremely hard working tile and stone contractor who has dedicated his life and body of pain to raising my 4 kids and giving them a good life. I look old and wrinkled from sun and work and my wife look like shes 30. She works as a waitress and has always had it pretty easy. Always making sure her life was easy. I was very successful and one day began to notice my wife working against me in just about every way possible. I dont think it happpened overnight but I stated taking notice that if we were watching my daughter play softball and I happen to say out loud ball, she would say strike. If I said fowl ball, she say fair. Not that big of a deal at first but kind of annoying. Then she starts sitting separate from me at basketball games, starts really working against me.  I have always eaten healthy as a child and tried to pass that on to my kids. Many of our early arguments were over food choices, bed times, lack of discipline ( none ) My wife would literally feed my children candy 3 or more times a day in addition to cookies, ice cream, you name it.
She literally would go to the store and buy the huge bags of candy and give the entire bag of candy to the kids and just say dont eat too many, which means more than like 20.  We ate alot of fried foods and cheese, my wifes family being in the restaurant business. She thought cooking was a thing of the past and candy and fast food and restaurants are all you need. We are pretty active so none of my kids got severely overweight. Despite that I knew that this lack of nutrition would eventually have health consequences. Fast forward. I am working hard, doing the work myself for floors showers and stone fireplaces etc. as a licensed contractor. My wife decides that working weekend at a breakfast place is where its at. I can not get her to get a normal job, thats too hard. I cant get her to stay home and help out with hte business. She needs to have off 3 days a week, during the week, with no kids. Some how my pots are still cold, my house is a mess. Shes busy eating lunch with her parents, hiking, not answering phone, being a B is really important on her days off cuz dhe needs to get out the house and do whatever shes doing out there while shes not answering the phone. My wife lies constantly about anything and everything but Im suppose to believe her when she says she would never cheat on me because she is better than that. Never says cuz I love or gives any substantial proof. 
For some reason anytime she is on facebook and I walk up the computer, she has to scroll like mad, but if I say why, Im wrong, she has snapchat and some friend named DiirtyD so I said who is that. OOOOh thats D---- a friends son, but hes says thats not him. Still no explanation, she deflects the fight to something else. For some reason we stayed together. She is always leaned away from in posture. She literally lights up like a giddy school girl with flirty behavior and completely turns her body to other men and will laugh hysterically at non jokes like and idiot in love with some one. She is completely unaware and denying any wrong doing even though every laugh, twirl of hair, giddy laugh and pointing and openness directly at other men while having a general negative disposition and literally turning her shoulder and head away from me at any social situation we are at whether a soccer game, practice or new years eve party. Now all this is really getting me down so we have been fighting and I have been telling her years what the hell are you gonna do after I finally kill myself. She doesnt give a care, she never has. I work one of the most physically demanding jobs and I do it better and work longer and harder than any one else. I can barely type cuz my thumbs are in so much pain, my back shoulders neck knees, you name it. My wife through the years has done nothing to support me, instead she gripes and complains If I even have a helper. She always says things like " your going to do that job by yourself , right." It was very inconvenient to her days off if she had to fax something to our accountant. or do something other than make a phone call.  They say ignorance is bliss and my wife is living proof. She is happy to be ignorant to anything shes too lazy to do. She is smart enough to remember everyone's names so her ignorance is selective. Im very intelligent and I cant remember names because I have stress tied to recall, cuz I really want to remember your name, then get embarrassed because I cant.
My wife has never offered once to rub my tired back, Now i have been told that I should not expect that so I stopped. But do you think that if you had someone working their ass off to make your life easy maybe just once in her life she might offer to get up in the middle of night when my migraines got soo bad that I would lay in the shower and cover my head with towels and beg for the pain to stop. I have had about 15 really, really bad migraines in my life, 10 of those in a few years time 5 in the last decade since I stopped working 12 to 14 hours on my knees. Not once did she wake up and offer to help, in fact she would lay in bed and tell me to shut up because my moans and groans were waking her and the kids.
I know this skips around alot, but thats just what Im feeling right now. Fast forward, still together, still fighting over everything, more miserable, pretty sure she is fucking my best friend.
Im tryng to catch her but I just dont have the energy. I have the kids on weekends and cook and clean my ass off cuz shes not doing enough, she does do some dishes after bitching, while bithching. She has never tried to make the kids do chores, I tried to put out chore list after chore list with absolutely no support.
So my kids dont do chores or pick up after themselves.So my house is a mess most of the time and I work my ass off constantly at work and home. I had a garden with 20 different veggies. carrots, green beans, squash , corn, zucchini, yellow squash lots of stuff. My kids all ate veggies while young because I made sure to cook for them as much as I could.
 For 3 years , literally 3 years. My wife did not cook a single vegetable from my garden just to work against me and be a B. She enjoys it, she hates cooking, loves her phone and someone out there. Shes nice as pie to anyone and everyone she meets but loves to do things to make me upset. She works really hard to make me very sad, Then starts calling me smiley in front of my 9 year old daughter. Did I mention she has Crohns disease. When we fisrt knew my daughter was sick, without a diagnosis yet, but she was loosing weight, anemic, not growing, fevers and shortness of breath. My wife blamed me for her getting sick, all in front of R. Demanding that I get rid of our beloved chickens and rabbits. I did so willingly not know what was wrong with my child and I am relieved that I dont have to do all the work anymore to take care of the animals, cuz life is really hard now. I use to pretty much live in my back yard to avoid my wifes Bitching tyraids of why did the kids leave their clothes in the bath. She would literally bitch at me for every little thing they did wrong, then bitch at them, and then again at me, but have no rule or enforcement of rules or any consequence other than constant bitching. I hid outside with the chickens, rabbitts, dogs and my garden.
Fast Forward again: Research Crohns disease : No known cause or cure. Much science that dies say people who are genetically pre-disposed to have Crohns can get if 1 You have a poor diet consisting of mostly sugar and carbs. 2 You have a mother that is literally to lazy to research anything or read about anything but she is going to go the doctors and demand the strongest course of anti-biotics they can pre-scribe. And if shes not better right away , demand more. My daughter had a pneumonia at 2 years old and has tree nut allergies, she always needed more healthy food choices and the more I tried to stress that to my wife, the more she would give giant bags of candy. I once asked my mother in law for help on the nutrition aspect and her reply was pizza is a veggie. 
Now knowing that bad diet, anti-biotics and stress is what cause Crohns, The disease is so variant, they cant really prove it but if all the people pretty much have the story, it adds up. Science is just not caught up yet with all the auto immune diseases.
But thas a given, My wife still feeds my daughter candy and frozen yogurt topped with candy, and pizza, and carbs galore. I tried to talk her into changing diet with no results, she does care, she just lazy, and more of a child raising children. I have been trying and trying to get her to watch videos . Read, ( not gonna happen ) so here watch this video, I will leave on the computer for you while Im at work and you have off 3 days a week,mid week. nothing to do, definitely not cooking or cleaning on those days off. So she cant even take the time to watch the videos of other people with Crohns talking about diets, dos and donts, cant get her to watch movies or documentaries about health , diet, disease, Crohns, nothing. Now my daughters Gi doc has wanted to do a scope to check on her bleeding etc. For 4 months my wife avoided making the appointment. I was on her ass a few days a week. She was literally liening to me about dedcutables, we have a $10,000.00 deductable on our insurance, oh yeah, my wife decided on her own, to call my Blue Cross insurance that I pay for through my business and change our deductible from $1,000.00 to 10k to save $120.00 per month. Wasn't coming out her pocket, but of out of her restaurant food supplement budget. In bad times I worked harder for less money and my wife needed to give it to restaurants and frivolous toys for kids, landfill fodder.  Cost us 20k in one year, 10k one child with Crohns, 10k  oldest child was run over by a car while at University. Oh yeah back to the scope, literally lying about everyhting to put off the scope cuz our docs want to put Ry on new meds, but need to prove she needs it with another scope. So meanwhile my wife is taking my daughter to a self proclaimed healer with his light frequency machine. Hes telling her to take Ry off meds so I freak out and call her family to get her in check. Oh yeah we had a little re-lapse cuz my wife was too lazy to go but the probiotics that were working to get her blood tests numbers down. My wifes like oh shes getting better now, she doesnt need her medicine for a week. I wonder who she was doing that week. She had off 3 days that week, but she wasnt home. Oh yeah then theres the time I  went to have sex with my wife but there was this big load of white on her lips when I looked down to enter. Back to the scope. So 4 0r 5 months later than docs and I wanted we finally get scope done. I cried and wanted to vomit, my little girl is now pretty tore up inside in 3 different places. We finally changed diet but thats just because my daughter now can not eat anything without pain. The worst is yet to come, my daughter has a pulmonary manifestation of Crohns, very rare, very dangerous. Still cant get wife to read about that. I really really dont know what  to do. I am not innocent either. I have given her the carbs she loves but at least I would make her drink water at the restaurant and if I went to the bathroom or left the table, that water turned to sprite!I reeally want to go. My body has been in severe pain for many many years. My mind is crying for an end. I just cant leave this little girl with her monster of a mother. Hands hurt bad and my babies home now
