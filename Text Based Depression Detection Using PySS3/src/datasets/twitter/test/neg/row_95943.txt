Really tired of living31 yrs old. After trying my luck working abroad and failing, I've lost all motivation in life. Got depressed. Don't want to apply for any job. Jobless now for two years. Feel like a failure. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to disappoint myself even more by trying and failing. I've lost my spirit. I only pray that by some miracle I'll just wake up one day with the strength and the will to live for any reason at all. Otherwise, I don't think I'll make it another year.
