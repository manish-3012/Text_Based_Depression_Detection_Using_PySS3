I didn't ask to be like thisIm sad all the time, with no motivation to do anything. People say im wasting my life but I don't know how to act differently. I didn't ask to be me, but im here. Im sad and alone without knowing how to act differently. Stop talking as much to my friend's afraid I might say something that they don't want to here. Now im sad and lonely, without care from my parents. Just sitting in my room hoping to wither away one of these days.
