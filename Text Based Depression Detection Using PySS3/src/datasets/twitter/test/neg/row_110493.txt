nothing is righti have weird fetishes and i hate myself for that

i'll never be able to be a rapper or enjoy my life, or to have my own gaming computer, or my car, or to learn how to draw, or to have my own house

i dont want to grow up feeling miserable, but that's what's gonna happen, bc i'm a lazy idiot (cant swear here i guess so im being light) and i dont do anything towards my goals.

in fact the only thing i do is sleep all day and play games

i can't even deal with people since i have social anxiety and whatever

i wanna die

I CAN'T SOLVE ANYTHING IN MY LIFE OR BRAIN

btw i already go to therapy and take meds
