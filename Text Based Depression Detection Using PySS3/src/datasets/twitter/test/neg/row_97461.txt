I wonâ€™t be alive tomorrow morningI already made a post explaining why if anyone wants to see, but I hadnâ€™t made up my mind yet. Now, I have. Tonight I will be making my third and final attempt.

I truly believe I am doing my family, and the world, a favor by getting rid of myself. I wonâ€™t be able to hurt anyone ever again, and I will cause no more pain. I will be in no more pain, either. 

At least I was able to help a few people with this Reddit account, itâ€™s one of the few good things Iâ€™ve ever done. Goodbye.
