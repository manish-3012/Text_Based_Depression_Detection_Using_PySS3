People take one look at me and want nothing to do with me, I struggle to feel welcome in society and on earth in general.Hi there everyone,

I am struggling with thoughts of suicide because an issue that has plagued my early adult life, and has brought me to extreme low points.

It is how my appearance constantly creates bad first impressions and means I cannot get a match on tinder, people often mock me in public and people often feel like they can treat me like shit.

I just want to be able to date, and to be treated with some form of respect. Those things seem pretty far fetched right now...

Take a look at my profile pic. That is a reject on sight type of guy as I am sure you will agree. I dont want to look like that. Any girl reading this would shoot me down on first glimpse.

My appearance truly makes my life difficult. I had an ex girlfriend who was unattractive herself inside and out, but she said she couldn't bring herself to sleep with me due to how bad I look, but she liked me for who I was none the less. Girls often seek me out to reject me, just to make sure I dont hit on them also.

I dont want this to haunt me anymore. I have worked hard to try and change this situation for myself because I deserve it, but even after braces, haircuts, regular haircuts, grooming and engaging heavily in the social life university provides..... I am still perceived as someone who is not datable on first glance.

I dont want to live like this. I am a good person with things to offer the world, but I guess that means nothing to girls when you are a 3/10.
