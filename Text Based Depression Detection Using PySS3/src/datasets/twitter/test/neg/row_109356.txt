Maybe my last post? At the bare minimum, another rant.I can see the bottom creeping up to me faster.  I go to sleep crying, wake up crying about how alone I feel.  My first girlfriend/fiancee I had to break up with, and still cry about.  However it was no different, the first signs of something going wrong, not about her, and she would immediately run away, and that's how I learned about "Stonewalling." and I was left crying alone, but if she had problems, I'd be right there, if I had problems, I was stuck alone staring at 4 walls.  Now I get to stare at 4 walls permanently talking to nobody!  Yay?  I told myself when there's absolutely nothing left, and I hit that rock bottom again, this time will be the end.  Even bought a gun a few years back to be ready (I've been suicidal for just about as long as I can remember, depression sucks but I hid it well).

At least I'm not stuck in my car, there's something good!  No bed, and the carpets are so dirty at spots it makes me want to vomit, but it's better than being cold and cramped.  I tried to clean as best I could with a broom and general cleaner, which is all I could afford.  I'm also pretty sure the person I paid for a months rent is getting evicted before my month is up, so just another roommate ripping me off of 100s of dollars.  It's the normal now, but I'll take what I can get.  At least at this point it's just a really expensive hotel?

I can't remember the last time I physically spoke to someone using my voice, other than through text online.  Probably a few weeks at least.  The friends I did/do have either will not, can not, or do not want to assist.  Some I even told to avoid me for awhile, because I was afraid of losing them too.  The others only came to me when they needed things, and have been quickly blocked (I hate blocking people, but I don't need that right now).

Tried to get help from the only "Family," I "thought," I had, my foster parent's, and I should've known they're are dumb as two rocks, and meaner than a drunken honey badger.  I don't even know what to call them anymore.  Foster parents is too nice.  Caregivers till 16?  They love to yell and scream and get angry at everything.  I quickly realized they're the ones that started all of this when I was young.  Why would I think they'd be the ones to help me now?

As usual, my male parental figure just threw money at me (He's not rich, 100$, I didn't even look at it?) complaining about it the whole time.  The female parental figure, just ran away as usual, and let him threaten and swing fists at me.  I threw his money back at him and told him I never wanted his fucking money and frankly didn't need it.  What I did need, was a Father and mother and not to waste more money than that same amount you threw at me going to visit you!  Only to get yelled at for being depressed?  Thanks, Boomer asshole, for not understanding costs!  I tried to just call you, but no you couldn't make time for me to just chat on the phone you told me to come to you, and I was dumb enough to believe it would be any different.  Just like when I was 10 and you couldn't make time to drive me 10 miles down the road in a rural town to rent a movie.  You had to go to the bar first, get smashed, then swerve all over the road with your 10 year old kid you adopted (and "supposedly" cared for) in the back scared shit less as we almost drive off a cliff.

I really am alone, I wish I could drink alcohol (I'm too sick, and get violently ill off a single drink), I'd be broke but at least I'd have someone to talk to.  It might even make suicide unnecessary, given how sick I am.  Not sure but this is America, can't go to the doctor without insurance!

I wish there was a way to make myself just sick enough that doctor's would take me seriously and actually run tests, instead of taking my money and telling me to come back in a week.  Bitch I waited 4 months to come here because I'm broke, and insurance doesn't pay for anything.  You don't think I take going to the doctor lightly and your just going to tell me to come back in a week?  Then give me my money back and I'll pay you in a week when you do your job!

Anyways, just another rant I'll probably delete later, if not I guess I'll finally be at peace and we can add this post to the "Last post of a Reddit user," list.
