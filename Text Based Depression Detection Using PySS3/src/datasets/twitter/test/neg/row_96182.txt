Yeah mom, I'm fine.No, you don't need to stay in my room. You're tired. That's fine.

"That's fine" is all I've ever told anyone.

It's fine that you're too busy for me.

It's fine that you didn't have time to hang out. It's cool. Don't worry about it.

No dad, you don't have to visit. It's fine. I'll see you next year. 

It's fine.

Guess what: it's not fucking fine. 

And neither am I.

Fuck.
