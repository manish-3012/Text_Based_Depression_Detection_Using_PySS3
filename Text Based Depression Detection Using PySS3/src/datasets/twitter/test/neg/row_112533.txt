Why do i feel like this?So last night i was making a video and i have a bunk bed and fan and i was using shoe laces to hold my arms up *pretending to be a puppet*
And i feel like it might be a temporary thing but I've just been thinking about suicide alot? What would happen? What if i have a break down and kms when i wasnt thinking straight? 
A voice in my head is telling me to do it even though im not sad or anything?? and I'm stressing out about it, it makes me want to break down and hug someone..
I'm not sure if this is an ocd thing because i convinsed myself i was a murderer for a few days once and it turned out to be an ocd related thing and I've gotten over it now.. Can someone help or tell me what to do? Will it last long ? I don't want to be thinking about this. 
I might just be overthinking it like last time.

thanks, guys.
