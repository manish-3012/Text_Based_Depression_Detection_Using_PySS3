I need to have my fiance's mother involuntary committed if she doesn't agree to get help.This is an Arizona and I need help.

She drove off a canyon yesterday and survived. 800ft fall and is still here with minor injuries. She needs help. Our family agrees and would love to know how to proceed. Thanks
