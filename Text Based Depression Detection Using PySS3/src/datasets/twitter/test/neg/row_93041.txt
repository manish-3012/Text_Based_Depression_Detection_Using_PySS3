Rex, my son but dog formOnly thing keeping me from doing it, is my dog. I have family who would love to take him. They always watch him if I leave town and donâ€™t want him to be alone.

They donâ€™t have a home though. Currently brother and grandma are living in a one bedroom camper with 2 dogs (one is small but one is huge) and two cats. It wouldnâ€™t be fair to Bandit (large dog) to share the already small camper with my medium sized dog.

I got my dog from a shelter. I canâ€™t let him go back to one. Heâ€™s also extremely scared of strangers and lunges at them to get space.

If I kill myself who knows what would happen to him. (I just turned 20F) I would do it if I knew my family could handle it. I know they canâ€™t. I see a therapist but things just keep adding on, adding on, and adding on. Itâ€™s so hard to take care of Rex and also my mental health. He wants love and is so clingy when I want left alone.

I want to go to my kitchen and get a knife. I want to swallow pills. However how would Rex get fed until they found my body? Rex would be sad. Heâ€™d miss me (I hope) I canâ€™t do that to him. Heâ€™s always there when Im sad. If Im dead I cant be there for him when heâ€™s sad. I wish I could find something to do for him so I can just.. be gone. Yaknow?
