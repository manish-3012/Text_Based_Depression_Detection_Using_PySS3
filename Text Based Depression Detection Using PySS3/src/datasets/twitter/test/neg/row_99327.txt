I'm tiredI'm so exhausted and fed-up with everything. I have so much to say, but I can't put it into words. I just wanted someone to care about me, but looking back, I realize that's a huge burden to put on someone, and I'm just not worth it. There's nothing left for me to do. Nothing distracts me anymore, and everything reminds me of things I don't have, but desperately want. I can't keep living like I've been, I don't want to anymore. I'm just confused, everything besides killing myself seems so uncertain.
