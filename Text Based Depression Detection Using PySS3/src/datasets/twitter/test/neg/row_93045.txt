Im scared but its what I must doOn an alternate account now. I have been contemplating weather or not I want to kill myself for the past few days now. The only thing stopping me is one event in my life that I have yet to make sense of. For starters I am gay and that is how I was born despite people trying to convince me it is a choice. 

I have had people turn there back on me my entire life. Somehow I still managed to develop a thick skin. I am a young adult now and thought I was doing okay. I remember when I was visiting a family members house with me and my other siblings. I remember when my relative came to greet us she hugged all of us one by one and when she got to me she made a look of disgust and refused to touch me or even acknowledge that I existed. 

I was only 12 years old at the time but i knew why she wouldn't she knew i was the gay one the tainted one the sin. She wouldn't let the other kids play with me out of fear that I would "contaminate them". Funny i still feel the pain of that moment today. I was always treated as the outcast of the family. 

My dad hates gays and think we should all die as does most of my family. With my step dad being a drug abuser I was forced to change schools every other year I never really got use to one location. 

Some times when money was needed I would do things that no 11 year old child should have to do. I got used to being tough on the inside and I learned the world was not sunshine and rainbows. Being gay life was a cold uncaring bitch i tried my best to be strong through it all I really did. Then one day when I was 15 for the first time I decided I would try and kill myself but before I did I will never forget this. It was 4:00 at night and I was thinking of how hard being gay made my life I was praying and told god that I hated him and wished he would die. I was angry at him for creating a book that taught he world to hate me and his existence. 

As a kid I was told to never curse god so I cursed him 1000 times in my head and said if he was real I would kill him myself I felt he turned his back on me. Nobody gave a damn about what I was going through and what was happening all because I was gay. I had a knife with me and wanted so bad to kill myself. I begged god to please show me that he cared and that he could help me since nobody else would. I pleaded with him from the very bottom of my heart to just show me somehow that he was real and that he understood how hard this was for me. Then a miracle happened exactly 1 hour later it was 5:00 in the morning and the doorbell rang. Coincidentally I was the only one in the family who was up and went to answer the door.

Two nuns were standing at the door dressed in all black with the white things over there head I was in complete and utter shock and absolutley could not believe this. I opened the door to greet them and it was strange one of the nuns had a clipboard in her hand and she reached her hand out to me and said would you like to join our church. I was so scared that I said no thank you and slammed the door went inside and peeked behind the blinds until they walked off out of view.

ME and my family lived in the middle of nowhere at the time I could see the entire parking lot where did these women come from and why at 5:00 in the morning when nobody had EVER in my entire lifetime come to the house to tr and get us to join a church. It scared me it was to coincidental which to me means somebody obviously heard my prayers I didnt join though because I am gay. I have no business in a church it wold make no sense for me to be there is what I thought.

I went through a lot more during that time and eventually was raped and became a broken lost person on the inside. So I tried to do what I did before I prayed to god again and asked him to show me he was real like he did before this time no nuns came to my house i tried praying but nothing happened. I felt like because i didnt go back when i was 15 god would not do that for me twice. I alwys felt lost and isolated from the world I always expect the worse so that when things go bad I can minimize the hurt. People say those who commit suicide are weak they dont know shit I am very strong. I didnt give up when I was homeless I almost gave up after being molested and told it was my faullt but I didnt. I didnt give up when family shunned me but im tired of the struggle. I feel like a mishapen puzzle piece and no matter what I do i will never be happy. The way i was born has confined me to a life of sadness. I hate everything I will never recieve real love i will never truly belong to a community and I will never be able to feel normal. No amount of self help speeches and medications can help that. I hurt so much on the inside from so many things. 

I dont know why god would curse me with such a life. Im just so lost and confused. I donw want to believe somebody could exist who would create a book teaching the world to hate and abuse me. However those two nuns coming to my house within an hour of me pouring my heart out all those years ago with absolutely no transportation because I could see the parking lot lets me know somehow something heard me. I am not crazy that truly happened I know that event is important what are the chances of that? 

But I really dont want to go on anymore some people will judge me as a loser or say im weak but they dont know shit they will never know and understand all that I have endured. They will pass judgement without so much as a second thought but I know I have been through alot. I know my mind will never be able to take the endless heartbreak and disappointment ahead.Nobody will ever understand I have been looking up the most painless way to die and I really want to because I know the pain will stop. I know I will be at piece. I just always wonder about those random two nuns who came to my house who looked me up and down when I opened the door almost like they were robots and gave me a chance to join there church.

I dont regret saying no though why would I want to be a part of something teaching the world that im nothing and deserving of nothing but death and the contempt of other people.

Do you know what its like to have people cheer for you and then give up on you and turn their back in disgust when they learn you are gay? Do you know what its like to be outcasted and shunned by your family. Do you know what its like to be raped as punishment for being gay. I survived it all and never complained because I thought to be upset made me weak I never gave up through all that shit so fuck anybody who says I am weak. I am just tired of shouldering the hurt and the pain I do not want to do it anymore and I should not be forced to. With that said I met somebody who came into my life recently I could tell they had good intentions for me. It feels good to meet somebody who encourages you and tries to help you after a life of bullshit. However there was nothing h could do to help and I know he tried but I will forever remain a soulless lost misshapen puzzle piece. I will never be able to find happiness no matter what I do. I am really tired and I just want to feel better I am tired of waking up everyday jus to endure. Life is about more than enduring it is about being happy as well. However all I have ever done is endure and thats all I would ever be able to do I will never be able to happy ever again. And so rather than wake up just to be sad I just want to sleep. 

The world is a nice place to be a part of when it is something that was designed for you. The world was not designed for somebody like me I have had many people tell me im not shit and will never be anything. I evern had a family member tell me I should kill myself and I know when I do it will bring a smile to their face because it would prove everything they said about me to be true. the only reason I chose to live is to deny them that satisfaction but that is not something to live for. Im really really tired and I feel no shame in deciding to rest early. People can judge me and say whatever they want it is my decision and pretty words and telling me im worth it will never fix me or my problems. I am not a victim though I dont need anybody to pity or cry for me I just deserve for my pain to end and I have a right to deal with it how I choose. Thank you so much to the people who came into my life to try and help. What I want those people to know is that nothing they could have ever done could have made a difference this always would have been the end result and it is ok it really is. I know ill feel better when its finally over.
