Gatherings? Now?I have lived alone and seen no one for 6 months  and cannot stand reading posts of complaints about people living with 3-4 house members, bored out of their skull and advocating agressively for the permission to meet up with family for 4 days.

Have they any real experience of what true loneliness is when you speak to or see no one for months due to government restrictions, social anxiety, severe dostress/depression, suicidal urges 24/7... and have no desire to see any of your high risk and high risk taking friends and family?!!!??? None of whom have even given a shit to reach out to you?

I havenâ€™t see anyone for months. I want to die because Iâ€™m unable to socially interact and hearing people complain about the lack of interaction gives me zero reason to live and a strong urge to kill myself.
