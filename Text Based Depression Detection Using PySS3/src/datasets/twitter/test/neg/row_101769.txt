I'm a hypocriteI post on here about my own suicidal ideation but I also comment on as many posts as I can trying to talk to people and see what they're going through. I guess part me hopes theres a chance that if it helps someone else itll help me, but I dont think I'm helping anyone. I'm sorry to anyone I've made feel worse or if I felt patronizing or hypocritical.
