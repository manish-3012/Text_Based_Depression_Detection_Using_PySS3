I think I'm readyI think I'm finally ready, It feels stupid but all I can imagine is slipping away and just not being here anymore. 

Everything ending, it's fascinating.  I attempted a couple of months ago and I failed (obviously). 
I've calculated where I went wrong and I am 100% sure I'm prepared. 

I don't want it to be like this, I don't want to feel like this is the only way. But it is the only way, what's the point in anything anyway.
