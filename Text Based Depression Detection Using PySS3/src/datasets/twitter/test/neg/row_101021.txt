Can anyone relate to the grief stage of traumaMy life is fucked up. I'm 17 in foster care, been in the psych ward two times whilst going through my trauma not knowing what the fuck was wrong with me. I didn't even know I had trauma. I was numb for years and my mum put me in care when she couldn't cope with my emotions in December. The realisation didn't hit until June and I was more manic like and confident with 'how mature i've become from what i've struggled with' type of thing. I was really just pushing away the grief but the more the realisation has sunk in the more depressed I am. I'm fully into the grieving stage at the moment after 4 years of numb. I can't keep going. I'm broken, i'm a broken person and I don't have the strength to fight anymore
