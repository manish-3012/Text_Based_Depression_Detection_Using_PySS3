Hello.This is my first post on reddit. I donâ€™t know if anyone will ever comment but I just want to vent. I was raised in an emotionally and mentally abusive house hold and feel that I struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. I go to college and I am entering my sophomore year. In high school I fucked off and did drugs and in general I stopped caring about life. I wanted to turn a new leaf but it is getting harder and harder everyday. itâ€™s hard to vent to my mom and I donâ€™t want to worry her with my issues and I fear that she will feel differently about me if I tell her my about what I am going through and wouldnâ€™t really think anything of it. I donâ€™t have friends to talk too and I feel like my father still treats me like a child and generally will fail to understand because he is a narcissist. And my brother has his own issues and we donâ€™t talk much anyway.  There is many sources of stress in my life such as my unbringing, over thinking the future, school and numerous â€œfamilyâ€ issues although itâ€™s hard to think what I have is a family at all. I am 19 and sometimes I just think theyâ€™d all be better off without me and I felt this way at a very young age. I feel alone, worthless and feel I will never be happy or become someone. Iâ€™ve been thinking about going to therapy without telling anyone or just going somewhere without telling anyone and being by myself for a couple of days. I donâ€™t have much energy or will to live left and I donâ€™t know what to do. I just know that I donâ€™t want to be on this earth anymore. Iâ€™m tired of the stress and pain.
