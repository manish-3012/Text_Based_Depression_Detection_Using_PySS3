Releasing my raps before I goI think it is time.
I am releasing my raps here and then I am checking out.

My name is Kit.
I'm a female.
Old as fuck at 27 years old.
I have no talent.
That's enough context you need about me.
Tissues For My Issues:
&gt;I get scared all the time
Left to cope by smoking some dime
Suicide on my mind like the guy from Sublime

Itâ€™s hard on me
Itâ€™s hard on you
Only wanted comfort
Instead plagued by review

Troubled from the start gate
Dad slammed my head lost-a-couple Qâ€™s 
Product of apeâ€™s irate 
DFCS had no motherfucking clue
Concussion, wonder whatâ€™s left to function
Told to sleep it off like Dad on consumption	

Itâ€™s hard on me
Itâ€™s hard on you
I was all ears
Time for my P.O.view

Grounded for seeking help
Stamp blue paw on my bruise
Look, DFCS! (A CLUE, A CLUE!)
A fictional dog has a better excuse to why they left me in abuse

Itâ€™s hard on me
Itâ€™s hard on you
Not enough tissues for my issues

Edge lord need not apply
Shit coping, Schadenfreude
Not so fly
Get that shit out of my face before your thesis I debase
the
Wanna-be-Kaufmansâ€™ keep trying to fuck with otherâ€™s often
Paralyzed still try hard to distil real feel
Good burn bro my skin-gonna-peel
Late to the game is better
Than never
Dishing Kitâ€™s new niche
Like wonder twins (activate)
In form of endeavor
Fugue so bad canâ€™t stop once going

Founder of lifeâ€™s glitch
Broken walls debt I am owing
Cause Iâ€™m the juggernaut bitch

And because I wasn't happy with how basic is came out I started to fix it with:
&gt; Troubling, scared I grew idle
struggling to cop a cope 
without a therapist
flared feelings left me on 
suicidal precipice

&gt; Girl was abused
 suicidal fuse lit
with her age only ten
didn't engage back then

&gt; From a child who is agoraphobic to 
Angora poetâ€™s anaerobic exercise
Chastised by societyâ€™s lack of eyes
