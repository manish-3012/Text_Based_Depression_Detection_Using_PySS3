Why are we still here? Just to suffer?I'm 24 year old female from Europe (Felt like that needed to be said, don't know why)
For over 7 years, I've had depression. I also have anxiety and social anxiety.
I'm also introvert and spend a lot of time alone but geez that eats me alive at times because my mind doesn't shut up.
Yesterday I was also blocked by a person who I love and who loved me, at least that's what she told me. I'm left with thoughts "What did I do wrong? Did she lie about everything?" Etc. questions and replying what we talked about in my head and it's driving me crazy. I know I'm not perfect and often times I'm difficult but this makes me feel like, I'll never be enough for anyone to stay in my life. I just push everyone away because of my problems.
Lately I've been thinking about life a lot, how we were born to do this and that. How nothing makes me happy and how everyday feels the same. Waking up to this miserable world, trying to distract yourself and then trying to get some sleep and doing the same thing all over.
I wish there was a pill to swallow and your life would be over. I've never enjoyed living, it feels like a huge task and being forced to. 
I've been thinking of jumping off a bridge, because I don't have motivation to make it less shittier. I'm super lost and feel worthless. The only thing what keeps me from killing myself if my mother, I don't want to cause her pain.
