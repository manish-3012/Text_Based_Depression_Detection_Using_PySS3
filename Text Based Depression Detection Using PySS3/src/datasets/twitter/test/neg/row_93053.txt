Hard NightIt's always harder at night and yet tonight seems to be the hardest. The thoughts of killing myself are stronger than ever. I've even googled which pills to take. The bottle of Tylenol under my bed is calling my name. 

Or maybe I'll just cut my hand again with the kitchen knife. Trying to resist is almost the hardest part. Feeling desperate and alone. I could really use some words of wisdom right now.
