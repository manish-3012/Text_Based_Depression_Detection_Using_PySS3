Very worried I will myself in the next few days. Stuck between a rock and a hard place and more and more I see suicide as the only way out.I'd rather not bother with details of what brought me here. If you're really that curious you can dig through my post history.

The only thing you need to know is that all things that people told me would get better with time have not. Months have passed. Tempers have not cooled. Friendships have not been rekindled.

I am not as sad as I used to be. Instead I am completely numb to everything in it. Just disconnected from the world.

I go to parties with attractive women and I feel nothing. I don't even feel like flirting. My goals have crumbled. I have no energy or desire to return to my job or to volunteering. I was lucky to find such rewarding work that allowed me to help people in need. Soon I will be let go from both positions permanently. I think that doesn't really bother me because I see myself as being dead anyway.

I trust nobody. I've hinted at the few remaining people that talk to me that I might commit suicide soon, but I don't come out and say it explicitly. I don't think they are really interested in helping me get through this. I don't think they can really help resolve all this interpersonal bullshit. I don't even think I'd want to live even if all this interpersonal bullshit is resolved, because I'm smart enough to know things will never be the same again between anybody. Ever.

And I'd rather be dead than be constantly reminded for years of how I've fucked up every good opportunity I've ever had.

I'm just so fucking through with living.
