What to Say... Where to Start...I'm new to posting.  I'm not entirely certain what all I should share - I could ramble on about all that comes to mind, but I don't want to waste too much of your time...  Ah well, it's going to happen anyways, I'm sure.  Forgive the novel that will surely follow...

Mind you, if you want anymore details, do ask.  

Let's start with my general life, and whatnot.  I'm a relatively shy girl, keeping to myself and my classmates, and avoiding most contact with anyone who doesn't come up to me first.  I've grown up in a Christian household, was never purposefully sheltered, and have gone to the same small, private Christian school since Kindergarten - and I should be graduating from it this 2012.  I've never experienced much bullying of any sort, and even now the guys in my class don't pick on me because I don't appear bothered by their taunts.  -Fact is, I laugh at their sexist jokes, and even make my own.  I'm a tolerant person.  So, my years were relatively peaceful.  It's hard to recall, but I believe my self esteem was moderately good - I didn't think highly of myself, mayhaps, but I also didn't think negatively.  However...

Come 10th grade, there was this new fellow in my class, joined the year before.  He was terribly pessimistic and unhappy...  He wanted to rid of his parents and siblings, held no love or care for them, wallowed in his sorrow...  He wasn't completely dark, he had a few happy moments, but the joy he had was undoubtedly short lived when he did have it.  Foolish me - I ended up crushing on him.  (Not because of his pessimism, though.)

This is the start of my first self-diagnosed depression.

My theory is simple - I liked him, he was unhappy, I ended up unhappy because I hung around him.  My self-esteem collapsed - I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm nothing more than a shadow and stepping-stone for my friends, I'm not going to make it anywhere in life.  Every negative thought I had, I linked it to myself.  I sobbed over how no guy ever crushed on me, how even the guys in my class ignored me, how I felt unimportant and unloved...  And the one friend I confided in (solely over the internet about it, however; I hadn't the courage to say anything face-to-face or over the phone) ended up asking me to stop talking to her about it, because it hurt her.  Oh, that didn't help...

For the next year, this sorrow became so bittersweet.  If I was ever happy, it was short-lived, while this despair and pain became my new joy.  I clung to it - it was all I understood anymore, all I was familiar with.  So with the pain came my joy.  I tore at myself, cried until I felt sick, begged God to help...  There was no release.  At this time, suicide was nothing more than a thought; I never considered it, it was simply a subject of pondering.

Well, come summer vacation, I slowly recovered.  I had to MAKE myself let go of the depression since, as I've said, I came to cling to it.  But I understood that there was such a thing as happiness without the pain, and I, though alone now in my battle, overcame.  I no longer had the stress of school.  I cut myself off from the real world and was glued to the computer.  I made a few online friends, and continue to talk to them today.  They didn't at first know about the event, but they helped without knowing; simply talking, and having fun...

I got better.  
For a while, anyhow...

Two weeks ago, I felt a bit sad.  I supposed it was just going to be a normal, temporary sadness - everyone has those days.  But it soon occurred to me that it was lasting longer, and the feelings...  The feelings were all too familiar...  I was weak that day, I suppose.  I started to think of the future again, and get a bit stressed over school - It's hard to stay focused when you just want out.

Nonetheless, so comes the second depression.

I've felt more hopeless now than ever.  I don't see a future for myself...  I'm suffering again (though it's less addictive now than the past, it's still no easier to get out of).  I'm considering suicide now, not just pondering over it...  Though, even I admit that acting upon it is still probably a good bit of time away.  The consideration remains...

The future is terrifying; I don't know what to expect from it.  It's not necessary to know how to survive the world when you're in school...  There's no classes or tests for that.  All you need is to memorize and repeat whatever the teacher says, and the things that are necessary to pass and graduate.  You don't need worldly smarts.

Then again, most people are smart enough to figure it out, anyways.  I haven't such luxury...  I am an idiot, after all.

How am I to survive in a world I know so little about?  I don't have my permit yet to drive - my own fault there.  I haven't had a job before, though I realize I should get one about now - but a lot of good, supportive jobs also require you to be a college graduate.  College is a new place, filled with strangers; If I go, I'll likely have no friend to ease me into it, and I quite dislike the idea of humiliating myself in front of everyone with my idiocy.  Considering I know so little, I'm bound to embarrass myself.  A place to live?  I'm a bit eager to get out of my parent's house, the freedom sounds pleasant, but...  That requires money.  Which requires a job.  

The world is terrifying when you feel so confused, unable, and lost.

My struggle to understand others' feelings...  I'm not completely oblivious - I can feel things towards others, and I can sort of understand what others feel (which isn't the same as predicting how they're feeling, mind you).  But when it comes to others' feelings towards MYSELF...  I don't get it.  Why do they care?  How am I not annoying?  Why do they want to be my friend?  What's so fun about ME?

I lack the understanding.  I feel unloved, uncared for.  I feel alone.  This is probably what hurts the most...  I'm always so lonely.  I want to feel that love...  But it's so hard to feel...

People say they view themselves doing certain things in the future.  I can't picture myself ANYWHERE.  This thought is frightening - what if it's foreshadowing?  What if it means I die young?  In one sense, the pain is over...  But I'm still not entirely prepared for it.  I'm not completely ready for death...

I opened up to two (online) friends about my feelings some days ago.  Eventually, one created a video.  I heard the sadness in his voice, I saw his body language...  It suddenly occurred to me that they truly did care about me.  And it hurt to realize that I was hurting them with my stupid consideration...  No, I didn't -fully- understand the feeling towards myself, but it was a start.

I can say that, thanks to that, I've considered it much less.  I do love my friends...  But I'm still so lost, so confused, so alone...  I still just want it all to be over...

I want to get better for the sake of friends.
I guess this is the best reason...

--

Don't hand out ignorant, "It'll get better" comments.  Those don't help very much.  In fact, I guess most hopeful comments are simply repulsive...  So what's the point of my being here?  What help could anyone possibly offer...

I'm sorry about my novel.  I'm sorry if I wasted time.  I'm sorry for my idiotic thoughts.  I'm sorry for... apologizing.  

I guess I'm still hopeful that I'll still run into something that shocks me back to being sane.  But I also guess text isn't the best way to do this...  Words can be so cold, unfeeling, and unconnective.  I guess maybe I really should talk to someone - hear someone, see someone...  I guess that's what helped the most with that video...

*sigh*  I'll shut up now.  I'm starting to ramble, and I've typed plenty...  Not even sure anyone will respond...  I hope it was at least entertaining to read this, if none else comes of it.  I hope it was all relevant and helpful...  

...and so begins my paranoid worrying...
(I get nervous and frightened I'm a bother)

Be honest.  If nothing else, I demand you be honest.

Adieu for now -
but I will return.
