I think I finally need to kill myself...and nowI've posted on here a few times before but I think my time is finally up. Which is a shame because I've been getting better lately...but today made me realize that I really do need to die.

Since going off my meds 2 months ago or so, I've felt worlds better. Very little suicidal ideation. And when it did occur, it wouldn't be there for very long. I've even tried to tell my therapist that I don't think I need group therapy any longer, even though she is right in thinking that I need more support than her once a week.

Even on a day like today where I have every reason to feel positive...it just goes to complete shit. I haven't even felt suicidal in the past 2 weeks but of course today I do on the eve of another fucking holiday I can't stand.

I already know this isn't temporary. Suicidal ideation has become a regular part of my life. And I already know that there isn't going to be a road to recovery.

I'd like to think I can make it to Tuesday when I have therapy but I'm not even sure of that anymore. Just here crying and wanting to be dead in the next few hours
