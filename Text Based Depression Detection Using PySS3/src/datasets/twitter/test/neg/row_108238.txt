Inside the Mind of My RapistWhen I was 10 I was raped by my dad who adopted me. I was only there for a little while before it happened, so obviously I shouldnâ€™t have gotten too attached, but of course that wasnâ€™t the case. Iâ€™ve been to other families before, but I was always in the foster care system with my disabled twin brother, never actually adopted, he was the only one. I hate to say this, but I was always jealous of how much attention my brother got. It seemed I was always outcasted from the family, while they payed attention to him. But of course they needed to pay more attention to him, he needed it. When I was finally adopted by my rapist he always gave me more attention than my brother, I felt so happy that I finally was recognized somewhere. Although, Iâ€™m never allowed to be happy, the only reason why he would ever pay more attention to me was because he was attracted to me, why would there be any other reason. I sometimes want to know what was going on in his mind when he chose me. So many other children were out there to adopt, why me? Why did he have to come in and ruin whatever was left of my life? I want to cut all my skin off and shave my hair because I feel like itâ€™s all infected by his touch. Iâ€™m so tired of trying not to sleep because whenever I wake up I still see him on top of me. For some reason I still canâ€™t stop loving him. I should hate him, but I donâ€™t. I miss him. Now Iâ€™m stuck back in foster care with parents who once again payed more attention to my brother, until he died a few months ago. Now I live with the guilt of never truly forgiving my brother when there was no real reason for him to be at fault and living with the fact that I want to go back to my old dad, my rapist. I feel as if this life has already failed me so much that I need to start over. I donâ€™t think I can ever heal when I just keep getting injured by life over and over again.
