Anxiety is basically ruining my lifeIâ€™m having a hard time functioning with my anxiety. I feel like Iâ€™ll never get better and I just want to not be alive. The horrible things that are filling my newsfeed are on repeat in my head, Iâ€™m always hyper aware of when Iâ€™m alone and my friends are out doing things, and I am fully convinced Iâ€™ll never date. I have a hard time articulating exactly whats wrong, but its gotten to a point where I donâ€™t care about how people would be affected I just dont want to be here anymore. I dont remember what its like to be happy.
