Can't sleep, suicidal thoughts too strongFirst things first, I'm a male to female trans individual.  

Was recently turned down for a job.  I work at walmart as an asset protection associate and I was contacted by my boss's, boss's, boss (a regional ap manager) about putting in for a management position that he knew I had desperately wanted in a store that was close to home for me.  I had an interview that I had prepared for, practiced and thought I'd nailed, but alas it was not meant to be.  

I've been stuck working in stores that have been nothing but abusive to me for the last two years.  I usually don't report the inappropriate things associates have done or said to me, because I never want to be that person, but I have done it a couple times.  The times I've done it, nothing was done about it, so I'd given up reporting them.  

When the interviewer (who was not the person that asked I applied), a Market ap Manager, was going over things I could have done better, he said one thing to me that I have not been able to shake off that has really affected me.   He told me,  "Six months ago, i never would have expected to interview someone like you.  Times are changing."  

Times are changing, but not to me.  They are exactly as they've ever been.  This is like the twentieth time I've been turned down for a job that was suitable to my experience and education.  I have a bachelor's degree and have only had two jobs in the last 15 years.   By all means, I feel like I am an ideal candidate for !@#$ing walmart management.  

I don't see the point of it anymore.   I've been depressed my whole freakin' life and I don't know how much more I can take.  I feel like my whole life has been wasted all because I wanted to be true to myself.
