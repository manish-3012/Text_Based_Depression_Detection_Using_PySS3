I'm uglyA few days ago I heard about the website of "photofiller". If you haven't heard of it the premise is you upload pics of yourself and other people will rate them for based on categories like attractive, smart, trustworthy, etc. I decided to upload some pics of mine to see where I really stand. It din't go so good...

I had worries about that I may be ugly considering I never did well on tinder and okcupid but cementing it just really... Of all the things in my life this is the straw that broke the camels back. I'm done, I'm done going to the gym, I'm done dressing as nice as I can, I'm done going to class, I'm done going to work, just fuck it all I want out 

I didn't ask to be born ugly and to have never had a girlfriend or even be kissed, I want off this ride and I'm gonna kill myself
