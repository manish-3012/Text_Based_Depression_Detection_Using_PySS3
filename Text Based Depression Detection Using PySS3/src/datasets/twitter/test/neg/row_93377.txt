Uncomfortable? Iâ€™ll just die laterAm I the only one who has this weird coping mechanism where like... if something upsetting or uncomfortable happens, like if someoneâ€™s yelling at me or calling me things or even something as little as small awkward situations... my way of dealing is just repeating over and over in my head â€œitâ€™s cool, I could just kill myself later on and not worry about this anymoreâ€ or â€œIâ€™ll be dead tonight so I donâ€™t even have to waste my energy feeling upset about this.â€ 
Obviously Iâ€™ve never killed myself after one of these times, and unless it was a severe enough situation, I donâ€™t think I would. Just knowing I can end it all is comforting and expecting it to happen makes the moment feel less intense.
Anyone else do this too?
