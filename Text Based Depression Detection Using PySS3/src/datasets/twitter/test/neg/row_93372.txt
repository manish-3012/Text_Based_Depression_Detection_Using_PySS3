Porn ruined my life and i would love to end it.Hey guys, first of all excuse my weak english, iâ€™ve been a straight guy all my life and have never been interested in any gay stuff with all my respect to my gay broâ€™s out there,, since i started watching porn when i was 18-19 i started to get into Transexuals/ladyboys porno videos and im in my late twenties now,Yesterday for the first time in my fucking life i went to a massage parlor and fooled around with a â€œladyboy- â€œtransâ€we didnâ€™t have sex but we made out and kissed and our genitals kinda touched for a second by mistake while we were kissing so i also mightâ€™ve contracted a skin to skin std.. and then the trans wanted to have sex with me but i didnâ€™t allow it me, i didnâ€™t like any of it,i realized that im brain washed by porn i didnâ€™t like the trans thingy.. it was just stupid fantasies and now im back to my place with crazy anxiety about stdâ€™s and crazy depression and i keep having suicide thoughts,im now officially a fagot created by porn and i would be ashamed to ever date a girl after what happened now, also my mom has been always wanting me get married and see my children  and become a grandma and i also would love to be a father someday,and look at me now, Iâ€™m nothing but a Loser fagot, that shouldnâ€™t be with anyone, and my mom definitely deserves a better son, and now how will i move on what if i caught hpv or herpes from that and gave it to someone else??? Urgghh alot is happening through my mind im just giving up on life.
