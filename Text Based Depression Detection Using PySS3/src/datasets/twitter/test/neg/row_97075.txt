What happens if I fail?This is the only doubt that stops me. My life may be shit right now, but it is manageable shit. If I try and fail, I lose so much that I don't know what I would do. I can take days stuck inside my apartment, I have done it before, but I haven't spent time in a mental ward. I even have the means to make what is statistically a fatal attempt, but I still stop because nothing is for certain. In a way, I can take comfort in my cowardice. I know that as long as I have the question nagging me I won't go through, but how long will that question chase me away?
