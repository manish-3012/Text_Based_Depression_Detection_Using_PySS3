Getting close to doing it again.I was posting on here pretty regularly. You guys were really helpful. I'm getting really tired again though.

Tomorrow my boss will ask my coworkers for input about my upcoming review. Needless to say being suicidal hasn't made me the best employee over the years. I don't know if I can function if I lose my job and insurance. In the US, you are basically fucked without private insurance.

I was dreading Valentine's day, but pretty defiant Friday and Sat. I got a hang up from a private caller on Valentine's day. I don't know if it was my ex, but I got another call Monday and a hang up yesterday at work. It got triggered and so messed up from it.

I can't reach out to my family or the few friends I have about how I'm feeling. I just started seeing a therapist and she'd just put me in a psych ward. I've tried to kill myself a couple times before and was unsuccessful. I hate living like this. The emotional pain is getting to the point that it's physical. I can't even describe what goes on inside me. I try to meditate. I pray to a God I don't believe in. I don't get out much. I feel covered in ashes and filled with glue. I don't see any kind of good future for myself. Maybe I shouldn't have changed my mind in December. I don't see this getting any better.
