Hey people.I'm 19M with bipolar I and schizoid personality disorder, among a handful of other issues.

I feel empty and passionless. I do not love anyone, or anything. I feel next to nothing, I am nothing. There's nothing tying me to reality. I feel like a void, an absence, like anything other than human. And there's very little hope, due to the nature of my disorder, that this will ever change.

I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a while now, but in the past half a year it's been way too much. Currently I'm hospitalized (voluntarily) for the second time in the past three months, but I'm beginning to regret this decision. If I weren't here, in the hospital, I'd kill myself today.

I can't imagine myself living on. Having a job to sustain myself, forcing myself to be creative just for the sake of filling the void that can't be filled, hanging out with the occasional acquiantance, all aimlessly, all devoid of meaning or purpose, and for what? Just to die anyway a little later?

I feel like all my issues are culminating into a tight point. My whole life I'm just drifting in and out of crises, never at peace, never comfortable, all for continuing an existence that's about as vibrant and full of taste as a piece of stale bread. 

I've made peace with death. I've made a plan. I've written a note, one of several I'm planning to write to different people before I go.

As soon as I'm out of the hospital, I'm finally ending it. I've had my go at life, it was eh, and there's no point in pushing further.

I don't want to live anymore.
