I need help...I'm a 24 y/o male, 3 years ago my wife and son died (1 month apart, my son stoped breathing and my wife had a brain tumor) and last year I tried to suicide twice (with pills and cutting myself), since then I've managed to grab onto people that doesn't really want to help me. They say that they want to help me but as soon as I need it they ALWAYS turn they back on me. I'm in the point where I think I deserve to be treated that way, that I don't deserve to live and that I'm compleate shit. A month ago I was living with my girlfriend and she dumped me (she is one of the people giving me their hands and taking it away as soon as posible). I don't know what to do anymore, today I spent all day crying in my bed. It's like my soul is gone, my mind is shattered, my heart devastated and my brain fried. I'm not being able to hold myself alone (wich everyone tells me to do) because I don't know how. Help...
