I'm sick of hearing "It gets better"It doesn't. It only gets better if you find the motivation to do something about it, and *succeed* at it.

I've tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, ***AND FUCKING TRIED***. And I'm just in a worse off place than I was 6 years ago. Every single fucking time I've even attempted at bettering my self I've fallen further from where I even started. 

Thought it'd get better when I got out of middle School. It didn't.
Thought it'd get better when I got out of high school. It didn't.
Thought it'd get better when I was in college. It didn't.
Thought it'd get better when I dropped out and got a real job. It didn't.

And in between each of those, I've still failed on every little thing trying to better myself and find meaning along the way. Less friends, worse social skills, less in shape, no hobbies, not 1 single lasting meaningful relationship. 

I've seen professionals, the meds made me worse, and the therapists were baffled as to why I hadn't killed myself yet. 

Another wasted year gone, and another one to go I guess. 

Happy New Year.
