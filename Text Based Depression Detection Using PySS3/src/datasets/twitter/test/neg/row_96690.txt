I just want it to endThe title is not original in any kind, sorry. Anyway, I wanted to say that I have all planned out. I have only thing missing and it is stopping me. Russian medical care, especially psychology is shit. They keep telling me stories that it will be alright, that It is just a time thing. IT IS NOT. I have been suicidal for more than two or maybe three years. I have it all planned. I want to disappear from my house one day and walk as far as I can possibly can to any forest and shoot myself. But (luckily??) I don't have neither gun nor a bullet to do that, but I think I'll manage that. Every day for me is worse then previous. I am just done. Burned out. I will tell you all how I ended up like this. To be short I was diagnosed with depression since I was 15 and today I am 26. Parents told me to stop lying to them about depression, to stop being lazy. I somehow managed to live to 18 years ( legal age in Russia) and went to psychologist by myself. Shit hit the fan after that. Parents started hating me. I am probably guilty in this situation. Or maybe it's just their Soviet education that made them believe that having a child who has something wrong is death-like. At age around 23-24 I discovered Reddit, r/depression to be accurate. And that sub kept me going due to emotional support of people there. But now, I feel like there is nothing that can support me. All I have is stupid 5/2 9am to 10pm job that I have to go to to keep living in my rented apartment. Huge cigarette addiction and no will left to keep on living this life. Every day is the same for me. home-work-home-sleep-repeat. And all my days off are spent by me sleeping in my bed all day. Thanks to this I have lost my friends. I have no wife/possible GF. My mother has divorced my father and has no intentions of speaking to me. My father has moved ro another city and doesn't want to keep in touch with me. All is lost. thanks for reading and sorry for ranting in your feed.
