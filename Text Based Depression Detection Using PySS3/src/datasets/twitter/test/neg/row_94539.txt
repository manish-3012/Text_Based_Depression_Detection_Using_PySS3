Hey everyone, I'm here to help.So most of you are here to find help or here to help others.  I'm actually both.  I've come here to support you all, but by providing that support you guys are helping me deal with these emotions too.  

It has been a really crazy and honestly a messed up year for me so far.  On February 19^rd one of my good friends decided to take his life.  This was exactly 6 days after he became an adult.  That's 6 days of living life as a supposed free man.  He had troubles with depression, honestly he was too smart for himself.  He knew what was going on internally and felt there was no escape.

There was a way though.  He was very private about his emotions and condition.  I truly feel that if he was open to sharing these thoughts with others, the possibility to cure himself was there.  Everybody I know loved this kid, and we still do, but it hurts that he isn't here in physical form to show that love.

Only two weeks later a teen I had little personal connection to committed suicide also.  I had texted him a few times, and he seemed like an extremely happy and wonderful guy.  Yet he hid his true emotions and feelings of despair.  I think about both of these guys almost every day, sometimes many times a day.

So I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you feel like there is no way out, take a minute to find someone to talk to.  Don't be scared about how people will see these emotions.  I challenge each and everyone of you on this subreddit to tell one person how you feel about them or even what is on your mind.  I think the power of communication and connection is enough to help save lives.  If anyone needs help dealing with anything, please, PM whatever you need.  I'm here for you and you're here for me.
--Peace and Love--
