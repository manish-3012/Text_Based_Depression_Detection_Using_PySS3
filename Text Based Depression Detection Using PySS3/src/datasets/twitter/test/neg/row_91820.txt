A shitty poem I made on my break, my BPD destroyed another relationship with someone I loved
Ghosts, 

remains of my loss

thatâ€™s all you are, I donâ€™t know what to say

This pain this hurt, I feel it each day

........
........
........
........


â€œYouâ€™ve hurt me too much, Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t â€ 

those words that you say,

A familiar phrase, 

a crushing chant

Our relationship, our connection, falls

The questions of who I am

an endless maze


........
........
........
........


For you were everything I ever wanted 

But I left you with scars, 

forever haunted,

The falling of the stars,

The fading of the moon,

Being with me,

Brace,

For the paralysing doom 


........
........
........
........


Your presence, your life it gave me reason to live 

I loved you so much 

believe me, 
 
Please,

believe me,

I just canâ€™t comprehend

The shit I caused, 

so hard to forgive

To understand 

........
........
........
........

An angel, a princess, my everything and queen 

truly those words I deeply solemnly mean

A monster, a psycho, not the person I was

But the thing I became,

to you that is always

Forgoing I seem

........
........
........
........

I donâ€™t blame you, honestly, I really canâ€™t 

Live your life, be happy, 

please forget me

Escape from my toxicity, my sickening rant

........
........
........
........

The coldness and chill,

Your voice,

 when I try to reconnect

A feeble attempt,

to rebuild the wall,

I failed to protect

........
........
........
........

The sadness of each day,

The blame I hold,

It was a bitter sweet dream,

But an eerie pattern,

 just waiting to unfold

........
........
........
........


Everyday I question me, my actions 

even my mirrored face

â€œWho are you?â€ I scream 

My mind ,

a never ending race

........
........
........
........

Decisions, thoughts, feelings 

sharp as a pin

You see this race, the one I always lose,

This,

This is,

My unforgiving sin 

........
........
........
........

Your fragrance, your grace, 

I did not deserve

But my crime my punishment, 

this I must serve

My decisions, impulse, sickness so brass

For you a small cut, 

for me a deepening slash

........
........
........
........

A self inflicted wound,

Tearing open my skin,

Blood running so fast,

I canâ€™t even begin

........
........
........
........


To live this again,

Was it all a dream?

A fantastical story,

Your light in my life, a fading beam

........
........
........
........

That connection, feeling of care that I crave,

All the loneliness, chaos

For this soul, 

no one can save,

.......
.......
.......
.......


My only release from this relentless hell

Is for my spirit, my being, 

to which I must sell

A noose, pills, a blade 

this ever consistent list

To start over, end this battle 

of searing reminisce,

........
........
........
........

Each minute I wait, for him to greet me,

from what I canâ€™t forget 

From that I miss 

Black mass, 

Still bones,

Death,

I urge and confide,

in his welcoming kiss

........
........
........
........

â€œTake me nowâ€ I shout â€œfor this suffering, when will it end?â€

â€œNeverâ€ he proclaims, 

â€œthis existence you carry, no one can mendâ€

........
........
........
........

Hanging from a noose, the branch of a tree,

â€œThis I promise you Jack, is the only way to be freeâ€

........
........
........
........

For you see your life, friends, family and lover

Another side to you, 

evil, 

destructive, 

they will never discover

Thatâ€™s not you,

Youâ€™re everything Iâ€™m not,

I wish I could be normal, not lose the people I love 

For you will be remembered, 

The joy that you bring,

But me?

I will be forgot

The things I do and say,

this void,

will never ever recover

........
........
........
........

A life and living I have always hoped

To be happy, in love 

Blissful in cheer,

But my wake is a reality from which I am choked

........
........
........
........


I miss you, Iâ€™m sorry 

undeniably true

I know you donâ€™t with me,

Youâ€™re glad that weâ€™re through

Your happiness has always mattered the most,

To me

And to you

With this I can do nothing but boast 

Your smile, I think of each day

Your laugh, 

A painful reminder of what I have ultimately lost 

But i canâ€™t lie,

If it means happy without me, 

To bring jubilance each day,

Those so lucky to be in your life,

Me?

I admit,

Iâ€™m too awful to stay  

........
........
........
........

You will flourish and be successful in whatever you do,

You were special, 

Kind

A rare spirit 

This I knew

The one that makes me regret,

Everything I do

........
........
........
........

My flusters of rage, insecurity and trauma 

The reasons and shame, 

can not be understood with a simple comma,

........
........
........
........

Iâ€™m sorry I mean it for everything I am,

This storm in my head, 

omitted from calm

This disorder, 

the quicksand of battling my brain,

I wouldnâ€™t admit on my enemies, 

the worst of the worst,

you would undoubtedly go insane

........
........
........
........

As i awake to the brightness 

The rise of each morning,

Darkness shroud the radiating sun

Another scar on my skin, 

Cancerous this plague

Engraining, another forming

This existence, 

Undoubtedly vague


........
........
........
........


For me the world isnâ€™t potential and hope

Standing at the edge,

My stomach sinks,

Fear, guilt, a bleak steepening slope

For the hand, skin and touch of you,

is everything I need, to feel, to cope

But your emotions and thoughts, a curse I can falsely read

........
........
........
........

I assume that anything bad, wrong is always my fault,

Itâ€™s my belief and understanding, 

a perception I canâ€™t halt

........
........
........
........

A new face to help, and medication to take 

Another book,

a higher dosage,

a new perception?

No

None of it helps control whatâ€™s inside

Just lock me away, imprisoned, for all of your sake 

The lonely cage, 

I deserve to confide,

........
........
........
........


To die and end my pulsating heart, 

would surely be murder, 

purely unjust,

But killing this other side of me, 

this demon,

a fulfilment I must

........
........
........
........

Another body I cannot diminish,

Make them suffer,

This story, 

This journey,

Itâ€™s always,

Inherently,

the same cruel finish


........
........
........
........


Do not feel guilt or sorrow for â€œwhat could I have doneâ€?

For this war and conflict, through this, could only be won

Now not another innocence will be wounded, grazed

From the shadow that overhangs,

that will eventually cave

........
........
........
........

I love you all, 

I wish I was different,

Not me,

so very much,

But I canâ€™t run from this disorder, 

borderline, 

my eternal crutch,
