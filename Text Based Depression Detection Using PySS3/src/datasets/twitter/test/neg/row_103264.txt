I'm tired of being a fuckup.I don't know what to do anymore. I stare blankly at things and I feel like I'm always numb. I get upset really easily and have anxiety attacks over nothing.

I've screwed up an amazing relationship with the one person I truly loved. 

I feel like no one ever understands me and I'm not sure if that's because I can't communicate how I feel or if people just don't care. I'm at a total loss.
