I know this probably wouldn't even kill me anyway but I'm having an impulse to down all of my meds at onceI have duloxetine, bupropion, hydroxyzine, aripiprazole, and lamotragine, all almost full-month supplies. I don't take the lamotragine anymore but the rest I do.


Whenever I take them I just think what if I just took all of them at once and then maybe finally didn't have to fucking suffer anymore? Because taking them normally clearly isn't helping and neither has anything else, ever
