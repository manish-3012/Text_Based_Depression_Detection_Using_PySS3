Its 3amI'm waiting for the right day to do this. I tried last weekend and was stopped by my girlfriend. I told my mom that I want to kill myself and now I'm starting therapy. First session Anne told me that I'm likely bipolar and possibly schizoaffective. She handed me an MMPI test to fill out for an official diagnosis. I'm to scared to do it. I'm normally more articulate than this, but my thoughts are coming out in odd groupings. I just can't stand this anymore.
