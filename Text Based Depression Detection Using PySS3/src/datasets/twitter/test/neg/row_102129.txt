Suicidal thoughts after increase dosage of Lexapro, just something I have to work through or mjor concern?I've been on 10mg of Lexapro for my anxiety for about 2 months. It was working pretty good, I did have some severe anxiety the first week on it, but then 2 weeks ago it started to not work as well. My doctor said this is normal and you just have to find the right dosage so he increased it to 15mg (says he wants me on as little as possible) this thursday. 

Yesterday (saturday) I had some intense suicidal thoughts during a panic attack on my way to work. These weren't the sort of "I want to die" thoughts, I wouldn't say I'm suicidal at all! They were more an intrusive thought that scared me into worrying if I was suicidal. 

All day yesterday I was very depressed and anxious. Today was much better, I had no suicidal thoughts and was just a bit up and down. I have a follow up next month with my doctor but are those suicidal thoughts cause for major concern or just something I have to work through (I read the first 2 weeks after a dosage increase are tough)?
