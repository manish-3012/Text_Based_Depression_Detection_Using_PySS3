I wish I didn't have people who cared/supported/helped meI know this is a horrible thing to wish for and I'm horribly ungrateful, but if I had no one maybe then I would finally have the courage. Being the oldest of 6 I'd hurt so many people and they all look up to me cause of sibling blindness. My parents who love me and always tell me how proud they are. My girlfriend who would 100% follow through if I went. My friends who feel the same way. I wish that none of them had the heart to put up with me or the bad luck to have me enter their life. Life is a prison
