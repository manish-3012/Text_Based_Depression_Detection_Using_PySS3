Has anybody else done permanent damage to their bodies after swallowing pills?About a year ago, I was feeling really depressed and lonely, so I gulped down a shit ton of ritalin. It wasn't necessarily to kill myself, I just wanted a short escape from the world. While I was coming down from the high, I realized I couldn't breathe through my nose at full capacity, like it was a bit stuffy. A whole year later, this has persisted. Also I'm a lot jumpier, and more easily frightened. Has anyone else experienced permanent damage to their bodies like this?
