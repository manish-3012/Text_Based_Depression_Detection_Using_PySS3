So ugly I want to dieDon't bs me about its what's inside that counts, in this society looks are everything.
You can't have happiness unless you are a pretty woman. 

Every guy ive dated, I've approached or they date me out of pity. 
First bf was abusive told me to get surgery, second boyfriend used me for sex and to get his ex back, third boyfriend thought i was too ugly to date so used me until he got feelings, fourth boyfriend used me and got with his friends sister a week after and my most recent ex was taking pictures of beautiful women and boning an ugly fuck like me
No wonder he cheated.

I've been called ugly all my fucking life my mum; my dad, my brothers, People in school, my ex, strangers and even online.
I was called ugly up until the age of 20, my whole fucking life robbed of happiness.

Am i supposed to have just glowed up into a beautiful woman like people tell me iam? Well I can't be

Pretty women get snatched up, cared for, loved, They settle down, have children and get approached at clubs.


Im yet to have a loving mutual relationship and a normal life.
I'm spending thousands of pounds on cosmetic surgery.

People tell me I'm beautiful, strangers, guys, my family, my friends and even professionals. 
I've been asked to model, I get asked out a lot online but it all makes my head hurt
I sob, I dont know who iam.

I just want to settle down and have children n be loved 
Surely I deserve that after the life I've had


Sorry reddit I can't do it anymore, I've had one suicide attempt this week and my family i live with told me to do it.
