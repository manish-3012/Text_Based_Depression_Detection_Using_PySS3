Everyday I ask (poem)**Everyday I ask**


&amp;nbsp;


Why I wouldnâ€™t just die,  


in a world so unforgiving  


Why I shouldnâ€™t say goodbye,  


when thereâ€™s no point in living  


&amp;nbsp;


No aspirations, not one achievement  


Disappointed all my relations expectations  


At least my death will cause relievement  


I have no worth, have known since birth


&amp;nbsp;


Sit alone all day, got no one to talk to  


Just another day, another dÃ©jÃ  vu  


Booze, a bruise and self abuse  


I want the help, but still refuse  


&amp;nbsp;


So despite the depression I hide my mess  


Iâ€™m not trying to impress them  


Just give the wrong impression  


Prevent those whispers, but no success


&amp;nbsp;


I really donâ€™t want to cause any commotion  


Just sink motionless to the bottom of the ocean  


Grab a chair, down a bottle 80 proof  


Take a breath of air and hang myself from the roof


&amp;nbsp;


Why I wouldnâ€™t just die,  


in a world so unforgiving  


Why I shouldnâ€™t say goodbye,  


when thereâ€™s no point in living
