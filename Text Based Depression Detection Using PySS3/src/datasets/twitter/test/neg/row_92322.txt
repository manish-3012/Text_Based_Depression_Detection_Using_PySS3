Every step forward is worseI'm a middle aged guy, husband with three young children and own a business. Not too bad, eh?

Well, the business recently failed and my wife filed for divorce last week. We moved to a small town where she grew up a few years ago to be around her family. My closest family is 2,000 miles away.

So now I'm living in a motel, no income, a wife that hates me (I earned it) and a small town where I have no friends or professional network.

I was just released from the hospital after being held on a 72 hour watch. I managed to bullshit my way out. I still don't see a way forward out of this mess. It's like the universe is telling me there's no room for me here.

I know, I know. I've got kids. Don't do it because of the kids. But that reason is the only thing keeping me from killing myself, and that reason is getting strained.
