No one knowsWhat makes me the saddest is that no one knows how truly miserable and empty I feel. People don't reach out to me. My family thinks I am a "normal" student who lives her life and studies everyday. No one knows how deeply I suffer everyday and every night. I carry this immense sadness and sorrow with me everywhere I go and how I wish I was never born. I just want to feel understood and that people truly care for me. But everyone only cares for themselves. 

I want to die so bad but I don't want to traumatize my family.
It could be over and no more pain, no more suffering... but I am too scared. 

Waiting for better days to come or my death.

Sending all of you brave sufferers my deepest compassion.
