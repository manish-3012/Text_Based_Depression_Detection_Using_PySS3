On and on againItâ€™s hard for me to put into words what Iâ€™m feeling in this exact moment. Itâ€™s 1:06am and Iâ€™m sat in the living room staring at my phone. I have work tomorrow and right now Iâ€™d rather not be here anymore.

I hate myself, I hate my working life and my job. Iâ€™m early 30â€™s and I have no direction for my career. I am a walking waste of air that is just getting in the way of others. I hate that I have to spend 8-10 hours a day in a job that I am rotting in because I am useless at everything else in my life. Everyone at work hates me and piles on the work to the point where I break. I never get praised and anything that I feel I excelled in is met with someone finding a fault. Worthless and useless sums up my work life. 

Iâ€™m morbidly obese I canâ€™t lose weight for shit and whenever I have done well, a family member or friend is there clapping and waiting for me to fail so they can laugh or say I told you so. 

I am loved by my partner but I am a burden on him. Iâ€™m never happy and spend most of my time crying or feeling down. He would be better off without me. 
My family have had enough of my mental health, they were sympathetic before but now itâ€™s â€œyouâ€™re on medication now so youre 100% betterâ€ Iâ€™m not. 

The only hope I have to cling on tonight is that I may be able to find work where I can work at my own speed doing something that I love. Be my own boss and work what I like. I am done with rotting in an office and answering to people that make me feel like shit. But Iâ€™m stuck. Itâ€™s never going to happen for someone like me. I donâ€™t want to live another day like this. Feel like this. 

Iâ€™m sat with all my medication in reach. Taking all of these seems the only way out of this hell. It really is hell. How could my life become so shit. Why am I driving myself to a place where I feel like shit for 80% of my day. I canâ€™t take it. I canâ€™t take it any more. I want out.
