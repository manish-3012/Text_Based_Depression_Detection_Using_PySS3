too old to have not dated, no point.This is possibly idiotic but I do not want to live anymore because I have not dated. I am in my late 20's and most people this age are married, getting engaged, etc. I am stuck a stage behind these peers, it is a sinking feeling. I have a challenging time relating with people, and have never had a boyfriend (which is quite bizarre at my age, I'm aware). I am a shy person and do not know if I will ever find a friend in this, much less a partner and am over all of this. What is the point of going on? I do not relate to other people, I will always be the weirdo and odd one out. There is not a point to living if you have no one to enjoy life with.
