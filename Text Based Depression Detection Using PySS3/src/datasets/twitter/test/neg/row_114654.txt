have everything. have nothing.i don't know where to begin, if one could put my life out on a table like a  photoreel it might all make sense to someone how i got here, and maybe even i'd see where i/it went wrong.  i'm not depressed for any credible reason (poverty, divorce, struggle, loss, etc), my depression is a pitiful result of privilege and laziness, and perhaps even intelligence.  there was a time when things were going well, i was creating music, writing, fucking, reading, sleeping, exercising, socializing, etc.  

but i am dying inside, everyday another part of my soul crumbles to ash, making the very things that can pull me from this hole more and more impossible to accomplish.  i want to do things, i want to make money properly, i want to find love and be loved.  i've been spoiled with easy sex and beautiful women, easy money that seems to flow faster than i can squander it on trips and shows and alcohol and blah, and my artistic bullshit-threshold is far too acute to allow me to create anything anymore.  these things which previously could pull me from depression are no longer there for me.  love is dead, i remember the feeling of touching a woman's hand and wanting to be with them forever, but i don't even think i can feel that anymore.  $ is crippling, what do you do when you have money from your family, money from past projects, and nothing to funnel it into but 2 week excursions to europe that end back at home with depression.  

i am meant to be something and do something on this earth, my brain deserves to be put to work and my heart deserves to be loved, and i understand these things but i just can't seem to do anything about it, and it gets harder everyday.

everyone seems to find it so easy.  to wake up, latch on to the most warm member of the opposite sex, find a shitty career, get married, have annoying kids.  i am simply spoiled...to death...and it is killing me slowly.  nothing is good enough for me anymore.  the other night i put my jeep in 5th gear, gunned it to 90 down hollywood blvd and was going to just drive until i hit a wall, but some people crossed the street and i stopped for them and saw a little girl and had a holden caulfield moment that may have saved my life.  

i realized i can't bring myself to kill myself, my ex-girlfriends lives would be shattered, i know they don't want me back (i deserve it) but the only meaningful thing i have left in my life is taking care of these poor girls who are probably just as depressed and paralyzed as i am on the inside.  my parents would blame themselves, my brother who probably has even more reason to be depressed than me and looks up to me greatly would be crushed and might even commit suicide himself.   there's no way i can do it, i get tears thinking about the collateral damage of it all, but there's just no justification for living a life like this when everyday goes nowhere.  all that's left to do is passively experience art/media created by other people, bang ex-girlfriends who could care less about me, and maybe watch my sports teams perform.  i have decided that if i ever really feel like ending my life again i am going to spend time snowboarding or surfing or with friends first since i know these things cheer me up, but i also recognize that they are escapism and they can't always be there for me.  i am fine for now, so spare me the hotlines and the "plz don't do it"s, i just want to figure this thing out...
