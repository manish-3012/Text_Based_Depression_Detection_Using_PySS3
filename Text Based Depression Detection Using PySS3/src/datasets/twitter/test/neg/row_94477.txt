one of my fb friends posted this status..."you know what sounds good right now? death. like this if you give a fuck about me.."

it wasn't someone i know all that well, but it really pissed me off, because today is the 3 year anniversary of my best friend's suicide. so i commented on it, telling him not to pull this kind of shit, and got completely attacked. i know we all need some love and attention sometimes, but seriously making it a facebook status is not how to go about it. was i in the wrong for calling him out? isn't the tendency to kill ones self quietly after tons of consideration? doesn't it usually go with apathy and introversion? is this person just being a fucking attention whore?
