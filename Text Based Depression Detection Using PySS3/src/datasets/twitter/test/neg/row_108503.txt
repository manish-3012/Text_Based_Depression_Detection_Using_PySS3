Why live if I'll never feel satisfied?I feel like I've never been satisfied with what I've had ever in my life. Why do I need to live if this is the only thing I'll ever see?

I'm only 16, but I still feel like this will never change. I also feel as if I'm never good enough. This self-hatred has led me to self-harm, which I've become addicted to and am fighting on my own. I've managed 3 weeks without cutting, but on the inside, I'm a wreck.

Do you have any advice, Reddit?
