I might do it. Iâ€™m so close to tipping.No one can tell but right now, Iâ€™m crying and internally screaming. Iâ€™m an 11 yo boy but whatever. Iâ€™m being forced to go on vacation 1 week notice. Iâ€™ve had so many things going on in my life. Iâ€™ve been cutting my arms, legs, and ankles. The vacation is a road trip. My moms know I have severe motion sickness. I kept begging and arguing. I had to remind her of my motion sickness. She just said I donâ€™t care. She doesnâ€™t are about my pain, physically or emotionally. My parents are divorced and it sucks. My brother is leaving for college who was a good friend to me. Everyone hates me. My mom will yell at everyone who annoys her. People make me feel guilty for mistakes a long time ago. Iâ€™m weird. Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™m short. I swear, a couple more events and Iâ€™ll fucking do it.
