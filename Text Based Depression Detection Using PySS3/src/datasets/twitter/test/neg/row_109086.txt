I have been depressed for more than half my life.I honestly cannot find a way out anymore and i have tried to end it. I have told 2 people that are yelling at me to get help but i cant. I have been able to control it a bit and keep my feelings secret but this year, i have never felt like this.
I have tried 8 times in 6 months. I have been able to play it off as "whoops accident" but i recently did something impossible to play off. I wake up everyday saying to myself "**** im still alive".
