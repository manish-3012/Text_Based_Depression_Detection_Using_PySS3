I donâ€™t know how I should kill myself help?(I only want people to answer to this and not try to change my thoughts )

Iâ€™m frustrated and annoyed bc I canâ€™t decide on how I should die, I want it to be fast , not painful and I want it to be easy to do. I thought that I could shoot myself but I canâ€™t buy a gun in this country ): 
So I thought about hanging myself , but itâ€™s weirdly hard to find a good rope and a spot to die in. I also read that people can survive this and had to have big consequences.

I donâ€™t have the guts to cut myself and I have always had a hard time to swallow pills so idk if I can take sleeping pills, but it would be nice to just die in your sleep 

I canâ€™t jump off a bridge bc here we donâ€™t have tall enough bridges to kill you if you jumped, it would only hurt you 
I might think that jumping from a building is a good option but I donâ€™t where I would found a roof top or the right height, and Idk if I have the guts to do that bc Iâ€™m a little scared of height also I donâ€™t want to disturbed people with killing myself on their sidewalk     

So what should I do??
How should I kill myself? Pls help with answering !
