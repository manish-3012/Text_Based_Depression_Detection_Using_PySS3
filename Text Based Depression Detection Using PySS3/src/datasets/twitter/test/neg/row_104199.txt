I can't understand...In the same time i can't cryI always feel lonely, i can't trust anybody, when i try to do it, they hurt my feelings so i think it's better to stop trying. The world is so...grey? I can't remember anything in other colors. I'm tired of ppl, of my cat, of everything around(especially myself). What's happening? What's wrong with me? Help me understand pls, i wish to end this all and run away, so empty and fooled inside makes me lose more and more senses :(
