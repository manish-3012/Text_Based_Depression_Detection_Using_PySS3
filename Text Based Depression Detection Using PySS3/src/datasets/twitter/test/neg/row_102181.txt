Itâ€™s always on my mind but I canâ€™tSuicide had been on my mind since middle school, (I am 23 now) I want to end my life because Iâ€™m not great at anything, Iâ€™m not good at school, not great at being a worker, not amazing at being a husband.

The main thing that always stop me from ending my life is the people around me. I feel ashamed that they will lose a close friend, a brother, a son, and a husband. Itâ€™s selfish of me to end my life, they give so much but it always the reason why I want to end it all.

They give everything I need to be great but I fail at it, Iâ€™m tired of failing them all, I wish I know what to do with my life, I need help, any advice, Iâ€™m too scare to talk to anyone about this as they will see me a failure.
