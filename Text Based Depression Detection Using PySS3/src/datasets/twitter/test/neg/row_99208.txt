I pray for God to let me die and He says noMy wife has lied to me about our finances our entire marriage, almost 30 years.  It's my fault I know.  I should just take them over, but the thought makes me sick.  I hate myself for allowing it to go on, but I love her with all my heart.  Found out today that another automatic payment didn't go through. I called her and told her that all I wanted now was to walk into traffic.  I pray all the time for God to just take me out, but apparently He doesn't think that's the thing to do.  I love her so much, but I just want to die.  Our son is 28 and I've got enough life insurance to pay the bills.  I want out!!  God forgive me for feeling this way, but I am tired of being afraid to answer the phone or check emails.  I couldn't walk into traffic because that would mean involving some innocent person in my misery.  I have the 20 gauge shotgun my grandfather used to kill himself and the remainder of the box of shells he used as well.  Nothing like family tradition.
