Iâ€™m literally waiting to kill myselfWhen my mum dies Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Iâ€™m not even sure anymore whether Iâ€™d be able to stop myself. Iâ€™m 42. My mum is elderly, becoming more immobile and sicker as time passes it seems. I believe she hides it well, for obvious reasons. All my life Iâ€™ve been with my mum through exceptional times and bad, and there have been many bad, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve always stood with her to protect her. Sheâ€™s my world and to be honest thereâ€™s literally nothing else in this world I care about. I only really care for my mum and animals. Nothing else in the entire world I give a single shit about.

Iâ€™ve grown to completely despise this world beyond description, and utterly loathe people. Although Iâ€™d never hate anyone, not a single soul. I donâ€™t want friends (although Iâ€™ve had plenty), a partner (I would have liked sweet children but Iâ€™ve given up on that, and Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d want to bring anyone into this fucked up world), or help from anyone as Iâ€™ve realised nobody ultimately can help you in the world. 

I know it would be catastrophic for my mum to see me die but when she is no longer here, I know I will have nothing to live for and absolutely nothing to stop me. I suffer constant pain, anxiety and worry daily and depression. Itâ€™s never going to be ok for me, and without my mum, in world I already feel completely lost and utterly lonely in, is an absolutely petrifying and depressing prospect.

I already make plans. Iâ€™ll hang myself from the banister, or Iâ€™ll go on a long trip and drown myself in a lake. Maybe Iâ€™ll be spontaneous and take a run off a cliff edge. Itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™m ready for it. Just waiting so I donâ€™t cause unbearable pain to my mum. My lifeâ€™s failed massively. Except for the beautiful childhood my mother provided for my, my life has been utter shit. Worse thing is I couldâ€™ve done more. Now itâ€™s an utter drag. A constant pain that Iâ€™ve concluded will not get any better, will definitely get worse, especially when Iâ€™m old and alone and shitting in my pants. I know in the second half of my life Iâ€™m going to be completely alone, that terrifies me beyond description.
