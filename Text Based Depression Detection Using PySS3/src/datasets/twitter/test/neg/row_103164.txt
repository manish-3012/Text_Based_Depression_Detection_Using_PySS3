Last shot at seeing if anyone cares enough to be there for meI donâ€™t have anyone else. And I feel more lonely than I ever have in years. This is my last cry for someone. My last time trying to ask others to be here because I have no one. Donâ€™t feel you have to.. I want genuine people, not someone who feels forced. Though thatâ€™s sweet that you might feel pity, donâ€™t feel obligated to do anything.
