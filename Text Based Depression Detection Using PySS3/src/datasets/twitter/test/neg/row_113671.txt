Iâ€™m so tired of this.Tired of living. Tired of doing this every single fucking day. My therapist says that i need to wait because itâ€™ll get better in ways that I canâ€™t imagine. He says iâ€™m too young to understand (iâ€™m 17.) 

I turn 18 at the end of december. I previously had plans to kill myself by then. Think iâ€™m gonna revive those plans. I have a supporting grandma and somewhat supporting grandpa, who iâ€™ve lived with for the majority of my teen years, because of my parents abuse. i still canâ€™t get past my trauma. 

iâ€™m also trans. to think that i have to go through so much bullshit to be able to be the person i really am. 

but oh well. my plan is to make my family hate me and then move to another country when iâ€™m 18 so i can kill myself there.
