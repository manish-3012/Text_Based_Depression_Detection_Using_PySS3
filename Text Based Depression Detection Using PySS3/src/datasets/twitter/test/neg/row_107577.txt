I want a pretend boyfriend before I have the courage to kill myselfI'm a girl lower twenties in the states. I was denied govt help for severe ptsd from prolonged child sex abuse. I can't work full time hours. They traumatized me at the evaluation, for nothing. Most of my romantic relationships have been people who abused me as well. I'll never not be an object or stepping stone in someone's life. I just want someone to pretend to love me unconditionally before I finally end it all. At least then I can lie to myself and daydream about the perfect life.
