I donâ€™t even knowDoes anyone else feel just...uncomfortable with reality? I feel like Iâ€™m not meant to be here, to be alive. Living is so painful. I never really understood mental agony until now. Every day feels like weeks, suicide is always on my mind. It feels like the walls are narrowing in on me. I donâ€™t remember a time when I didnâ€™t want to die.
