I think i am actually supposed to die.Well. I posted a few times about me Not being able to get out of bed only watching anime sometimes, Not getting a job, friends, a hobbie or anything like that, that i got my mom thousands of â‚¬ into debt cuz of the money that the youth Office pays if i do something and that i would just kms once i cant Lie in bed anymore. on this subreddit and on r/self .

I honestly got some nice and good responses and people who really tried to help and i even tried to better myself and try to do something because of All the people telling me that theres more to life, that i lack a reason to get up and that i should do something about it, try small steps first and try to better myself.

But i just cant. I really did try. I just cant keep it up and end up doing the Same Thing i did before. Laying in bed doing nothing besides watching some anime and thinking about what way to kms would be the most efficcient.
