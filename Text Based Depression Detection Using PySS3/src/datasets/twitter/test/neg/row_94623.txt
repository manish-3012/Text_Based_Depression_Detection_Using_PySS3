A serious ventI took 12 tylenol last night. I know its not going to kill me or have any permanent damage, but now I just want to take the rest of more than a 100 pills. I can't feel anything anymore. I know I should be scared but somehow, I felt a sense of relief knowing that thus is going to be happening later.
