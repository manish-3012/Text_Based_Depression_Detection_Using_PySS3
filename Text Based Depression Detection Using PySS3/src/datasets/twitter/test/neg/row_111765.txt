I think im gonna end it soon.This is gonna be a long rant, but here we go. I cant deal with this pain anymore. Its been building up and up. Im extremely insecure, and have extreme anxiety. I dont even know where to start theres so many things wrong. But my main issue is,  the last 2 years of my life Ive literally isolated myself in my house because im so insecure about my appearance, im so ugly. And normally this wouldn't be a problem but the reason im so insecure about my looks is because I used to be good looking, but in the space of two years I got bad acne, and my already big nose got bigger making me look even more like gru from despicable me, thats what they'd call me in school. Im only a young teen, but it hurts knowing ive wasted two years of my life, I used to have friends but I lost them all because I never speak to them, because ive isolated myself. Because im so insecure. I hate myself, I look in the mirror and want to cry. I was never this ugly. but even when i was decently looking, i still had anxiety. Im just so sensitive and im not made for this life. im so ugly, and i hate myself. My nose has gotten so much bigger the past year and i darent even go back to school because i think im so ugly compared to what i used to look like. I hate watching everybody get boyfriends and girlfriends and enjoying their time but im way too ugly to even leave my house, let alone go to school and talk to people. But it didnt used to be like this, I used to have friends, and I used to go out all the time. But back then I was young and shiny, and so good looking. And have no insecurities. My nose was big but now its too big and I hate myself. I sit here just thinking about all the time I wasted, all the potential I had, but I cant for-fill it because im unbelievable ugly and insecure, I love my old witty funny self. But now I try to be my old self, im not who I once was, Im not happy anymore. I used to look at people who were in relationships and be happy for them, knowing if i really wanted to, i could get one too. but now i genuinly cant, im so ugly and sad, watching everybody grow up while i sit out and hate myself, im going to fail everything in school too, thats if i even go back.
