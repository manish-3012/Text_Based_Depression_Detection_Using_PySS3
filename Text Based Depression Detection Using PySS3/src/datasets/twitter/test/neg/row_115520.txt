someone help me pleaseHelp me please. I've been in a long distance relationship for the last 8 months. Things have been really tough. She is everything to me, everything I've done has been holding onto this relationship. She's just blocked me from all kinds of communication. I don't know what to do. I'm sat in tears as i type. I know I've not been the best boyfriend, but I've been trying, I've made mistakes. She's the only person i have in my life. The only one i can talk to, she's the only reason I get out of bed in the morning, and its all gone.
