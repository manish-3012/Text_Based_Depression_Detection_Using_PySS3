This is just a stupid rant about how much I pity myself and Iâ€™ve spent all day doing fucking nothing and I hate itIâ€™m falling apart and have been for much too long. Yesterday I left work early for fear of having a mental breakdown and today I called in. 

Yesterday when I got home I bought cigarettes. Been trying to quit, but arenâ€™t we all. It was nice outside so I just sat for a while. You know that depressed daze where all you can think about is how shit everything is and you just want to die? I just kept myself sitting there because I knew if I just sat there I wouldnâ€™t be able to kill myself. I had a few hours until my bf got home and Iâ€™d be safe from myself, so until then I just sat. 

While I was sitting, a little boy who lives in my apartment building was outside with his mother. He was ecstatically playing and exploring. He couldnâ€™t have been more than 2. He ran right up to me, oblivious to the horrible pain I was experiencing, and said, â€œHi! How are you?â€ I could barely understand him, I donâ€™t think he knows many words yet. How am I? Man I was dumbfounded. Finally I found words and broke out of my daze, at least for a second. â€œIâ€™m good, how are you?â€ His mother smiled and told him to say, â€œIâ€™m fine!â€ After that he ran off and she went after him. Iâ€™m glad I had sunglasses on because the encounter made me burst into tears. I was so jealous of that boy, he seemed so happy. I also felt terrible for him because one day his innocence will be ripped away and he will discover the horrible state of this world weâ€™re living in. On top of it, hardly anyone knows Iâ€™m feeling this way, but he just seemed to know. I mean he obviously didnâ€™t, but I swear his eyes were asking me if I was okay, if he could help me. It was so strange.

Today I called in and I feel terribly guilty. Iâ€™ve just been sitting around my apartment trying to convince myself that itâ€™s okay to take a day to take care of myself. Except Iâ€™m not taking care of myself. I havenâ€™t eaten, Iâ€™ve smoked far too many cigarettes, and Iâ€™m afraid to move for fear Iâ€™ll just go grab a razor blade and slit my wrists or take my belt out of the closet to hang myself. 

I know I need to go to work tomorrow. I need to stop taking sick days just to mope around. Iâ€™m going to try to go in early tomorrow to catch up. Iâ€™m going to try to stick it through, no leaving early, and Iâ€™m going to try not to cry at any point during the day. Holy fuck itâ€™s gonna be hard though. I just feel like a worthless piece of shit. 

My bf will be home in a few hours again. Iâ€™m just gonna hug him and cry. I was hoping today would be a day to help me feel better, but I think I only made it worse. I keep thinking Iâ€™m going to get chewed out by my boss tomorrow, but thatâ€™s completely unrealistic, right? We have sick days so we can take them when we need them, and if Iâ€™m feeling this way I definitely needed one, right? Iâ€™m just trying to justify my dumbass fucking feelings and actions. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™m just a ball of anxiety and pain and I want it to stop.
