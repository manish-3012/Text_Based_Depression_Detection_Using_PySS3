I deserve to dieWell...i really tried to stay alive. I worked on myself. I tried therapy. Medication. Everything. And it worked...kinda. I felt better about myself. But i can't seem to stop failing those who I claim to love. And now i've gone and committed perhaps the biggest fuckup of my life. Even if i get out of depression i'll never be able to live with the guilt and shame. I broke my word so i guess i have to pay...I'm terrified of dying, of nonexistence. But i have no choice left. I'm checking out on Saturday. The anniversary of the start of WW1 seemed appropriate.After all, if i fucked up might as well take the Officer's way out. I'm sorry i couldn't help any of you people more.
