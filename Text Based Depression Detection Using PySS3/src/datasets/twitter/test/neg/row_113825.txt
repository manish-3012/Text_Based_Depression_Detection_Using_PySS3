Parents. Threatens to destroy my college/job career.I feel the need to jump off a bridge and just drown my sorrows in the abyss. Due to family issues, regarding me in general, due to my sadness in anger fusing together as a time bomb ready to explode into a Sea Mine size explosion. So here what's happened: My Mother and my Aunt, both says if I don't pass this Algebra Tutorial Final Test for college which is a 70% (Currently staying at 60-65%) they'll force me to go back home to find a job. So, why shouldn't I stay since, I'm clearly 18 and allowed to do whatever I need to do here, then back there. My Major is Computer Game Designing, if I can't find a effort to create games, I can't live with myself anymore. It's like they say "You Lose one, your parents wants you to lose many". Asian parents... they guess they knows what's best right? Wrong. I want Happiness, freedom, and be treated as a equal to an equivalent of a friend. Though, going out on the interstate bridge hoping to drop to my death, will be pleasant enough. Seriously, who thinks they were just making a false claim on saying "That excuse is a lie, they won't do that". Well sorry bud, but my parents is something I can't opposed to. I mean like that Sincerely, Cause if no college means no way of pursuing my career just end it, erase my existence it's useless once they made my decision on something they opposed to, they will carry me off to homebound.
