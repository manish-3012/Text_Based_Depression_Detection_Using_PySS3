Torn..I'm torn between making and keeping this post open or just not even writing this. I'm nearly 29. December 10th I'll be 29. I've wanted to die everyday for the past 20 years. It's been my first thought every morning when I wake up. But from 2008 to October 18,2020 I've had a rock. A person. My wife. I thought we were doing good. On october 18 she asked me if she could sleep with someone else and I've never done anything for her sexually. 

After nearly 3 weeks I found out she was lieing and she spent the night at someone's house. Lets call him Dave. Not once but 3 times OVER NIGHT. 

I cant sleep a full night anymore. That night I actually almost did it. I locked myself in the bathroom with my hunting knife. I tried a few spots and then I push it hard against my throat.

It only would have taken a small slip to do the job. But I was scared. I was sitting on the floor while doing this. I looked out the window and asked for ONE reason not to do it. And I was giving it 30 seconds before I did it...

I got to 10 before I stopped and cried for about 15 seconds. That's when my wife busted the door open... She talked me out of it and said nothing happened besides a kiss and they stopped.

She still spends time with him and I've never felt so alone. This week I've only spent one night with her. She's allowing me a female companion.. 

I already know how I will end it. Being a diabetic it can easily be ruled as a death from the diabetes. I'm just waiting for her to say she's leaving me before I do it... Until then I'll just be in crippling pain. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad if i had friends. But I'm always forgotten about. My own mother would rather be drunk in a bar than spend time with her only son.

I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. I'm waving a white flag. Please life stop beating me down I'm not sure I can hold on much longer.
