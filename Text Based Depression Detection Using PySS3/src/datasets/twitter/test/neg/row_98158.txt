I don't know who I am anymoreI fucked up big time. I did a stupid thing and it resulted in me being removed from a group/team that has been my entire life for the past three years. I've invested hundreds of hours of work in this group and made many friendships and had great experiences that changed me. But I messed up. And it's gone. My entire identity, my life, the thing that made me feel like I had a purpose in this world is gone. And all of my friends in it will keep moving on without me, and I'll be left in the dust, watching as the best thing in my life leaves. 

I can't do anything any more. I can't focus on schoolwork, I can't sleep and I'm harsh to the people around me. Every night I just cry and wish I hasn't done what I did to cause this. It's so hard to stay alive. I feel like my entire identity is gone, it's been ripped from me, and I don't know who I am anymore. I am nothing. I have no purpose. No, I don't want to find something new. There is nothing for me, I already threw away by far the best opportunity I had. I can't believe that I did this. I feel like a failure in every aspect. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the effect it would have on my family. I just can't do that. I have a sister and two parents. It would crush them, and I don't want them to feel like I do.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no purpose. I'm no longer inspired to work and learn. Every single night I dream about being killed in some freak accident that wasn't my fault, so it wouldn't hurt my friends and family as much. I can't escape this miserable existential hell. I don't know who I am anymore and I don't think I can find out. I don't want to make a new identity, I can't. It didn't help that I never fit into many places in the first place, except this group. What do I do now? How do I move on and stop these suicidal thoughts? It feels impossible.
