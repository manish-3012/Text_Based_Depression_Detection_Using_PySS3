I have reached a peak in my ever-going quest for self improvement, and the only way is down. Everything I try in life fails, and every time I try to improve I fall back down to my original situation.For a while I have been trying to make myself feel better. I have increased my social experiences greatly, I go to the gym 4-5 days a week, I eat very well, and I get 8 hours sleep every day. I do everything I can to make myself feel better, but nothing works. I have lost all attachment to my goals, and I always return to this low state of depression. I can't make any situation work out in my favor, and most of the things I attempt fail. What is really the point of trying to make yourself feel better if you are in a constant state of depression. Why live a hard life when you are guaranteed to die.
