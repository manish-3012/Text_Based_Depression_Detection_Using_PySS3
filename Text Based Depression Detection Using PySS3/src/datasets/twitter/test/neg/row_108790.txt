I hate meI'm a terrible person. My depression makes me lazy and selfish. My girlfriend nearly broke up with me because of it. And she can't live with me because I've let my depression get the most of me.  I'm so scared of losing her. I'm smothering her. I'm just a bad person. I don't know what I'd do if we broke up. And I know we will break up if I don't get better. I just want to fucking die. I don't know how people get up and do things everyday. I'm moving in with my parents. I just hate everything. I  hate everything.  I hate myself. I don't even hate life. I just hate me. I hate me. I've never even kind of liked me. At best I've tolerated myself.   Nothing is good. Everything is hard. Fuck this. Why try?
