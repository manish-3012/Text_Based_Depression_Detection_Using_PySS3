Iâ€™m too young for thisI think a man killed himself earlier but I just now found the post. I canâ€™t stop crying. Iâ€™m not prepared for this. I didnâ€™t know him at all, I just found his post randomly. I donâ€™t know how to handle whatâ€™s happening. Iâ€™m only 15. Please be alive, I canâ€™t do this. Please know that people WILL MISS YOU. I canâ€™t stop uncontrollably crying since Iâ€™ve read it. Iâ€™ve never cried like this. I canâ€™t stop shivering and shaking. Iâ€™m trying to type this in time to hopefully save somebody but I canâ€™t focus enough. Please donâ€™t do it, it will effect somebody. I just want to know heâ€™s breathing. His mothers gonna find him hanging. If you think nobody will care afterwards, there will be people. Please donâ€™t put them through this, they wonâ€™t be prepared. I canâ€™t express with words how much I need all of you to stay alive, I just canâ€™t handle whatâ€™s happening. Itâ€™s way too much
