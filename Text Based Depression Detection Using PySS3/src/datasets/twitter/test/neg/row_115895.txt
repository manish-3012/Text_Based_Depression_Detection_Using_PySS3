I'm fed upI'm fed up with all this world, it's people, it's shittiness. My plan is for this Sunday and to go with the Sunrise in one of my favorite places. It's been a struggle these last days and getting to it, is going to be a incredible challenged. I almost did it tonight, filled the tub, brought my knife in, ready to go. I don't have any freinds aside from 3 and I had to call twice, if he hadn't picked up the second time, as much as I wouldn't want to hurt my parents and family by dying at home, I'd be gone.

I'm so tired, so sad, so hurt

I'm just done with it all. I wrote my note and it doesn't have any of the contempt in it as I didn't want my parents feeling like I'm angry or whatnot. I just
I just don't know anymore. Help me
because nothings f- working
and I'm so tired and scared and sorry and sad. 

Please.

Cause it's happenening , one way
or another


Edit: nothings fucking worth it anymore, I don't believe or feel I have value worth , matter anything. I'm not contributing, I'm not advancing, I'm dying so might as well just get to the point cause it's not getting better. I'm just dragging this on
