20F Surprised I made it to 18Growing up it's been rough(mental and verbal abuse mostly, some physical), no friends throughout school, birth mom is dead to me + no clue who birth dad is, adopted, 1 twin sister and 1 brother.

Sister and adopted dad did the abuse. Sister called me an ugly fat bitch every day for what seemed like forever...probably would be about 6 months. If one of them started abusing me the other would tag in and make it worse.

Dont want to explain anymore... but it got worse.

My only true escape was listening to music or playing video games. That was the only true time I could truly zone out and be in my own little world. I use to think about killing myself daily... I tried a couple times and got no result.

* One time I posted online I needed to talk to someone because I wanted to no longer live. A few hours later police showed up at the door and my dad and sister found out... they said I didnt have the balls to kill myself and I'm weak.

* Another time I called the cops on my sister because the abuse was so bad and she threatened she was going to kill me if I didnt do it myself. The cops spoke to her and she just shrugged it off and called me a bitch for involving the cops for "something petty".

I moved out at 18...they and some other family had placed bets on how long it would take for me to move back.

I've been moved out 1yr 6 months and I dont regret it.
