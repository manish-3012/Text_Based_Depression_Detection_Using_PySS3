My thoughts eat meMy thoughts eat me

Like a five course meal
I donâ€™t taste good 
They throw me out 
Then puke me up 
And step on me

My thoughts eat me

Not a Michelin meal
I was cooked by a toddler
Thatâ€™s why no one likes me
People act like they do
As with the toddlers sand cake

My thoughts eat me 

I treat no one right 
No one treats me right
I want to die 
Iâ€™m just too scared
I only wish, 
That someone cared
