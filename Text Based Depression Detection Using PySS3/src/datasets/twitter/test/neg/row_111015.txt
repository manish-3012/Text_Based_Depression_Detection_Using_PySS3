Thanks for nothingI thought this was supposed to be a place for support and all the times I've posted very few people offer support. Thanks for showing me that the world and universe doesn't give a shit about me. I've already got a plan that I want to commit to so maybe this is what that sign is. No one cares about me anyway so why am I even typing this.
