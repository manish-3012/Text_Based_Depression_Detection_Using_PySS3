Got discharged from the mental hospitalI posted earlier this week...Sunday I think. I donâ€™t remember. I donâ€™t remember anything from the last two weeks since my doctor cut my meds in half because he thought I was â€œdoing betterâ€. It led to a psychotic break. Now I have a gash down my arm and an intense fear of being left alone. No one knows what happened to me from the time I left work (6:30pm) til I approached a cop, bleeding and holding a handful of pills (10:30pm). 

And Iâ€™m afraid it may happen again.
