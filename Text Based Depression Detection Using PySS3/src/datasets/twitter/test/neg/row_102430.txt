How to get past survival instinctHow do you get past the threshold of your survival instinct?  I want to kill myself. Life just isn't worth living anymore. But every time I pick up a knife or think about shopping for a couple bottles of Tylenol, I can't bring myself to do it. Partly because I'm afraid of what's on the other side. Which is silly because either I have to face it eventually. Partly because I keep holding out hope that things might change, even though if know they won't. And partly because I'm afraid of failure. I don't want to face anyone after being brought back, and have to go through bullshit mandatory therapy to make me lie to myself about life's problems. 

None of my reasons for hesitance involve my friends or family, so if you try to talk me out of it that way, then shove it. My choices are my own, and yeah they'll be sad about said choice. But they'll get over it in time. 

So yeah, how do I push myself to do what must be done to end my misery?
