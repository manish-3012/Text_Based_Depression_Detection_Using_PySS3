Plastic surgery or death?It wasn't long ago that I was a very handsome man but a tragic accident with my mom left me with a broken face.  I spend the last 7 years as someone else and wishing everyday that I could just go back in time and undo the accident.  

My life is gone as far as I know it.  I can no longer attracted girls and form any sort of relationship because of this face.  Being close to 30, I feel like my life is truly over.  

Even with plastic surgery, it wouldn't ever give me my old face back nor do I have enough money for such costly operation.  Every time I stare at myself in the mirror and no longer seeing a face I recognize, it just kills me inside.

What should I do or what would you do?
