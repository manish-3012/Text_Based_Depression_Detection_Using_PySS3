Im ugly inside and outIm a fucking failure. Whatâ€™s the point of even living a mediocre life ? Even my family dont understand why Iâ€™m feeling like this they say I have everything. The thing is Iâ€™m disgusting looking I canâ€™t even look at myself in a mirror. Why canâ€™t I die already ? I know people care about me. And I canâ€™t even self harm anymore. Iâ€™m constantly crying for no reason. I hate my useless worthless ugly self and I donâ€™t want to live everyday of my life seeing my miserable face. People who care about me they donâ€™t even care or at least they wonâ€™t care long. I want to disappear and nobody remembering me. Iâ€™m a worthless human being not even good to look at and not talented. A lot of people have it way worse and Iâ€™m still complaining which makes me even more pathetic. I hope today itâ€™ll work.
