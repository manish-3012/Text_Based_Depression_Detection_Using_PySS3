19/m i have a really important exam in 1 month and i think i will end it if it doesnt go as plannedThey say this exam is not everything but it is to me right now.Ä°t is the golden ticket to my freedom.Ä° have had suicidal thoughts since i was 14 but it started to be stronger in the last month.
For the record,Ä° do not want to die.Ä° think i have a lot to live for but as i said it is all connected to that fucking exam.
Right now im trying to focus on studying and not thinking about it but its hard.
Ä° have been listening to this song for a week and i think it helps a bit.sharing it in case it helps anyone.i will post the results in a month or two.dont die on me until then.
