Canâ€™t die because Iâ€™ll traumatise those around meI donâ€™t want my parents to have to handle my dead body in any way, I donâ€™t want to damage my siblings, parents and friends beyond repair. Iâ€™ve seen what death and suicide does to people and I just canâ€™t do that to them but thereâ€™s nothing left for me. Iâ€™m just a shell at this point.
