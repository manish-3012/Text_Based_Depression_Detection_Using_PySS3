Killing myself todayIt's over. My suicide note is done. 
Tonight, I'll be free. Free from emotion, free from the self hatred. Free from everything. I'm almost done with my will. My brain is trying one last time to survive. Look for help one more time. Please. That's what it says.

On August 16th I felt the first stroke of pain. I was born coddled. School was no issue. But then I went there. To the STEMM Academy. By September 13th, I had my first thought of death. I kept hidden. When I told my parents about my feelings, they told me the same old thing, "Suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem." My problem didn't go away. Then, I got really irritated when my teacher might as well spit in my face. She told the whole class that teen suicide was caused by them thinking the little things are big. But now, it makes sense. I give up. I've been fighting this war too long. I've left STEMM, but the echos of pain still ruin me.

Please help me. In truth, I don't want to die, all I ever want is for the pain to end.

I'm weak, and I know it. I'm a coward. I've given it my all to survive. But I no longer have my old strength and support
