Maybe it's time for me to go.I got home from work tonight. Nothing bad happened today, but I still felt terrible. After all, I dropped out of college recently. I'm living with my parents. I haven't talked to any of my friends for a couple months, and they've stopped trying to contact me. Everything's fucked.

Dad asked me how work went. 

"Fine."

He asked me what I was doing tomorrow.

"...Why?"

"I just want to know." he says.

"But *why*?"

"Can't I ask you one damn question without you treating it like a fucking inquisition? Jesus..."

"..."

"Well, what are you doing tomorrow? Do you have work?"

"...why do you keep asking me that?"

"Because I'm your Dad?? And because I care about you."

"...have you been drinking again?"

"Why the fuck would you ask me that?"

"You never ask me what I'm doing unless you want me to do something for you, or if you're drunk."

"...you little shit. I *never* want to hear that again. *Never*."

"..."

"You hear me?"

"..."

"Why do you fight me?"

"...I wasn't fighting you."

"Don't tell me that. Don't you *fucking* tell me that. You always make me the bad guy. You always assume that I'm out to get you. Guess who's been paying for this new house the last few months? Me. Guess who hasn't charged you for rent for A YEAR??? Me. Guess who cleans the kitchen while you're down there in the fuckin' basement playing videogames?"

"You never ask me to help you!"

"Because I shouldn't have to, dammit!! You're a grown man. You pull your fuckin' weight! Don't play dumb with me."

"...I'm done playing that stupid passive-aggressive game of waiting for you to ask me to help. Grow up."

"...WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!"

"..."

"SHUT. YOUR. DAMN. MOUTH!!!"

"..."

"This is MY house."

"..."

Dad gets up from his chair. He walks over to me. He looks me in the eyes. I wait for him to start yelling, but something odd happens.

"Why...why do you do this, Lucas?"

He's crying.

"Why do you fight me?"

I look down at my feet.

"Why did you stop going to school?...Your mom and I just wanted you to succeed...and now you're..."

"...what?"

"You're not the person I thought you would be."

At this point, Dad can't even speak anymore. He walks up the stairs slowly, still sobbing. 

I don't know if he was drunk. I don't know if it matters. I heard what he said, and I heard the pain in his voice. I saw the disappointed look on his face. I almost wish he would've just stayed angry. It would have been easier to deal with.

I tried to stop thinking about what happened. I watched a movie on my laptop. I played assassin's creed for a little while. But the pain didn't go away. The words still echoed in my mind.

"You're not the person I thought you would be."

I can see the road ahead. College dropout. No degree. Crappy apartment. Barely getting by. Ashamed to see my family. Long lonely nights. 

There's no light at the end of that tunnel. It's over. Now's a good stopping point. I need to end this before I disappoint more people in my life. Mom's already grieving. Acting like I've died or something. Maybe I just need to finish the job.
