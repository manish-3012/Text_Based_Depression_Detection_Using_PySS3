I finally have no reason to liveI woke up feeling very depressed this morning.

I realized now that there is nothing for me to look forward to. I really don't. Everyone tells me that nothing lasts. Sadness doesn't last. For fuck's sake, it's been lasting several years and I am so fucking tired of it.

I'm here in bed. My eyes are sore. I lost 16 lbs in a week (I'm 116 lbs.) My place is a mess. I just don't care anymore. I had a breakup but I've accepted it more or less.

What is hard to accept is losing someone who knows me well, who I can talk to for hours. I shouldn't be dependent on him but our conservations were meaningful and delightful. 

It's not the same with other people. For Christ sake, don't tell me to move on because I will move on my own time.

Right now, I'm in bed. I've known what I wanted to do. I'm not sure if I'm ready. I haven't written a note. I don't know what to write.

"I love you"
"I'm sorry"
"I'll be in a better place"
"I won't be suffering anymore"
"You don't have to worry about me"
"I won't be a burden again"
"I will love you always"

It hurts too much. Every minute. It's excruciating. Fuck it hurts too much.

It's excruciating because I miss the people I care about. Friends I've lost. Recent events relating to sexual assault. I have friends over the phone but it's not the same in-person. 

For you, M, who may or may not read this post. I reach out to you because I wanted a friend. You told me you will be the shoulder I could cry on. An ear. You're busy. I know. You said you will and you aren't.

I don't desire to kill myself over you. I desire to kill myself because of everything that is combined.
