I am so tiredLike everyone on this sub. I am so tired. Tired of trying, tired of putting on a happy face, tired of PRETENDING, Iâ€™m a raw ball of nerve endings occasionally covered by an alcohol soluble scab  Itâ€™s 2 and i have the internet to reach out to, that is so just me. I own all the decisions that brought me here. I own the lack of friendship that drives me to listen to music in the dark at 2 am with no outlet for the sadness just that rules me. I own all of this and the bag is just too heavy
