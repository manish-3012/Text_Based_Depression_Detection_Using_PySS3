so numb. something is missingI am not sad or angry or happy. I a numb and floating through life. So very apathetic. I donâ€™t want to be numb anymore, but itâ€™s not like itâ€™s a choice. Drugs and sex and binge eating, cutting and drinking, it all fills the void for a little bit, but afterwards I feel sick and empty. This cycle repeats and has been repeating for years. I have done everything to be a better person. I have done it all. The therapy, the meds, the better coping mechanisms. I am now convinced that â€œwaiting it outâ€ is the only option. 

I am not going to try and kill myself anymore, but if a bus hit me I wouldnâ€™t be too sad. 

How can I continue on? Why are we even here? Is life even worth living? Every time I tell myself yes, I know I am lying.
