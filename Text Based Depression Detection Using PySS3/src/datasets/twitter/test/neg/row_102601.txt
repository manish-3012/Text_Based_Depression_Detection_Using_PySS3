Sometimes I wish my loved ones stopped loving me so I could die without hurting themHey there, hope you guys are fine.

I have been suicidal since I was 14 or something like that and I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and agoraphobia for a while, with better and worse moments. 

At this point I think that I would never be able to completely eliminate those mental problems. It has always been the same, for years: some horrible months, then a painful recovery through a big amount of medication and therapy, then a month of happiness, and start again. It's a circle in which I have been trapped for a while and I think that I will be here forever.

I have always resisted the temptation of killing myself because of other people: my parents, my friends, my partners. Now I only have my girlfriend and I don't want her to suffer, but I have had enough. Maybe I could break up with her and then do it, it's something that I have been thinking these days. 

Life has always been painful for me. Therapy doesn't help me and medication doesn't always work. I don't even want to meet anyone else because I'm a disaster, everyone who stays near me suffers. 

People say that I'm not trying, and they are right, I'm not trying because I don't want to keep fighting a losing battle. I have given up. I'm 27, I never thought that I could reach this age, so living for so long is already an accomplishment for me. Now I don't care about what's next. Heaven, reincarnation, nothing at all... I don't care, I just want to end this suffering.

Sorry for the negativity. I need to vent, I guess.
Anyways, stay safe.

And sorry for my broken English.
