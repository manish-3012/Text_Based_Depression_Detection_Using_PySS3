I'm so so very tired.I am born poor with 2 hardworking parents and a sister. I always  have an inferiority complex about my situation.
Was bullied in school when i was young and maybe that's why I am a dick to others. I don't know how to show affection even at 23.

Managed to get into university and fall in love. But my grades is now just passing, lowest among anyone i know. Turns out I am an emotionally abusive boyfriend, I really hate myself. My self destructive tendency just destroys everything. Girl left.

I am tired everyday, on the verge of giving up. I plan to do charcoal suicide this weekend. I do not have passion for what I am doing now. It's just a grind with no reward, I'm so done. If I am born alone and gonna die alone, I choose to end now.

I know how stupid and irrational this is, but i just can't take it anymore. I'm not even the emotional type. Strange, i'm looking forward to ending it.
