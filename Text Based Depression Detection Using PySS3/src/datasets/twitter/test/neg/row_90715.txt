I have a doctor appointment set up for next week but I dont know if I'll make itI know this is ridiculous. In a week, I'm going to see a GP for depression and anxiety, but my suicidal thoughts have increased in intensity. This week I have been planning, making suicide notes, and amassing all the materials I need in order to commit suicide. I want to do it so much, and I was going to do it today, but things came up, and I have to stay at school.
