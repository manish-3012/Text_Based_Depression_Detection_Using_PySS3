It feels like Iâ€™m flirting with destinyIâ€™ve never in my life been able to envision myself getting old. I canâ€™t even see myself making into middle age years, the image just cannot conjure into my mind. I made attempts as a teenager, as a young adult, made a few quite serious and nearly successful attempts last year, and I feel like my next is upcoming quite soon. I hate the cycle. Which attempt is finally going to succeed? Why do I have to keep going through this cycle of highs and lows and false hopes that everything will get better? If I were to write down all my whys on paper, surely Iâ€™ve been through enough already. Surely I have enough reasons already. Surely I have given life enough tries already, Iâ€™ve gone to therapy, Iâ€™ve found a semi successful combination of medications, I improved my life... maybe I just wasnâ€™t meant to be. I donâ€™t know why I keep fighting my own fate.
