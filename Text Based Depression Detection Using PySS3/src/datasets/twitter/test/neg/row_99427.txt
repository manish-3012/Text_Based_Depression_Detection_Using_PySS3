Ive messed up life and there is no way out.I have been depressed all my life. I have taken every wrong turn possible out of want of being alone. 
Ive turned to alcohol. It has stopped working. I hate everything about myself and every decision i have ever made. 
I want to die in peace but I have so many lies out there I am afraid to.
