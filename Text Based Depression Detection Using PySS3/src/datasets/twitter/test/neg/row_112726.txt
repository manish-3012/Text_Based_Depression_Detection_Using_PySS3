Have nothing in common with anyonejust noticed this. Why I donâ€™t have any lifelong friends from elementary or middle school like everyone else does, or why I never had a boyfriend from my hometown of state. I donâ€™t have the same humor, mindset, hobbies or interests of these fucking people but I wonâ€™t conform to them either. Donâ€™t even sound like any of them. Living in the Bay Area makes it even worse cause thereâ€™s this new cancer generation of tech assholes over here. Everyoneâ€™s the same..fake
Never felt comfortable here and now itâ€™s below fucking 0 
Want to kill myself, Iâ€™m never getting out of here
