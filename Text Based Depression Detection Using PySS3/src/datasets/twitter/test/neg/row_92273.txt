I have always found comfort in knowing that if I fuck up and everything goes to hell I can always kill myself as an escapeWelp, I have fucked up and things are going to hell. I can't see how anything will get better. 18 years old "so I have the whole life in front of me" as I'm often told. No passions, no skills, no friends (don't want any, but at the same time I don't want to be alone, I don't even know), no grades, no hobbies, nothing. I don't want this life, especially not the whole thing.
