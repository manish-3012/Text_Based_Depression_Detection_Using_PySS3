Have until tomorrow to pay rent or I'm evicted, not sure I have it me to struggle to get through this.So jealous of people who seem to get through life without much struggle and strife. My entire life is suffering. Everything is difficult and for what? I have no family, so significant other, and no passions. Having a hard time thinking of why I should not just take the easy way out. It wouldnt make me special, considering thousands and thousands of people each year in this country go this route.

If I had the cash I'd definitely get a gun so that i could just get it over with.
