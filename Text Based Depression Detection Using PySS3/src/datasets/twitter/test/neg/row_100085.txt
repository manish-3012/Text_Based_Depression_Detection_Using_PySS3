Why is life so fucked up?Where did we come from and why the fuck are we here? Why do we have to deal with pain, suffering, loneliness,fear, guilt etc? What is the point in all this when we all die in the end anyway? 

Does anyone else feel like theyâ€™re in some kind of fucked up video game being controlled by someone who just wants to see you suffer? 

Iâ€™m so fucked up right now thinking about this world and I just want out.
