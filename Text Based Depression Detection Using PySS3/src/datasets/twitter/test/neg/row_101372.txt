Suicidal ideation and the pains of logical thinkingI know my life has been good. I've always been the kind of person who strongly believed that damage is a learning experience and that mistakes are tools for growth. Usually pretty optimistic the kind of person who sought out life and wanted to experience it. 

I'm a 24yo female but within the last 4 months I've become depressed, I've started having suicidal thoughts. Suicidal feelings, like this itch that needs to be scratched. Like I could just take a razor to the wrist or hang myself. And I tear up and cry because I don't t love life anymore, and nothings gone wrong in my life I haven't been able to handle. I feel stupid for feeling this way I know I have it so good compared to so many but I still hurt.  I hate myself, I dont enjoy anything anymore.

I spend my days laying in bed. No phone, no laptop just starting at the ceiling trying to remind myself of my mother sister father and boyfriend who would all be traumatized to see me go. I fanatize about it constantly I can't hold attention to anything anymore. I'm on medications now its been just over 6 weeks but I feel like they aren't helping. 

I need coping strategies I'm afraid I'll go through with it, my doctor doesn't take me seriously because I've never self harmed, I also dont have any addiction problems. But I'm a perfectionist and once I have a plan I know I'll go through with it. 
Please someone tell me how to cope. I dont know what to do,I'm scared, and embarrassed.
