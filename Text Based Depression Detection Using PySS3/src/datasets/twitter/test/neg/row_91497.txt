need a reason to livei've been pretty suicidal for awhile and it's been getting progressively worse. the frequency and severity of my thoughts are getting worse and i feel pretty helpless tbh. i've tried reaching out to people about it, and everyone always tells me the same thing: that committing suicide is selfish and i need to think about the effect it would have on my family and friends. but this just makes me even more upset and even mad because i feel like they're just guilt tripping me into living? i feel like i don't have any reasons to live for MYSELF anymore. i'm sick of living for other people because of how my death would affect them. what about me? why can't i do just this one thing for myself in my life? i need a reason to live that isn't just about others, but about myself. and i can't find any.
