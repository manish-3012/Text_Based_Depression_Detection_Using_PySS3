AloneI just feel so alone like no one wants to be around me and I know may people have bigger things going on in their lives but I always feel so second fiddle in everything I do, i Never feel like myself I donâ€™t know if I ever will and I feel like I will never be ever to hold true relationships will anyone ever like me? Do I even like myself I spend most of my days skipping classing smoking nic, taking the random pills that I save up and laying half passed out on my bathroom floor my motivation since weâ€™ve started online school has plummeted, how people see me in their lives I realize is little to none like with each passing day I realize I mean nothing to no one and I just get so close to just ending it all as each day moves forward
