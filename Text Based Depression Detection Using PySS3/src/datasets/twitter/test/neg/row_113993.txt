God I wish I couldI wish I was lucky. I wish my parents didn't care. I wish my grandpa didn't care. I'm sure if they were in my situation they'd understand and let me, but how can I explain to them that I have to die? The world is truly better off without me, most others see it, but they don't because they knew me when I wasn't a horrible person.
