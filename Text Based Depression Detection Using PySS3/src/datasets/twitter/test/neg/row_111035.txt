Thanks for all the motivation from multiple throwaways.Honestly, I mean it. Its the end of the road. I am trying to ruin all relationships so people aren't as sad when I pass. I have everything planned out. You may think you failed, but you guys helped prolong the inevitable. Thank you for giving me extra motivation to make it through these last couple months.
