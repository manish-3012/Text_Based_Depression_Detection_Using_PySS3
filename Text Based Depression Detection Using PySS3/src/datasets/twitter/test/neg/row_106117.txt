I want to suicide...I don't know....I feel so distant from everything....

Don't have any friends... don't have a caring family... don't have any interest in anything....always dreaming about something which makes me happy.

I dwell in paranoia every second..I feel like a failure...I feel like a lost child in an adult's world.

Everyone else is doing well in their lives but I'm just stuck up at one place, for 10 years. And I don't want it to disappear, yet can't find any way to cope up with it....

Feeling so suicidal nowadays....even pointing a knife towards my wrist sometimes...or thinking of ways to self-harm.

Just venting here cause I don't vent in real life...or to people I chat with regularly.
