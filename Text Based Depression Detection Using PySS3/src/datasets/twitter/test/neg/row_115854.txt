Holidays are the worst.Not that I donâ€™t want others to be happy, but for some reason seeing everyone laughing, having fun, &amp; just actually... *living* reminds me of how empty life is for people like me and how much *I* have trouble living. Iâ€™m feeling the worst today and itâ€™s only the *beginning* of the holidays.
