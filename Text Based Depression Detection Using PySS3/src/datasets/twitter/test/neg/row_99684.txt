This is a first for me.I truly cannot believe I'm even posting on this sub. I always thought no matter how bad it got I would never let suicidal thoughts seriously enter my mind but it seems that it's happened anyways. You think that if you take the time to better your own life that the depression will eventually go away but it's all a fucking joke. I know if I actually went through with it, it would destroy my family and friends. But my parents are already dying. My sister has always been incredibly depressed and throughout my childhood after seeing her attempts to kill herself,  I said I would NEVER do that to the people in my life.  And yet here we are. The only difference between us is that if I actually go through with it,  I will not fail. 

 Happiness is one big practical joke,  love is a lie,  and peaceful thoughts are artificial.  My normal self,  my old self,  can only be seen in flashes when I am not sober.
