I canâ€™t take anymore of this mental torture :(Iâ€™m so sad and pathetic right now that I canâ€™t even muster up the energy to write out whatâ€™s led me to this point. I even made this reddit account to post this because I just wanted to get help but like I said, Iâ€™m so unmotivated that I canâ€™t put it into words. Just know that my social anxiety has ruined my life for years now and I just wish I could get rid of it. Iâ€™m seriously considering killing myself to just get rid of this mental assault I have to go through everyday of my horrible existence. 

Thatâ€™s all I have to say for now. 

I hope everyone on this reddit page gets the help they need soon including myself 

Iâ€™m sorry if I didnâ€™t do this all right this is my first time using reddit :(
