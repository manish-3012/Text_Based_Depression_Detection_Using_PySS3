I want it to endI really donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Iâ€™m just going through the motions with life, I hate my job, Iâ€™m always alone, Iâ€™m just trying to get through each day and Iâ€™m exhausted. I canâ€™t find the energy to do anything at all and I canâ€™t find the point in living anymore. I keep trying to find a why but there is none. Everyone says it will get better but after more than a decade heading that you just realize it doesnâ€™t get better. There are occasionally days that are better than the rest but 99% are just like a robot carrying out instructions. I canâ€™t feel anything good anymore. I just want it to end I canâ€™t do this anymore
