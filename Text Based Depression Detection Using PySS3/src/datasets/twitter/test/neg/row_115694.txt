I'm done with this constant fighting from the most insignificant thingsI'm so done. I fight constantly with my mother from the most stupid things. There's not a day that goes by without her trying to argue just for the sake of arguing.

Online school has me stressed enough and her trying to have me even more stressed and getting upset just so she can get upset's bringing me to my tipping point, I'm so done.

My grandmother called me yesterday to berate me as well. Now, the both of them stopped talking to me and my mom is doing a lot of petty things to inconvenience me even more...

God I just wanna end it all and be done with this quarantine, fights, online school, tests and all that. I get the constant feeling no one here likes me. My birthday's this month and I'll be stuck with my parents.
