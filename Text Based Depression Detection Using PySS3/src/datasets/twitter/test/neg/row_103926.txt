ConfusedLast Saturday, I finally got fed up with life completely and attempted to kill myself. I ended up spending 2 days in the hospital and surviving. I've read multiple suicide stories where they say they instantly regret it but I don't feel any regret. Is this normal? I want to get better and feel better, but while I felt like I was about to finally die, I actually felt the best I'd felt in so long.Â
