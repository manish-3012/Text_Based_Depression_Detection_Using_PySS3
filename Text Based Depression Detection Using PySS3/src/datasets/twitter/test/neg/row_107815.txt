Never enough.Why am I never enough? It's like nothing is good enough. I used to think it was about my parent's, that I needed their approval. But it's me. Why? I know I'm doing great, but why don't I feel like it? I'm smarter than enough. I'm kinder than enough. But why do I feel like I have to look like others to be enough? Why do I feel like I have to have a skinny body or an hourglass figure? I never though insecurities about my appearance could take such a toll on my heart, but it does. These thoughts follows me constantly, to the point where looking at myself in the mirror fills me with anger. I'm hideous. I'm just not enough, and I don't know how to get rid of this feeling. I can't even describe it? I get angry, I feel trapped, I scratch and try to pull at my skin, put my hands around my ugly neck. Why?
