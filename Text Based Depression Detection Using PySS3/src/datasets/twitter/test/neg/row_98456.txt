I wish I got sick so people would feel bad for me and not be mean to me.I have suicidal ideation because I hate myself and I wish I was normal. I cry about everything and I cry multiple time a day and I dry in school and my mom yells at me for crying and tells me to make contact and that I look special and why am so wierd which only makes me cry more and it's all my fault and I put myself in this situation. I have no friends besides one's that went to college and are too busy to talk to me or ignore me I have tons of good aquatiences but none of them like me. Mostly I am really ugly and I'll never be able to fix it. My hair is disgusting and curly and looks like it's a ears nest to matter how much time I spend on it and my mom says its bad until she does it. I don't know how to wear makeup and anytime I ask they just tell me to use a YouTube video but I'm too uncoordinated to do any of it. I already have wrinkles at 17 which is enough to kill myself because it will only get worse. I am anemic so Im rupulsively pale but I also have terrible acne even after Accutane. Im way to short and fat even though I can't lose any more weight even when I log everything because at 120 I look like a whale because my face is round. Im really hairy but I already know I'm ugly so I just get bullied for not shaving my legs but I don't even care anymore. I am supposed to go to college this fall but I know I wouldnt make any friends because I'm moving to a hick town  and all of the dorm mate ads are pretty girls who say you need to go to church with them or weeaboos. I'm not saying any of these people are wrong just that they won't like me because I am too wierd. I stopped watching wrestling so my mom would like me more but all I care about now is obscure worthless stuff. This isn't even the tip of the iceberg I just needed to vent because I was feeling really close to it which is even more stupid because absolutely nothing is wrong in my life I'm just worthless even though I everything is fine for me and every body thinks Im happy because it's all my fault.
