...help?I am really fighting the urge to either go ahead and kill myself or to just leave. I've given at an honest effort the past few weeks to exercise, think positively etc. and it's not doing jack shit. I just don't see the point to put in an effort anymore and I'm about two seconds away from draining my bank accounts (which is a very minimal amount) and just driving to wherever I end up and just forget the world for as long as possible. I'm sure I would wander back home eventually but who knows when.
Also, I can't get my suicidal thoughts out of my head and it is really tempting to follow through with it at this point. I have it planned out perfectly for hundreds of situations so that I will actually reach my goal next time and not scar any family members. I just don't know what to do.
I will be on for at least the next 5 hours so AMA or give advice please.
tl;dr 2 seconds away from just driving off or suicide.

EDIT: I was talked down. At least for the time being.
