Should I talk about it?I know the obvious answer is yes. But I plan on going before Saturday.


Saturday is my boyfriends birthday, he passed away two months ago, he was in a hospital and was going to be therefor some time, he was very vocal about not wanting to spend his birthday alone there. I donâ€™t want him to spend his birthday alone. And I donâ€™t want to live without him any way.


So now, I was gonna do it tomorrow, so I spent the afternoon with my parents, and after doing that I feel like I should talk to them about it, let them know I plan to do it. But I really want to do it before Saturday and I donâ€™t want them to get in the way. What do I do?
