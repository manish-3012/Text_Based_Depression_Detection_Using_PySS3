I want to kill myself... but not die?This is really weird

So, I am a 13 year old male, I'll say that now. I didn't come here for attention, nor for a bunch of people to say "Nooo suicide is bad! Don't do it you've got so much to live for!" 

I am in a very confusing situation. I've been depressed for 2 and a half years. My stepdad attacked me, I'm always negative, my mum seemed to hate me and told me she was "f***king sick of living with me" always swore and shouted at me constantly. Moved to my dads as a change/ fresh start. I have siblings here I get on better with than at my mums, but I'm still not that close. I've had no friends for years, I contemplate suicide daily. I just stopped cutting but its hard. I dont get pleasure from things anymore. I never have any energy or anything. My dad knows and he wants me to get counselling and anti depressants. (Suicide also runs in my family, my dad attempted, my uncle did twice and my auntie three times, as well as my cousin self harming and being really depressed for years) And so many times I've been that close to doing it. But I don't want to die- I want things to change. But it feels like they never will. I've given up. It's very confusing. I get bullied at school and told to kill myself all the time. I get that high school relationships are pointless and mean nothing, but it would be nice to not be the only one in my form to not have been asked out. Mainly because everyone hates me. Sorry, I'm rambling here, I just don't know what to do.
