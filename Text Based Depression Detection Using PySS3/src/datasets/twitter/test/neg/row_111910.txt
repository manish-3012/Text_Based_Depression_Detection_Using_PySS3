I ruined my relationship of eight years for a man who decided he didn't want me, and I realise now that I have no one and deserve nothing and I am spirallingI am normally a very stable person with a lot to live for.  I threw it all away on an affair that lasted two years.  I moved away, knowing I needed to end it.  It continued anyway.  He woke up one day and decided he needed to decide between me and his girlfriend.  He chose his girlfriend.  I cut him off.  He told me he wanted to make me his wife and have a family, and now he doesn't want me.  It hurts, and I am confused.  I never should have let him suck me into this -- it was wrong and a non-starter all along.  

I have tried to move on so many times from this affair to focus on my relationship with my boyfriend of eight years, become the girlfriend he deserves, but couldn't dig deep enough.  The lies kept getting in the way of a healthy recovery for my real relationship.  I couldn't fake it any longer.  I told my boyfriend a week ago that I have been unfaithful to him.  He left today to spend a couple weeks with family.  Understandable.  I need to give him space to figure out what he wants to do.  I want to make it work, from a place of total honesty.  He might not want to.  He might end it, and we would both have to start again.  That should be okay, should be something I can deal with and handle.

Deep down, I wonder if I will ever be able to experience that kind of connection and passion that I had in my affair ever again.  I haven't before, and it feels like I won't ever again.  I want to address this with counseling and not seek to replace it, but find a healthy way to handle it, if my boyfriend decides he wants to stay.  But I wonder if all the pieces you are supposed to have in a relationship, including the physical, will ever fall into place with my boyfriend.

I have been trying to read articles and seek support.  I have told one friend about this, but she had just recently gotten out of a bad relationship situation and finally rounded a corner, and it's Saturday night and I know she is probably enjoying time with her family.  I could call my mom.  I don't want to burden my friend or my mom.  There is no one I can talk to, and I would be a burden to everyone.  I feel like the logical conclusion is that I really only have one person in this world, and I hurt him so much that it might be irreparable.  I don't deserve him.  Can I really engage in this or any other future relationship, knowing what a terrible person I am?  How could I trust myself, much less ask someone else to trust me, knowing that I am a cheater?  I feel so dirty and horrible, and so disappointed in myself.  It feels like everyone would be better off without me.

I don't know how to proceed, but I found myself thinking of ending it.  It's kind of the logical conclusion.  This is not a normal reaction for me, and it has freaked me out a lot.
