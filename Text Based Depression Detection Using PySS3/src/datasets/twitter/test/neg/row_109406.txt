I have trouble losing weight, and it makes me want to dieI'm very energetic, and I barely eat, but I'm still over 200 pounds. I know it's my fault for being such a lazy pig to even get there, and I deserve to be ridiculed, but I just can't lose weight. I know the only way to lose weight is diet and exercise, and all other methods are BS, but I diet and exercise, and I still can't lose weight. I'm just a fat loser. I'm better off dead.
