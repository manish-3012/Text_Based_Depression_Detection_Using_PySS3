Why do I have to live?This is truly a quality of life question. If we euthanize animals when we question the quality of life they will be able to achieve.... why am I some kind of selfish monster for wanting to die? I am a burden on society and a vampire of energy and resources. I live a sad excruciating life that feels no happiness. I canâ€™t think of a time in my entire life I was happy and Iâ€™m 30 years old now.

I am so sad. All the time. Iâ€™ve been this way as long as I can remember. My earliest memory is me wailing about how I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I was 4 years old. I know my brain is broken. Maybe I was dropped as a baby, my brain might be starved of dopamine or serotonin or something. I am on medication that allows me to get out of bed and somewhat maintain a job but for what? It doesnâ€™t take away the feeling.

The only way I can describe how it feels is like walking around skinned alive, all of the nerves raw and exposed, while everyone else has skin. And you have to pretend youâ€™re not on fire and try and act like a normal person. They say to distract yourself with things you like, but can you enjoy your favorite tv show when you have a migraine? The pain is too constant and too distracting. 

Itâ€™s the shell shocked numb feeling after someone you love dies. A constant ringing in the ears and your throat feels like your screaming but youâ€™re just standing there silent and staring. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m under water and everyone else is just normal in air. 

I have constant intrusive thoughts. I am exhausted. It never ends. The reasons people tell me not to kill myself donâ€™t make sense to me.  Things donâ€™t get better, and if they were they will still also get bad again too. The people in my life would be devastated... am I really supposed to continue living just for other people? Iâ€™m sad 1,000% of the time, but I canâ€™t kill myself because then people might have to also feel sad for part of their time? 

Why do I have to live constantly fighting this uphill losing battle? Why do I have to live as Sisyphus, when others donâ€™t? Sometimes I wonder if this really is hell. If Iâ€™m damned or demonically possessed. I wish for death every day, because then I could rest without everyone hating me and calling me cowardly. 

The only thing that helps with this buzzing is pain. I self harm in ways I hope people wonâ€™t notice because it brings me so much shame. I pull penny sized chunks of hair out, cut my thighs, burn myself with lighters, beat the back of my head until I feel quiet and numb, and that is the closest to peace I feel Iâ€™ve found. 

Iâ€™ve tried therapy, Iâ€™ve tried devoting my life to service and goodness, exercise and yoga. Iâ€™ve tried escaping into books and games. Iâ€™ve tried support groups and churches. Mindfulness doesnâ€™t help, it just makes me mindful that my body is constantly physically going through the sensations of a panic attack. 

The only relationships I have donâ€™t feel genuine because if I were myself I would truly be a drain all the time. I put my energy into masking and making other people feel good because thatâ€™s what relationships are supposed to be. But if I even slightly start talking about how I really feel about things people become disturbed and upset. When people try and cheer me up I pretend it worked even though it never does and often makes me feel worse because I know I SHOULD feel better. 

Is life really just supposed to be performative? You do your song and dance for the benefit of other people and never yourself? Existence for other people makes sense. They can dance and sing for themselves, there are good times and bad times, they experience joy and want, they have quality of life. But if Iâ€™ll never have those things because my brain is missing an important piece, why must I keep chugging along?
