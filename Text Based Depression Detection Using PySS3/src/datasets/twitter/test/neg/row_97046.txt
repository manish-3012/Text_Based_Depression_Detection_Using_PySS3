I'm completely ruined.I drink too much. I fucked cheated on my ex and I am the most miserable person in the world anymore. I finally started thinking about this again and I'm not even using a throwaway. I don't know what to do. I ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. I am never getting over this. I'm completely self destructive at this point. I'm useless. I don't know what to fucking do anymore. I'm never going to stop thinking about her. I bet she may be reading this. She knows my reddit account. If she is, I'm beyond sorry. I don't know what else to say. It's all my fucking fault and every single goddamn fucking day I live with it. It sucks and it's all my fault. If I ever do it I'm leaving my keys to my apartment on her front porch with a note so the animals will be ok. I don't know what else to do. I want to fucking stab myself sometimes. I have this apartment and it NEVER feels like home and it NEVER will and everything will feel awful for as long as I'm there. I'm in such a bad place. I don't wanna be this way. I don't want to have these thoughts. Why can't I be fucking normal? Why can't I do normal shit? What is WRONG with me? I fucking hate myself. I dont know how much longer I can endure this. Every single day waking up feeling miserable and regretting every choice I make. Fuck. Fucking fuck fuck fuck.
