life is trashI am at the point where I literally just wish I didnâ€™t exist. I donâ€™t want to kill myself or hurt anyone I love. But I feel like maybe everyone would be better off if I didnâ€™t exist. I am far too weak to deal with the day to day bullshit that I endure. I am so unhappy. I wish I could just disappear. Maybe go into a coma for a long time and then wake up and everything be okay. I love my parents and my sister and I would never want to see them hurting. But my life just feels so hard. I feel like I have the world on my shoulders. Is it really worth it to push through?
