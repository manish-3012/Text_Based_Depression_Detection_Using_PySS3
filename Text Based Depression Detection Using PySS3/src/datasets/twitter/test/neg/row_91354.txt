My life and choices are a mistakeI'm sitting here bawling my eyes out at another fucking fight with my Ma and stepdad. I'm broken, I just moved back in with my parents after a nasty separation and soon divorce from my wife. I got married to early and way to young. 

I'm fucked up mentally, I'm so godamn ugly that I can't look people in the eye, I don't enjoy getting haircuts because of my nonexistent hairline, and I'm overweight as hell. I have crippling social anxiety, to the point where I interact with no one other than my current family. I shake and twitch when I'm close to people and I get made fun off for it. It's made work hard and I'm always looked as retarded and sad.

I was with my wife for a short time, she fucked me over and used me, and I ducked up by threatening her and her family in angry texts, she's broken me and now might possibly file harassment charges.

My family situation is a lot worse, my mother is with this real POS who threatens to beat me and kick me out every day.

And I don't see a future for me, I'm ridiculed every single day for how I look and act, and I'm honestly starting to believe I'm retarded with how I think and act, I feel like I can't function right and just always feel alone.
