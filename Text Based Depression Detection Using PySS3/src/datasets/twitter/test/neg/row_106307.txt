I want to go before my son does , very very very long wall of txt, so sorry :(I have thought about posting this for months, I have struggled with doing this in fear of what would be said to me or about me, I havent had the best experiences with some of reddit, I have met some WONDERFUL PEOPLE, and I am very thankful for that, but I have also met some very very MEAN people, saying some very very nasty things about my son, about me, and accusing me of things that I havent done, or my motivations for things I do.. but I have felt this way for so long I just have to get this off my chest  and I thought about doing it on a throw away, I am at the point where I just dont care what others see or think about me.

 I am bi polar and going through something NO ONE ever should have to go through.

 My 3 year old son is terminal, I have some desions to make that I dont know the answers too, and its so so hard. He needs surgery that constists of brain, brain stem, and spinal cord, and skull surgery. The worst part of it all, his survival rate is at about 5% , BUT if I dont do it, he can live a few more years but will just fall one day to the ground to never breath again, everyday I pray is not that day. Do you know how scary it is to watch your child and wonder what you are going to do when that happens, will he be in my arms?, will he be playing?, will he be asleep, and the worst one of my fears, will I be alone when it happens? That one right there I am sooooo terrified of, I have a fiance but he is always at work, we have alot of bills and alot of responisblity for my son that normal people dont. I dont know how to write, I have never been good at this, I am sorry I am just trying to explain this as best I can. My son has already had skull surgery at 3 mo old, we almost lost him when he was born, AND during that surgery. He has alot of different medical problems too, He has 3 ASD's of the heart ( he needs surgery for that too) , absent left kidney that the tubes are narrowing on, closed hole spinal bifida, fluid pocket on his spine that is growing, craniostensenosis ( sp? I can never spell it right) they are pretty sure he is autistic, failure to thrive, cleft palate , recessed jaw, along with the closing around his brain stem, the brain stem is coming detached from the brain and spinal cord, and he is missing 4 vertebrae on his spine, and it is narrowing . There are MANY surgeries he needs, the odds are so against him. I am scared shitless, and I dont know what to do, I have no friends or family to speak of, and I feel so alone. I have to make this decision of to get the surgery done, or let him live for how ever long he can, and just let him go, I am afraid , because this surgery he MIGHT make it out of, and that part be over, and can go on and get his heart fixed, his mouth, everything that is wrong with him, or I can just let him go. He has a chance of better odds of making through the surgery, but that isnt attainable as of right now, we would have to move to another state, have people be there for us, and my daughter, we dont have the money, resources, place to stay, any of it! I have tried almost everything I can think of to get some funding to help save my son's life, he needs to get to The Mayo Clinic in Mnn. They have a better survival rate for this surgery, his chances go to around 45% IF we can get him there. Im just so lost, every avenue I have tried has failed , people JUST DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MY SON, no one, he has fallen through the cracks and because I am a shitty mother, I am NO BODY, my son has to suffer the consequences. Everyday I wonder , did I do this to my son? Did he come out this way because of my health and body? I would like to also mention he was never supposed to happen, I was never supposed to be able to get pregnant again, I actually found out I was pregnant with him , after I had blood drawn for pre-op for a hysterectomy .  We have been through so many  genetics testings , they can find NO REASON he was born this way

 Now to the other part of the story, ME, I am diagnosed Bi-Polar , I have aggressive MS, fibro, loss of function of my muscles and nerves ( my mylan is deteriorating ), as many more smaller things wrong with me ,  as of right now I have no mylan around my knees and part of my legs , if there is no mylan, my nerve surges shoot all through out my body, and into muscles or my bones, its EXTREMELY painful.  I even fought off death when my daughter was born, I was in the hospital for 3 months after I had her, I had a severe staff infection that spread through my whole body, some of my organs were shutting down. I made it though, I love my children with everything that is ME! They are my world, if not for them, I wouldnt breath, move , or exist. This March I was told I have about 15 yrs at best, if my health keeps deteriorating , I have been on so many different meds I cant even remember the names of half of them, nothing has slowed it down :( My fiance didnt realize how severe I was, he has always been a wonderful man, taken care of me, been by my side, he is just one man though. He doesnt know all the answers, never shares his feelings, and never tries to put more on me than what already is. We had a huge fight about a month ago, he hasnt been the nicest the past about 8 months, lashing out on me, our kids, and EVERYONE. I asked him what did I do to deserve this? I dont want to live the rest of my life like this, I dont have as long as he does to enjoy life, and the way it looks I will be running my self ragged trying to save my son. All in the end my family will still be losing one of us, or both.  He looks at me and says " I am sorry I am being this way, I dont know how to control it, I am mad, confused and hurt", I ask why?  he says " Do you not see I look at your beautiful face every single day, and wonder what have I done for god to take away everything that means the world to me? He is taking my son, and if that isnt enough, my wife, my soul mate. He says I am scared Dana, I dont want to lose either of you. I am going to be left alone with two huge wholes in my heart and voids in my life, how are me and Skylar supposed to deal with this? I just looked at him, and cried so hard,  I am going to be in a wheel chair full time soon , I am in one now but I am determined to NOT be in it, I wont stay in that damn chair until I fall for the last time, and cant get the fuck back up, god damn it I am 28 years old, this isnt right! 

I so want to go before my son does, so I can be there waiting for him so he isnt scared,  I would rather Skylar not see the worst of what is to come, I dont want to disappoint and watch my best friend ( my fiance ) and my daughter , I cant bare to  think of what this is going to do to them, when I get so bad I am in the hospital, and cant be a mom, or a wife. I know I am rambling, I dont know how to clearly say what I am feeling. I just know , that if I am going to die anyways, I want to be there before my son does, I am a waste of space here, and nothing but a burden on my family.  I have given up on my self, I need my son to get better.  I am falling apart on the outside and inside. I am medicated with lithium ( 1000mg's) a day and have been on almost everything imaginable for this depression. I wish I had a choice to better my life, in my circumstances there is nothing  I can do to change the fact my son is dying, and so am I. Our whole family is falling apart, and angry at each other, I feel like I am letting my fiance down, we are supposed to grow old together! And watch both of our children grow up and be loving good people ,My daughter is also having a VERY hard time with this, she has been there for EVERYTHING, even when they sat us down to tell us he is terminal. They never thought to take her out of the room BEFORE telling us, she lost it, I have let her down, Thank you. I just need to get this off of my chest, I have no one to talk to , when I try to talk about my son dying or me , my fiance just sits there with this look in his eye, and says everything will be ok.. we will figure out a way to make it all ok, we always do. What I dont tell him, is that all I want to do is just get it over with  and die. That I hurt so bad, that cooking his dinner takes almost every single amount of strength I have in me, I TRY not to tell him things that really hurts me or just takes everything out of me, he is exhausted to, exhausted isnt even a powerful enough word for what me and him are, we havent had a full nights sleep since my daughter was born,and as my son's brain condition gets worse, the less he sleeps because of pain, and brain pressure, I am lucky to get 3 hours of scattered sleep every night, same with him, no one cares we are so tired, we have hallucinated , we cant function, We have had people say damn you look like shit, you need some sleep,  and they know we have NO ONE, not one person to watch the kids, to let us sleep, to keep Skylar while we are 4 hours away at Children's with our son, we are in so much trouble right now because of truancy its not funny. I have to make the decision of taking the only normalcy my daughter has ( school ) out of her life, and keep her home for homeschooling. That decision is as hard as me making the decision for my son. She doesnt have any friends, and gets made fun of constantly, but she loves to go to school and learn. Im just a fuck up that cant get anything right, even making healthy children. What did I do or better yet, my children do to deserve this?
