I have given up completely, there is nothing in me that wants to live, but...I have been suicidal for years because I suffer from BPD. All this time, though, there has always been this tiny spark of hope that wished I would not die, so that is how I survived the two attempts, I think. There has always been this tiny part of me that wanted to keep living. Things have been going downhill again and I have become more suicidal each day, but this time, there is no hope, there is not a single part of me that wants to keep suffering. I just really want to leave this world and find the peace I deserve. The worst thing is, even though I have been waiting for the day when I finally make the decision to die without any regrets, I cannot proceed with my plans at the moment. My parents are suffering financially and I do not have any money to cover the cost of my funeral at the moment. My death would make their financial struggles much worse, but I just simply do not want to keep suffering and waking up each day in agony, what do i do?
