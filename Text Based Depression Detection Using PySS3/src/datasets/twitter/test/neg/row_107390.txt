I just want someone to loveI've been in three relationships and they all ended with someone cheating on me and then them breaking up with me. I always try to make it work. I know it's my fault for not being good enough. I try so hard to be everything  they wanted me to be. I'm still in the last relationship and I want her to leave. She's a cheater and a user like the other two, but I'm alone without her. Even without the world being fucked right now, I'm completely alone. No friends, no family. She's using me because she knows I can't go on alone. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this though
