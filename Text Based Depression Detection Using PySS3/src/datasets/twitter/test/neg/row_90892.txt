I feel nothing anymore.I'm 25, Â£2200 in debt due to being a fucking stupid alcoholic. I push everyone away and everything I have ever touched has turned to shit.

I am in shit that I cannot recover from. Doctors can't help, meds can't help, just called Samaritans and they didn't even fucking pick up - though I've no idea what I'd say if they even did.

I don't care. This is me. Don't live like this, I thought I was so amazing and I'm not. Nothing can fill the void that I feel inside me.

It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but I am jumping off a fucking bridge. Both mentally and physically.
