Suicide isn't the "easy way out" it's a really hard optionActually coming up with a way to kill yourself and then doing it is really fucking tough, also losintg the last bit of hope and deciding/wanting to get out is really hard.

Only really trying to turn your life is harder because it's close to impossible to reach, only "trying to hang in there a bit more" is probaly the easiest way..
