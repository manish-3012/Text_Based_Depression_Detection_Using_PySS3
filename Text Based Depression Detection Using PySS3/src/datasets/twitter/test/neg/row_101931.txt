Need urgent help. What can I do besides suicide?22 yo South African male. Had to use all my life savings to help my parents financially because my father is an abusive alcoholic sociopath that hasn't worked for 4 years and destroyed our family. I could never focus on university because I had a bad home life(my parents followed me to uni because I was their source of income), had to try and run the failing family business and work to keep the family afloat financially. This year I had a full-time job as a real estate agent, part time job in the evenings and was a full-time Bcom Econ + International trade student. I failed the year academically, don't have a cent to my name to continue my job, can't find a new job because there is no jobs in SA. Ontop of that I have crohns disease and complex ptsd and avoidant personality disorder with extreme depression and anxiety. These illnesses are in part because my father abused me emotionally, my mother enabled him and because of early childhood emotional neglect and because I had to live with an aggressive alcoholic who drank the family into poverty and a mom unwilling to leave. My question then is: what option do I have besides suicide at this point? The bills are stacking up, no one to help me(no friends or family), soon I won't make rent and I just can't seem to win at life.
