Nothing mattersWhy keep living? Whatâ€™s the point of going if itâ€™s going to be the same monotonous routine day after day? Life feels pointless. I know I have so much ahead of me but itâ€™s hard looking that far ahead when iâ€™m living this hell right now. I have no friends. I have no family that loves me. I have nothing left. I havenâ€™t enjoyed human interaction in years. The last time I tried therapy he talked about himself for an hour and took my money. The meds donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re working any more and the future seems dull. Everyday feels the same as it has for years. Why do anything any more if I know nothing will change? Thereâ€™s no hope. Positivity and joy is an unrealistic fantasy that people choose to believe in. Nobody really feels happy they just get better at hiding the pain. Every day itâ€™s painful to wake up so why donâ€™t I just sleep forever? I donâ€™t enjoy a second of my day from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed, so why not just cut out the pain? 
People say ending it isnâ€™t the solution but what the fuck do they know? Nobody fucking understands how I feel day in and day out. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a pussy so I could just fucking end it already. The only reason iâ€™m not already dead is because I worry about the pain it would cause the people around me. I have a dad and a brother that would miss me. Theyâ€™re just an obstacle in the way of the solution to my problems. Iâ€™m sorry for the long post I just canâ€™t take this shit any more.
