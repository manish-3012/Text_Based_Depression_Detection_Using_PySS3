One day back at school and I'm already suicidal.I got here about 10 hours ago and im already suicidal. I haven't even been to a class yet or anything. I just can't handle this stupid place anymore. Last semester I failed my capstone so it's not like I'm getting a degree this semester anyways... 

I really feel like I just have to quit at this point, for my mental health, but idk. My parents I know would be so worked up because they paid for it, but how can I help it? 

Also, I told my mom this yesterday, and she said it's hard to understand why/how I failed when she doesn't suffer from depression like I do. She said she wants to help, which is nice I guess. 

I feel like I'm just rambling now. Idk what to say. Idk what to do, really. If anyone actually read this, thanks.
