I think I need helpOk so I want to start this off by saying I love my family I really do love them so so much, but I dont think I truly love myself as a person.  


Recently after watching the netflix documentary 13th due to the overwhelming theme of black crime recently I felt that I truly don't deserve to live in this world as the person I am and the person I may become, I often have racist, homophobic and misogynistic thoughts and I know that makes me a bad person but I want to change I want to grow into a loving, valued member of society and to make a real change in at least one persons life or at the very least make my mother proud of me. But I am truly worried that I will grow into a hateful person and I am trying to change myself now and I don't want to sound like someone trying to beg for sympathy or in a way cut corners but the only real remedy I feel now is to end my life and hope that I'm either reincarnated as a kinder person or sent to heaven where I'll soon meet the rest of my family in time, and I know I said I love my family and the main reason many seemingly depressed people don't commit suicide is because they don't want their family to be sad but my justification is that I just won't care when I'm dead.  
Sorry if it got a bit religious there but to finish this off I just think I need help.
