I just wrote my letters. It was an experience.I decided, after four long years of agonizing pain that tonight is the night.
Just got prescribed anti depressants. Theyâ€™ll be the death of me. I donâ€™t care if I have issues if It doesnâ€™t work. I cant take it anymore. 
I wrote my letters to my closest friends and family. It was an experience. I cried more than I thought I would. I realize that any language isnâ€™t enough to really portray what I really want to say. For someone who says theyâ€™re a writer, Iâ€™m pretty shit at explaining.
Itâ€™s bittersweet, I find. I finally get to end my life. But I feel bad leaving my loved ones like this. I donâ€™t know how to feel. Its been so long since Iâ€™ve felt anything.
