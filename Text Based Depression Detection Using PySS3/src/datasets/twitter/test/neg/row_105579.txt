Goodbye r/suicide watchGoodbye.   I want to thank you for letting me lurk on here for years.  Your encouragement to others has helped me through some dark times.  

Unfortunately, I am unable to continue with the way things have been going for the last several years.  I am out of coping mechanisms.  It's one thing to give up and not try, but another when you realize that your best just isn't good enough.    And that's tough to swallow.  

In every game there are winners and losers, and the game of life is no different.   Someone has to lose.  

Once again, thank you all, and goodbye.
