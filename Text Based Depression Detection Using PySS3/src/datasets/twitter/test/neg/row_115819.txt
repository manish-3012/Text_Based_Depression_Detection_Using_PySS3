Coping with clinical depression without health insurance?Im recovering from my first really bad episode and recently found out i will be losing my health insurance. I have tried celexa however it greatly worsened my symptoms and I have since avoided antidepressants. However, I always liked the idea of being able to turn doctors for  new medication if it got really bad again.

How do those of you without health insurance cope?
