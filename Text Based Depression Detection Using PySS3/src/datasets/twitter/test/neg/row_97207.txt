I really want to kill myself, but I can't make myself do itEvery day at work is the same, every day at home is the same. I get bitched at for not doing anything when I have no where to go. The only salvation I've found is in fantasy games, but none of that is real. I want to buy a gun and one bullet, but I can't make myself do it.
