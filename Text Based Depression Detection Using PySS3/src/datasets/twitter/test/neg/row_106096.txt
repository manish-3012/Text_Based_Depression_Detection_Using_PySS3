Im so exhausted and I know I don't have longI don't even know what to say anymore. Not sure if I want an answer or if I just want to vent.

I have always been somewhat depressed my whole life. I was never super popular with anyone and even now I'm still just the punching bag with all my friends. I've been pretty good about controlling my emotions but these last two months have been hell. Most of my recent problems are in my past post history so I'm not going to repeat it.

My ex-girlfriend transitioned to a guy about a month and a half ago and everything I ever cared about just went to shit. I tried to be as supportive as I could but nothing ever seemed to be enough. It took me about a week or two to start using the new name and pronouns which from what I've heard is pretty good for me to adjust that quickly but it just didn't matter. My ex has blocked me on everything we were connected on and I'm starting to believe our entire relationship was a lie.

I was called so many fucking things and told I was such a piece of shit for being the way I was but I have texts saved and video evidence of him doing the exact same bullshit. I know in the end he's just a lying asshole but all I want is closure.

I attempted suicide about a 3 weeks ago and I ended up surviving but I was in a behavioral health center for almost the whole week. I've gone to therapy 2 times a week since I was admitted and it hasn't done anything. Im rereading this whole post right now and its barely even cohesive. I feel like a psycho just scribbling in a notebook at this point but I don't care. I'm thinking about making an exit bag in a day or two and making sure I don't recover this time. I'm just so tired and at this point I'm not even willing to make my life better.
