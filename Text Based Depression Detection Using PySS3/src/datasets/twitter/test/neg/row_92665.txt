My fate is pretty much sealed.I'm 24y/o m, graduated high school in 2005. I tried university straight out of high school, ended up dropping out first semester and have been making student loan payments ever since. 

Fuck fuckedy fuck fuck, a bunch of stuff happened, went to the hospital for suicide watch, recovered repressed memories of childhood molestation, blah blah...

So, fall of 2011 I started a 2 year college course. I had been trying to get into this course for about 4 years, but it was always full, or I had to upgrade, or something would come up. Things were great, I had top marks in my class. Then student loan ran out. I stopped sleeping. Couldn't wake up for class, and I spent more time trying to pick up hours at work than I should have spent on school work. In May, it had become apparent that I had ended up failing the second half of the first year of the course. That's when I decided "Everyone always says 'just hang in there, things will get better.' Well, it's not. Fuck 3 or 4 years ago, and fuck 8 months from now." Basically, I had decided that if things don't improve by January 2013, I was going to off myself.

I was working at a casino as a poker dealer since May 2010. Eventually, they shit on me (details, blah), and in the month of August I was certain that I couldn't do anything without failing and decided to quit my job. I moved back home with my parents, and after 2 and a half months I finally got a job at Tim Horton's. It's like I'm Billy Madison in a class room full of 7 year olds. I get about 16 hours per week.

Having taken that long to get a job, I never got around to filling out the paperwork to resume my studies at college. I'm trying my best this afternoon to get things sorted out, but I don't have enough information to fill out my student loan application, and I haven't heard back from the course instructors with regards to filling out the appropriate paperwork. I tried taking the bus into town today to go talk to the instructors in person when my friend offered to drive me. He forgot about me, and then I missed the only bus. I'm pretty sure that it's too late now.

On January 12th I will be 25 years old, living with my parents, with a years worth of student loan on top of my previous loans, which I will barely be able to make the monthly payments. I was going to be able to salvage the successful part of my education, but that dream is gone. So now I have nothing but debts that I won't be able to afford to pay.

More details, haven't had a girlfriend in 8 years, haven't been laid in 2 years, yada yada yada. 

I've never attempted suicide before, the reason for which being that if I am to ever attempt it, I intend on being successful in doing so. I won't share the specific details of my plan as to not give anyone ideas, but I assure you, it's a quadruple fail-safe, and it will not fail. 

I've got less than a month left. I need to talk.
