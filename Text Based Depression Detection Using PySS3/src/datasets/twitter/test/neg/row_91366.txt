I always fail, why can't I do anything right? Fuck. I can't do this anymore. I can't even kill myself successively.  I've tried to get better, I honestly have, I wasn't born to live. That sounds stupid, I know, but I have never felt accepted in my life, always been an outcast, my problems were never as important as others and I'm just worthless. God dammit. Welp, I'm leaving now, see ya,  thanks for listening.
