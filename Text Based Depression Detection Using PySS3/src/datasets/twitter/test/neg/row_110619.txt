Wrapping up loose endsI have an appointment tomorrow morning to get my last will and testament notarized. I have a letter listing all my assets, account numbers, where my legal documents are, and a list of my teenage daughterâ€™s doctors and medical records. Once all the planning boxes are checked tomorrow morning all that is left is to find the best place/time.
