Feeling hopelessI feel like I need to talk to someone about whatâ€™s happening to me. Iâ€™m sorry for the spelling and I hope you can understand my English.

I have been thinking about suicide lately, honestly I canâ€™t remember the last time suicide was not in my mind, a stroke would be the best thing that could happen to me, at least I would leave without being judged and it would save my family a lot of questions and such. Itâ€™s not that bad during the week, I work and itâ€™s stressful lately, I donâ€™t have much time to think about myself and when I get off I go to the gym and thatâ€™s it for the day. Working out was probably the best thing that happened to me, it got me out of depression years ago and I really enjoy spending time in the gym. Monday to Friday is basically the same shit every day, I go to work, after work I go to the gym and then I get home, eat and sleep but during the weekend I struggle, I have some free time to relax and think and thatâ€™s what brings me down, I think about what I miss in my life and how hard it will be to achieve my goals and I always end up asking myself â€œwhy the hell am I doing this? â€œ whatâ€™s the point? Why should I keep suffering? Thereâ€™s no one in my life who cares about me except my 2 friends. My family thinks I am dumb and a pain in the ass, thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t really talk to anyone at home because Iâ€™m afraid of making them angry at me and make my situation even worse. There used to be a girl I talked to, we met a month ago and I really felt great with her and I think she also did, We spent so little time together but I really thought it would work, it didnâ€™t last more than a couple of weeks.  Now I realize how much I want to be in a relationship, I want to love and care about someone and I want to feel loved.
