F*ck All Of YouI'm done talking anymore. I'm done trying anymore. When I help myself? It isn't good enough. Well f*ck this! All I ever known was death anyways. I've already been pronounced dead twice. I might as well finish what I started. Pretty sad with the circumstances I've been dealt with. 13 years straight of trauma &amp; violent tendencies and watching the people important to me die of murder, suicide and I have it weighing on my mind every single day from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I'm tired of the flashbacks. Right now? I've already have cut my arms up and I'm bleeding, but no one gives a f*ck. No one accepts me. Well f*ck it! I hate me too. Nothing to love about myself. F*ck believing anymore. I've lost all faith. I been through this since I was a youth. I don't deserve to live anymore. I suffer alive. Might as well die a slow &amp; painful death. I don't give a f*ck anymore. All I I ever do is get hurt by society. People will never f*cking understand the trials I have been dealt with. It's pretty sad when I've applied for therapy and those f*cking people all gathered in a room and laughed at my pain &amp; suffering spilling my heart out after all that has been done to me. Well I'm f*cked up! The damage has already been done. I'm going to f*cking die and you'll ALL LAUGH WHEN I'M GONE!!! 

Have a nice life without me!
