Starting to lose hope in lifeNo matter what we are fucked. Global warming is happening, the Amazon is on fire, and there is a really big asteroid hurling towards earth that could easily wipe us all out in apox. 10 years. There's no point in learning anything or trying anymore but I'm not trying to kms yet cause my dog and cats and parents would be sad. But also I can't think of us all dying together
