Coping with the feeling of impending failure?I have a wife, 2 kids and 2 dogs, with an okay job. I'm not disillusioned about what I have, but I have always been phenomenally average at everything I've ever done. Every day I sit here and think "how the fuck am I going to keep this up?" 

I feel like at every moment I'm barely making it all work and that one day I'm just not going to be able to handle it anymore and completely self destruct. How do I cope with this suicidal level of unconfidance
