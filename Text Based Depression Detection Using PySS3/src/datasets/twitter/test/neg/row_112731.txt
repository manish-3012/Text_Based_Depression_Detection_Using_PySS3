Blocked by father of dead childI didn't want an abortion . He forced me into getting one . I am a day after recovery and he calls me to say "My job is done. This is closure and the end of us". He was never there for during the pregnancy , and said he will not help with the recovery . I said that even though I will access other resources , I still need his communication at the least....(I don't know how to describe it. but there is this odd hormone bond(?) when you are pregnant that makes you want the fathers care)

He hung up. Blocked me in every way possible . I have no way to contact him. I have no idea how to hack so I could atleast get a hold of him or someone he knows .

I'm physically unwell already . Post op bleeding and pain . mentally I can't stand this . my child and the father are gone . what is the easiest way to go without pain . should I take a bunch of pills?
