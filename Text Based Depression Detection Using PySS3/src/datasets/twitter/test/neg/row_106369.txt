Therapy is too expensive and I'm suicidali've been getting mentally worse for the last couple of years, two weeks ago i had the urge to throw myself in front of a train, it was scary and also so attractive as an idea. i didn't do anything and the thought went away.
these last couple of days I've been feeling very bad, but this morning I felt (and still feel) somehow worse, i started contemplating the idea of killing myself for real, I thought about it for a while, and then I started looking for ways to kill myself online, the fastest way, so that there is no way to actually be saved. and it was there that when i open the link it turned out to be something like "is not a real list of ways of killing yourself, but please ask for help.. etc" and i started crying and sobbing like never before. I'm currently alone at home and I feel scared I won't make it through the day.
I started to look for a therapyst in munich, where I live, and to my surprise, the prices are so high. I don't have much money, I obviously can't afford to pay 150 per session, or more. but I think for the first time I need help.
