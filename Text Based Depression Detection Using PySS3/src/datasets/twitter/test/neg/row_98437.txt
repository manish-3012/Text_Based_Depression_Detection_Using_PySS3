I don't know where to find hope.I don't know if I have depression or not. I haven't been diagnosed or anything yet lately, I've been feeling down a lot. I have no motivation to keep up my grades. I've changed my field of study multiple times. I'm so lost. I'm so stressed about school and money. Every time I go back up to my hometown, my parents are constantly telling me how their business is not going very well. My mom lost 3/4 of her clients and is down to only a couple. I feel like this should motivate me more to keep up my grades. But I found out I have to stay another year. I... I just don't know what I'm doing anymore. 

It's 2am. It's raining hard outside. I think about suicide but I feel like a lot of people do anyways? Is this normal? Is it normal to think about dying everyday when I'm alone? Do I need help? I don't know what to do. I feel like I'll never go through with it. So I'm safe, right? Am I PMSing? I don't want to disappoint my parents. I don't want them to be sad if I do die. I care a lot about my family. I have a great family. So why is it that I'm so sad all the time. Am I being ungrateful?

I used to be scared of the dark. But now I don't care much for darkness.

Thanks for listening.
