I found out through reddit that my husband has been lying to me about wanting children.hi,

im very much in need of medication for ptsd. ive been lied to, cheated on, called a liar, and lost all of my friends because i cant be bothered to be friends with people who think those things about me.

my husband has been my rock for over 5 years. i found out he cheated on me last year, and haven't (even with therapy) been able to stop social-media-tracking the people he was with. it kills me every dumb-ass day. the woman is not attractive at all and everything about this absolutely crushed my self confidence.

as stupid as me staying with him is (i need to become more financially stable first before i can leave, but i want to die more than i feel like going thru the effort of leaving), we had never planned for children until 2 years ago. he was the first person that i ever wanted to have kids with, and we spoke of it frequently once we breached the topic, but knew we couldn't until we had saved up more. he was always excited about it. well, the social-media-tracking has escalated to him, too and i found his reddit account and saw a post from a few months ago saying that the idea of having children disgusts him.

im just...done. i have nothing and no one. i dont want to get knocked up by a cheater in the first place, but what if that didn't happen, we'd followed our 'dreams' and had a child/ren.......would he have loathed them and me forever?
