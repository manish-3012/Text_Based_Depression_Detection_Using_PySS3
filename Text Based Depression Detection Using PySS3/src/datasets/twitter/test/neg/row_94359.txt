Date is approachingI have been trying to commit suicide for the past couple of months. I've been trying to hang myself by a belt and doorknob and I got up to 4:24 without passing out. After that I chickened out and couldn't take it anymore. I plan on commit suicide in the next few weeks. I have rope and I'm going to duct tape my hands so I can't untie the noose
