I'm really just lingering at this pointI haven't been happy for a very long time. It has nothing to do with my friends or loved ones, its all me. I'm the reason I can just be happy. At this point, all I want to do is lie down and die, go quietly without anyone noticing. Maybe some pills, cut an artery, some way that will take me peacefully away and out. I owe it to everyone I know to do this, I dont deserve to live anymore for all the ways ive fucked up my life. I've made my SO feel worthless, ive demonized my father and I just dont want to try for a job. I'd rather avoid what ill just fail at....im a broken person and a sad example of a human being, everyone will be happier when im gone. Sorry about your knife daddy.
