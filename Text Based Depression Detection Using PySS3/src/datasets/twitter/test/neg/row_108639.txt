An online friend of mine just told me she took 34 ativan pills and is trying to kill herself; I don't know what to do.This is the second time she's tried to commit suicide that I know of. Unfortunately, I don't know where she lives. I've been trying to tell her to get help, tell someone or go to the hospital. I don't know what else to do! I thought of coming here and seeing if anyone has dealt with this before.
