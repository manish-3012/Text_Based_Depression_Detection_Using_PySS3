I want to die with dignityI have tried in the past but failed miserably. Got my chest pumped twice in the past. There are too many ways to fuck this up. I want to go freely, on my terms. I read online that the Netherlands and Belgium do assisted suicide for mental health illnesses.  Thatâ€™s the way I want to go, relaxed, peaceful and happy. I want to be comfortable when itâ€™s time. I donâ€™t want to jump in front of a train or jump off a bridge itâ€™s too messy and you end up scarring people by doing that. Which is why I want to do it under lethal injection. Itâ€™s quick, painless. I started doing research on what medicines they use to inject you with. I wish assisted suicide was legal in California. It forces people to die alone in a cruel way instead of giving people the option to end their life on their own terms.  I want to die with dignity. I have no friends or family which would make it a lot easier for me, I wonâ€™t have to worry about causing grief to anyone, which is actually lovely.  Iâ€™m going to do more research, I felt a wave of relief knowing thatâ€™s an option for me. Im going to create a fool proof plan, a lovely one. I hope god will forgive me, but I think if i have the right to live i should also have a right to commit suicide in a humane manner.
