I think I'm heartbrokenI don't think I've cried as much in years as I have tonight. I am only 18 and so I know there is hope for the future, but my boyfriend now ex has moved on. We were together almost two years, But in a weird place for the last few months. I couldn't cope with long distance so pushed it to the back of my mind due to uni but we were talking, things were going okay. Then he calls me today to say that he misses me, but he's going to start seeing another girl. She's beautiful, with similar interests, at his uni. such an upgrade. Funnily enough I was on a date too today, but it didn't go well. Now I feel very isolated, I'm away from all my friends and family because my uni is 300 miles from home. I can't head home until christmas and all I want to do is cuddle my dog. I've struggled so much and I'm just floored by it. I don't think I would be killing myself over a boy, I can see that life has more purpose than that. But this is just the tip of the isolated iceberg, I have very few friends at uni and I don't see myself making any more. I don't think I can cope anymore, but I also don't have the balls to drop out. The future is terrifying but the future with nobody who loves me? That's even worse man
