In the grand scheme of things..In the grand scheme of things, offing yourself is no big deal.

They are all going to be irritated for a while afterwards. My extended family would not care at all.

I made it pretty clear to my mother and roommates that I am suicidal, nobody cared. They choose to ignore it. They don't care. They're self-absorbed. (As if I am the one who has a right to talk about that.) It has only gotten worse, day by day. Nobody cares. Even if someone tried to help me, I'd be to stubborn and paranoid to trust them. 

I don't want to trust them.   
I just want to die.

I don't want to continue studying.  
I just want to die.

I don't want to play video games.  
I just want to die.

I don't want to go outside.  
I just want to die.

I don't want to get a job.  
I just want to die.

Sorry if you wasted your time reading this.
