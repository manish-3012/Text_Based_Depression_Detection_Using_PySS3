my dad almost killed himself todayi donâ€™t know what to do anymore, iâ€™m so tired of constantly being in pain. my father almost killed himself a few hours ago because his mother died today in the morning and i just feel so broken, iâ€™ve never experienced loss and i donâ€™t even want to think of what would have happened if he killed himself. heâ€™s the only person i have in my life who gives a shit about me and to see him in pain hurts me iâ€™ve cried all night long and i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i dont live with him and iâ€™m scared heâ€™s going to try to kill himself again i donâ€™t know what to do iâ€™m just scared and in pain. i only knew that he was trying to kill himself because his neighbors called me and i understand heâ€™s suffering too but i donâ€™t want him to die and iâ€™m scared that heâ€™ll never be okay after this. his neighbors are checking up on him constantly so he doesnâ€™t try anything again but iâ€™m scared heâ€™ll do it and i donâ€™t know what to do because i wanted to go over to see him but all heâ€™s telling me is that he wants to be alone and cry alone so i donâ€™t know what to do.
