:(Every day is hell and people around me just terrorize me. What am I? What have I done wrong? I never hurt anybody ... Why do I deserve so much hatred....? Life is unbearable. It sucks. My boyfriend is stressed but won't listen to me. I don't fucking know what to do. I'm not in control of anything and I hate it. I wish I had something sharp but all my knives suck. Fuck. I can't fucking do this
