My friend just sent me a suicide note on Facebook.My question is: I don't know what message to leave.

He (let's call him J) sent me a message about 9 hours ago which I've just seen about an hour ago and now I dont know what to say.

Another friend is telling me I should assure J that I'm here to listen to whatever he has to say but I think leaving a lot of assurance messages will just rattle and panic him.

What do I do?

Thanks SW.
