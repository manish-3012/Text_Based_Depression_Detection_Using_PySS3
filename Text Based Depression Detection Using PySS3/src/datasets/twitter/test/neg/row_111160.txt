I hate this formI feel so uncomfortable in my body and in this form. It frustrates me and I dont want to die but I dont want to be in this body anymore. I hate my mind, my body, my face. I want to cease to exist. I dont know if this is body dysmorphia but the pain I feel when I think about this form Im in is ridiculous. Iâ€™m also so fucking lonely. I dont think anyone will ever be able to love me and if they do Iâ€™ll never be able to accept it. If there is a god i pray to him to end my misery.
