Got the day planned out, and really looking forward to it.?For the first time I'm not thinking they'll be sad when I'm gone, help help. Got a great day planned out. Favourite food as last meal, visit an escort for a couple of hours, overdose on heroin. Simple. It feels amazing to be excited about death, rather than it be something I crave but am scared of.
