I'm tired.Every day I wake up and go through the same exact bullshit.  
Every. fucking. day.    
Two years. I've felt like this for two years. It hasn't gotten better. I doubt it ever will.  
Everyone says it gets better and I'm still waiting.  
Please. I can't wait anymore. Every day. I wake up and I wait- for something? The faintest shimmer of water in an endless desert? And yet I can't trust myself, maybe a mirage, or heat exhaustion.  
I'm too tired of chasing after endless mirages. I hope you'll understand that I don't believe my eyes when you point out the latest body of water. You're dying of thirst, too. I can see it in your eyes.  
I'm tired. I'm so tired. You say there's a helicopter coming, but where is it? I've waited so long. I've struggled so long.  
I don't think it's coming.  
I'm ready to bury myself in the sand and suffocate. The thirst is raw agony, and all I can do is wait. Wait or die. For the best?  
For a glimmer of water?  
It's all a mirage. Please let me sleep.
