FiredIt was supposed to be a great job for a good company and a month in they let me go for not carrying my weight. I didn't know the system. I had difficulties working with other departments. I was new and then you punch me in the gut like that. 

If I had the courage I'd go back and make someone pay. I don't though, so i'll just sit here on this throwaway account in bed while I die of dehydration. I can already feel my head pounding. Not long now. 

What good am I if all I can do is work for a wage? I got nothing else going for me. No way to find my passion. So I'll just bide my time.
