I feel really alone and I want help but don't know what to do.Hi all. Sorry if this is sorta dumb and confusing but I don't know what else to do. The past while (week or so) I've been feeling really suicidal. I've been in off and on therapy for the past nine years and I'm just tired of being alive. I was raised by a single bipolar (verbally abusive) mom who died when I was fourteen. I've been abused and assaulted (physically and sexually) off and on throughout my life and all I want to do is to not be in pain anymore.

I was abandoned and moved from foster home to foster home and really just wanted a place and a family. I found a home that supposedly loved and wanted me but they eventually decided after about two years that I was too much and forced me into a facility within the span of a night. 

In that facility I watched members of the staff get attacked and assaulted. I was forced to do body inspections whenever I left the facility and generally it was an awful time. People threatened and once tried to murder me and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. 

After leaving the facility I found a home that seemed to love me. A family that I could potentially call my own. I thought for once that my life was going well and everything was in order. I have (had?) a wonderful amazing partner who loves and cares about me, a group of friends that supported me and a (family?) that loved me.

Recently that has come to change. I was told by a parent that they would never be my dad let alone a parent and that they would never trust me. While that was going on my partner had to find emergency housing and was subsequently needing to find temporary / permanent housing which was stressful for all involved. It was around that time when our relationship problems started. 

Communication was not great between really anyone that was involved and even though we've progressively gotten better, things have not. We're constantly stressed out and she won't even look at me because she's afraid of me (I have done nothing significant enough to deserve this, she doesn't even know why.) 

In addition, my (parents?) with my small little foster brother children got into a pretty intense car accident about two days ago and that's also been a big factor in how I feel.

I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I want to end my life because of all this pain but everything is so confusing and I just don't know what to do. I've tried calling hotlines, talking to friends (not my partner) and just everything. I took a mental health day from school / uni today and I just can't do this anymore.

I don't know what to do. Please help me :(
