Hey god, you can take me back nowMy mom said every one of my childhood friends doesnâ€™t want to hang out with me because I and my siblings are embarrassment to society. My dad and my siblings make me out to be an abusive nightmare. I am genuinely a waste of life who Doesnâ€™t have good enough grades, doesnâ€™t know what they want to do for a living, and doesnâ€™t have any hobbies or friends. Iâ€™m done at 14 years old, 14 years wasted. I have no ambition. I canâ€™t do it myself, it would hurt to much. Can someone just run me over with their car?
