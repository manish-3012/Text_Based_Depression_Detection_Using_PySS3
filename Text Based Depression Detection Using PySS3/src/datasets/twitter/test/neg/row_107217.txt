I Want To Just Die PeacefullyLife is just so senseless. Nothing in my life is worth living for. It's just a weird confusing dream with no point to it. My life is good I guess, I get good grades, have a roof over my house, and have a loving family. The only thing that sucks about life is that I'm in it. Why do I have to put up with myself while torturing the world? I have no energy to do anything about fixing my life, it'd be so much easier to die. 

I did see a therapist for 2.5 months but my parents made me stop seeing her and now I have to get an evaluation at the hospital and perhaps stay there for a week or so. Truly will it even help? Is there even a point? I don't have the strength to cope with my feelings it'd be easier to just let them eat me up. Death would be ideal for me and everyone who knows me, but I can't die because certain people would get hurt. A lot. For now I'm cutting to compensate for the desire to kill myself, but death would be the ideal solution really.
