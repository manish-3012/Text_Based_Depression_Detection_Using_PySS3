I don't know what to do.I don't know what to do.  Everything seems to be going too well, but I just feel so uncertain about the future.  I'm so afraid that I'll fuck up somehow.  On normal days, I don't give a fuck about the world or how it views me, but right now I don't think I'm worth anything.  I'm socially awkward, ugly, lonely, and I really hate myself right now.  I feel so weak, that other people have had a life orders of magnitude worse than mine, yet they feel fine, and I'm here on reddit complaining about how shitty my "amazing" life is to strangers who don't know me, probably don't give a fuck, and have better things to do.
