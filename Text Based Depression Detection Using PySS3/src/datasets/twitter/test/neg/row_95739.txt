maybe too formalIâ€™m sorry. You donâ€™t have to read this right now, or if/while youâ€™re grieving, but I would like it to come to light eventually.


This is a letter to discuss the main reasons for what happened. Also enclosed is any pertinent personal information I would like to discuss privately.


The first and primary reason: being transgender is an impossible task left to me by fate.Â  Second, I feel sufficiently isolated from those I was once close to that my death will not inflict as much pain as it would in the past.Â 


If you werenâ€™t aware, my being transgender was not a choice or decision, and it is not something I would wish upon my worst enemy. Being transgender (i.e. gender dysphoria) is a neurological condition that was the root of most of my mental problems, I think, from late childhood onward (whenever societal and physical gender differences started becoming more pronounced). Transitioning is the only action known to alleviate dysphoria; thus, my transitioning was not a choice, not a statement, not done in spite; it was simply the best option as a medical treatment. Not everyone understands this. I donâ€™t think hardly anybody who isnâ€™t transgender themselves does, including you. Iâ€™m sorry if there was animosity between us due to these misconceptions. Background information aside, the reason I made the choice to end my life is that while transitioning does alleviate dysphoria symptoms, I have come to the opinion over the last eight months that it is far from a cure. It is impossible for me to ever become what I view as a real woman: one who was assigned female at birth and raised as a girl/woman. Medical science can get awfully close to physically altering my body such that I am physically female, and theoretically, my brain is already neurotypically female (hence being transgender). What no surgery, hormones, or therapy can ever accomplish is erasing the 21 years of male-coded socialization and relationships that have unfortunately shaped me (note: That is not to say I never valued the friendships I made as a â€œman.â€ I whole-heartedly cherish every one of you that ever let me be a friend despite my many flaws). Thus, I can never truly be an authentic woman. This especially poses an issue as Iâ€™m 8 months into my physical and social transition. Going back to living as a man would, in my mind, be a fate much worse than death. Alive, Iâ€™m essentially stuck in between a man and a woman and I am not strong enough to cope with that fact and its implications on my place in society.


I have suffered from acute depression for my entire life, from the onset of adolescence onwards. Some is certainly attributable towards gender dysphoria. I suspect also suffered from a handful of other undiagnosed disorders like body dysmorphia, attention deficiency, and rapid bipolarism. Addiction was a massive point of pain in my life as well. The sum of these parts was a long standing desire, passive or active, for my life to end early, but what kept me around was the social bonds with friends and family. I never wanted to hurt anyone else. I feel, at this point, my transition and conscious social withdrawal have distanced me enough that I am comfortable committing suicide and expecting not to hurt anybody as badly as I would before.


The above paragraphs are everything I feel is necessary to explain my decision. Please do not think of transitioning as the cause of my death. Transitioning truly extended my life by about 9 months as it gave me something to cling onto during the deep pain that was living as a â€œman.â€ It is simply too little, too late. I admire other transgender people for whom transitioning is enough of a cure.Â 


I hope this document clears up any leftover misconceptions and demonstrates that the decision to end my life was not one made in a moment of passion. I hope you feel as I do that we were once close enough to justify sending this, and if not, I apologize. I also hope you can understand that I could never be happy and actualized in life to the point where death felt like the better alternative. I really do not want anyone else to hurt themselves as a result of my death and, perhaps ironically, urge you to seek professional help if you have any desire to. My problems were one of very few that truly could not be fixed.


While I do not believe I was or could ever become cisgender, it is my will to be buried and remembered as a woman. If there are any services held in my memory, I would like a venue for donations towards The National Center for Trans Equality made available. One intention of this letter is that by its widespread nature, it holds the parties responsible for the above decisions accountable. I made a great effort in life towards distancing myself from my male origins and if nothing else, do not want that to go to waste.


Thank you for reading, and goodbye.
