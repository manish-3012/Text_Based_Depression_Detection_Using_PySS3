time for me to goIn the past 127 hours i have lost everything. Everything that i lived for, everything that made me happy, I lost the person I loved the most in my life i lost my house, my car and my family. I am nothing and I am nobody. The girl I love doesnt want me anymore because i destroyed my life. I want nothing more than to end it but for some reason I am too weak  to  go through with it. I want to die, I want the suffering to end but the world wont even let me die in peace. Ive lived a sad life i was a fuck up and in idiot. I want to die now and i want to die peacefully. My whole life i wanted to help people but at this point in my life i have realized that the only way i can truly help the ones i love and care about is by ending my own life. to those who know me and find this some time after my death try to remember what i was like when i was happy and how i used to be not what i turned into. Try to remember the guy u fell in love with Paynter.
