I'm so tired of being in this cycleFor the past couple years I've been in this cycle of hating myself for past mistakes then slowly building myself up only to continue to hate myself. I hate myself for tons of different things, I get paranoid about everything. Like when I was a lot younger and fooled around with my sister, now I'm afraid that I molested her and left her scarred/traumatized. I don't know what to think. I have constant anxiety attacks and I can't take it. College is right around the corner and I don't even want to think about it. I just feel like I've brought others a lot of pain and no joy. I can't stand it. I don't know how I'd kill myself, but it just feels so tempting. I should seek therapy but I'm terrified of asking my parents about it. Suicide just feels like the way out. I sometimes think about what people would do if I did kill myself.
