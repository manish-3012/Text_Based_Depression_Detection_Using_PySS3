I can't escape my mindI've been a lurker for a few months now, never had the courage to write a post. So I lost my girlfriend of 2+ years a few months ago. I ended our relationship because I felt like I had to clear my head from all the constant suicidal thoughts I've been having for a year and from all the pain from ex partners. Two weeks ago, I decided I was ready to pick up what was left of our relationship but I found out that she's seeing someone else. And honestly I relapsed. I fell back into the suicidal thoughts and it feels like I can't outrun all the memories and that I'm constantly drowning in my mistakes.

The past week, it seemed like the both of us were fine again. But I found out that she's been seeing him behind my back. Sending her home, meeting her. and I just feel so fucking hopeless. I feel like I'm in this constant back and forth, swinging in and out of all the negativity and the hurt swirling around in my head and all i just want to do right now is end everything. I tried to end my life twice now the past two weeks. the first time was when I found out and a driver pulled me off the road. The second time was last night when I zoned out and found myself on the road half an hour later. I'm so scared. But I've no one to run to. nowhere to go.

I love her so much. 

But she'd rather be with someone else and honestly it sucks so fucking hard. I hate him so much. What he's done to her, the way he plays her like a fool and all I can do is sit by and watch her drift away from me as I try my very hardest to swim against the current, to hold on to all that I have. 

All I've thought about the entire morning was how she could tell me she loved me right after he sent her home. I placed my trust in her. I gave her my all. I thought things were okay. She wanted out with her friends and I was okay with that. All that mattered to me was her, and I thought I had her completely. I keep apologizing because I just feel it's my fault, for letting her go four months ago. I shouldn't have. It's my fault and I'm just a failure through and through. 

When we're together, it just feels so natural. Even after four months of absence, we just fall right back together and it feels so fucking right. And I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself if I let that go. But I guess she has and I don't want to. Maybe I just don't want to see myself let go, I don't want to face reality. I don't want to constantly try to outrun my fears, my memories with her because I know I'll lose. I always do. 

Frankly, I don't know where to go from here. Maybe I just don't want to go anywhere at all. And honestly, I'd rather end my own life than see her with someone else knowing that at the end of the day, I couldn't even hold on to what meant the most to me.
