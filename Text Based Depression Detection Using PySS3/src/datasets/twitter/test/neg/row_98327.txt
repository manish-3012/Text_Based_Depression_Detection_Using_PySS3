Practice makes perfectI've been suicidal for 30+ years - that whole, "it gets better" or "it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem" just doesn't ring true.  I've tried twice in the past, both times by hanging, but I was young and dumb and unintentionally botched both attempts.


What's stopped me from trying again is that stupid fear of dying - and that uncontrollable/unconscious bodily reaction that tries to keep you from dying.


But for the past couple of weeks I've been building up courage, practicing and getting comfortable.  I've always been afraid of heights, but for some reason, live in a penthouse apartment on the 23rd floor.  In the past, just going out on the balcony and looking down gave me that stomach-in-the-throat falling feeling.  But for the past month or so, I've been spending more time out there...looking over for longer periods, bending over the railing, jumping up and down.  And finally, last night, I crawled over the railing and sat on top of the railing with my feet dangling over the side.  I was still a bit freaked - and I'll probably do it again soon - but it felt freeing and liberating just climbing over the railing.  My body/mind wasn't controlling me anymore.


Eventually, I want to get to the point where my flight response - the fear - will be as dead to me as the rest of my feelings.  Yes, I'm in therapy; yes, I'm on medication; both of which are helping me be more and more objective about the pointlessness of both paths.


I hope on the way down I will finally enjoy a new experience, if only for a few seconds.
