My ex girlfriend of six years called me after a year of no contact, said she regretted breaking up with me, then texted me for two weeks before ghosting me. I am on the verge of a total breakdown.tldr: I ruined an incredible 6 year relationship due to a bad drinking problem. Fixed it and started to get my life together but still missed ex terribly and struggled to settle with someone else. She calls out of nowhere and tells me she regrets leaving me, wishes she could see me and wants to try to build what we had before. After two weeks of talking suddenly ghosts me and won't answer the phone. I don't know what to do.

Between the ages of 20-26 I was with a girl who I considered to be my future wife. I adored her, we travelled all over the world together, four continents, got through college together and had an apartment. She was my ideal woman in every way and I clicked with her like I've never clicked with anyone else.

When I was 24 I fell into a drinking problem caused by a lot of childhood trauma that I went through, this is my biggest regret in life, it got worse and worse over two years until my ex lost all attraction to me and just wanted a normal life, so left. At the time I was devastated, I knew that I'd never forgive myself for losing her and I did a lot of begging and promising to never drink again, go to AA etc. It was too late, she'd already met someone else and moved out of our apartment to be with him.

I have spent the last 15 months rebuilding my life, I haven't had any alcohol for 7 months now and the other 8 months were almost entirely sober but with the occasional slip up in dark times. I've turned my life around somewhat, started applying for better jobs, finally got my drivers licence, have some new friends and started hitting the gym. I have had a few little messages here and there from my ex just asking how I was, but I mainly ignored them because it hurts to talk to her as a friend. I tried going on some dates but I really, honestly still miss her quite a lot and find it hard to picture my life with someone else.

Three weeks back I started getting frantic calls from my ex one evening, after the fifth or so call I decided to pick up. She was not happy, she said she kept thinking about when she walked out on me and felt so much regret. She said she wasn't happy, had no one to lean on and kept thinking about how 'at our best we had that thing people spend their lives searching for'. She even said it was mainly her fault that we broke up and that she wanted to see me. She said she understood if I didn't want to see her right away but she would give me time, take it slow and hoped that I'd come and see her in the next month or two. I had to pinch myself, I couldn't have dreamed this any better. I told myself that it was too good to be true, and spoke with her every couple of days for two weeks. She always contacted me first and we really clicked, a couple of nights we talked for hours and she was laughing and flirting. For the first time in a year I was genuinely happy, people were noticing that I was happier and looking like my troubles were finally leaving me. Then suddenly she stopped. I left it five days and then gave her a call, no answer. Sent a text, no answer. Just like that she ghosted me. I am so devastated I don't know what to do with myself. What do I do now?!
