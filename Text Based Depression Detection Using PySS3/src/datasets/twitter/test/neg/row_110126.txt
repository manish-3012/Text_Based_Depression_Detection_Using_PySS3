I don't know if it is going to get better.I've been thinking a lot lately about suicide. I keep telling myself I'd never have enough courage to actually end it all but this weekend I may have reached a point that I just don't know if I can deal with any of it anymore. 

I'm 25, I have (had?) a promising career in the beer industry. This weekend I got pulled over on my way home from the guy's house that I've been in love with for the last 6 months, who has a girlfriend. He doesn't know how I feel, actually he thinks I like his best friend. Well I joined the DWI club on Friday, spent the night in jail and will probably lose my license unless my lawyer works some magic. 

I know you're probably thinking this is not a big deal, it's just a DWI. A lot of people have them, but this is the icing on the cake. I already owe $150,000 for my undergrad degree from Purdue. I already can't afford my loan payments (Interest only $730/month once I have to start fully paying ~$1400/month), I'm over 2 months behind on them. And I haven't paid anything on my Federal loans at all. The lawyer I hired is going to charge me a $2500 flat fee. Plus everything else that is going to come with this situation. I have a small amount of credit card debt. Mostly it's the school loans that are killing me. 

I realize this is all my fault. I put myself in this position. I shouldn't have gone out of state, I shouldn't have driven home Friday night. I can't talk to anyone about how I am feeling, they'll just think I'm crazy. I'm alone. I work 2 jobs, and I feel like since I quit one bar job to go to something better (because that place was going to kill me) I have been week by week chasing the money I need to make to stay afloat. And this new job I have, I feel inferior at. I have been serving/bartending for 5 years, and I have always thought I was very good at it. Until this job. It's a fancier restaurant, I don't know foodie food as well as I thought. I am struggling, and then not getting the shifts I need because of it. I only work 30hrs/wk at my day job, and only make $13/hr. So about $1,200/month after taxes. That doesn't even cover my bills. Let alone DWI fees. And my backed up loans. And the fact that I'm going to need a new car soon. 

I don't have anyone to borrow any money from. My family is lower-middle class. My mom lives in my aunts house for free, and my aunt has cancer. 

I don't want to tell anyone at work about the DWI, because I was probably going to be getting promoted into sales soon, which I have been wanting since I started at my company. This has happened to  me so many times, I'll get so close to what I've been working for, and then either I fuck it up, or it gets fucked up for me. 

I haven't dated anyone - even gone on a date, since last March, when my boyfriend abruptly broke up with me and fairly destroyed my faith in relationships. I am so lonely, and I live with probably the most in love couple in the world. 

I have recently realized I am everyone's back up. By this I mean if they're having issues with their sig. other they come to me. If they need to get over someone, they'll try to hang out with me on a sexual level. I am sick of being everyone's back up. It's like they know I'm vulnerable, and lonely and they can fuck with my head. The guy I'm in love with might not know he's doing this, but he might. He did something last week that made me think he is trying to keep me around *in case* they ever break up. Which is also awful. There was someone else I was interested in, and he seemed interested also, until I found out through friends he was just trying to make his ex jealous. 

My grandmother, who was the most important person in the world to me, recently passed away. I'd never had anyone even remotely close to me die before, and I am not dealing with it well. 

One night I was fairly drunk at my apartment, and I broke a beer bottle (on accident). I decided to try to cut my arm open with the broken glass. I still have the cut all the way up my arm. I wore long sleeves for about a week, and then told people it was from my cat. I tried to slit my wrists when I was in 7th grade (my current roommate is actually who stopped me) and when my mom found out she told me I did it the wrong way (I cut across, not the long way). I don't have any insurance so I can't go talk to anyone. And I'm fairly certain my roommates and best friends are sick of my crazy emotions. And the one friend that I know would be there for me no matter what lives in NYC right now. I want someone to curl up on a couch with and just cry into their arms and I don't have anyone. 

I just don't know what to do. And I'm sorry that this is so non-sequential.
