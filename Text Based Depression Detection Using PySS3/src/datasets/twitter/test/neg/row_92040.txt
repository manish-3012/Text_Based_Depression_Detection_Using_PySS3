Anyone else worried about their password protected phone/laptop/...?I'm 30 and have been struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and, because of that, a drug addiction, for at least 10 years now

The only thing keeping me here is the fact that it would literally kill my mother if I took my own life, and so instead I hold on for dear life, not for me, but for the people who still seem to care and show no signs of stopping

I've gone through so much therapy, as an inpatient as well as on a weekly basis, and nothing really seems to help, I don't want anything from life, I want distraction from the pain, that's it. What pain? I was abused as a child, am severely emotionally and socially underdeveloped, yet intelligent enough to be aware of all this, though uncapable of changing.

I do admit, there has been change, but it feels like I'm literally crawling a marathon, where the majority I started with is already half way done or finished, I'm just lying here, dragging my bloody corpse forward with the only onlookers remaining being people looking in disgust at how much I fucked up.


Enough ramblings though, my main question for you guys is:


What do you do with your tech devices? If I ever do kill myself I want my mom to have whatever memory of me she wants. It might hurt a lot to have a digital encyclopedia of me available at all times, but I can't imagine leaving her NOTHING would be much better... worse, if anything.


Anyone else considered this? Do you have your devices locked? Will you leave instructions with passwords etc? Or maybe you don't want people close to you to find out all the shit you've been up to? Or they'd be hurt even more if you left all those memories behind?

I'd probably reset my browsing history for good measure though lol
