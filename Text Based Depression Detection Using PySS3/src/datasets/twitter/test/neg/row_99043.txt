Coping with a lifetime of suicidal thoughtsBefore I share my experience, I'd like to call attention to you caring folks that I am **not** at an immediate risk for suicide, just in case you are able to help someone that is at more risk than I.

I am a 30 year old female that has been living with suicidal thoughts and attempts since the age of four.  I'm not sure what caused me to start these thoughts so early, but I clearly remember trying to eat "poison crayons" in an effort to end my life.  Fortunately, crayons are non-toxic.  

Throughout my childhood, it was made clear that neither of my parents particularly cared about me, and at times they displayed outright disgust for me.  My mother often ignored me, and my father often screamed at me for being too loud.  My mother's focus was on religion, and my father's was on taking and manufacturing illegal drugs.  I often felt invisible, and when attention was paid to me, it was because I did something wrong, so I tried very hard to do well in school and be as quiet as possible so that I would not cause my parent's anger or disgust towards me.  

As a teenager, I found a bit of solace in taking illegal drugs and promiscuity.  Eventually, my father was arrested for his illegal activities, so  my mother divorced him.  Shortly after, she married another man.  He did not like me, so I had to move in with my boyfriend at the time's parents.  They did their best to help, however, they had chemical abuse issues in their family as well, so help was limited.  I greatly appreciate them giving me a place to live and food to eat so I could finish school.  As an escape, I married a boy from school and we were married for a couple of years.  Turns out he is gay, so we divorced, since neither could make the other happy.
 
Throughout all this, I had serious thoughts of suicide a couple of times a year.  The rest of the time, I felt fine, and was able to live a somewhat normal life, despite the challenges of my childhood.

Today, I live a fairly 'normal' life.  I live on my own and have a full time job.  I have been unsuccessful in romantic relationships because I believe that I have a love addiction/avoidance problem.  Currently, I have an acquaintance type relationship with each of my parents.  They rarely tell me anything of importance going on in their lives, and I do the same.  Any communication between us is superficial in nature, for example, the weather, or current movies/television.  Most of my 'friendships' are similar.  I don't share much about myself because I have deep trust issues.  I am afraid of being betrayed, because I have been betrayed many times, since I trust the wrong people.  

I have seriously attempted suicide more times than I can remember.  Obviously, none have worked.  Most of the time I am thankful for this, and sometimes I wish that one of the times had worked.  Many times when I feel sad and alone, I think about how much I would like to die.  I don't tell anyone because I don't want to call attention to myself.  I feel that if I tell anyone how sad I feel, I will become even more socially isolated.  

Today, I am feeling very sad, and was thinking about suicide.  I know it will pass, as it always does.  Within a few days, I'll be back to 'normal.'  I am isolating from my social group.  What I would like is a friend to hug me and just sit with me while I cry.  I'm too afraid to let anyone see me weak, so I'll just wait it out alone.  

Hopefully soon I will become tired of this and go to therapy.  Until then, just typing all this out makes my heart feel a heck of a lot lighter.  

If you have read all of this, I thank you, and offer an 'online hug.'
