im pretty sure im back at my brink againi dont want to make this too long because i'll just rehash shit that's making me miserable. 

basically my foundation in life is crumbling. i am living in a very unsafe situation with a narcissistic, abusive, alcoholic mother. my brother is 10 years older than i am. he and his wife were my foundation in life. in the past year my brother succumed to similar habits of my mother, and began doing cocaine and drinking. 2 weeks ago his wife left him after 12 years. it's really painful to watch him lose himself. my long term S/O and i are also separating. he has been my best friend for years. my entire fucking reason for waking up. and within about a month i've lost all 3 people. 

my mother and i are being evicted because she is consistently late on rent. i have enough savings to get myself out, and with my job i can sustain myself, but that would mean i am unable to go to post-secondary in Sept 2016. i do not have interest in taking out loans, i'd need $15000 in student credit and $15000 in OSAP (government loans that have less interest) in order to live by myself if i left THEN and not 1 year BEFORE my intended move out date.

i don't know what to fucking do. i've lost my best friend. i have nobody to reach out to because they're either out of my life or dealing with their own issues. i'm under 18 until December and therefore i can't just take off and survive. pretty sure i can't even sign a lease. i'm seriously considering killing myself just so i can end all of this.
