I hate having to force people to hangout or like me, this is what depression is made out of. Tears won't stopAnytime I feel any kind of joy from socializing it always turns out I'm a just a trash bag that will eventually get filled with lies and friendships and relationships ending. I then get thrown up like always. I went out for the first time in a while and felt a glimmer of hope but today is what reminded me why I stay alone and shut people out. I sit here all day trying to text and call my "friends" but no one wants to hang or talk or is busy. people like me in the moment or for a few weeeks but I always fade. I just texted a lot of people embarrassing myself trying to be happy and see people but it's a waste of time. I have no one who cares about me deeply, I just want love. I hate my life.
