i'm going to tell my GP about the suicidal thoughts because I don't have a therapist yet.Suicidal thoughts and plans have been getting more and more intense and I know I have medication that could kill me, but I've been trying to plot how without having a painful, gross death. (Most pill overdoses don't let you just go painlessly to sleep. No. It's a horrifying, lonely, and terrible way to go.)

I've decided that I want a peaceful, dignified death. With loved ones, maybe in a hospital, with medication that they can give you to take away the pain and the panic. I've been through a hell of a lot in this life, and that is part of why I get suicidal sometimes. But honestly, that's also why I deserve a peaceful death. I've suffered enough. 

I mean I can't guarantee I won't just die of a heart attack or something, but you get my drift. My chances of the ideal death increase with no suicide.


So I'm going to tell my GP because I see her this Wednesday. I'll just tell her I've been having the thoughts, drifting in and out in severity, with some planning. I am certain that they won't be like 'off to the psych ward with you' since the psych ward mainly exists for the point when I'm going to kill myself right now. I'm not there. I just know I could.

That's a good step, right? 

Suicidal thoughts are medically relevant and someone needs to know I've been having them. She will probably refer me to a therapist and/or a psychiatrist and take note of it. 

You don't get carted off because you are having occasional thoughts, but it is important for a medical professional to know.

I'll tell her.
