I wish I didnâ€™t existIâ€™ve battled with depression on and off since I was an early teenager but I can honestly say that at this point, Iâ€™m truly fed up with my life in every way. I no longer find enjoyment in anything. Yesterday my boyfriend - who truly was the only light in my dark world, has ended things with me. It didnâ€™t end nicely either. Whatâ€™s more soul crushing is the reasons he ended it stem from issues caused by a chronic condition that I suffer from and have completely no control over. He doesnâ€™t seem to understand that. He thinks Iâ€™m selfish and inconsiderate because of this. This is the second time heâ€™s broken up with me in the past two months for the same reason. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts during a period last year for other reasons, and again this year after the break up. I just feel completely worthless and I have for a long time. Not even the person that I love wants to be around me anymore. I feel like the worse person in world. This is just the cherry on the cake because I donâ€™t see anything good or happy in my life anymore and I donâ€™t have any hope for the future. I think itâ€™s come to the time where I truly want to simply end my life and avoid the pain and misery that Iâ€™m feeling....I have no zest for life anymore and Iâ€™m honestly ready to go.
