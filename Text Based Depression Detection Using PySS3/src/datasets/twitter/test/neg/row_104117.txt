I don't want to live like thisI've been sick since March with probable COVID. I'm still short of breath, exhausted all the time, joint pain, chest pain, lack of taste, etc. I literally work and sleep. I can't keep up with housework. I can't do anything I enjoy. I can hardly take care of my cat.   
I keep telling people I don't want to live like this. I don't know what they think I mean but I mean I'd rather die than live like I am. This isn't living. I had severe depression before all of this and it's gotten exponentially worse. Impossible to see doctors face to face.   
Why couldn't I have just died?
