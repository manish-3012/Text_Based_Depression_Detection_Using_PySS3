They only care about you when your suicidal and depressedSo like the rest of you here Iâ€™m waiting for the day I finally snap and end myself from this retched world Iâ€™ve had to experience death to family members no dad and all types of bullshit and the friends that were actually real and understood either moved away or were fake all along. So Tell me why itâ€™s only when I post the times Iâ€™ve almost ended myself they care but anything else nothing I asked them on snap if anybody wanted to hang cause Iâ€™m bored as shit not one person said anything but they claim theyâ€™re my friends. By the way it was 75 people who saw that shit. In my opinion death is only when we are truly free and Fuck High School.
