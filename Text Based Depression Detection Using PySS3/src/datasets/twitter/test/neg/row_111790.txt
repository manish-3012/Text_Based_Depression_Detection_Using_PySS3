A very long post that has to do with a verbally abusive dad who had a stroke who I don't loveDamnit reddit, went down as I was about to submit but in a way good thing it did, I revised and added more details. I was thinking of posting on r/depression 
becaude it's more "alive" but I didn't for some reason. Was thinking of posting both here and there but that's up to mods.

I always believed details are crucial, I always put thought into things. It helped put whoever I'm explaining it to in the scenario (I would hope). So the extreme details here are normal for me.

Where do I even start. The very beginning? Feels too far back even though I like story telling - kind of. So here's some details about me: 20 years old, college student, no job because no one will hire me for some unknown reason (had a job for a week but was lied to about hours so I had to quit to make it to my class hours), live with family, stayed in a corner with 2 friends in high school so super anti-social and it only got worse after high school, managed to ruin several girl friendships (not girlfriends) by leaning on them for emotional support, absolutely no girlfriend experience. I live in Southern California and was aiming to be an airplane pilot but costs, lack of knowing where to go, etc stopped me this past week.

So 3-4 years ago my dad suddenly because verbally aggressive to all of us in the course of a week, getting mad at small things which is semi-normal but then suddenly spewing out hurtful insults we as a family never expected, and he still denies it. He's been more accepting of it saying he won't do it lately this year but he still does when angry (difficult to tell but the and motions and tone make it obvious, the why is explained below. So fast forward to this year, March 30. I am on spring break for a week from college and just took an english midterm and felt good (didn't do good but I still passed the class with a B because essays). Dad was having trouble walking and mixing up names for the past day and in the morning of the 30th he is rushed to hospital. Turns out it's a stroke. I visit after a few days so he's settled in and I visit more and more, and focusing on school less. 2-3 weeks later insurance says its time to move to shit rehab center so he's there for some time and I visit. He wants to go home which is understandable. Dr there "discharges" him saying "he does not meet the skills" when **they are** the ones that should be helping. Hes given 48 hoursto get out otherwise we have to pay $245 a day he's there when the rejection of discharge needs 72 so he comes anyway. All he could say was "deedee ah or he deedee dee" so go figure. He still can't really talk and his breath is horrifyingly bad but if you tell him that he gets angry and blames you. For his own breath. But he can brush and eat by himself. You'd gave better luck decoding hieroglyphics than knowing what he said. But I put up with it and tried my best most of the time. I helped a lot with being there when speech and physical therapists arrive but he turns on me just as quick, like he always wants to make a fight of something. He tried getting physical once which was somewhat funny since he had a half working hand and I have two hands to defend myself.

Also I should mention that after spring break I spoke with a professor who helped a bit and took me to the campus psychiatrist office so I saw an intern a few times but the help wasn't optimal, appointments are 2 weeks apart and now my usual guy is gone for the fall semester. Going is free it's just ahhhhhhh a new person, they won't know my movements and facial exprressions I had with the other guy when talking. I want to day I went and opened up to professor because I reached my limit and mental capacity but I don't know now.

Skip to today and it's where I've had enough and would be willing to do whatever to get him not necessarily to die but just out of the home into a nursing home or something. Just be gone from here until I get some stuff straightened because right now it's my life that's starting and he won't let me. Remember that I leaned more towards visiting him than school so I didn't pass Spanish 2 and barely passed a history of Spain class. I don't feel loved at all at home. My mom says don't say that I love you but does she really? I'm the one being blamed for leaving windows and things open/on when I didn't go near them.

I have a great gaming pc but I can't even use it because dad (it feels wrong calling someone like this a "dad") is always watching tv, sometimes to on purpose annoy me and then wants me off by 10 so it's unfair and then puts the blame on me saying whatever he's saying with his stroke face saying it's my fault for today. My career choices are expensive, I have no job experience, my age group gets no benefits, I've got no one to love, no one gives a shit about me here, my mom is just selfish and only cares for sister, sister is a total bitch towards me when I've done nothing. She's in her age of attitude and rebellion but it's bad because parents didn't listen to my advice to help her behave so now she thinks she can say and do mostly whatever, and sometimes gets away with it because mom prefers her greatly over me. Also mom lost her job a few weeks ago, her last day to work is mid August so we're all basically screwed. Thanks ohama you were a garbage president who helped only your own kind.

There's more I could say but I can't remember now so I'll leave this self note here. 

Also I tried the 741741 number but I messed up. I'm not used to texting people because I rarely ever get messaged anymore so I tested them and was browsing here and didn't reply in time because phone was on silent and conversation reset. It happened again while I went to shower because I wasn't sure what happened but I think I've given up on that one. Also FYI I'd rather not call unless I have to since everyone can hear, even if mom and sister are out shithead dad is still here. I actually spoke with my mom saying don't be surprised if you open the door and find me hanging and she replied wit don't day things like that, depression isn't real, just think happy and it'll be cured, stupid things like that. 

So the meaning of my post today is that I find it unfair I want to use my PC and be alone and my mood will be happy. That's it, I don't do drugs or anything or need money, I just like playing games and chatting to friends. This is my idea of being a good boy, not going out to rob or stab someone. Dad thinks its fair to watch tv all day (I leave room and watch videos on my phone in another room but PC games are so much better on my stress and mood levels) and then tell me to basically gtfo at 10pm when I haven't used it much all day to begin with. So here I am with no question other than what even are my options? What's there to live for? What do you make of this story? Who's to blame for anything?
