I just want the pain to stopHi, 

So a little bit about me--I am currently in medical school but have been struggling from the start. Just wanted to vent about how much I hate how unforgiving this field can be at times, feeling very hopeless and lost about what to do. Since starting school, I struggled academically quite a lot..had to remediate two summer courses, and now, found out I didnâ€™t pass one of my board exams, and retaking will delay my graduation by a year. I have days where I feel okay, like â€œlet me forget the past, move forward,â€ but sometimes I wonder, is it even worth it at this point? Even if I kill my exams moving forward, will program directors at residency programs just look at the mess of my past and throw my apps away? Will I even get a job after finishing this all? Just so heartbroken, donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s with working so hard for the next two years if it will get me nowhere, but at the same time, itâ€™s not like I have other career options. I donâ€™t know how I let it get this bad, Iâ€™ve been a good student my whole life until medical school, I literally feel like I have no purpose anymore and will be miserable forever. On top of this all, I am in severe debt. My head is spinning so much, I just want this all to stop, I am tired of the pain, I am tired of studying, I just want to be happy again but feel like I never will be again. I just want it all to stop. I am talking to a professional about my feelings but some days it just gets really bad, you know? I just don't know what to do.
