The only thingAt the point the only thing that keeps me alive is my mother. She loves me so much and so deeply that I cannot imagine killing my self because of the toll it would take on her. 

I recently lost my job and live in a city where I have no friends and I just can't do it anymore. I don't know how I could possibly ever be happy. Whenever I think about a new job or moving to a new place I just think about how unhappy I will be there. 

I have tried 3 times in 5 years to kill my self and I have backed out every time. But this time I am not sure. I feel as if no matter what I will continue to be so unfit for life. Like I will never be totally ready to live.
