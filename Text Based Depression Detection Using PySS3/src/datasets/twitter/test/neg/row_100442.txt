It's time to say goodbye.ommit suicide, because I'm not worth the space, resources or time I use everyday. I'm merely a burden on everyone I'm around, especially my family, my parents; who have supported me unconditionally, my siblings who have always been there for me, my extended family who are always there.

I serve no purpose. I have no goals. I benefit no one. I'm nothing more than a useless waste of a human being. I have no motivation to achieve, no intrinsic or extrinsic value, and certainly no appreciable reason to live.

This has been long coming. I've always had plans, motives, or means, but never all at once. I'm here now. To say sorry, for wasting the time of everyone I know and care about -- even though I'm not worth the time of day. I'm not long for this world, and this world hasn't longed for me in a while. So here's my last hurrah, I'm done, finished, I can't drag on any further.

Goodbye.
