I just drank a lot and took several sleeping pillsI've known a lot of people who attempted something and they felt regret and called someone and got help. All I feel is relief. I hopefully won't have to wake up ever again. I won't have to deal with my shithole of a life, losing friends for no reason, the love of my life randomly falling out of love with me, having no job and no idea what I would ever want to so and not be miserable. I won't have to deal with anymore pain. I won't have to read another redditor saying "that happened." Okay that last one is probably my final joke ever so dome laughs would be nice. I just needed a place to say this all. Goodbye, hopefully.
