Anyone else struggling with PTSD and suicide? (Warning:novel ahead)I have had major depression my whole life, it runs in my family, but over the past 3 years I had started to "lose time" I would simply not remember periods of time or be soas like a black out. I was also starting to disconnect for days at a time. I knew what was going on but I didn't feel anything I was simply moving because I knew I was supposed to. It was terrifying and I had no idea what was going on. I told a friend I wanted to end it and he called the police I was hospitalized and put on antidepressants for the first time. I was diagnosed with ptsd and they explained in greater depth that what I was experiencing were dissociative episodes.  When I overload on stress my brain makes me go somewhere else or shields me from everything by blocking how I feel, but it only made me more scared. I am terrified of myself, driving when I am stressed is a nightmare,  as I can dissociatiate completely and come to in a different place entirely.  I was released from the hospital and told to continue taking the antidepressants. After about two weeks I started the worst depression spiral I have ever had. Writing usually calms me down so I started to write what turned out to become a goodbye and a plan. I set the date for today, my birthday, because I didn't want my family to be sad during their birthdays or xmas. Leading up to this week all my symptoms have gotten worse because I am stressed. I have told my friends and they know and are going to stay with me but I am struggling because nothing is better in the six months from when I set the date til now and I am tired of feeling scared of myself. Just wondering if anyone can relate.
