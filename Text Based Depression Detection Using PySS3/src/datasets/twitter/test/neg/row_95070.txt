Iam 14 and i just want to dieAlready at the age of 11, I once thought about suicide (i dont know why) and then my life started to fall apart ... my parents are too strict with me, my sister still annoys me, I'm depressed almost every night, I have a lot of bad grades in school and because of that everyone is laughing at me and now I really don't know what to do with my life ... pls help.
