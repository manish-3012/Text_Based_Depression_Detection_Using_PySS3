It's been 22 years and I still don't want to be alive...I waited patiently for what others promised me. A better future, an escape from my past that was filled with sexual abuse and assault as a child and even in my teenage years, constant bullying, strict parents who blamed me for the bruises I came home with, a so called best friend whose father molested me while she watched, a love unreturned, a loneliness I can't escape...

It's been 22 years and I am tired of waiting, tired of hoping for a better tomorrow, tired of being called selfish for wanting to leave this world, tired of doing my best and never being enough, tired of feeling dirty, used and unwanted...

I don't want to wait anymore, I want to go...because the pain never stops...
