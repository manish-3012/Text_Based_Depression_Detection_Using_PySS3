Is there a way to time your suicide in a relatively less painful way for your betrothed?I've made plans so that no one squeamish Would find me. But I am now thinking about timing, and what kind of timing would hurt close ones least.

Usually my desire waxes and wanes with my serious medical condition. I'm beginning to think beyond that into when will be the least painful for my fiance (would after the wedding be nicer, to have that memory? as soon as possible? Or after we do some meet and greet of the family? I want him to have some nice memories, but dont want to make him think I did it because of the wedding. 

And what if the 'right time' comes to best spare his feelings but in that moment im not being smotthered by the heavy black velvet of crushing depression longing for release? What if I feel 'eeh' at that certain time? What if I dont feel that bad again until after the wedding, certainly ir would be worse for him to have a suicided newlywed.

I do want to spend the rest of my life with him. Its just that some circumstances make me sometimes desperately wish that it was over, painlessly, easily, soon.
