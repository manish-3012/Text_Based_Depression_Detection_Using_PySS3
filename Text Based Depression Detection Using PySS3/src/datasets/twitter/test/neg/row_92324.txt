I'm all alone and the thoughts won't go awayI'm a guy who's almost 20 and simply can't build and maintain meaningful relationships. Yes, I have friends, but I don't really feel close to any of them. I used to have two friends who I could talk to about anything. Now, those two barely talk to me and if they do it's usually because I reached out first. It's gotten to the point that I can't even bring myself to take the effort to reach out to those friends, or any of my friends for that matter, because nobody cares about me enough to talk to me. 

I know I sound like a needy bitch but I don't think some human contact is too much to ask for! My other problem is my intense social anxiety which prevents me from making new friends or generally socializing with new people. I can't bring myself to say something to somebody I don't know and even if I do end up in a conversation with somebody, I can never think of things to say that would continue the conversation.

Obviously this makes it incredibly hard to find a girlfriend. I have yet to even go on a date and I'm alm,ost done with college for god's sake. And please don't come at me with the "you have time, you're still young" bs. Simply put, having been single this long is not normal. 

All of this, along with a nice dose of depression, is what's making me think long and hard about killing myself. Whenever I drive, I usually have 3-4 fantasies about veering off the road. So far I've been able to fight the urge, but idk how much longer I can keep fighting. I just don't have the energy left. I need some help and there's nobody around.
