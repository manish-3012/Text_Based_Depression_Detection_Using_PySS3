Going to kill myself before I turn 18I just made this account right now and i am soon going to turn 18 so i have about 3 months to try some things i enjoy. I fucked up too much in life, i just fucked up. I took drugs from peer pressure,  photos got posted online and now it's just a ticking time bomb until i am caught, i really really really don't want to live with this being able to get me at any time, i feel sick from stress everytime i see my family knowing that if they knew i tried drugs, they would hate me. I don't want to live, i'm a complete joke, i died people would care for 1 day but thats it, no one would care after that, so whats the point in living if you're not going to leave a mark on the world.  I'm so afraid of growing up and being alone, i really don't want to, to others i am a really social and talkative person, people see me as someone who's probably got no worries and is incredibly chill, but i'm so fucking afraid and im just putting on an act, i know i have no future ahead of me. I just hope life changes in the next few months
