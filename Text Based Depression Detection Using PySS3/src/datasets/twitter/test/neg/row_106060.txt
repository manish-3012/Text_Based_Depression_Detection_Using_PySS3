My bipolar life is sad and I lost myselfHi. I decided to register, because... I don't really know, I feel lost, at this point in my life I feel like I need to commit suicide like it's my responsibility of sort? I know it sounds stupid, but... I can't help it.

Iâ€™m a 23 years old female from Poland. I've always been "strange" and didnâ€™t get along with other people. It's hard to describe it, I've just always felt like an alien, had different hobbies (paranormal stuff, reading, rock music etc.) than people who surrounded me. When I tried to communicate with others I usually failed, at first people seem to like me, but then I guess they see that I'm different. I can't have a normal conversation with most of them, because I often don't know what to say next. Iâ€™m not into make-up, fashion and not into typical â€œmaleâ€ stuff either (sports, cars, whatever). I donâ€™t know if it matters. I just want to know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I was diagnosed with bipolar, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily make you weird or socially awkward I guessâ€¦ One psychologist suggested Aspergerâ€™s, but at the time, I thought it couldnâ€™t be that.

Now I changed my mind, I did a test, which said it may be the case. Whatâ€™s more, I lost myself in a sense that since I was diagnosed with bipolar Iâ€™ve stopped doing things I once loved, like writing, singing, reading books, drawing. I only had one psychotic episode, the rest of my life is neutral/depression. 
Thereâ€™s one weird thing. When I dream, I can feel really happy, motivated and optimistic. It doesnâ€™t happen each night, but I regularly dream of wanting to do something or doing it and these activities are what I once enjoyed, but as soon as I wake up, these nice feelings go away, they disappear just like thatâ€¦ Is it common for depressed/bipolar people? Itâ€™s so pathetic that my dreams are more vivid than my life.

And Iâ€™m seriously scared of my future, scared of getting a job. Iâ€™m a student now, but I have 2 more years and I will have to look for a job. It scares me, because nowadays you have to be open, social and know how to communicate with people to have a good job, at least it seems like it. And I canâ€™t see myself working with others all day, being judged for awkwardness. I donâ€™t believe in myself, because I became a loner over the years, I tried to kill myself 3 times, I canâ€™t have a relationship longer than 1 year. People ignore me when I walk into the room and say â€˜hiâ€™. Iâ€™m not hated, but Iâ€™m not liked either. I feel I have nothing to offer. I hate myself for being what I am, I donâ€™t matter. Even my friends ignore my messages sometimes and I have like 4 of them. When my parents dieâ€¦ I will have no one. I donâ€™t want to experience this awkward, empty existence anymore. I feel itâ€™s what I have to do, like suicide is my biggest role in this life. 

What I wrote is just a summary, just a tiny part of what bothers me.
