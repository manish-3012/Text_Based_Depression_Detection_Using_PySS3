i can do it nowThings have gotten so bad, and I've been sober for so long, that after having a drink because it's my birthday (turns out I'm not an alcoholic... abusive people around me drove me to drink), I can tell that if I really wanted to, I could jump if I just got drunk.  I'm ready to go.  I have one last hope, but if it doesn't work out, I will get drunk and jump.  I have the location; all you need to do is lay down and "roll" off... jumping is too against survival instinct.
