Is it bad to have a long list of problems/worries and things that make you anxious 24/7?Around 2 years ago I made a list where I could write down all my problems or worries whenever I feel like it, also itâ€™s a thing so IF I was to end up killing myself, I could leave it behind for my parents to see why I have killed myself, and that it was not at all their fault.
