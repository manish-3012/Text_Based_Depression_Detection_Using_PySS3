Just another fucked up human being...Well... Hi people. I've read a lot of posts and now my moment came... I feel like a shit most of the times... I feel so stupid, undeveloped, I can't form normal human relations (probably because I'm a piece of shit)... It really feels like I'm so fucking empty... And living a life for me seems like I'm in the middle of desert in which it's not even hot... It also feels like nothing that I say is important to anybody, I also really find it hard to care for other people too... that circle is killing me... most of the people don't give a fuck about what other people are saying, they just want to talk whatever the hell they have on their mind.... I wish I can just enter other people's brains, that would help a bit, but that's impossible... I don't like anything, I play video games most of my time because that's the only thing that hardly makes me sad or something. I judge other people a lot, I'm angry for some unknown reason, other people's lives affect me from some unknown reason and it ends up with me being so damn angry... I used to think that I'm superior to some humans and now I think the opposite. I'm a huge mess and I doubt that I'm fixable. I haven't went to hospital yet, but I notice a lot of mood swings and some kind of obsessions that I'm already fucking sick of. Even the dumbest things cause mood swings for me. When I see another human that is successful or just simply creative/that has some kind of depth within him, I feel awful.  I also find myself really edgy and cringy at times. I just suck at everything. I can't see the point of living, especially not inside the mind like this one. fuck me
