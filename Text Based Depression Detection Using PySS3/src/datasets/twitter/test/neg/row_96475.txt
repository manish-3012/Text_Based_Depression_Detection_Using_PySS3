Trying to find some direction, but still feeling trapped.(This post is gonna be kind of a mess since I'm going pretty back and forth with it adding and changing parts as I go along. Sorry if it makes no sense.) 

I had a long talk with my mum this evening, during which I almost told her that I'm suicidal. I kind of wanted to, she has always been supportive and has known where to look to get help, if she was unable to help by herself.

I did manage to tell her about the breakdown I had at work over the summer, and how things have gotten worse since I lost two huge sources of support in my life (my girlfriend and therapy). I did tell her that I've been having some pretty dark thoughts but couldn't help but shy away from the extent of those thoughts.

I've been researching for weeks how to do it quickly and with as little discomfort as possible, and ways to increase my chances of success. I want her to know and I think I need her to know, but I'm scared. All the while I'm thinking about this, I'm still worrying about work. I put so much pressure on myself because my workplace is short-staffed as it is and I feel guilty about putting my coworkers in a more difficult situation.  I saw a doctor today who offered to sign me off for a few weeks to get myself back in therapy and to give my new meds a chance to get into my system and hopefully alleviate some of the side effects, which I declined in favour of a note saying to reduce my hours instead of taking me off entirely.

I just really don't know what to do, where to go from here. I'm trying to make a start on recovery but it's so difficult and I'm a little afraid of the fact that somewhere in the back of my mind, I know I have another option. No less difficult, but faster and guarantees that I'll never hurt like this again.
