...iâ€™m really thinking about doing it tonight i just wish i was strong enough to do it, iâ€™m looking at a bottle of adderall right now and iâ€™m thinking of downing the whole bottle and making this go easy, i just wish the one person i love wouldnâ€™t have betrayed me cause i know that iâ€™m just gonna keep running back to her if i try to leave so the only way to break out of this loop is just to kill myself, i feel like everyone would benefit from my death...
