Always alone, always lonelyTo the grave. That's where my empty existence will follow me. This damnable slog of working to live combined with inappropriate coping mechanisms lead to this.

A shell, as vacuous as it is vapid, wanting death. There is nothing to mourn, as whoever was inside died long ago.

Years of unsaid 'happy birthday's, decades of not even so much as touch of another, a lifetime of being alone, not comprehending why no one understands. 

Surely whoever inhabitated this shell died, only for the body to continue it's meaningless March to Oblivion.

There is nothing left. No mind to nurture, no soul to save. Just a hollow husk. Pay it no mind as you pass it by, for it you do, just for a second, it might hope.

And that is the cruelest punishment to inflict. In it's instincts, the shell knows it will never be loved, and it will die allow. To allow it to hope otherwise,

Well, you must be inhumanely wicked.
