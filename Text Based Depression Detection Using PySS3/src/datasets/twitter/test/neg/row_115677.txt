Thursday the 14thI've been planning my suicide for Thursday the 14th for about a month now. It's the day before mock exams take place, I don't even feel an ounce of stress for anything which stops me from ever putting work into anything, I've got no future. I'm too scared to take a single step out of my comfort zone and I am too anxious to ask for help. The past week I've spent the nights in bed wanting to cry so badly but nothing comes, I'm just this void of nothingness, I don't even want to talk to close friends about this because I'll just come across as attention seeking. I'm just going to see how the school day is and most probably end it all finally.
