I just donâ€™t like how the world works.I apologize if I come off as very depressed, I just wanted to get a few things off my chest. 

Like the title says, I hate how things are. I hate how people act. 

If youâ€™re tired of working at your job, people will tell you to get a new one. Tired of your house? Just find a new place to live? Certain hobby starts to bore you? Just find another one. Tired of being alive? Woah, there buddy. There must be something wrong with your brain. 

I cannot fathom how people canâ€™t understand for a second that some people just donâ€™t see life to be worth living. Ever watch a movie and half way through you just know it isnâ€™t worth your time to bother with the rest of it? Itâ€™s kinda like that. 

Itâ€™s evident that suicide is the way out of suffering. The antithesis to life is death. 

Knowing that at any moment of my choosing, I can end my life, brings me a small comfort. At least I know that no matter how bad the day is, how bad my life has been overall, if I choose; I can end it all. 

I am not going to kill myself today. I am not going to hurt my family like that, or the few friends I have. It sucks that I canâ€™t have it both ways, to escape this misery but at the same time not devastate people who are dear to me. 

So I will remain here, trapped. Gosh I truly hate how things are. 

If youâ€™re also having a rough existence, at the very least, just know that youâ€™re not alone. And I for one will not blame you for having such feelings, or lie to you and tell you that life is worth it, absolutely no one should have the right to tell you with certainty that life will be worth it. 

Thank you for reading.
