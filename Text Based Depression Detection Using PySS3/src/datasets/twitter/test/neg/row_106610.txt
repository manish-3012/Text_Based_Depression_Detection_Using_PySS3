I'm fully seeing a suicideI don't know if I'm overreacting or whatever bug I'm starting to see my own suicide full on like for a second. I'm not seeing it from just corner of my eyes but like seeing it full on. I think I got to that point where I'm that bad... seeing my own suicide fully. It can be anywhere... but the thing is it's rare for it to appear. I done so looking &amp; thought I was just overthinking it but I actually found something... it's PTSD or mental imagery. I don't think at all I have any of those things. I'm probably just overthinking things.
