I know this is weird but would anybody talk on the phone with me or Discord voice call?I feel like shit and I need to vent about it or just talk to someone about random basic things to feel a little less alone and depressed right now. To at least pretend that I have a friend. If you want to, PM me please. Iâ€™m 21, Iâ€™m not malicious Iâ€™m just fucking sad.
