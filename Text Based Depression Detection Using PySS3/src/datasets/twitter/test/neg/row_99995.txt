I beat mental illness today, for the first time in ten months. There is hope!For the first time since I did MDMA on the 3rd of January, Iâ€™ve got back that sense of rigidity, stability and purpose; my identity has returned. When I look in the mirror, I donâ€™t see a victim and recoil in disgust, I see a survivor and a warrior who has been through hell and back and has lived to tell the tale. Iâ€™m not stuck in a dissociative haze where i forget everything I have done the day after it happens. I feel free to express myself, and I donâ€™t live in constant fear of social judgement. Iâ€™m not constantly on the edge, trying to deal with the constant extreme mood swings that plagued me in the months prior to today. Hell, even a few days ago I was convinced that it would never end and I wouldâ€™ve destined for suicide.

This subreddit has some members in it who are in very dark places. Although it doesnâ€™t seem like it, THERE IS HOPE! You WILL get better, you WILL see the light at the end of the tunnel and you WILL be able to see a future where you are happy and stable. I canâ€™t tell you when that whether that happens tomorrow, in a month or in a few years, but I can promise it will happen.

Now that Iâ€™m optimistic again, I need to adjust my lifestyle to continue to feel this way. I plan to do this through exercise, hydration, socialisation and diet.

I hope this gives a sense of hope to those who are struggling, and helps someone out there who is having difficulty finding a reason to continue with the pain. It will get better, I love you all.
