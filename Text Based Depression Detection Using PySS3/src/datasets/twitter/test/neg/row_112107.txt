this is stupid &amp; i'm sorryi'm having a really horrible night so i made an account after lurking here for months

i've been dosing 150mg-250mg  on DPH multiple times a day &amp; up to 400mg every night for the past two months

i picked up a bottle of 100, 25mg DPH pills that were labeled as a sleep aid - i didn't even read the label or look up what DPH was when i bought it. melatonin wasn't cutting it &amp; figured the $3 bottle would be worth a try

one night back in october, i think, i was having a really shitty night (much like tonight) &amp; was trying not to fucking kill myseld. so i took 10 of those 25mg DPH sleeping pills. then i spent like an hour hunched over in bed pulling out my hair cause i have trich &amp; was having a fucking panic attack. finally managed to pull myself out of it &amp; was feeling very sleepy so i moved for the first time since dosing that 250mg &amp; holy shit, i was high. 

i has NO IDEA that the fuck was going on. had no idea you could get high off OTC sleeping pills or even wtf DPH was. i googled it, saw on some website that DPH is actually fucking benadryl &amp; that stupid desperate people use it to get high, that it's fucking lethal &amp; basically poison. 

well i'm a stupid desperate person. i spent the rest of that night convinced i was having a heart attack, shivering like crazy, legs twitching &amp; completely fucked out of my mind, no idea what was happening

didn't touch the shit for another two months. since i got kicked out of college last may, i've been sober. turns out i'm a fucking alcoholic, drug addict piece of shit when left to my own devices, so i moved back in with my parents &amp; got a job at a grocery store. crazy suicidal, no friends, no money

in janurary, i decide to try DPH again. cause i'm a piece of shit that will do anything to numb my shitty anxious brain, right? so i pop 150mg just to try it out a smoke some weed for the first time since i left college. it sucked, so i tried it again the next night. did that same thing every night for a couple weeks. one day i decide to bring the bottle to work with me. good thing, too, cause i have a panic attack for like, 4 fuckin hours. take 150mg &amp; a 4mg THC pill, holy shit i'm fucked.

i go down to florida for two weeks to see my sister get married. whole family is there, staying in an air b&amp;b together. we drink every fucking night, i'm drunk for a week straight. DPH trips are too obvious, can't do it around that many people. some of the worst two weeks of my life. didn't even realize i was withdrawing

i get back home, go back to work. damn i wanna drink so bad. horribly suicidal. cutting myself every day. basically going bald. i don't wanna drink anymore, fucking hate drinking. so i start taking DPH. all the time. work was okay on 150mg a few weeks ago, why not do it again? it makes everything so much easier. i don't think on doses that low. i'm just on autopilot in another fucking dimension. anxiety about how shitty i am as a person, about how shitty i am at my job, about how shitty my life is, how i fucked up the only good relationship &amp; walled out the only person who actually cared about me?? that's all replaced by anxiety of oh shit, does my boss know i'm high? customers? much less existential, easier to manage. 

that bring us to now, i've been doing this for like 2 fucking months!!!! wake up still tripping from the night before, take a couple pills when i get to work. those wear off in a couple hours, take a couple more pills on my lunch break, a couple more on my 15. go home, wait for my parents to go to bed &amp; take a bunch more. trip for a couple hours, get a hour or so of sleep, wake up &amp; do it all again. 

i have horrible hppd. i can't sit in a dark room anymore cause i can't tell if my eyes are open or closed, it all looks the same. basically blind in my right eye. there is tv static constantly, i see shit in my periphery constantly, i'll be sober &amp; get an overwhelming high feeling for a couple minutes out of no where. i don't remember entire days, i've lost two months of my life. my hands are always shaking, sharp chest pains all the time, my skin is awful &amp; my appetite has dissapeared. if i don't eat for a day, i'm basically tripping cause i get that same body load &amp; weakness you get while high

then coronavirus. i'm in new york. i work at a grocery store, i'm a "in-store shopper", we get crazy busy. working constantly, high 24/7. my dad gets sick about two weeks ago. i have to quarantine, can't work anymore. dad is fine, i don't get sick cause my body walking rat poison, still can't work.

i haven't used in two nights now. i want to die. i'm so fucking suicidal. i bought two bottles, i have 5 grams of DPH sitting a foot away from me. i know that's enough to kill me, i can slit my wrists deep enough that i'll pass out before i even start tripping. it's so close to me. honestly i'm writing this all out now to keep myself busy enough i don't do it. my parents are in the next room, i can hear my mom snoring. they've done so much for me, fucking man i love them so much. it was my dad's birthday today.

i starting cutting myself when i was in 6th grade. i was 10 years old. i'm 20 years old now, i've been dealing with this shit for 10 fuckin years now. i'm so tired, i'm so tired. i can't do another 10 years of this. 

i told my mom that i was struggling probably 10 times from 6th grade to 12th grade. in 11th grade my friend all get together &amp; tell my parents they are worried about me. i've been cutting thus whole time. four months before i graduate high school, my best friend tells the school about it. they call me in, call my parents, they say this is the first they've heard of it. had no idea, fuck that. they just didn't want to deal with it. they get me a therapist, i go two times. get on meds

holy shit, meds are amazing! for a few months. they the dark thoughts come back, my friends leave for college. i leave for college, get set up with a doctor. i move to ny, winter is dark &amp; cold. i start drinking every weekend. doctor decides to switch me from lexapro to zoloft in janurary cause SAD sucks. in march i quit my meds cold turkey. i'm drinking every day, stealing liquor from house parties, the gas station, &amp; my friends. i do horrible fucking things to people.i care about. fail every one of my classes. try to kill myself in april. i fail that too, wake up the next morning covered in blood &amp; vomit in the bathroom. no one knows, i don't tell anyone.

somehow manage to get through another year of classes before i'm kicked out of school. been living with my parents for almost a year now, sober. then i started this shit a couple months ago. in october my coworker, best friend, &amp; boy i am completely in love with tried to kill himself. i break down to my mom and tell her all of this shit. tell her i need her to get me a doctor, that i need help and i cant do it on my own. guess fucking what!!!!!!!! 

nothing happens. in november that boy &amp; i start to "date", i dont fucking know. he comes to my thanksgiving. we are both fucked up &amp; he is so fucked up. right before christmas he tells me he can't  be in a relationship, we stay friends. good fucking friends. i get back from florida in feburary and he barely talks to me. i'm so alone i'm so fucking alone. why wont he just fucking talk to me. 

fuck quarantine. everything is so fucked up right now. i'm just a weak fucking baby, i' so ashamed of myself for all of this. Fuckig dont even remember  why i started it. fuck this. fucking fuck this fuck

is this my suicide note? is that what i'm doing right now? never wrote one this frisg time. might as well write one now.


it's my dad's birthday today he is 48 i think. he was an abusive fuck when i was growing jp.but he has worked so hard to be better, he is so much better and i love him so much

i know my mom wont help me because she doesnt want ne to disappear for 10 years like my borther did after his attempt. i know that and i forgive her but i cant help but resent her for noth trying. she works so hard for allof us , i love her so much i vant think of how much it work hurt her to walk in on my dead fucking body

incant do this to them no matter how much i want to. icant kill myself until they die. i hope i get the fucking virus &amp; die or i hope my parents get it &amp; die so then i can fucking kill myself. how fucked up is that. How fucking selfish is that. i' a fucking piece of shit

i know this probably breals a lot of rules or whatever. i just need to talk to someone. i have no friends cant talk to my parents, the only person i think might understamd hates my fucking guts probably, at least enough to not want tontalk to me. typing this all ojt reallly helped. Took likentwo hours but at least i didnt dose or cut myself. i understand if this gets removed. was originalky wrote this &amp; was gonna post in r/dph but i dont think they want me there after all this. i dont know what i need. probably a hug i dont know

im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im so fucking sorry

i'm gonna go to sleep and delete this in he mornign
