idk.  

being honest/open with how I feel is something I donâ€™t know how I could do properly. I fear being judged for not wanting to live anymore and thinking that someone else can make better use of the life Iâ€™m wasting. I feel useless and lack the urge to be social. Maybe if I disappeared while still alive it would not hurt the people I love much. I realize that I have a few people that care and that Iâ€™m not as alone as I thought. I feel as if I am still. Iâ€™m the oil in water, ill never blend well and will always slip though anyoneâ€™s fingers like sand. Iâ€™m a lost cause, I have no desires, happiness is imaginary, temporary like ice cream because ice cream is good but when its gone its over until the next cone, Iâ€™m tired of wearing a mask all the time. Holding back tears I donâ€™t want anyone to see. Iâ€™m hurting myself doing so. Id rather be dead then to deal with myself and Iâ€™m sorry to the people Iâ€™ve come close to but never opened up to. I donâ€™t want anyone to think Iâ€™m weak when Iâ€™m trying my best to stay strong for myself. I talk as if Iâ€™m going to act on it. I often find myself lost in a thought of being in a binge of alcohol and pills or a mess of blood from my wrist or suffocation of some sort. I used to always say that if I were to die young it would be by my hand. Felt cool to say but there was a dark truth to it. Iâ€™m going to be twenty-seven and Iâ€™m losing myself more and more each day. 

the girl that left came back into my life. I really missed her. I needed to be on my own for a while to see the bigger picture. To see that Iâ€™m a bit fucked in the head and need some type of professional help because I shouldnâ€™t be thinking like this and that I shouldnâ€™t be beating myself up for no reason. Although its always been the same things. Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shit that has no ambition, no life, socially awkward, lacks confidence, lonely, and just wants to die because the next person can probably live it so much better. Sometimes I feel like doing that one will smith movie where he donates his body parts to those he knew needed it and then killed himself with jelly fishâ€¦ I think Iâ€™ve put a lot of thought into it for no reason because I havenâ€™t acted on anything since the last time and that was about ten years ago now. Thatâ€™s a good thing right? Thatâ€™s a good thing right? Thatâ€™s a good thing right? I donâ€™t think this is life, itâ€™s a nightmare with commercial breaks you looked forward to but never sold anything worth while.
