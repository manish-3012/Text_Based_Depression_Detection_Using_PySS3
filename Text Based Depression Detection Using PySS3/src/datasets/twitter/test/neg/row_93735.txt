Ex committed suicide, want to dieSome backstory;
I have been in various abusive relationships from a young age, been to the police to try to mitigate harmful situations, been shot at in response to faliure to keep quiet about abuse, and been bullied since I started school when I was five years old.
During middle school things started to get better for a while, until I was assaulted by some of the employees of my school and subsequently bullied to the point where I spent every day with earplugs in so I couldn't hear anything my classmates said. After middle school I attended a summer program, where I first met someone who actually understood me, and I felt I understood. 
Two years later, she took her own life, recording her note and suicide on camera. I vividly remember the way her hand twitched as if beckoning me, as she tried to pull the trigger of her pistol another time. She shot herself twice in the head and died almost immediately. At the time of her death she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, her doctors also think she had DID but were unwilling to give a diagnosis because this condition is essentially a death sentence. She was on LSD, 25-I-NBOME, cannabis and cocaine at the time of her death.
She killed herself because she was also abused from a young age, bullied in and outside of school. After other suicide attempts her parents sent her to an asylum where she continued to experience assault and abuse. She took her own life when she was visiting home, knowing returning to the asylum would result in continued abuse.
I managed to graduate high school and start college before I was assaulted again, some of my classmates tried to take my life, and I ended up in a similar asylum. I was assaulted there as well, and tried to kill myself in the asylum the day after the assault while on hospital grade morphine. 
I left the state several days after, found a full time job living with my parents, and have been working ever since. I continue to experience abuse and bullying but less so than before, but I still experience suicidal thoughts. My doctors think I have DID but aren't willing to give a diagnosis because they also consider it a death sentence. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
At this point it is very surprising that I am still alive, and back in the asylum I told myself that I would wait six months and if I was still suffering I wouldn't proceed in this life. Most people with my conditions attempt suicide and many of us are successful.
If people close to me discover I am suicidal I will likely end up back in an asylum, or in prison for possession of an unregistered firearm (a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison in my state). Both of these options will only lead to more abuse and more suicidal thoughts. 
I feel like there is no way out of this situation if my personality dissociates to a suicidal one. What can I do to stay alive when the provisions for my suicide are a stone's throw from my house and I feel like my condition leaves me no escape?
