Nothing is working anymore. (A rant)Think this might actually be my last post.  I've tried so much to "fix" myself and my depression, but nothing is working.

I've tried reaching out to old friends, only to be ignored.

I've tried making new friends, only to be ridiculed/ghosted.

I've tried getting therapy, only to be shut out thanks to the pandemic.

I've even tried moving a few towns over to live with family who say they genuinely care, only to go to bed feeling the exact same way.

I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.  I'm beyond alone and frustrated with all my failed attempts to alleviate this empty feeling. 

There's a sword on display in my room and I'm so, so tempted to just stab myself with it, or maybe the bridge down the road will do.  Or I could try to get some meds on hand or something.

Actively searching for happiness is just too exhausting.
