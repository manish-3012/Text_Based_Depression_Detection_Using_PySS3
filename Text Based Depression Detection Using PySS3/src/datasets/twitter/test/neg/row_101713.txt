Girlfriend sufferingMy girlfriend suffers from panic/mood disorder, she may be bipolar but hasn't been officially diagnosed. It all stems from some fucked up shit that happened to her when she was younger and her parents haven't helped one bit. She started expereincing panic attacks in high school and alienated a lot of her friends because of it. Whenever she gets a bad mood swing and gets really depressed she always blames herself for whatever, and says this is why I have no friends, etc. 

I try to tell her thats not true but at that point theres nothing I can say, I just have to ride it out until she snaps back to reality. I'm scared that I'm losing her though. She just got off medicine because it was making her gain weight. She has random breakdowns where she just gets super angry or depressed and i get the brunt of it. I really love her but it's been almost a year and I don't know how much I can take. She is seeing a psychiatrist but isn't in therapy at the moment. 

I just could really use some advice/encouragement from anyone. If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading
