Feel like I'm not strong enough to liveSeems like all my life has been cycles of weakness and the occasional strength. I've had suicidal thoughts since high school, but most of the time I was able to stay distracted and eventually curb them away. But I've reached a low I guess, suspect I might have a mild form of bipolar disorder, runs in the family. I get irregularly moody, highs and lows that come out of nowhere. 
It's unpredictable and exhausting. I can't get a grip on myself, I detach from some people but latch onto others, hang on to people too long. I'm still hanging on to my exes, my exes whom I should be over. But I just can't let go of anything once I feel it slipping. It makes sense to me that I'm just not fit to survive in a world where moving on is necessary. 
I try to focus on the good shit. I think part of what keeps me going is my four brothers. If I lost any of them, I would fall apart. Probably wouldn't want to put them through that.
