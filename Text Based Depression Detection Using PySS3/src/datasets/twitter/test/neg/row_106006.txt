HelpSomeone I donâ€™t personally know, but am very good friends with on Instagram just messaged me and said they attempted suicide this past weekend. Please tell me what to say to them. They are always there for me when Iâ€™m about to attempt as well. I donâ€™t want anything bad to happen to them. What do I say??? Iâ€™m literally crying my eyes out walking to class right now
