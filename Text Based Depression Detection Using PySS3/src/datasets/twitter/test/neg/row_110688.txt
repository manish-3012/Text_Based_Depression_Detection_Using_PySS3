Well hi thereHey Scuicidewatch, i am not suicidal but I just wanted your opinion about something that came up.
Every now and then when things get a little too stressful I think about how easy it would be to just jump off a building.  I am obviously not going to do it because I love my family too much, but it would be really easy.  I could just go to the top of the 9 story movie theatre around my neighborhood, and jump.  When it comes down to it, all you have to do is not think about it, and just do it.  Yah sure during the fall I'll be like, man this is stupid, but whatever, too late then.  And after that, no more stress. :D
