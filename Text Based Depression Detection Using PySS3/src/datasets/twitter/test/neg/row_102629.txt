I'm really struggling hereI don't know how to write this. It's sort of pointless, because I don't know what you can do to help. But talking is supposed to help, isn't it? And there's nobody else.

What shall I say? I'm 23, female, and I live in England. I'm autistic and agoraphobic, I haven't left the house for anything other than a doctor's appointment in months. I haven't left it to do anything fun in years. I'm entirely reliant on my parents. I can't use the phone (so I guess it's pointless suggesting the Samaritans or something, sorry). My world is very small. I don't have any friends. I don't talk to anyone. I spend all day on the computer and just watch the world go by. I live with my parents, but they have their own problems. My dad is emotionally abusive to my mum and she suspects he has frequent affairs. She can't be bothered to leave him though, even though she's told me she doesn't love him. My mum herself is borderline suicidal, she tells me that she feels numb and pointless. I also live with my brother, who's 18 and going to university in September. He doesn't speak to me and resents me because I'm autistic. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 21, so my actions were often seen as me being irrational. As a result, I ruined and continue to ruin family birthdays and Christmas, because I don't like being around people. My mum blames me for this, and since I received my diagnosis appears to have given up on me. 

I'm very alone. Sometimes I blog and it's like a shout into the void. I want to be normal, I want to go out and have friends and talk about books I've read and go see movies and be an active participant in my life. But I can't because I have this crippling anxiety which makes me throw up at the mere thought of outside, and I live in the countryside with no buses so I couldn't go anywhere if I wanted to.

I have a psychologist, who has given up on me because I was unable to get a job. He will see me in four months. He put me on new medication for my autism, but it made me so tired that I'd wake up and have to go back to bed four hours later. Then I'd sleep through again 'til morning. I can't talk about my depression in sessions because my mum or dad are there and I don't want to worry them. My mum takes me worrying her quite personally, and it makes her angry. 

I know I write as though I were a child, but in a lot of ways that's how I'm treated and it's how I've become. I know I'll never be in a relationship, one, because I'll never meet anyone, and two, because who'd put up with me? My sister, who's 20, just had her second baby and she's so happy. Her partner's dad bought them a house so they're set. They're happy.

I feel as though I should just stop. I don't see what'll change between now and my death some 50 years from now. My mum has decided when she and my dad die I'll live with my sister. I don't want to be a burden on her though. I want to be independent but it seems more and more unlikely every day.

Frankly, I'm screwed. If you've read this far I'm thankful. I don't know what to do. The only reason I'm still here is because I can't think of a way to end it that'll look like an accident and is instant. I need to not to be able to change my mind. If I take pills then they might not even kill me and I couldn't live with my mum's anger. 

Please, I don't want it to be like this, but I can't see a way out.
