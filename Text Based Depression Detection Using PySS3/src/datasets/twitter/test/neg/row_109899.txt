I want to just end it. Iâ€™m tired of hurting everybody I loveI left my boyfriend broke up with him after 3 years we were having major issues because we both had untreated mental illness. We still talked for a month after the breakup acting like weâ€™re still together. We are both now in therapy. Then a week ago he truly left me for good because I made a really horribly mean comment when I was angry. I regret saying it, and he has every right to leave me for good over it. 3 years together, I havenâ€™t heard from him since it happened other than him telling me he needs space. Saying weâ€™re not permanently broken up he wants to be together but that we need to fix ourselves (our mental illnesses) 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. We were planning to get married next year...I regret leaving so badly and saying things that were so mean. I am literally so worthless. Every man Iâ€™ve ever been with has always left me because of how horrible I can be with the things I say. 

I know I am the problem. I think if I just end it then I canâ€™t hurt anyone anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of hurting people, everyone I love I always end up ruining. 

I want to go so badly. I want to just be at an eternal peaceful sleep. But I am too chicken . I always am :(
