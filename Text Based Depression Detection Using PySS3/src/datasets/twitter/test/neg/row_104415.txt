The bridgeI've walked across this bridge over the Duck River several times now tonight. Each time wondering if I should jump or just accept my fate and live underneath it. I'm 33, over the last 18 years I've actively tried to kill myself maybe a dozen times, each time I fail but not for a lack of trying or planning - in one case the gun jammed, another the rope broke, and one my friend sensed something was up and rushed to my house and unwrapped the instrument cable from my neck. I'm a hard worker, loyal to a fault, decent at learning, but I sleep so deep I can't hear any of the 5 alarm clocks within a foot of my head so no matter how good of a worker I am I have no hope of a "real" job. It caused me to lose a really good job recently, hell, that was 3rd shift! And it's about to cause me to lose my shitty pizza delivery job that I've had for the past 12 years. This is why my destiny is to just end up living under a bridge until sweet peaceful death. I have a 5 year old son who I love with all my heart but he's only ever called me "dad" twice, he knows me by my first name and in all honesty probably wouldn't even realize I was gone. I have a so called fiancÃ© but.... That's a WHOLE other topic, but for the sake of this post lets just say she's not the most supportive and is the bigger part of why my depression has been flaring up. I just don't know what to do but I'm tired. I don't know whether to just give up and accept my fate of being a homeless nobody or to try and potentially fail to end it all yet again. Not really looking for support, but if my story somehow helps someone else then maybe this life has the slightest bit of meaning after all...
