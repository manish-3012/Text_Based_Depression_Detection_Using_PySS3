Anyone just curious about what happens after death?I'm a 24 year old male in Australia and have always had a lingering thought in my mind about suicide.

I guess the reasons why I haven't attempted in the past was due to helping mum (helping her pay off the mortgage to the house due to dad leaving her and helping her while she recovered from her hip surgery)

But now that mum is better and the mortgage is paid off, these suicidal thoughts keep creeping up on me.

I don't consider my life to be all that bad, I do OK financially, I train 5-6 times a week at the gym, I've started volunteering at my local fire brigade, people would describe me as a very confident, outgoing person. Basically, I feel like there's nothing wrong with my life at the moment but these thoughts still come to me.

It feels as if I'm programmed to want to kill myself, no matter what I do or what steps I take to disengage myself from this feeling. Sort of like a morbid curiosity to see what life after death is like, if there is such a thing. When I keep myself busy, I can shut these thoughts out but when I slow down or when I meditate, my mind seems to default to the idea of suicide.

Just wondering if anyone else feels the same or can share their experiences?
