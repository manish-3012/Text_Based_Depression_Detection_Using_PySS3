Attempted to kill myself todayIâ€™ve done nothing but laze around during these past few months so last week I decided to change that. I started exercising and learning a new language. Hanged out with my cousins. Everything was going... decent. The thoughts never stopped though, haunting me everyday even as I try to change my lifestyle.

Today, something happened. Something concerning my â€œfatherâ€. And that something was enough to push me to the point of breaking down. It was already difficult to fight off the thoughts that came whenever I try to better myself, and that was the last straw. 

So I tried to kill myself.

In the back of my mind, I knew that this wasnâ€™t going to work and that Iâ€™d probably pussy out in the last second, but I did it anyway. I used a belt and tied it on the wire hanging above our couch. (The wire is where we hang our laundry). With a million thoughts racing in my mind, I put my head in the loop in the belt. 

The wire isnâ€™t even high enough for it to kill me so I kneeled down on the couch I was standing on. The belt slowly tightened around my neck. With my right hand I held on to the belt above my head and my left hand on the loop below my neck. Then I tightened the belt using my hands. Suddenly, all of my thoughts just stopped and my mind went completely blank. All I could hear was the sound of my own heartbeat beating fast and loudly in my ears. I started feeling dizzy. I just stayed there for maybe a minute before I finally snapped out and removed my head from the belt.

Right now as Iâ€™m typing this Iâ€™m laying down on the floor with completely nothing in my mind. I donâ€™t really know what to do now. I justed wanted to type this out I guess, Iâ€™m sorry
