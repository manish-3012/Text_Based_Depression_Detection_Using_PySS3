I've decided to start writing a short story/book/drool whatever you want to call it to see it will help my suicidal thoughtsI've removed names for obvious reasons, just what I started typing tonight but now I'm resigned myself to bed in a pit a self-pity and contemplation. I'm going to keep writing my story until 1) I finish the story to the point I've helped myself and continue living or 2) I finish with life. I don't really know which ending it will be, at the moment I feel to guilty to end it and clutching on to hope but my voice in my head is quite loud at the moment. Anyway I don't know if this post will be removed for breaching the rules etc, at this moment in time I don't really care, just wanted to share a beginning;

So Iâ€™m sat here in our house on the sofa wrapped up in my blanket, my daughter is playing up the stairs on her phone to her pal, my wife is at work for some reason so annoyed at me that Iâ€™m not even sure she would care if I ceased to exist, my son is out in the village currently doing what boys his age should be doing although probably not legal but who am I to judge after my teenage years?_x000D_
_x000D_
Iâ€™m a 34 year old male, with a loving family of my own, a decent job with a decent wage, no serious debts, no adultery in my marriage â€“ at least not for a number of years, no real reason for me to feel like ending my life but yet I feel like I shouldnâ€™t be here, or better put I feel like the world would be better off without me dragging everyone down with my depressed domineer. So Iâ€™m writing this essay/autobiography/memoir/whatever you call it to get things off my chest and maybe help someone else if they read this._x000D_

Yes me and my wife of 11 years, have just had another argument, but what makes this feel worse is infront of me she said to my daughter, that she hasnâ€™t been happy for weeks for reasons that will never change. Now, to me that statement screams that she hasnâ€™t been happy for months, maybe even years, and the reason is me. I thought we were happy??_x000D_
_x000D_
By all accounts our marriage is great for the most part. We have a good laugh with each other, we have started experimenting in some 60 shades of grey that has created some memorable times already, we still try and have some great days out as a family, unfortunately we donâ€™t really have any friends but thatâ€™s due to moving so much, and every now and then we argue like everyone else. _x000D_

My son recently confinded in his mum that he is having suicidal thoughts and I cant help but feel Iâ€™ve driven him to be like that. Im going to go more into the details at a latter chapter, first I just wanted to set the current scene, which if your reading this probably doesnâ€™t seem that depressing or interesting and im not giving any guarantees that the rest of this drool will be interesting either. _x000D_
Anyways back to sitting on the sofa and why im typing this shit out. Having searched google for about an hour and what happens to my family if I decide to end it as if trying to find an answer that will tell me they will be happy, looked after, move forward with their life and what im doing is the right choice. This didnâ€™t happen. Instead I found post after post about the survivors of suicide or family members of the ones that succeeded of the tremendous guilt that was felt, the hurt, the torture, more guilt. Which in turn, filled me with guilt and tears. I thought about calling the good Samaritans but took a shower instead feeling rejected and full of self-pity._x000D_

Previous attempts_x000D_
For aslong as I can remember, in the back of my head ive longed to end it all, I nearly succeeded twice, the first time after taking a tremdous amount of pills that would of killed an elephant I found myself throwing up, sweating, pupils the size of pin heads, everytime I closed my eyes I woke gasping for breath shitting myself because I didnâ€™t want to die. How fucked up is that, take a big enough concoction of tablets to succeed in my quest to die, to then be in a single man room on a army camp at the weekend, no one to come looking for me, to having the built-in human trait for survival to kick in. _x000D_

The second time, me and wife had split due to her sleeping with someone else, although I probably drove her to it with being a shite husband. So we had split up after 3 years of marriage, a year or two after Daughter had been born. At this point I was driving round to see her and the kids everyday after work and at weekends. I had just came back from a three month deployment to Kenya to find she had been fucking someone I worked with, a few months before hand I found out my best mate at the time in the army was supplying me with and suspicious amount of vodka to ensure I passed out so he could use MY car to drive down to the married quarters to fuck my wife. This happened for a few weeks until I caught on and had to be restrained from ending his life. _x000D_

So after the second wife fucking friend  came to light, I was in a very bad place, after visiting my children and starting the depressing drive back to my one man room on camp, there is a stretch of road, about a mile straight with a very sharp bend at the end. I had an FTO at the time, Japanese  sports car from the 90â€™s, down that stretch of road the car reached speeds of 120+ MPH, on more than one occasion I had my foot to the floor down that road, tears pouring down my face also hitting the floor, with every intention of not touching the brakes or attempting the bend. At the very last possible moment the face of both my kids would appear in my head, the words â€œDaddyâ€ ringing in my ears would compel me to slam my brakes on, struggling to keep the car under control until I was at a point where I could guide the screeching tyres around the bend and afford the mass of trees that had my name etched onto them. _x000D_
I would return to camp, via the local shop, a bottle of Vodka in hand and if money permitted, something to mix it with. The night would end, the sun would rise and the repeat button would be pressed.
