Going off my medsI feel exactly the same on them after taking them every day for three months as I did before. I still wake up in the middle of the night sobbing and panicking. It wakes up my boyfriend and he gets angry with me because he works early in the morning. I don't think I've wanted to die as much as I do today since the last time I ODed. My therapist has officially been dodging me for 6 weeks. I've gotten drunk and/or high every night the last two weeks and when I come down it's all shit again. I don't even get hungover anymore. I'm just numbing myself at this point. a few weeks ago my mom told me she'd rather I be dead than a failure but I'm never going to be good enough for her. My boyfriend told me today that he's going out of town from the 11th to the 14th to visit his friend. My birthday is the 13th. I think I'm going to commit on my birthday like I had originally planned a few months ago. My friend's mom told me that the hardest days for her were her sisters birth date and death date and it'll be easier on my brothers if those are the same day. It'll be my birthday present I guess. I'm supposed to work in the morning but I think I'll have to call in because I'm fucking miserable and I can't move out of my bed right now.
