3 hours till New Years and Iâ€™m all aloneThis years been a mess, from an attempt on this day last year to being kicked out of multiple homes to constant suicidal thoughts and self harm and now to the final culmination where everyone I had cared for is has separated themselves like the dead weight that I am, Iâ€™m sorry that you all had to deal with the burden that I am but when I tried to get better you all just left me again so really whatâ€™s the point? So how about this, Iâ€™ll stay away and drink myself into a stupor and we can see what this New Years can bring itâ€™s better this way anyway
