I donâ€™t know how to cope anymore.Iâ€™ve thought 1000x about ending my life. Iâ€™m at the point of just being constantly angry, and it worries me. I canâ€™t do anything to fix or relieve whatâ€™s going on, and everything is making me angry these days, I feel like one of these times Iâ€™m just going to be mad enough that I just off myself. Atleast in the past itâ€™s just been extreme sadness and a spark of hope still left. I donâ€™t feel like I have any will to want to keep going. 2020 is going to kill me.
