Anyone know a way out?I'm 21. Depressed. Anxious. I don't know. Between my parents being narcissists and my lack of power to change anything I just keep considering ending it. I'm in school learning to animate but I'm not that good at it. Depression took the fun out of it. 
There are two things holding me back: my guinea pigs and my boyfriend. I got the guinea pigs over the summer to help me mentally. May end up marrying the boyfriend if I don't actually end myself. We've been dating for 2 years as of tomorrow. But despite those nice things I just keep feeling empty. I don't know what else to do.
