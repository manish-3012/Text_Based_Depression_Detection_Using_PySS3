I don't feel like I have a purpose anymoreI am doing music at college and my parents want to  move about a 20 minute drive Away in the middle of nowhere. There is apparently a bus stop however I have adhd and autism and its not an excuse but the adhd saps my motivation and drive leading me to become extremely lazy not by choice because in my head I'm thinking I want to do this but my body just refuses. I can sometimes barely get myself out of bed in the morning  even after quitting smoking weed. If I move and cannot go to college I feel like I have no purpose as I will fuck up my attendance because buses tend to always be late and in turn that would ruin my course success chances. 

I'm tired of being dependant on medical drugs to have the dopamine I need. I'm tired of living life on nightmare mode mentally. Environmentally I acknowledge it could be much worse but mentally I just can't take it, I would speak to my friends but I find wording my problems extremely hard. 

I'm just going to accept that I'm going to end up like my siblings, kicked out of my house for disagreeing with my parents views,. I have no place in this society.

All I wanted to do was make some great music and I've tried learning from watching videos at home however my attention span is so shit that it just doesn't happen. And I am developing a tolerance to my medication so that isn't even helping me as much anymore. Its really upsetting the difference between me on meds and me not on meds and I can't handle it. Its like when I'm on them I become much better at everything I like as if the adhd disappears, and then when I'm not on these meds everything is inconsistent, everything I do I enjoy I stop being 150% at. 

My parents are just bud smokers now, my dad is unemployed and just sits on his arse all day playing games and gambling on shit phone apps. I've told him to try and get a job but everytime he puts obstacles in his way such as "nobody will take me" or he will get defensive. He doesn't even apply anywhere. 

 This could sound like I put obstacles in the way for myself and I admit - I do but I just don't enjoy life anymore even though I am young(18). I've been feeling this way about myself since I started becoming a teenager and nothing has helped other than the meds take my mind off of it. I also overthink things a lot, people point it out and I try and work on it however it just comes back subconsciously a lot of the time. 

Anyway, if you're reading this I appreciate the time you've taken to hear my little bit about why I want to end my life and I hope the best for you in your life, you deserve it.
