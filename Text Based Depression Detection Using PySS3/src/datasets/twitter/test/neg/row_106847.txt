I made the motion of slitting my wristsI have never self harmed physically. I do plenty of negative mantra thinking daily but today was the first time I even came close to ending it. I didnâ€™t even have anything in my hand but I could so vividly imagine something there slicing my flesh and it makes me think. 

Itâ€™s almost funny to me because at the first sign I noticed of wanting to kill myself, I went to the doctor. I sought help and got on medication. After a fuckton of trial and error, with lots of severe adverse side effects, it turns out that only 3 anti depressant meds are safe for me. Of course, theyâ€™re the most expensive(even with insurance). So no more meds.

I want out.
