Ive been thinking about it for a long time. But today just seems calm. Like im supposed to do it soon.Everything just seems so distant. Like everyone and everything is expecting me to do it already. I have nothing. I can't stand waking up every morning knowing I'm just going to take up space, that there is nothing to feel, nothing to expect but my own thoughts telling me to do it already. I just don't know where. I just want to dissapear, so no one will find my pathetic ass.
