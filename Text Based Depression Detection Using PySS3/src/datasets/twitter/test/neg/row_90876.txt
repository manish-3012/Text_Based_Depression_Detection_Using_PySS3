How effective are "safety plans" really?I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts pretty much my entire life but last week was probably the worst I have ever been. I had a plan, a timeline and was ready to go but I've managed to pull out of it.

All the suicide prevention stuff I've seen says I should have a "safety plan" - people I can call, things I can do to distract myself, places I can go to be safe, all that. Thing is, I had all those things available to me already and I didn't use them when I was at my worst. I even thought about calling someone and completely rejected the idea.

Maybe I didn't want to do anything because deep down I knew I wasn't serious, but isn't being resistant to getting help a big part of the problem in the first place?

It seems like even if I have a safety plan I either won't need it because I'm not really serious or I won't use it because I am.

Anyone have any safety plan success stories or other thoughts?
