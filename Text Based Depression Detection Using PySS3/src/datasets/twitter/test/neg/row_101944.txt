I overdosed on some pills last night and it's the best I've felt in so long.I have a horrible headache, I've felt nauseous all day, and I couldn't sleep at all last night. It felt like I was losing control of my throat muscles and I couldn't swallow anything for a little while. But you know what? I didn't spend last night or this morning depressed. I was thinking about the overwhelming pain I was feeling physically and not emotionally, and it was so nice. I didn't overdose to kill myself, I don't really know why I did it. But I'm glad I did it, because for one day(for most of it anyway) I didn't think about wanting to die.

Nothing makes sense to me anymore.
