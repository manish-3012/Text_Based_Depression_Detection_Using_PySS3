Iâ€™m so tiredIï¸ just want a break.
Iï¸ canâ€™t take a break longer than three minutes in my own fucking home.
The only break Iï¸ can get is by skipping my classes or not sleeping.
Thereâ€™s always something to complain about, something to blame me for.
At home itâ€™s just â€œmake me food, fix my phone, wash the clothes, feed and bathe the animals, tell me what this vague instruction means, wash the dishes, etc.â€
Itâ€™s nonstop and Iï¸ really donâ€™t care for anything anymore.
Itâ€™s either do these things nonstop or get hit and Iï¸ really donâ€™t like being hit.
School is no better because they give us massive amounts of work in hope to improve our abysmal test scores because the teachers canâ€™t teach.
Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself five times now (and yes, itâ€™s embarrassing to have messed up that many times)
But Iï¸ usually try to overdose, but now Iâ€™ve figured that since Iï¸ have multiple guns at my disposal, Iï¸ might as well use them.
If Iï¸ do it In the street, will the city have to pay for the removal of my corpse?
