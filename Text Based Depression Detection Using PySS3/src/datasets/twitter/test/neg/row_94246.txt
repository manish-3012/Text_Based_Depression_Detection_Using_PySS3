â€œMental health campaigns increase awareness and lessen the stigmaâ€ .... fuck you.Not in my opinion. It seems like many companies and individuals throw out meaningless hashtags and â€œsupportâ€ to a problem they canâ€™t understand. Itâ€™s trendy and cool to say you empathize. 

When really, people who are actually living through the darkness of an illness know most of this is a facade. Throwing superficial bandaid solutions and labeling it as self help.

The actual reality of what itâ€™s like to deal with a disorder isnâ€™t palatable or pretty enough to display on Instagram for fucking likes. No amount of filter can change how broken the healthcare system is and how no one actually cares about you when youâ€™ve become ugly inside and out.
