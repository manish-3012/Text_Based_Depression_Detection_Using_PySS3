It's been 3 months, I'm tired.3 months ago I had a damn good paying job, I wasn't behind on my bills, everything was pretty fantastic. Until one night I received a message from a stranger saying that my wife has been cheating on me. I flipped my lid, I left work in a rage, when I got home I damn near destroyed my whole house. I never even thought I could feel such anger and hatred towards a person. I have 3 kids and one that's on the way, and I'm not convinced it belongs to me. I haven't been able to get out of bed, I've lost my job, my kids are scared of me because they may or may not have witnessed a little of my destruction. I'm behind on all my bills, I'm not going to be able to give a good Christmas this year. I just want it all to end, I feel like a complete failure, I should have handled the situation differently, i understand that. I've tried therapy, but that shit doesn't work for me. I just want it all to stop, I don't have the energy to keep pushing, I'm tired.
