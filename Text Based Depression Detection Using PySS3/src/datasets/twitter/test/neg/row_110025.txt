Want to die right nowThe worst part is no one will ever miss me. It's like I never existed. No best friends, no anything. Just like that, I'll be gone and no one will even know. Along with me, I'll be taking all my dreams I ever had. Everything I wanted to become. I'm taking all of it to the grave with me, and no one will ever know.
