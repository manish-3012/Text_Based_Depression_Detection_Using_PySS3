My life was ruined by a Mr. Big Operation wherein I did nothing wrong within the context of my situation.I started playing forum Mafia at a young age and became very good at the game. I did not understand, hilariously, for a long time how scary it was for some people; and I have lived in terrible accommodations with rapists and murderers, or otherwise on the streets, for so many years because of it. And there is no compensation and I am not getting appropriate help. My neighbours are very bad criminals, and I'm just someone who was exploited. I do not understand how these operations can still persist when they hurt people like me so much.
