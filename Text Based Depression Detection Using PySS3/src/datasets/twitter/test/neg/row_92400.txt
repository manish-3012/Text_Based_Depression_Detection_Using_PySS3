Coworker leaving her jobSo my coworker is leaving her job for a new job and when she leaves I don't have a reason to live since she is my only pick me up during the days. I'm planning on writing a suicide note for her but am worried it would sound like I'm blaming her even though it would be more about how she kept alive for these past 3 years but maybe I won't.
