Make the pain stopI need this life to end. Everyone wants me dead. I get called hateful things every time I leave the house. A man my age or older (possibly former classmate) was shouting "Weirdo! You suck!"

Then a friend and I were at a cafe trying to enjoy ourselves and this younger girl stood up near us holding her phone up to take a picture and I don't think she was taking a photo of us to make fun of but I am suspicious and triggered because other people have done this and have also made a fake profile of me containing homophobic, transphobic, and misogynist vitriol. So of course I am a little hyper vigilant of people. This is an emotionally exhausting pain to deal with every day and I can't fucking take it right now.
