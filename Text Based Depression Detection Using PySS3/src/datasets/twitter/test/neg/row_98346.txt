I don't know what to do.It all started in six grade. A kid randomly started to say that I was stupid and started to blame things that he did on me. This would go on until he moved or something. Then it went to seventh grade. I used to be in sped classes and I finally got out of them.  But then I started to fail math, and I was instantly put back in without a choice. Kids found out and I was started to be called stupid. Which I didn't really care about. Then it reached the people who I thought were my friends. They started to call me Billy Wonka because I showed them a video about a kid named Billy getting bullied or something a year beforehand. Then after they got over that they called me gay and then fat and then retard. Then it got to the point where I can't focus on my grades and I started to fail Langued Arts and Science. Then I was forced to meet with my teachers after school and in homeroom. I didn't want to do it cause then I would seem more stupid. then the verbal taunts became physical at sleepovers they would steal my phone and lock it out. they would make dares to punch me. They would spit, punch, and kick me. there was even a time when they shot me with an airsoft gun close range. At school, it wasn't any better. At lunch and during bake sales they would steal food I bought. shut my locker so I would be late. exclude me. tell me to not sit at there table cause I'll infect them. Then said that I'm a horrible person because I used to make some jokes that weren't the safest for work. But always made jokes like that to me. spread rumors. They made fun of my lisp and then the gym. In gym class, they would call me CPAM which basically meant "Aids Monkey". Then I would crack, sometimes cry and they would call me a baby. I would sometimes talk to my mom about it but if they ever found out then they would call me a pussy for telling on them. I've talked about this to them many times and they don't care and I can't leave because then I won't even have anyone to talk to. This meant that I stopped showing up to those after school teachers meeting which deeply effects my grades and I'm just disappointing my parents and my teachers now. I have no chance in life it feels like and I just can't do anything about it. I've never told my parents about my feeling because they think its because of youtube or something. It just seems like I can't exist and then it would be better.
