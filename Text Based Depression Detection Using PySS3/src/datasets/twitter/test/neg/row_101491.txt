I hid my pistols so I can use oneI put myself in a bad place. I can't think. I have no one to talk to. My wife is pissed. All I have done the last week is plan to end this. I hid my pistols so I can use one if she finds the others.  I am just so lost. No way out. No going forward or back. I pushed to hard. I had it made. All I had to do is shut up. I did not. I can't think. I can't think. I can't think. All I do is sleep.
