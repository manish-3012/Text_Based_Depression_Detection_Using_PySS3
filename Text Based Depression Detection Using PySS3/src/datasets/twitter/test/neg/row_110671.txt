Friend posted suicide note on facebookI'm 100% sure this is serious. He said he'd suicide by drinking too much, he was supposed to take a train (a day before his suicide note) but we don't know if he took it, he can be anywhere.

It's has been one hour since his last message on facebook. Police has been called, they're trying to geolocalize him etc..

We're around 8 people trying to find him, and I'm posting here in case we forgot something. (We called all related friends, the hotel he went in, someone's checking place he used to be)

I think we're doing all we can, but I feel like we could get help from facebook. So I'm asking here, really sorry if it's not the right place.

Edit: He resurfaced today, he drunk a lot in a hotel room but he's still alive and coming back near us.  
Thanks for the answers, I'm glad this subreddit exist! Maybe I'll give back when I'm ready.
