A Monster Who Deserves To DieOh boy. Look at that. Another whiny millennial bitching about his non-issues. Haha, I'm sure you get a lot of my type around here. Actually, this time it's even worse: it's a piece of shit whining about how he's a piece of shit. Straight to the point, I'm really just a terrible person. I'm narcissistic, overly-needy, a pathological liar, manipulative, insensitive, parasitic, short-tempered, licentious, overly-idealistic, impulsive, irresponsible, a constant blame shifter, and violent. But no one wants to be  seen as the villain, so of course I'm also fake as fuck, pretending to be a good person to win friends, favors, and "fortune." Haha, sometimes I'm so fake, I even fool myself into thinking I'm a good person. But that usually doesn't last too long, since I'm so damn shallow that after only knowing me for a little while, you'll be able to peak through the cracks and see me for the piece of scum that I am. 

I won't go into details about all the people I've hurt, since we'd be here all day, but I finally fully realized this truth with my most recent victim: my girlfriend of three years. After she broke up with me, bawling her eyes out, I had a good long self-examination, and I realized what a monster I am. Three months ago I had planned to jump off the bridge near my house and end it all, since it felt like the whole world was crushing down on me. But now I wish I had done it, since I realize that it's the opposite: I'M the one who's burdening everyone. Of course, my family and "friends" will deny this to hell and back, but of course they do. They only know the fake "good boi" face I've been wearing since God-knows how long. They only know me as the guy who follows all the rules, is popular with everyone, all that stuff. But it's not the truth. And of course, I could never tell them all this, since I'm too scared to sully the reputation I've built up, since I'm such a selfish piece of shit.

It's ironic that I'm even posting in a place like this. I've lurked here for a couple years now, reading your stories of suffering. And so I know that some of you all know me in real life. I'm that friend that always leeches off of you and never pays back. I'm that boyfriend who told you he loved you over and over, but it was all a ruse for my own emotional gain. But don't worry! Unlike them, I don't like myself for all the shit I've done. Quite the contrary. I hate myself. And before the month is done, I can promise you that you can sleep a little easier, knowing that one scumbag like that has rid the world of themselves. Ha, or probably not. Last time when I went to go to the bridge, I got picked up by the cops, so I don't even know if I actually have the courage to throw myself over. I'd like to believe that I'm virtuous enough to pay for my sins, but given everything I've said so far, probably not, huh? Haha, I really hate myself. I wish a dozen stray bullet would rip through my skull and rid this world of my bullshit.

I know I'm the scum of the earth. ~~But after dealing with so much external bullshit these past 6 years (and even into the present),~~ I'm too ~~weak and tired~~ lazy to try to fix anything. It'd be better and easier for everyone if I just died. There are people out there who are suffering, but me, a lazy, selfish, short-tempered piece of shit, gets life easy. God.
