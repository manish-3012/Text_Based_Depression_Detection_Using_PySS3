I think a friend of mine attempted suicide this morning. What can I Do?We're freshmen in high school together, btw.

This morning I woke up to frantic calls from a friend of mine. We'll call him Joe. He lives about half an hour away, and my friend Bill and I live near the school. 

Anyway, apparently Bill had called him and said he was done. Bill took 306mg of methylphenidate (Concerta) I'm not 100 percent about this but that seems to be the case. His Dad (who is a terrible person) had no idea. His mom was out of town. He didn't want to go to the hospital so he locked himself in his room.

I went to his house early in the morning. I was so... fucking terrified to knock so I waited outside. Right when I was about to go in he stormed out of the apartment  building. He didn't have his schoolbag. He wouldn't talk to me and ran off. We're kind of close so this was strange. I walked to school just a little bit behind him.

He looked fucked up but I wasn't really sure what I was looking for. I guess he kind of looked like he had a fever. By the time I got to school Joe was there. He was talking to our coordinator. Then he ran away. No one could find him. The coordinator said his Dad took him home which seemed like bullshit but I don't know.

Sorry for all this. I don't know what to do. I want to go over after school, and maybe get his dad's number for the future. Or is it just better to stay away?

He might read this post. That's alright. I want him to know we care.
