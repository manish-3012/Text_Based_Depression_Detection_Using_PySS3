All I feel is guilt for what I've done.So I had a girlfriend for about 10 months and I thought everything was merry and jolly but a few days ago we had a big fight and she told me I was emotionally neglecting her and hurting her the whole relationship. I felt not only heartbroken but shocked to hear this stuff. I talked to one of her friends and he told me he really had no sympathy for me and I was just horrible and they talked down to me the whole time. I can't feel anything but guilt for this especially since her situation is already bad with her parents. I know this probably sounds really petty but I just need some advice. The only option I can see is to die to atone for my wrongdoings.
