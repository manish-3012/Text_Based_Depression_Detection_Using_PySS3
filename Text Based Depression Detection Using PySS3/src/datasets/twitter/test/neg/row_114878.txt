Im going to miss my familyIve posted a couple times about death. Clearly we all die one day. For those who think about speeding up the process,  do you think about your fam? Like I love my parets and bro, sis so much. I can't put into words how much i hate myself. I don't look In the mirror anymore. It makes me sick.. I have borderline personalitiy disorder but fuck.. I just  want everything to stop!!! I met a nice man who who thinks im gorgeous.. And wants to date me. If only he know. I wish things were simple. Fall in love and be a mom like I've always dreamed. I break EVERYTHING I though tho.. Why not hang myself!?! Honestly im prob gonna buy a gun. Im gonna miss my nephews and I'm sad I won't see what GREAT men they'll be. I think that hurts me the most. What I'll miss but im so done...  I'm 29.. Plenty of life lived. I wanna end it but im scared. Ya get it? There's no point in this thb I guess I just needed to vent.
