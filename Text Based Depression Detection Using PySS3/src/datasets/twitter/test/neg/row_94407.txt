Not sure what to doIâ€™ve tried posting here before,  but my anxiety stops me. I would really appreciate it if anyone would comment, message or just make your presence known to me. Itâ€™s been a struggle for a while, and I have no one to really talk to about this. I really would appreciate any advice, or just knowing someone knows how I feel. This will be long, thank you for using your time on me.

Iâ€™m 17 years old, and a senior in high school. I wonâ€™t lie and act like my life is shit, because itâ€™s not. I live a pretty good life, Iâ€™m not poor, I have family, etc. but I canâ€™t help but feel so incredibly depressed. Whenever I bring it up with my family, Iâ€™m always told that if I canâ€™t be happy with the life I was given- then Iâ€™ll never be happy. That Iâ€™m so fortunate to live in a house, with food, with parents, with toys and games, with drum sets and everything I could want. So how could I feel sad? I never knew why either, as being sad was never a choice I made.

Ever since I was 12, Iâ€™ve felt this sadness build up inside of me. Iâ€™ve always felt I wanted to die, but never to this extent. Around the beginning of my senior year in high school, I felt a new pain. I could be doing the most normal of activities: eating, doing homework, walking to class, playing a game, etc. and I suddenly have the urge to kill myself. Multiple times a day, I entertain the idea of killing myself. Iâ€™ve already made my plan, I have several. Iâ€™ve taken into account everything that could possibly do wrong, and made my plan foolproof. I will not share the plan, as I do not wish to reveal my location or give ideas to anyone here. I do not condone the act of suicide, I simply 100% understand why someone would. In addition to these thoughts, Iâ€™ve also been experiencing various hallucinations, or something along those lines. I havenâ€™t been able to talk to anyone about this either. The hallucinations normally happen when I am sick, but theyâ€™ve happened well too, for example: seeing drawings on walls or ceilings, seeing doors open and close repeatedly, or seeing animals. I also hear things, but I believe this is more normal than the visual hallucinations I see. I did try to tell my mom about this, however she told me Iâ€™m probably just tired. My parents always brush off any issue I have as normality, and perhaps it is. Though I feel like seeing hallucinations in any capacity is NOT normal, as I do not feel comfortable with it. 

My suicidal thoughts, or what I suspect to be suicidal thoughts got so bad I admitted to my mother that suicide had been on my mind a lot.  I was pressured to by my older cousin, who I am no longer in contact with due to her creating drama with my family. My mom, after literal months, got me a therapist appointment. I liked seeing a therapist. I could finally talk to someone about my feelings, and talk about my suicidal thoughts. She told me that I have anxiety and depression, though I donâ€™t believe I ever received an official diagnosis. She also told me that taking antidepressants may significantly help my situation. However, I never got this medication because I am afraid of mind altering drugs. I only got to see my therapist 1-2 times a month. While I still felt depressed, I felt better having someone to talk to- and I was generally beginning to feel more comfortable with her. My dad however, does not approve of me seeing a therapist. He claims I only go there because it costs money, and that I should ask her why Im such a shitty kid. My dad and I donâ€™t have the best relationship. But, Iâ€™ll get into that later. The last time I got to see my therapist was in December. My mom didnâ€™t like me seeing her either, I donâ€™t think she realizes how much I need it- or I feel I need it. I canâ€™t see my therapist anymore because my insurance is no longer covering her office.

Every time I bring this topic up with my parents, Iâ€™m told how normal my feelings are. Even if I say I feel suicidal, Iâ€™m told how I am not suicidal, that I just want to die- and thatâ€™s normal. I have no idea if I am suicidal or not to be honest. I am not a doctor, I am not authorized to make assumptions such as that. But I feel like Iâ€™m in hell everyday of my life, despite how wonderful everything is. Sometimes I feel, if one more thing goes wrong- my whole world will collapse. When my mom is alone and I tell her, she tells me â€œitâ€™s fine, itâ€™s fine, itâ€™s fine, Iâ€™ll get you another therapist.â€ And completely avoids the subject. It took me 5 years to ask for help, and it feels like no one takes me seriously. My father on the other hand, says if Iâ€™m suicidal then I am not allowed to go away for college, or go on any trips that are planned for me this year. He says he will check me into a hospital and never speak to me. When he and I fight, he has told me to kill myself, and said horribly hurtful things. Sometimes he shuns my mother and I, and it hurts so much. Iâ€™m told how perfect my life is, yet I cannot force myself happiness. I just want to talk to somebody, Iâ€™m even willing to take medicine if it means itâ€™ll fix me. Iâ€™m tired of feeling suicidal, hating myself, and sleeping my days away. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Thank you for reading, Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s really long. I appreciate everyone whoâ€™s read this. Please comment any advice you have.
