The last strawDo I have to ask anyone on this sub how it feels when you see your little brother run up to you and give you a hug, only to be pulled away from you by the abusive parent who kicked you out of his life? I think not. I instantly lost all of what was left of my will to live that day. Knowing that my own father doesn't want me in their lives anymore, why should I bother living? Since he's also now pretending that I don't exist I might as well not exist then. So I have to make this second and final attempt count. This time, no one will know except for the people reading this on this sub. I will end it all and I will suffer no longer.
