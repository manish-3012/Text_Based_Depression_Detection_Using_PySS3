Unknown title as not sure if I can find a fitting one for this.Um "waves", evening.

This isn't attention w*****g, this might not have the sad feel most of texts like this have, this might seem strange, confusing even but this is "me" so yes, nice to meet you. /greet

There is a tl,dr (short) version and tl;dr;dr;tl (even shorter version at the bottom)

Do apologize in advance for the wall of incoherent, messy, without a logical start or ending, "looped", etc. mess of a text, but, um.. the thing is, at this point in life I desperately need(?) to get, want, don't want, hope I (don't) get, require or "insert any synonym that fits" help. 
Simply out of ideas, way(s), questions, answers, everything on what to do except to, at this point, to end my so called "life" that I can't find a thread to cling on anymore. 

(here comes the part where I try to explain why or what is happening, at least I hope it will feel like one)

My early childhood consists of not so many fond memories, more or less only of my father getting drunk from work, calling me from my room and "teaching" me how to "life" from 9 p.m. up to 2 a.m. My mother had it worse, at least from my point of view. She fought him (only bright side of this part is that he never got physical, only verbal) and protected me and herself against that monster. I tried to "defend" myself but as I was young and uneducated didn't know what to do except to hide in the closet, balcony, tree house or anywhere I could think of to hide and "HATE" him and wanting to kill him (never did anything 'bout that part thou) This went on (as I recall) from my 7th up to 15th age of birth, as then he had to stop duo to medical reasons. Thou earlier/after I learned he did that even when I was younger. After that things got lil' easier, but the "scars" and the "parenting" crawled under my skin and shaped me in the person I was back then. Frigid, scared, attention seeker/acceptance seeker, to be wanted, to be needed, hugged, close to people. Which resulted in me having 014124 "friends" as I was afraid of being alone. 

This takes us to my high school, 4 years of my life where as much as I struggled and painted my face in happy colors and not let anyone "see" the real me, the things that happened. Was to ashamed as "everyone" else had i nice. Nice parents, house, stuff they wanted. That was of course not true, but my delusion was different. The traits remained through high school: scaredy cat, "mask", need for acceptance, for friends.

After high I enrolled in college which was a refreshing start in my life, as the college was in a different city and out of all the days in year, I spent my 10% of em home and that was mostly to visit my mother, holidays, birthdays and similar events. 

But yes, college. College was nice(?). Meet my first girlfriend, had my first kiss, my first time in the dark with le girlfriend (my first post and not sure if I can use the S word). Got to know a lot of people, travel around the world (well only 3 countries, but to me that was like waking up in Tardis and going places), "got" few friends but this time real real friends. Not the "09124" ones I had small talk and then both went separate ways. Thou the all so famous now (maybe, yes, no?) traits remained.. or even worse, they got worse. 

I made this shell of mine where I've swept all the bad emotions, memories, feelings under the rug, then put a table on it with a vase and flowers with all the colors in the world. And when people "visited" me (even my gf, even my real friends) this was the picture they saw and this was the picture they got to know me for. Which was... ba..bad.

Little did I realize during my life that not talking and being honest will eventually backfire in the most unexpected way(s) and unexpected time. Which it did.. More then a few times. More like.. em, with everyone I know, or at this point when I'm writing this, knew. 

I slowly, bit by bit, dot by dot, with my shell and my "way of thinking and life" was pushing and pushed away everyone I "had" in my life. Without even realizing what I did, what I was doing, what went wrong, why it went wrong, why it was my fault... before it was to late aka. now, today. 

I never wanted to lose them, I never wanted to end up where I am now but it happened, I did. Without a way to get them back. I could try, I did try but let's just say they did not welcome me with so much of open arms. We tried talking, we tried making this right, but it all just felt wrong. 

(at this point I missed out on lot of things that happened in the meantime, during my high and college which might make this more understandable).

But yeah.. it's been 5 years since the last paragraph happened. I've been living 5 years. Not finishing my college, thinking "I can make it without it, lots of people did, why couldn't I" and there was a time where I actually believed in that. Reality struck, didn't. 
(long story short: I was to scared of failure, of being criticized, of not making it, of being the "one" who didn't pass the exam, of looking people with authority in the eye and them telling me I failed, that I "suck", of "physical" interaction with professors that I just couldn't bring myself sometimes, even after months and months of studying, to take the verbal exam even thou I knew 80%+ of the books, material and stuff you need to pass) 

Ok, I lost my train of thought so to not torture you who made it to this part with more scrambling and  text.

tl;dr version

I'm 27 years old.
Have no proper education ("outdated" high school and no college)
No "real" work experience aside from student jobs, some storage work, casual big city work (giving away paper sheets, working in a mall for a week, etc.) just to get by, just to pay rent and "survive" (food, smokes, occasional treat aka. good quality coffee)
No friends for few years now. 
None whatsoever relationship with my family -&gt; none with father and less to little with my mother. 
No siblings to "brothers/sisters in arms)
Timid, scared of being rejected. "perfectionist" and over thinking even the smallest situation in daily life on more than a daily basis, several times a hour. Overthinking about everything. Being afraid to find real for the rest of time work as afraid of being rejected. 
The work I do apply, rejections keep flying my way as no real work experience, to old for that job, no proper education.
Realization that even if I find a work (average to low pay, as this is the only ones I could get with my "background"), work where I don't have to interact with people at all and could work alone as my social anxiety is serious and I am genuine afraid to talk and can't talk (can't open my moth and have the conversation with that people in my head, which then makes it awkward for that person and she/he leaves). 
But yes, realization that if I find that work I wont accomplish anything much in life, I wont meet anyone and if I do I will look like that loser kid nobody talks to thou even if I meet I won't know how to talk as my interests in the past years have dwindled and most of my time I sit and watch videos I've watched 124142 times during the times I had a "life" to "relive" those feelings (weird way of me keeping my sanity, of feeling alive, "like it was yesterday", or in other works, lying to myself at this point).

But that's the truth. I am aware of what I did and didn't do that I should have done but now it's to late. You can't turn back time, there is no restart, life is not a game. 

{LOOP}

Don't know what to do, don't know how, don't know with what or where. Don't have the will to do anything, can't think of a way to do it at this point. Have no motivation, have no expectations from or of anything. Trying to do something but after I find something I overthink, over complicate it in my head, convincing myself that I will fail and don't even start it. "Compose" this master plan on how to get back on my "feet", just to give up few moments later as I know I will fail. Trying to ask for help but I know I don't deserve it. Trying to ask for help but don't know how to explain it. Afraid that if I ask for help I'll get smack(?) talked back as I'm a failure, I should get my life together, so to afraid of that type of response, to afraid of criticism I don't and stay silent. Aware that others had it worse, way way waaaaaaaay worse then me and still made it, feel bad for not trying like them. Overthinking about everything I wrote, feeling even worse, falling even more and more in my shell of social anxiety depression loneliness. 

{/LOOP}

tl;dr of the tl;dr

I don't have and can't find any reason to continue living. Not suicidal, just "realistically" wanting to end my life as honestly and genuine think the world wouldn't change one lil' tiny bit and it would be a better place if I was gone from it. Honeslty think and know I am a failure and to old to be asking for help, especially when other people younger/older had/have it WAY worse than me. This everything is my attempt(?) of asking for help thou with each stroke I know I don't deserve it. With each stroke I hate myself even more for being the person I am. Confused, depressed, realistic, tired of living, scared of dying, just one big sloppy mess.
