I wish my family just die.Like seriously?
While i'm struggling with this extreme depression, they're just talking and laughing with their relatives as if nothing's wrong, doing activities like usual.
It's almost 2 weeks since i got a major fight with my brother because he didn't want to accompany me to look for a job by saying that he's busy, but the fact is he's always have time to hang out with his damn girl, and my parents was fucking blaming me for that, and then I starved myself that day, i lost my appetite, I can't (and i don't want) utter a single fuck to them since that day. I have the other brother actually, but now he has his own family already, he also don't give a fuck about me, he only focuses on his family.

I really don't know where to apply job, i only have low education because we're not a rich family. Been constantly rejected by companies. Jobless for 2 years.

And now the thought of stabbing myself right in the chest is haunting me everyday.
