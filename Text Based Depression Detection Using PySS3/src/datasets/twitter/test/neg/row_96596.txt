I can't go through with itI've made the decision 4 times, yet every time I seem to back out last minute. I was so sure I would go through with it this time, too. I quit my job, broke up with boyfriend, deleted most of my social media accounts, I was ready to just end it all. Yet for some reason I still can't work up the courage. Currently parked off the road next to a bridge because I'm scared and don't know what to do.
