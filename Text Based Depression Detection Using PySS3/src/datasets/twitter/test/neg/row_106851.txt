Something is wrong with me..I have the basic life essentials
Family that cares
Boyfriend
A friend
Not super rich but not poor

But i still don't want to live.. I don't know anymore.. i know I won't kill myself but i contemplatr suicedeverynight.. i am starting to fear myself.. been telling myself for months i am just being silly.. that i don't have the right to feel this way because there are a lot of ppl suffering out there and are busy fighting back on life... but I can't take away this deep sadness i feel.. everynight for months now i wish i won't wake up the next day.. and end up cry out of guilt.. i told myslef i am not depressed and did the things i like, anime,games,novels... to no avail..
And tonight i just can't take it anymore.. I can't stop crying! Why am i like this! What is wrong with me?
