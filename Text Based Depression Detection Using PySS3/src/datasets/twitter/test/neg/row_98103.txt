Doctors appointment after attemptingI've got a doctors appointment in 3 hours, after attempting last night. How do I approach telling my GP? I don't want a permanent record against me, or taken for evaluation, or any kind of bullshit. I just want to tell her and that be the end. I don't mind talking about it with her, but I don't want any '3rd party' bullshit. Does anyone know what the procedure for coming out in the UK is? Will I get taken away or admirers to hospital, will people find out????? Seriously considering keeping quite about it.
