I'd love to be somebody else......I have nothing. I'm lonely, I've been alone all my life. I never fitted in anywhere, I've been to so many schools still disliked. Is it because I'm the fat girl? I'll never know. All I know is I get treated differently, I've tried to be thier normal but.... I lost myself doing that. I use to be very talkative and bubbly never could shut me up but... These last few years I'm shy barely speak. I don't know who I am and I don't think there's a me. I've realised I've always been hurt all my life, since I was 4. I always knew.... I'm the weird one out. I used the Internet as a way to cope with my life since I was 7. It's mentally scarred me, broke me more. Made me more different. Nobody knows me, nobody wants to get to know me. I don't blame them, but it hurts. I spoke to this older guy, I got really close until I realised he was just using me. Is the only poeple that can be interested in me and love me. Manipulators?.... I'm speaking to this boy I know from school, first friend I've had in four years...... He's not even that into me.... I feel like... There's no point. I've tried so hard to be here and alive. He didn't do anything when a kid threw bottle at me when I was clearly upset. Which sent me to cry loudly on my bedroom floor.

Reminded me when my supposed friends would let me get bullied or bully me. I'm sure that wasn't his intention but why does bad things always happen to me?. The world treats me like a abomination at times. All the poeple that love me have hurt me, traumatised me. I always feel forever alone. 

I want to love somebody and for them to love me too.

I don't want to be like this forever. That's my worst fear
