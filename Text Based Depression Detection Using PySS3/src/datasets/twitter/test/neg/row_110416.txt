I'm so tiredI'm so tired of trying. 
My mom saved me 6 years ago from killing myself, and I recently lost her. The one person who checked in on me constantly even when i got married to my wife. My marriage is also a mess, she's so bipolar and will make me think things are fine for a week or 2 and than turn around and rip my head off for stupid shit. I'm trying to get a new job but no one will hire me. 
I try so hard and no one ever notices, I get forgotten about constantly when plans are made and just struggle to see the point in life anymore. Everyone would be better off without me, I feel like a leech to everyone especially to my wife because of how she talks to me. I just cant anymore, I know my mom wouldn't want me to join her so soon, but I've just lost all my will to fight and try. My life feels so pointless and I just struggle to see why I should continue
