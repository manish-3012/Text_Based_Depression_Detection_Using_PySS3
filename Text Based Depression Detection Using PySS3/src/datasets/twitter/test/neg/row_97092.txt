I feel like my brain is dyingEvery day my depression gets worse. I havent slept in 2 days now and im starting to see nightmares when im awake.... ill space out for a second and my terrible memories will come back. God i just want to end it.... i always stop right before i do it because i think maybe it will get better.... but it only gets worse.... i tried killing myself... 2 days ago i think but i failed because i cant even die right..... i think tonights the night i will finally get it done..... to my family and friends who may or may not be seeing this. I love you niamh... thanks for always being there for me. Thank you mckayla for trying to get me through this. Mom and dad thank you for raising me and making sure i didnt turn into some spoiled shit ass teen. Grandma thanks for always listening to my issues and not judging. Luna thank you for always being that friend i could just call up and talk to... even at 3 am :) ..... niamh im going to miss you most of all. I just want you to know this had nothing to do with us and i will and always have loved you more than words can describe. Please have a long happy life without me.... dont cry for me im not worth your tears.
