nothing feels real anymorei (14) donâ€™t know what this feeling is and I donâ€™t know how to explain it. but Iâ€™ll try. it feels like i shouldnâ€™t be seeing what im seeing right now, it all feels wrong. these hands arenâ€™t mine yet i can move them. everything looks distorted almost, it looks too familiar. nothing feels real and i donâ€™t remember the last time it did. i think the only thing that will convince me im alive anymore will be when i die.
