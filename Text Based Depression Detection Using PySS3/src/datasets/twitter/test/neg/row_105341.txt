Empty and aloneIâ€™d rather die young at the age of 20 than have to live an entire lifetime of misery and loneliness.  I have been feeling this way since I was 14 and nothing has changed. The only difference between now and me being 14 is that I graduated high school and Iâ€™m about to graduate community college in October. However, instead of transferring to a 4 year school to pursue a career, Iâ€™ve decided that nothing will ever change. A well paying career, good grades, friends, loving family, or even a girlfriend will never stop me from killing myself. 

I donâ€™t understand how I even have friends at this point. Iâ€™m sure they would be fine without me anyways if I kill myself. Eventually theyâ€™ll start their own careers and find a relationship. Their lives would be just fine if I was gone. Even if I stayed alive, I would eventually be forgotten about.
