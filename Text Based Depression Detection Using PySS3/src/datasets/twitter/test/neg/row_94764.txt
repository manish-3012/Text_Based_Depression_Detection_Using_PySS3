I'm frustrated.I've been depressed before. It's starting again. I've just turned nineteen; I can't imagine spending the rest of my life trying frantically to cling to contentment for a few months before spending a dozen or more months desperately unhappy. 

I don't have any plans at the moment; I just don't think that I can do this for the rest of my life- probably not even the rest of college.

 I've attempted before; I recognize that my friends and family love me, and I don't want to hurt them. I recognize that I have "great potential". I recognize that I am luckier than most, smarter than some, and have generally drawn an excellent lot.

I recognize that nothing that I have done has been able to keep overwhelming unhappiness from seeping back into my mind. I suspect that nothing will. 

Advice?
