I am not sure how much longer i can cope for. The voice telling me to end everything is getting deafeningly loud.Please excuse the word rubbish that will follow here. I cant think straight really. I guess I should give context but I dont know. I really think I want to die but I cant tell if i do or not. I am under so much stress....
My Mum died last year. I really miss her and want to be with her. 
I have just had to move out of my home because my siblings are selling it. Iâ€™ve moved into a house share but all i want to do is go home. And i can never go home again now. 
Things are not going well at my new job and my depression is getting in the way of me being able to do my job properly. 
My boyfriend is potentially about to have another manic breakdown. He said he was feeling really manic today. I donâ€™t think i could cope with him going into hospital again. 
And my friend who is back visiting said heâ€™d call to see me at 7pm. Its 8.30 pm now and so I guess i am not worth seeing. 
I feel like I have been sitting on my hands all week. I just want to make it all stop now. Everything feels awful. I miss my mum so much and I canâ€™t cope without her. I donâ€™t feel like I can tell my family that I am not coping. 
The suicidal thoughts are so so so loud in my head and they are there all the time at the moment. I really really donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to go home to my Mum and thats really not possible now. 

I am just in so much pain and the temptation to hurt myself or end my life is really big.
