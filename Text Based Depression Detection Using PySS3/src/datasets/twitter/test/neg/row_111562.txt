I'm using suicide as a coping mechanism constantly.I guess I should start off with I've been having thoughts of suicide for about 3 years now- noticing it getting significantly worse and becoming more of a plan so i'm trying to do something about it. I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm going into my Junior year of high school in 2 months. I have a relatively stable family life with a few minor issues like my parents fighting or kind of shit talking each other to me- but nothing is violent, they're just bad at communicating their issues with each other. No current financial stress or anything like that. 

Judging by a lack of motivation I would assume that I've been dealing with some kind of clinical depression since I was much younger (like 10 idk), but for some reason I hate the idea of being mentally ill even though I'm aware I probably have something going on that's not "normal". I can say that I do have an eating disorder, specifically anorexia (though I'm currently at the lower end of a healthy BMI and have been eating a bit better than usual). But when anyone brings up being depressed or something, for some reason I just think it would be unreasonable for me to have a mental illness. I just have this idea that I'm generally bad at dealing with problems and issues in my life because I enable myself to do so, and that it's not some kind of chemical displacement. I don't know, I'd have to get diagnosed by a doctor- and even then I don't think I would believe that I was mentally ill. 

I won't get diagnosed by a doctor or see a therapist because It makes me uncomfortable to think that I may be institutionalized against my will (or have to take pills, or talk about complex feelings lmao)- because eventually the suicidal thoughts / plans. would come up. Meaning I just wanna save face until I actually bite the bullet. 

I guess I should talk about sexuality because that's also a part of it? I've known I was bisexual ( or at least had a more fluid attraction than heterosexual) since I was eleven, tried to come out to my mum when I was 11 and first kind of had that realiziation, and it went okay but I'm fairly sure she doesn't remember the conversation. Also when we were talking about it she brought up still going to church and everything (my mum is pretty religious but in a more accepting way?) as she's never brought it up again, so I'm fairly sure she just thinks I was confused even if she still remembers it.

Both my parents would be supportive if I came out to them, but my issues with sexuality come from my own internalized homophobia and living in the deep bible belt. I have nothing against other LGBT+ people (currently am active and open about being an ally but not actually LGBT+ with family and friends) and don't even find other bisexual people as repulsive or uncomfortable in any way. But I find my own sexuality to be hard to cope with? It's not gross for me to think about being with another woman, but the word bisexual or explaining it grosses me out, but this has been very recent. I haven't come out to anyone in my life or online, I struggle with the idea of explaining to someone that I'm bisexual- but I don't struggle as much with saying my sexuality is fluid or that I'm attracted to both men and women. 

That was a lot of background that I haven't ever written out before, so i don't know if it makes any sense or not. but uh, I feel like at this point i'm so set on the idea that i'm gonna kill myself before high school ( I guess I like the attention of dying young or something) that I use to it to deal with my problems.

aka.) If I'm stressed about taking or signing up for something my brain just says to me, "don't worry about it you'll kill yourself before we get there". 

So like with the Act, I'm worried about taking it so late and not having a ton of chances left, so my brain just says stuff like "You'll be dead before college, so do your best but if we don't get a 30+, you're shooting yourself anyways'

It doesn't do that for everything, but I also do the, "You're gonna regret that when i kill myself", which makes me feel bad because people feel bad when people commit suicide. They feel like it's there fault, which makes me kind of worry about my family and friends when I finally bite the bullet. But apparently not enough to get help. 

TLDR: I'm suicidal and have been for 3 years because of my body (from eating disorder), stress about college and life after high school, as well as sexuality. I'm not unpopular and have a couple decent online friends as well as a group of people that I chat with occasionally in my school and on the phone. I've been noticing that when i think about planning for the future I block out things that cause stress because i'm suicidal. 

 I'm pretty calm right now, but I have been having panic attacks earlier about a couple different things. Which trigger suicidal thoughts and kind of ruin my day. These are the main things I use suicide to cope with

1. Taking the SAT
2. Taking the ACT
3. being ugly and feeling fat because of E.D.
4. Wasting my youth and also feeling like I'm aging faster than i can smell the roses. (meaning like i don't hang out with friends or do anything other than play or mod skyrim. Feel like I'm getting older and time is melting away, meaning that killing myself before highschool ends is getting closer and closer.)
5. Finishing this school project for summer (no longer a concern but caused me to have a minor panic attack this morning so i thought i'd add it.)

There's probably a ton of errors in here but I didn't want to go back and edit anything because I wanted it to be stuff I authentically meant and not just "edited to be nicer sounding" or something.
