mehThere are so many people on here battling depression it's really pretty sad. I'm one of them. Today has been the worst its been in a while.  I'm diabetic and one way or another I keep slowly trying to kill myself by either letting my sugar go to high or by overdosing on insulin trying to get it low. I'm 30k in debt and my bank account is so overdrawn its only going to get worse and worse each month. There is no way I can possibly fix this situation.  I can't afford to buy the right kind of food that I should eat to get healthier.  Anyway out of  the 7 deadly sins, its gluttony that finally going to kill me. The wages of sin is death.
