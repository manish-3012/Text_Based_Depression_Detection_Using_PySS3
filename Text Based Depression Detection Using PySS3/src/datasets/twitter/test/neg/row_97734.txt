Im posting on behalf of my girlfriendBefore daying anything im not sure if i should post this here, if not could somebody direct me to a more appropriate place :)

First a little background on me. I am 15, I am extremely happy with life and never run out of things to do, there is always something else i coukd be researching or doing etc. 3 and a half months ago I became the boyfriend of my amazing girlfriend. She is musically and artistically talented, she is absolutely beautiful and i love her to pluto and back.
Now for my problem
My girlfriend is extremely depressed, she finds it extremely hard to go to school and is probably about 4 times a week in tears just from how much she hates it. Even more worryingly about 4 days ago she let her frustration out on her wrists...School wont help, her parents wont help. Ik the light is at the end of the tunnel for her i just cant convince her to see it. I spend most of my time out of school with her just to make her as happy as possible. But despite all of this i feel like her depression is too heavy for me to lift. 

In short, what can I do to help her.
