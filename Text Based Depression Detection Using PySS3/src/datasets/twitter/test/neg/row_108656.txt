Somebody in r/MLPLounge needs your help.[http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/sitw6/i_cant_do_this_anymore/](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/sitw6/i_cant_do_this_anymore/)

I would never know the right thing to say to somebody who is suicidal, but you guys are always here to give support to somebody who is in need. Regardless of what you may think of the /r/MLPLounge subreddit, a person is in danger of taking their own life, so please comment on her post and show her that we care about her. 

Thank you.
