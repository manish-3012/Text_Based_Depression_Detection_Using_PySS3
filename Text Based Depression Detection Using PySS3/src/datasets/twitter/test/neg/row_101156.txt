I wrote thisCall me g6

Cause Iâ€™m fly, like a mother fucking plane

Just kidding, that was just a joke kid

Iâ€™m actually motha fucking insane

Think about killing myself everyday

Ask me how I feel, what I say always the same

Iâ€™m a happy bloke

I always hide these tears that make me choke

Itâ€™s getting hard to breath

Happiness, I just canâ€™t see

I take this gun

Put it to my head

Oh shit, this is fun

Oh look, now Iâ€™m dead

Flew up to heaven and saw god

But I didnâ€™t know the code, guess somethinâ€™ wrong

Gates wouldnâ€™t open

And He wouldnâ€™t come to hold me

Just looked at me with disgust

I always knew that my life was a bust

And now the afterlife is too

Shit, what a guy supposed to do?
