I make everything worseThrowaway account because on the off chance anyone who knows me IRL would care if I went. I feel I am nothing but a drain on everyone around me  I make everything actively worse by existing. I bring nothing to this world, not even a spark to light it up even a little. I dont think it's fair of me to exist. If I could just completely erase my existence from everyone's mind so I wouldnt be a burden, I absolutely would without hesitation. But if I killed myself then there would be a body to take care of and my girlfriend would struggle financially. I just wish I was fucking gone.
