Everything is ready. I feel free.I've just ordered pure helium tank and it will be here on Monday. I am relieved beyond measure.
CPAP tubing will be here in 2 weeks as well. So easy.

I don't talk to anyone and I don't go out except running errands once a week. I am aware that I have no future. I can't do what I want. It doesn't matter anymore, I feel no pain.

I will spend my final days in peace.
