i can't stop thinking about iti don't really know what else to say. i'm sick of living and thinking about the awful things that have happened to me being held responsible for things i don't care about and constantly worrying for people who couldn't care less about me. i think all of my relationships boil down to one thing: people keep me around at their disposal. i don't think anybody actually cares about me or loves me. perhaps this is just insecurity speaking, but it's a valid point. if i don't reach out to people first, no communication will occur. the only thing that brings me comfort is the fact that i can tap out if things start to get unbearable, and things ARE starting to get unbearable. i don't really know what to do anymore except hang myself
