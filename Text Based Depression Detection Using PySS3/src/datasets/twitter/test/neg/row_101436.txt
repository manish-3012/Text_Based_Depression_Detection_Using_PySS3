I don't wish to live anymoreI hate the way I look. I hate everything about my life. My mom is verbally abusive and holds me back doing a lot of things that are considered minor things to others such as letting me get a haircut.  I have never gotten my hair cut and I hate the way it looks on me. I want to get my eyebrows done. I want to learn how to do makeup. I have body image issues. I weigh only 120 lbs and my mom makes me feel as if I'm the heaviest person on the planet. I can't ever hang out with people after school. Even if I do she has to be there with me. I have no social skills due to that. She always favors my brother over me because he's smarter than me. I do decent in school. I could got 100% and she'd still yell at me for something. She won't let me apply to universities that are more 30 min drive away but I don't have a car and for the closest uni i could get into since I don't have a car would require me taking public transportation. It would be a 2 hour ride one way. She won't let me stay on campus. I don't want to miss out on the world but she holds me back in so much that I've just come to hate it altogether. Last year I hurt my back and it still hasn't gotten better despite getting treatment for it. It also makes me depressed. When I went to a specialist, they made me feel out this little survey to see if I was depressed or not and my mom was there and she filled it out for me even though I had wanted to tell him yes I am depressed I need help. Due to my back issues I'm not able to do a lot. I had to quit swimming because it hurt too much and it just didn't feel worth it anymore. I used to self harm but I somehow managed to quit because my mom would have found out. I still wish to harm myself. I want to just slit my wrists or take pills and never wake up again.
