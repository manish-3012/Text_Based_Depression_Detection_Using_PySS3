My life has been getting worse by the dayIâ€™ve had problems for a long time now, with my health, work and finances, my ex took the kids and now my girlfriend left me today. I loved her a lot, I still love her. My life is garbage right now and Iâ€™m completely alone. Yesterday I told my mother I wanted to die and that I plan to commit suicide. She started to cry and the confusion and surprise of her only son telling her that, and that look on her face has really hurt my heart a lot. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Today I took my gun out and put it to my head. I couldnâ€™t pull the trigger!!!! Fuck me! I canâ€™t even do this right! I just kept thinking about my mom and how this would kill her too. She has already lost my sister when she was 3 years old. My mom has never been the same since then. And I know that this would completely destroy and essentially, kill her too. She has done a lot for me in my life and I for her. Every day is getting more and more difficult to live. I donâ€™t know what happened to me! I was a happy kid, good grades and a lot of potential. Now Iâ€™m just a miserable loser, and I hate myself for it. Iâ€™m a damaged and broken human being and my existence is pure pain and suffering right now. I donâ€™t have anyone anymore! Iâ€™m alone! I stopped talking to all my friends, and all of my family is on a different continent. Thereâ€™s no way out!  I counted on my girl, she was my rock! And now sheâ€™s gone and probably hates me! I canâ€™t live without her. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore!
