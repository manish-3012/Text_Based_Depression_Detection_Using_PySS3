I did something wrong and now i have to pay.....So....for the past 6 months i have been dealing with people who have been harassing me. threatening me and they made false accusations about me and posted them online. saying i was a pedophile and i should be attacked.....ive reported it to the authorities multiple multiple times. but nothing.. i have evidence ive been harassed and intimidated and threatened constantly...but nothing, ive isolated myself for months and all i had was hatred for myself that i let these people win . these people used to be friends....

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the UK. I'm 22, ive never been in trouble with the law. I have been a helping community member, volunteer, i have aspergers. depression, anxiety and anger issues.

I felt that i wasn't getting any justice. i was constantly being harassed by these individuals so i retaliated. not with violence but by accessing their amazon and some social media accounts. I did not hack this information, as i was their friend, i remembered their passwords but for some odd reason they did not attempt to safeguard their accounts

&amp;#x200B;

I spent Â£15 of their digital amazon gift card on ebooks and then deleted their account. 2months later, the police knock at my door and tell me that i need to be interviewed for a fraud crime. i went to this interview where i spoke to a solicitor and told the truth....

&amp;#x200B;

I did access their accounts and shut down their Instagram and amazon account through illegal means which counts as fraud...

&amp;#x200B;

The interviewer is pushing to give me a caution...but it could go to court....i'm not built for court....they said they could seize my pc but since i confessed what i did they might not need to. theres nothing to hide here anyway but....as sad as it sounds. the pc is my life.....

&amp;#x200B;

I know what i did is wrong...i wouldnt have done it if i was not being harassed all the time....i did it because these people didn't stop and pushed me into a corner. they lost nothing while i, from their mental abuse... they have caused me to attempt suicide many times. i cut my neck with a hunting knife....i took many overdoses to which i passed out for days..i hung myself but didnt hang their long enough to pass out as i was scared....i dont really want to die....but ive been suffering for 11 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm sitting here with so much anxiety my heart feels like its going to give out....i want it to...i feel like ending my life because I don't know what i may face now....I am certain ill end it. It probably sounds pathetic but this is where i am. I am suffering from memory loss issues from stress, ive been so depressed i cant move...

&amp;#x200B;

If someone could ease me...just a little...what punishments may i face??? its been days since my interview and nothing. please...
