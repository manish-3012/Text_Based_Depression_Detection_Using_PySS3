I cannot be lovedWhy would anyone love me? Care for me? Put me first?

I just got out of a 5 year relationship. I still can't wrap my head around why she loved me and stayed with me that long.

I don't know what loving yourself feels like. I don't know what being happy means. The only thing I know is that I don't want to be here anymore.
