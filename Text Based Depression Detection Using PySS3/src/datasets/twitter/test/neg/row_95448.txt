I donâ€™t matter.Iâ€™m going to kill myself on October 26. Iâ€™m going to slit my wrists in a hotel room while three of my closest friends donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m taking such a long â€œbathâ€. Iâ€™m going to say sorry over and over again to the people in my life while I wait to bleed out until Iâ€™m not even there anymore. Iâ€™m done with life. I donâ€™t get why my friend cares. He should just not care like everyone else. Iâ€™m sorry man. I canâ€™t do it.
