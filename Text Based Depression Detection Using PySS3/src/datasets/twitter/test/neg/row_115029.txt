I need to dieI hate being alive. I hate being trapped as the person I am. I hate how there is something inherent about me that drives every single person away. I hate how every time I try to get closer to someone all of the effort I spend just makes them find me more disgusting. I am tired of wanting to hurt people. I am tired of getting flashbacks to all those moments where the people closest to me turned on me without any hesitation. By killing myself, i will simultaneously have freed myself and gotten my revenge by putting my blood on the hands of everyone who hurt me, betrayed me, or tried to get rid of me.
