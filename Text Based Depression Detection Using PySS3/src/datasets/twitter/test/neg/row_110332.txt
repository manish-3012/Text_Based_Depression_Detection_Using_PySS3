I SURVIVED AND IT FREAKING SUCKSTL;DR Since my last post, I tried to kill myself several times and I chickened out. Now I'm panicking. I might try again.

I had it all planned out. I set up a nice heartfelt goodbye post on here, I wrote a note. I went to school for one last day just for the sake of having a last day. 

Come time to kill myself. Unfortunately, there was some flaws in my method that made it too easy for me to chicken out. So that's what I did. I CHICKENED OUT. Not once, but THREE TIMES. First time, I had a good cry, because I realized that dying was kinda scary. Then I reminded myself how shitty my life was, so death couldn't possibly be worse. Then I tried again. Then I stopped instinctively because it was getting too painful. Then I chided myself again, and tried again to hang myself, and this time I made sure that no part of my body was touching the ground so that I couldn't chicken out again. Third time, I somehow managed to tip over a nearby wastepaper basket and stable myself. So I gave up. 

Let me tell you this, I didn't chicken out because I suddenly realized that I have so much to live for or whatever. The only fucking reason I stopped myself was because I got scared that it would hurt. That's the ONLY REASON. If I found a complete, foolproof, painless way to go, I would absolutely take it, no hesitation. But for now, I'm SCREWED. Dying is literally the one thing I ever wanted for six years, and I can't even do that. Because I was SCARED. I'm a fucking coward. 

I think what I have to do is choose a method where there is no turning back. Unfortunately I don't have access to anything except Tylenol and a rope, which are both painful and easy to go back on. I have to find a higher place to hang the rope but there is no place in the house except the place I chose previously, which is NOT WORKING because it's too close. I considered going to the nearby forest and doing it there (or maybe just climbing a tree and jumping) but I'm literally too lazy to get up off my ass. 

What if I ultimately decide to not do it? What the fuck do I do? I planned for my life to end here, right here. These past few days felt like a dream, because I am supposed to be DEAD and I'm NOT. What am I supposed to do from here on out? I know the right answer is, "Try to live life normally and eventually everything will get better," but frankly, it sounds ridiculous to me. The past couple years have all been the same, depressing sludge and I cannot see how my life is supposed to change in the future. The only worthwhile thing I can see myself doing next, really, is try to kill myself again.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and final marks from first semester are coming out tomorrow (actually today, since its 2:30 am while I'm writing this). I'm pretty sure I TANKED my finals because I completely half-assed them, since I was so sure I'd be dead enough to not care. But I'm NOT dead, and now I have to deal with my parents. Dad's probably going to lose it. Last report card, my lowest grade was a high B, and he completely blew up. Not "I'm really disappointed in you and you really have to try harder because this is your future here" blow-up, but "YOU'RE A DISGUSTING UTTER FAILURE, I KNEW YOU WOULD BE A PROBLEM EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN, I DON'T WANT TO EVER SEE YOUR WORTHLESS FACE EVER AGAIN. ONCE YOU'RE 18, YOU ARE GONE" blow up. Since my grades are probably in the 70s, there's a possibility I'll end up homeless this time. I'm scared. I actually tried again before writing this post, so that I wouldn't have to face him, but I decided not to, because what's worse than Dad yelling at me over my report card is Dad yelling at me over my report card while I have brain damage from a failed attempt. I'm really scared I don't know what he might do.
