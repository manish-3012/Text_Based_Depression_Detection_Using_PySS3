I'm so tiredI keep getting spontaneous flashbacks of my ex when I sit in certain places in my room or feel pressure against certain parts of my body. He was emotionally abusive to me, and tried to make me do things I didn't want to sexually. Looking back on our relationship, I feel stupid and weak. There were, like, a billion red flags that would have told me that he sucked if I'd listened to them, but I was so blinded by the idea of being A Real Gay in A Real Gay Relationship that I sort of ignored all of that. He had a very specific idea of me, as well. I can come across as quite feminine sometimes, and he tried to leverage that to get me to bottom for him- something which I don't want to do. He'd often spank me, try to gag me with his fingers or call me a bitch during sex without explicit consent or the chance for me to talk it through with him in a 'sober' manner beforehand. He wanted me to act like a girl- a few times he called me 'she' or made jokes about me being  'gamer girl', even though I told him not to do that. I feel like my body isn't mine anymore. He decided that he wanted to just be friends with me at several points during the relationship, but he would still flirt with me or make explicit comments about my body. He harassed me even after the relationship ended- calling me repeatedly or trying to reach me on platforms I've blocked him on. I'm genuinely terrified of him- he knows where I work and where and when I meet up with my friends. Nothing he's done is technically illegal, and even if it was I'm too scared of being that fucker who wrongly accuses someone of rape to report him for anything. I've had nightmares of him showing up at my house or trying to get into my room once quarantine is lifted, and there's not really any escape from that. 

My ex is only the latest guy who I've let be comically abusive to me. Friends, parents, teachers, co-workers, I've let almost everyone I know trample over me. I thought it was getting better when I moved to a new city for work- I managed to find a group of friends who know that what happened to me was wrong and they were trying to help me get the help I needed to become a better person. My ex kind of trampled all of that. He tried to get between me and my best friends, he made me meet up with him so often that I had little time to do anything else, he told me things about my friends that made me distrust them and so on. I'm trying to repair the damage now, but it's difficult. It's sort of shown me that no matter where I go, there'll always be someone trying to hurt or take advantage of me. I'm wondering if I'm the issue- if I'm just so broken that I draw other people into hurting me.

I don't have any means to directly kill myself, but I've been debating withholding food until I get severely ill for a while now. I've had an argument with a roommate (kind of my fault but he took it way too far) and I've been getting panic attacks when I leave my room because I'm worried I'll get into a confrontation. Today I ate so little that I was having trouble standing up, and when I actually managed to get a sandwich it made me feel more ill than better. I don't think it'll kill me, but it'll hurt a lot, and it should at least tide me over until quarantine is lifted and I can figure out a more solid method. I don't think I want to die- not really. I'm trying to apply for a doctorate and become a researcher, and I've got a mentor who's willing to help me with that. I want to do my doctorate and I want to get a boyfriend who cares about me and I want to go to therapy and get my head screwed on straight. I'm just not sure I can survive long enough to do that.
