What's the reason to not commit suicide?I don't have a terrible life, its not great but certainly not that bad. But i just can't think of a reason to stay alive because life is just a lot of hard work for a reward that is just so laughably small compared to the amount of work and suffering you have to endure.

What I'm saying is, why do people choose to want to stay alive? Why doesn't everyone just commit suicide. There is no meaning to life. There is no end goal. And there is no point to all this effort.
