Learned something today...I learned that no one would care if I died. Sure, my parents, siblings, and family would initially be sad- but they would get over it and move on. It would actually probably be better for them..they always tell me how stubborn I am. I always feel like such a burden and my mother deserves better. I guess I just used to think that if my life ended, everyone else's would too but I'm realizing the truth now. Plus, there is not one person in the world who absolutely needs me. I feel useless and selfish for even thinking that but I know it's true. I just wish I had someone or something to live for.
