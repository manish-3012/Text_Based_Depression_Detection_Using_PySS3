I just get home everyday and I take Xanax till I black out.Not being awake , or the feeling o freedom (of letting go, of nothing really matters) that kicks in before I pass out itâ€™s still one of the things that helps stay sane. Sometimes some whiskey helps. I just donâ€™t want to be here. And I want, just going to finish some small personal projects this semester, than slip into the sleep of nothingness. Cheers!
