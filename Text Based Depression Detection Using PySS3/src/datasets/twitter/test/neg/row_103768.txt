No real intentions but I just want to shareI'm 18 years, going through depression since October. Nothing gets better, I don't get any shit done, I gained 20kg in 2 years after a failed suicide attempt. I'm studying business IT but I'm super unhappy with it. My family gaslights me, I only have online friends. I'm thinking about self harming today, but I am clean since September 2018 and don't want to break it. I have no real hope or goals in my life, no happiness, don't know why I am alive
