I don't hate myself but I do want to die.I've heard people say they commit suicide because they hate themselves or are unhappy with who they are, the predicament they are in and the life they live. And that if they just go to counseling,  exercise, and better their lives and stop hating themselves they won't feel as bad. My thing is that I don't hate myself. I do hate being lonely or having to choose to suffer with dealing with my family and their selfishness and toxicity or being alone. The fact that jobs are harder to get more now than ever and I have no skills and no way to even get on my feet so i can move on my own.  I don't have friends that i could room mate with if I was successful and found a job. And if i managed to fibd a decent paying job (13-14/hr) id be working that full time and doing another minimum wage job part tine so i could just afford bare minimum. I wouldn't be able yo do college because i wouldn't have the time id i was working 14 ish hours a day in this scenario.  My parents want to move to indiana and i have been out of school for two years trying to save up. I originally wanted to gk to college but i was told blank point to my face "you're an inconvenience for anyone to have to drive you" so i worked and bought a car. A cheap one but a car nonetheless. Then i wanted to go to college adter i got my car and license but i had little money so i worked some more and started the FASFA applications... and I was told they were wanting to move so i tried working more and looking gir places to stay... then my sister asked for help in Indiana with things.  I quit my job to help her because "Family cones first" right? Well in every case except for mine it does. Family comes first except for when it is referring to me. Anythibg i need i have to get on my own.  My parents ask me for money yhat i dont have. Took money from me when i was in HS trying to save up (wiyhout telling me) when we had to have joint bank accounts because you cant have one on your own untill you are 18... i tried to do things on my own and get a start on life but everything and everyone kept knocking me down. I thought maybe it was my fault but you know i haven't done anything wrong. Not that i can see anyways. Now im still looking for a job after i quit my last one to help my ungrateful sister who treated me like shit just to have my selfish parents tell me i have 3 months yo figure something out because theyre moving to indiana (from texas is where we are at) may 1st... what am I supposed to do / what am I doing wrong? Is it wrong that I want to kill myself? I don't hate myself but I wouldn't mind not existing anymore. 
Tl;DR
I have till may to figure  out living situation and I'm not even on my feet yet. Should I just offmyself to save everyone from having to worry (not that they would) and myself from stressing out too much about it.
