Looking Through the GlassI often hear people discuss depression like itâ€™s a cold; something that can be cured by a pill. It runs so much deeper than that. We are treated like lab rats by our physicians. We are speculated upon by psychiatrists. We are shunned by society. However, when the unknown percentage of us take that leap, no more are the snide remarks; no more do people say hurtful things. This is just my opinion. Iâ€™m not suicidal, but my heart breaks each time I learn of one of us falling into the abyss. Think positive, because life does get better and easier, I swear.
