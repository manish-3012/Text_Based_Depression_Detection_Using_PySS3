I wanna dieI'm 18 recently graduated (barely), I got taken away from my birth parents at 15 because they were drug addicts, many people tell me I'm smart and can be whatever I want but I'm a lazy POS and I feel like I have no place in this world. My legal guardian is deciding to kick me out, I work 20 hours a week for 10.50 an hour. Im dirt broke rn and have 400$ in back taxes and it's all too much and I wanna die
