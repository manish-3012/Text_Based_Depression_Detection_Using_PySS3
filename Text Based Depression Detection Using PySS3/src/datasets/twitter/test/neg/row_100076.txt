+63 XEver since I was on highschool, the thought of killing myself is always by my side. When something went wrong, I instantly think that suicide is the answer. Now I'm on my 2nd yr of college, I'm scared that I might really do it this time, but I feel like it's the only way.I'm tired. Life is not for everyone.
