I try to get help but nothing works, nothing seems to help, maybe I just don't want to help myself. Maybe I'm actually the useless person that I tell myself.Hi guys, Idk what drives you to my post but i suppose you came here because you have some sort of concern for me and my wellbeing. 

Well, to be honest, I haven't been doing great for pretty much my whole life. I've been on the edge of giving up for a while. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, there is little to no hope for me at this moment. Nothing to gain. I've been thinking about ending my life one of these days, it seems like a peaceful way to go out. Its poetic in a way, for me to go out by my own hands before the world takes me. 

Well, idk if anyone will read this, however. This may be my last post on this site. I'm not sure if I can stay in this world any longer. Nobody would want to converse with me anyway so I guess it doesn't matter.
