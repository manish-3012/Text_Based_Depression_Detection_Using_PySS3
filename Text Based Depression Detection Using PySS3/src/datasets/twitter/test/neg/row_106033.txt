Fuck my life so bad. Maybe someone can relate. Wanting to dieSo I am 32 years old. I actually graduated from college with a degree in Business Management. I've done nothing with it. I've only worked in restuarants for the last 10 years or so. I got laid off from covid in March. I have nothing now. I am married with a 8yr daughter. My parents and her parents are still alive. It's the only family I basically have. 

I feel like a loser basically have nothing to show for. I have been been investing in the stock market for a long time now. Iv'e lost so much money in the stock market I don't feel anything anymore. I keep going back at it like an idiot would do. I keep trying to change my strategies. The first few times I failed I blamed it on being a rookie. Now this past time I failed I can only blame myself. What sucks is the ticker I traded, I would have had over 40k if I played it better. I got up to 20 k and lost it all. I feel like a giant fuck up. Now I feel 'Numb' like the songs from Lincoln Park. Ive lost so much money at the casino as well. I just feel like a giant failure. I feel like I am  a giant disappointment even though I know they would say that's not true. 

What other sucks is I used to be so into the deep wonders of the universe. I used to read a lot about science and the idea of the multiverse. Now it just feels like were living in a endless reality. We don't have as much of choice as we think we do. If the mulitverse is true then in an other universe we are just the actions that in an other universe didn't do basically. The fact that entropy is always increasing in ours doesn't help either. Any way the point is that I used to get excited about the wonders of the universe. Now I don't. I don't want to die but I feel like I am not alive anymore. I don't enjoy anything anymore.

 I only wanted to succeed in becoming a successful trader. I knew it was a double edge sword going into the market and now I feel like the other end of the sword is time. I don't want to go to therapy because they will never change how I feel. Im the only one who can understand what I have gone through

Life is boring. I don't have friends anymore, even if I did im sure it's just temporary or they are so predictable. I still try to work out when I feel better but when I am down it's hard. I would refuse to take medicine because I know how that story plays out. It's not even a depression it's just after getting beat up so much you don't feel anything. 

My mom tried helping me last year when I was down and gave me 1500 and I promised not to use that for investing. Well I did use it for investing and lost it all. I can't talk to my mom and I don't want to stress my wife out even more. Years after years of failure take a toll. I don't want to kill myself yet or at least I am too scared to do it. When I hear people of commiting suicide I think that I don't have the guts to do that like they did. 

I don't know who to try to talk to. My depression is just external and not internal as much. Maybe some one can relate. The idea of my daughter being sad after I am gone is one of the only things keeping me alive. I would want to know my daughter will be in safe hands. Or if my wife found someone who can make her happy. How would I even talk to her about any of this. Thats why I just keep all my feelings to myself. It's too deep to handle.
