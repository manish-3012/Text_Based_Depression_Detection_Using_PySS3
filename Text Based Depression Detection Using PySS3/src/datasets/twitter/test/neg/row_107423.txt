Something is wrong my entire life without any particular reasonI wonder if there is someone out there who feels the same. I didnâ€™t get through any trauma, I was simply not interested in doing anything from the beginning of my life. Never cared for my family, never had any sex drive or other â€œnormalâ€ feelings. I was told how extremely pessimistic I am since I remember. I decompose into the prime factors simply everything I do and wonder if I do it right or rather like a loser. By everything I mean literally everything. Washing my face, making a sandwich, smoking a cigarette. So I avoid taking any action as much as possible. I donâ€™t have any opinions on any topic. Iâ€™ve recently graduated from high school and spent the last entire month just laying in bed as much as I could with my phone watching videos on yt and trying to analyze how people work. I tried to do self harm to release feelings or whatever but it felt like any other thing I do, just wondering if I do this in right way or not. About a week ago suicide came to my mind. I am not suffering or anything, it just feels like a good option because I literally do nothing for this world, just exist and question everything. I know that my mom would be heartbroken but she also is now, when she sees how I waste my life. I procrastinate even with making a plan to kill myself. I hate that I canâ€™t even do this single thing.
