Help me dictate my next moveHi Iâ€™m 19 years old, I donâ€™t know what actually happened to me in a way, I mean sure I was bullied when I was young till I was 17, but at some point Iâ€™m used to bullying, got a girlfriend when I was 18 just breaking up after something weird starting to happen to me;

I was questioning my life, questioning everything. That time I never felt lonelier and nothing I do is meaningful. I didnâ€™t have friends and was mostly lonely all the time, itâ€™s seriously tiring and very suffocating. It feels so heavy to live and just continue to go on. I wanted more from life I think when I know life canâ€™t offer more. Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™m in no position to complain; my family is privileged (quite rich Iâ€™d say), I signed a contract for a sponsorship when I was 17, and basically I have no reason to complain, but I still didnâ€™t feel happy at all, I feel miserable and all I do is spend my money on some stupid stuff just to seek for that random happiness, Iâ€™ve been fighting off my thoughts that tells me to just end it all for real and for good, I tried to hang myself a couple times, but I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me.

Itâ€™s been a year now, Iâ€™m on medication 1.5 tablet of lexapro and 0.5 tablet of aripriprazole and am going to therapy, itâ€™s been a year since but Iâ€™m still not happy at all and I just wanna die. The feeling of being miserable, not belonging and the feeling of just not important is overwhelming me and I just wanna die, Iâ€™ll post this here and give myself 24 hours to let the Reddit community decide my next fate, Iâ€™m so tired of fighting this off and all I get is some advice that I tried before like meditation and stuff but trust me it ainâ€™t helping, and the more I tried and it didnâ€™t help, the more I feel incurable and the more hopeless I feel. 

Haha cheers to the last 24 hours!
