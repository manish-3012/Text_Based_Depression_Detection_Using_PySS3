Hopeless feelingHey,
So this is my first post on reddit.
Im curently 20 years old and i have the feeling that everything goes downhill rn.
Since a year everyday feels like a stupid routine, it wasnt that strong at first and my (ex)GF distracted me of the feeling.
Last month she dumped me, bc she Said she has no Feelings for me anymore..but i still do, but now is my closest person gone and a Part of my existence too. Last month i moved Out of my parents too and i live alone too. I have no one left to Open my emotions and my struggles. I Love my parents and they Love me, but we dont really have a Close relationship i never told my parents my thoughts or problems and im too scared open up to my friends about this topic. My dreamcarrier doesnt work Out too and im pretty Sure that nothing else would be interessting or possible. My mind is killing me everyday i Fall asleep at 5-6 am bc i think about everything every night that everything i do is useless and the Rest of my Life wont be fulfilling.
Sometimes i think about suicide Just to get rid of my 
Of my unknown future.
Im blessed by my parents and my only 3 friends, 
But i still feel hopeless, empty, lonely and trapped in a dailyroutine.

Sorry im not particularly good in english 
And i know that most of it is random garbage 
But i just wanted to tell Somebody
