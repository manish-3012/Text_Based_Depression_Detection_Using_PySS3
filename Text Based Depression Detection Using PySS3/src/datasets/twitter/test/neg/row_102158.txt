How Ridiculous. Do you know what really ticks me off? The debilitating fact that some of us suicidal people can't even acquire the necessary materials required to off ourselves; depending on our method choice. I had everything detailed and planned in my journal entries, and I even depicted it in timing calculations and drawings. However, I had to use my money for food and some clothes because my parents wanted me to. That money was supposed to be used to get a firearm off of the street for me.

That was my birthday money, my parents don't want me getting a job yet because I'm only 17 they say. I needed around $300-$500 to pay for a firearm. I specifically wanted to purchase a Glock 19 because glocks are safe handguns, which means they won't randomly discharge like other guns unless you pull the trigger. Additionally, they also have three easy safety mechanisms that I can easily unlock. Now, it's all gone and my plans are ruined. 

Has that happened to anyone before here?
