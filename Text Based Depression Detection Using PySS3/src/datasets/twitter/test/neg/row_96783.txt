My girlfriend struggles with suicidal thoughts quite often. I feel so helpless and live with the constant fear that sheâ€™s going to do it.We are in a long distance relationship and that makes it so much harder. Her family isnâ€™t too supportive. Shes been to an inpatient facility after a past attempt and is on medication. Yesterday on facetime she told me she was planning on doing it that night till I called. Just looking for advice or kind words.
