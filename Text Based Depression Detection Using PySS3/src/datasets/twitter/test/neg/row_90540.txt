Tired of being called selfish and a coward.I am tired of taking other people's feelings into consideration before my own. Why can't people ever think about how I'M feeling?


Why do I have to worry about upsetting my family because they say they love me? If they loved me then they wouldn't want me to feel like this all of the time. They wouldn't want me to feel miserable for the rest of my life. They wouldn't want me in pain every waking moment. 



I don't want to be up all night crying anymore. I don't want to hurt. I don't want to feel the weight of everything pressing down on me all at once. I don't want to continuously imagine all the ways I could die. I don't want to think about the car behind me not stopping at a red light, or driving off into a ditch or a bridge. I don't want to think about my hair flowing as I jump. I don't want to think about how many of those pills in the bottle would be enough. I don't want to think about buying a gun and a case of bullets. I don't want to think about if there were a house fire how I'd rather just burn to death or inhale the smoke. I don't want to think about all of the ways my own body could kill me on its own, or how many cigarettes I could smoke to move the process along. I just want it to be over. 


I've struggled my entire life and I am ready to go, right now. 


I have sought treatment and help, talked to people, tried numerous medications but to no avail. I seriously cannot handle anymore. I'm done.
