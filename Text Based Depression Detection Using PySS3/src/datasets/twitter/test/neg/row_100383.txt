I Tunred 19 Today.And I absolutely fucking hate it. I was supposed to be dead by 16, yet here I am. I know I'm supposed to be proud for staying alive or whatever people say, but how the fuck can I do that when I feel like things constantly go down hill? Living is so tiring. Trying to kill myself for the 7th or 8th time is so tiring. Everything is tiring. I'm tired.
