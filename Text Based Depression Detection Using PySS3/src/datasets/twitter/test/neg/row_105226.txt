NothingnessI feel nothingness in my mind and soul. Nothing to live for. Like i said in previous post, i feel like im better off not alive. Put myself at peace with the war with myself. Dont get me wrong i love myself. Its just my life and the the way things that turn out for me are terrible. I may be overthinking certain events but it just hurts knowing the damage from them. No way truly knows the depression and constant thoughts of bringing harm to myself and others. Am i crazy or just hopeless. Good for nothing loser. Get do anything right in my life. I know itâ€™s all about making mistakes and getting back up but i cant do this anymore. Fighting this battle and im losing every night.
