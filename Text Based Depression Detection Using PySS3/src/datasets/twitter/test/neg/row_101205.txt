Having suicidal thoughts again for the first time in years.I'm lonely. I'm tired of being lied to. I'm so tired. I've tried every avenue I can think of. I've improved myself. But no matter what, nothing changes. And now the thought of ending the pain is very enticing to me. No one near me, none of my friends know what its like to feel like this, they never have issues. I'm just an ugly monster who's probably a terrible person as well, I can't understand why no one even takes the time to respond to me. I'm unloveable. There's no other reasoning I can lead myself to.
