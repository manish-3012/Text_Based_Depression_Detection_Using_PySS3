Hey folks thatâ€™s all for now, and thereâ€™s not gonna be anymoreI want to die. Flat out I. Want. To. Die. So why is it so hard to say that not in text. I canâ€™t voice anything and not feel immense judgement. Wether the judgement is real or in my head I feel it and itâ€™s real to me and I canâ€™t do anything and it crippled me. Iâ€™m not even sure if I really want to help myself or if Iâ€™m going for the woman I love. I donâ€™t think I want help. I just want to waste away. Get shit faced and high watch some adult cartoons and cock the gun and shoot. I canâ€™t reach out to people because no one wants the burden or they canâ€™t handle it so I just push them away instead. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here. Maybe Iâ€™m just bored and want someone to talk to before I die
