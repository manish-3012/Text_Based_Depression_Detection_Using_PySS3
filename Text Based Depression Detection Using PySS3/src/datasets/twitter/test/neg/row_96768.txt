post-schizo warfare premature relationshipi am paranoid and think *the world is* against **me. i spend** my day lying in my room #wasting my *time.* i suck at everything and **have no** talents. i ~~wanted to~~ become an artist *but ill probably* just f^a^d^e in ***o b l i t e r a t i o n*** since *nobody* even *#looks* at my art.

i look at all the **art online** and it just makes me **depressed** because its all just people *trying to get* **attention** and *not caring* about ***meaning***; they want ***upvotes and likes and money*** and i *wonder whats the point in competing if nobody* even **understands** the difference between *someone* like wolfgang tillmans and your average *behance design hopper*

my head has had this numb feeling for 2 years now i think my frontal lobe is despanding and now ill probably get a brain anurysem or something. the girl i moved in with ***wants to take control of my life.*** i cant do anything about it anymore, its pathetic really i feel pretty useless and trapped in this 2d box like a flatlander.
