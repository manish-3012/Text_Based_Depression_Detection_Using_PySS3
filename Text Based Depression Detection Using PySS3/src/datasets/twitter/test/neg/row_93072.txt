First post, venting/informingHey guys, never done this before but recently my depression has become overwhelming. To start it off I was diagnosed in 4th grade (fucking Jesus right?) A year after my favorite cousin had died in a car accident. I never knew what it meant or how it affected me but now I realize my suicidal thoughts as a small child were a direct outcome from my depression. It became prevalent in 8th grade that I was beginning to worry my peers, I would be avoided at all costs because I was the kid who wanted to kill himself, only the group of outcasts accepted me and I was alright with this. High school came around and I had got a girlfriend, she was considered emo by most people but I didn't care, she was a beautiful girl who spread nothing but joy wherever she went, we dated for a year and now she was a freshman and I was a sophomore. Despite our happiness we broke up but continued to be amazing friends. That is until she started getting bullied. She became distant and wouldn't act the same at school anymore, she refused to tell me who the bullies we're because she knew I would get the whole school riled up. On a weekend during October, I got a random text saying "Thank you :)" and I thought nothing of it, which was idiotic of me. I found out later she had drank 2 cups of bleach and then hung herself before sending a mass text to all her friends. I was mortified, I had lost a best friend. My first suicide attempt came some months afterward, which was obviously unsuccesful, I chickened out and had to say I cut my wrist climbing a fence. The years go by until I'm a senior in high school, it seemed life was great, I met a beautiful girl, I graduated, I was popular, I felt in top of the world. After high school, I became the shell of the guy I was, I lost weight rapidly, college was some time away and I was stuck in my house, I could not find a job, my friends stopped talking to me, and now my girlfriend doesn't even care about me anymore. My parents love my sister more than me and insist that I stay alive for them. They make me feel selfish when I talk to them about it and the only person I had to talk to was my girlfriend and now she's become distant as well. I can't seem to get anything under control and the pressure has been mounting. I've never felt depression as strong as this before and just need to know what go do. Thank you for reading about my sorry life.
