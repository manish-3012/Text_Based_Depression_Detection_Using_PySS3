Sometimes I want help but sometimes I donâ€™t.Ever since I was old enough to wrap my head around the concept of death, I knew I wanted to go out on my own time. Recently Iâ€™ve felt that time was now. Iâ€™ve attempted in the past a few times, all of which failed. My first attempt was over some bullshit in the 6th grade that Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t end it over. I had my dads gun to my head with the door locked because of something one kid said. My second was after my dad had thrown trash across the room, hitting me with it, because I forgot to put a bag in the trash can after I took out the trash. I was going to od. That was in the 8th grade and I fucked up and didnâ€™t take enough. My third attempt was after Christmas 2016. I had had two deaths in the family that year and just the overwhelming sadness over my entire family brought me down to a new low. Plus during that time I was feeling more and more lonely. I hadnâ€™t been in a relationship for a couple of years and it was hitting me hard. Also my dad was being more and more verbally abusive to me and my mom. Yelling, cussing, screaming, making threats, etc. on a nearly daily basis. My plan then was to slit my wrists. Damn that shits hard to do. My fourth attempt was a few weeks ago. My girlfriend (now ex) had told me her plan to kill herself. Me being the over thinker that I am, blamed myself. Me thinking that she wanted to kill herself to get away from me or it being something that I did made me want to end it all. That night I drank excessively hoping for alcohol poisoning while at the same time popping Xanax like it was candy. I was so angry when I woke up the next morning that I was still alive. Since that night, I thought that I had recovered, but now I know I havenâ€™t. For about a week now Iâ€™ve had this plan. Yesterday was gonna be the day. Everything lined up. My (ex) girlfriend started the day off with a break up text. I knew it was coming. That girl though... she meant everything to me. Iâ€™ve never loved anyone as much as I loved her. Other stuff, too. My friends from kindergarten till now have all turned their backs against me because Iâ€™m a â€œpotheadâ€ and an â€œalcoholicâ€ (neither of which are true). My parents have been getting more and more disappointed in me. I havenâ€™t been happy in a while. Iâ€™ve forgotten what happiness feels like. My plan may or may not happen, Iâ€™ll just have to wait and see how hard itâ€™s gonna be to pull off. My method, though, will work. But Iâ€™m still getting feelings of a small sliver of hope every once in a while. Last night (after my plan had fallen through because I couldnâ€™t get the resources together) I came home more drunk than Iâ€™ve ever been. I couldnâ€™t talk. I couldnâ€™t walk. But yet I drove home and made it. I walked in the front door to find my mom and Dad. Knowing there was no way out of it, I confessed to being drunk. In my drunken state I also told them of my recent suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve since told them that none of what I told them was true and that I just got drunk and told them that. My family has always considered suicide a taboo topic and I should have no reason to be sad. Iâ€™m not even sad anymore. Iâ€™m just numb. After receiving my punishment today, I want to do this even more. My punishment is a complete loss of all freedom. Plus breathalyzers before and after leaving Home along with drug tests. My freedom was the only thing keeping me alive. This is probably the end for me. Iâ€™m done. But then thereâ€™s still that small sliver of hope I get. It only lasts for a few seconds but then Iâ€™m back to feeling the way I do now. After so many failed attempts, this is going to be the one I donâ€™t fuck up. All I have to do is wait till I can get what I need. Itâ€™ll all be over soon. I canâ€™t wait.
