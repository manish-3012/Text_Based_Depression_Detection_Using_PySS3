I want to die but Iâ€™m just too scaredIâ€™ve lost everything and Iâ€™ve done terrible things. I canâ€™t stop feeling guilty for what Iâ€™ve done and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about the people Iâ€™ve hurt. Everyone hates me and I feel so alone and want to die but I feel like this is what I deserve so how can I reach out to people for help when I deserve to feel this way, I feel too guilty about moving on and being happy because I donâ€™t deserve happiness, I deserve everything that is happening to me but I hate it so much. I donâ€™t see any way out
