Not suicidal, just want to ventI ruined the relationship between me and my only friend in 1 night.

For the past 2 years, I have not *actually* talked with anyone. About 6 months ago, I started talking with this one dude in my programming class, and we kept on talking on a daily basis.

Tonight (on Twitter), I made a comment about disliking Big Brother, his girlfriend, and his best friend tell me to shut up. I reply that it is my opinion and that I'm not going to shut up. They start telling me to shut the fuck up, fuck off, and start attacking me and saying how they don't care about my opinion and that I should get a life, etc. Nothing I'm not used to.

I begin to get frustrated, call her a bitch, call him a douche (after he called me a douche). They start dragging my friend into it, saying that he should be defending his girlfriend and his best friend, not even caring about his opinion on the subject. About 20 minutes of arguing later, his best friend blocked me on Twitter, but his girlfriend kept at it.

At this point I was so pissed that I couldn't understand any of what I was posting, and I'm just saying words. I make a death threat to his girlfriend saying that I would rip her head off if she didn't fuck off, she dares me, but by that time I immediately regret saying anything of the nature. I admit that it was an empty threat, I apologized, and she keeps this shit going.

I'm at my computer just exhausted, I did not want any more arguing, and so I just keep relying for her to shut up and fuck off. She keeps telling me to shut up and fuck off, and I attempt to reason with her that I did not initiate the confrontation and therefore do not have the obligation to end it. Just being stubborn as fuck.

A few hours after the argument, I talk with my friend on facebook, and at 3:14 am, he tells me we need to talk telling me I can't be saying that shit to his girlfriend, I agree, and tell him I wasn't thinking rationally, and that I feel extremely guilty about it. He tells me it pisses him off and he tells me he loves her and that she is amazing (as though it's objective). I agree with him. He explains I insulted every one of his friends and that when he doesn't speak up about it, they get pissed at him. I agree with him, almost arguing with him, but I decide otherwise.

Then he tells me
&gt;now, i am mad at you. im not gunna talk to you for awhile , and when i decide that im okay ill talk to you again. but if the EVER happens again im not going to talk to you. ever again, got it?

And now I'm left here, feeling extremely guilty about everything I had said, knowing that I was completely wrong, and missing him.

**tl;dr** Got in an argument over twitter, threatened friend's girlfriend, immediately took it back, now I'm alone.

**EDIT: He posted to me on Facebook**

&gt;you have 2 days left of this. and no matter what u say or do what u did is always gunna be between us. so remember that.

**So, it's an improvement I suppose. The word 'always' kind of bothers me though, I suppose it will have to do.**
