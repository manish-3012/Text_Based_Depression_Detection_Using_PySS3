I really hate myself16 years old and already feel like i'm unfit for life. I'm such a huge fucking loser who cant do shit and constantly worried about disappointing my family. Parents want my to go to college or some shit, but they don't realize that i keep fucking everything up. Can't function in social situations at all. 

Say an average or maybe 100 words or less everyday and feel like a complete alien when I'm at school. Feel like everyone is constantly watching me and I don't know how to walk right or sit right or breath right at all. Constantly feel inferior to others because I look like some disgusting animal.

I have "friends" but they are more like distant acquaintances. Have no hobbies at all except playing video games, but I'm real tired of my life being 90% escapism as soon as I get home. Only reason I can't kill myself is my family and my dogs, but whenever the bus is driving past me after it drops me off I really want it to just run me over. 

Never had anyone willingly approach me in school and whenever I hear someone laughing anywhere in my general vicinity I assume it's directed at me. I have absolutely no idea what my future is going to be like. I have a brother in college already and he says he hates it already and my brother is a lot better than me so I'm pretty sure I couldn't handle it. Can't even handle the workload I have now because i am permanently tired and just go to sleep right after I get home, wake up at like 11 and then stay up and reddit or 4chan or playing games. 

Also please don't post any "PM me" messages. I'd rather other people like me could read your suggestions.
