How seeking emotional support from a close friend led me to talking about a disturbing dream about them and making yet another mistame apologizing and suffering againSo I had some stuff going on, and I talked to her about my situation. I had just woken up after a terrible nightmare, but which I shouldnt have mentioned her. While I was all worried about family situations, I ended up telling her how I woke up with a terrible nightmare about her, and I never really have dreams for months and so and I only have nightmares never a good one. This dream had her exposed on her facebook profile, and it was nude stuff her and her friend  but also a room filled with 10 people or so and seemed like a bullying case and someone said in the video "the teachers are involved too" and out of that fear I was pathetic and told her how ai tried to reach her after seeing her profile when she askef me in dream if I hadnt seen it yet when i messaged her a hi  and after seeing it i was gonna reply but saw she had deactivated and I thought she was hacked and some evil person posted it all to defame her, in the dream I waited many days for her to return and I never saw her again and thought she maybe killed herself. When I was worried, I didnt realize it was such a fucked up dream, she would  feel uncomfortable and think I am obssessed with her or have dreams of her and that since it was nude related kind of exposure, maybe she might think that I am a pervert and all, and so I forgot my family situation after some hrs, realizef how I fucked uo hard since she wasnt responding much and her last reply said its scary, referring to my dream, i tried to apologize anf show her i am sorry but she didnt reply. I tried talking few more times but to no help. In the end I gave up, didnt want to bother or burden her and now I just wont say anything more and just accept myself as a bad person.

I mess uo everything at life, and even when I go to seek help, I mess up as well. I am convinced I am better off dead and noone should have to deal with me and I already dont talk to much, Isolating is the only choice for me and I hope she isnt too hurt because of me and recovers. I hope she becomes happy and i do not deserve to be around her. I should change my name to sorryman because I am always sorry and mess up but I rarely ever improve myself.
