Tonight might be the nightIâ€™ve had my note written for a while now, I really just canâ€™t take it anymore. I refuse to deal with my absolutely shitty life. I wish I could go out with a bullet in my head or a drug overdose but I cannot live anymore. Everyday is worse and worse, I literally canâ€™t stand living, I have no expectations or goals in life so there is no point of living when I have nothing to live for.
