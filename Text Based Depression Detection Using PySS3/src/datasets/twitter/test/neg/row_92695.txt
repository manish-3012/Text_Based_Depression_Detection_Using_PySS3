Can I make jokes in theseGuess who's back, back again--

Can't seem to ever make up my mind. So many people want to believe in me, but I know I will never be a strong enough person to measure up to even the simplest of their expectations. I wish I could end it all before they get their hopes up, so that I'm not anymore of a burden on them.

I want to change so badly. But I've been wanting that with no action for my entire life. When will it be enough. When will everyone finally realize how useless I am and abandon me. When will I get the courage to recognize that it's either death or getting better.

I hate how weak I am. I just want everyone else to be happy, and I'd rather die than know how much of a disappointment I am to them for the rest of my life.
