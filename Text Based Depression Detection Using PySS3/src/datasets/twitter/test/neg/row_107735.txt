A summation of a broken life and why itâ€™s nearing its endTo start I am , for lack of a better term , what most would consider crazy . I suffer depression and bi polar  disorder . Iâ€™m in my mid 30s so Iv learned to deal with it , but it is without a doubt a very tall speed bump on this road thatâ€™s led me here 

When I was young my distain for our world began. I was always a chunkier kid so I was made fun of relentlessly . My parents by the time I was 13 were fighting every day , loudly , in a small 3 bedroom ranch . Every single word made it to my room , hiding from it wasnâ€™t an option . They split several times and my dad moved out more than once. My sister was in and out of my life relying on random boys to save her from our nightmare home and all the hate and flying objects there within . I was on track by 16 to play football in college and had been scouted and given a partial scholarship with conditions , then I essentially broke my back and my chance at colleges disappeared just as quickly as my football career did . 
I wasnâ€™t a good looking guy , I had a couple friends , but no good ones , I was single and a virgin upon graduation , with no plans and a lot of anger 

I began working at 15 years old at a Hollywood Video , and have worked almost everyday of the next 20 years . The grind wears down my already tired demeanor . And has worn away at me like a belt sander on wood .  I have never once enjoyed a job Iv worked at . I was told repeatedly that working hard and commiting would lead to eventual success . This is a lie to put simply . Regardless of my work , my decade at the same job , my tireless work ethic , o have been in debt my whole life , and as I near 40 I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever even own my own home . I have very little to show for my slave like devotion in the front half of my life. 

I have had a few relationships , I am even now engaged to a girl Iv been with for 2 years . Before that I had a few long ones , this could be a post in and of itself but instead I will shorten the sob story that would go here . I fell in love , she left me for someone else . I recovered , dated someone else for 5 years who cheated on me constantly , I stuck around because I felt no one else would want me . She got pregnant , said it was mine , we lost the baby at 9 months and never really recovered , I dated the next girl for 3 years , she to cheated on me , manipulated me , drained my bank account then left for someone else . We to got pregnant and lost this baby at 4 months which I got to watch with my own eyes . I still have nightmares . I love my current fiancÃ© , but I have no trust for anyone , and have never seen a healthy relationship in my life , so my faith that she herself is faithful is low and my belief it will end well is next to nonexsistent .  I have actually developed a distrust and dislike for women in general to no fault of their own . My mother , and previous gfs left me with a bad taste in my mouth . 

I could continue , paragraph after paragraph of why I will put my Bersa 9mm in my mouth and silence the noise in my head soon . But instead I will  end it about here , I will say , I have diabetes . Heart issues . Bad knees , a bad back , bi polar disorder , depression , Iv been cheated on , manipulated , used , homeless , in debt , Iv lost my children , I have no real family , I have no real friends , no plans and no hope . Not once in 35 years have I seen something in life that makes me feel hopeful for the future . Everyday Iâ€™d another attempt to survive without breaking , and itâ€™s exhausting . My happiest moment is when I get home from work and get to watch one of the same 7 shows I watch on Netflix and I know I donâ€™t have to deal with anymore fake people untill morning. Every morning I wake up and get in the shower to start my day I cry , from anxiety and sadness of what and who my next 12 hours will contain . I love just to make it to my chair and watch my show . 

This world wasnâ€™t meant for people like me . Iâ€™m not a winner . Iâ€™m not even good. Iâ€™m a cog in the machine of America . And itâ€™s become overwhelming . No release , no reprieve , just another day . 

Time to go get in my car and drive to my job . Which maybe I should be thankful for , but instead makes me question why I even got out of bed .
