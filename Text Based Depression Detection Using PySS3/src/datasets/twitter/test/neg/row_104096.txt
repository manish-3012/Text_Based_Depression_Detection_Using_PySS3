The last of me has been brokenYesterday was the last day where I had something left in me. Tomorrow I was supposed to go to a job interview, I should be preparing but my soul is so atrophied I don't have the will to get out of my bed. Life knocked me out yesterday and I don't have any drive to keep on fighting. I begged not to wake up but here I am and God must be laughing because everything is such a joke. 
The pain is unbearable, there is a hole in my chest that is sucking up everything still left of me.
I am looking at the wall and there is not even much thoughts left, the pain overtakes all.

I am not good enough, nothing is good enough, life will never be good enough. 

There is nothing left of me, and the shard of my broken self produce grief so intense I can never relax from fhe pain of it's cuts.

I feel this is my end line
