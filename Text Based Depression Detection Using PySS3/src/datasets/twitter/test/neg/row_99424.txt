I already know how this sounds.Iâ€™ll get the strange part out of the way: I feel like the universe is giving me signs to kill myself. 

Itâ€™s okay to stop reading if it doesnâ€™t make sense to you, it doesnâ€™t really make much sense to me either, but I just get a strong feeling that this is the way things are. 

Iâ€™ve never been a super religious person, but I do try to look for little signs that Iâ€™m on the right track; however, lately, I feel like Iâ€™m only on the right track when Iâ€™m thinking about suicide. When I try thinking about future plans, they get dashed quickly. Even if itâ€™s small, like having a conversation with a friend, my plans end up ruined. Iâ€™ve felt suicidal for over decade, but Iâ€™ve never felt this strongly that my time should be ending. 

I know that this probably sounds crazy, but Iâ€™ve honestly never felt more clarity. Iâ€™ve held back in the past out of fear of failure, but how could it be wrong if Iâ€™m getting so many signs that Iâ€™m doing the right thing?
