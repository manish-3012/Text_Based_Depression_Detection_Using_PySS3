I'm seriously struggling to finish high school(I copied this from r/depression)


I'm in my last year. Even if I manage to finish this semester (1st), it will be a hit or miss because of my almost non-existent attendance. 

I have to tough it out for two weeks or so and catch up on the exams I missed, but no matter how much I try to force myself, I just can't do it. I keep telling myself that I just need the grades, it really doesn't matter whether I pass or fail, but I still can't even make it to school. Today in the morning I felt seriously determined to finally get out of my room and sit through the damn exams, but no.
I walked out of my house and just turned around and went back. 


I am fed up with myself, fed up with having to study, fed up with my school where every teacher hates my guts because I am a stupid slacker. 
I really want to finish this year, so that I will finally be done with high school, but I guess I'm just too damn lazy to even bother to crawl to my class like a fucking failure.
I hate myself, I want to violently stab myself in the face till I die and I don't know what to do.
