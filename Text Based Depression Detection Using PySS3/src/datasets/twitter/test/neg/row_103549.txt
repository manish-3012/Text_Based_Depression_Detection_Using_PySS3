Almost drowned myselfBroke my leg and cried for a bit. I'm just so done right now. Everything fucking sucks, I wrapped my leg went outside and jumped into my pool with my phone in my pocket and lay at the bottom for a while. Eventually i decided to get out but man, i wished i just stayed down there.
