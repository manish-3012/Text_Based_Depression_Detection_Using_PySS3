It feels like itâ€™s been the worst couple months of my life......but nothing bad has happened to me. In fact, things have been looking up more than ever. 

Iâ€™m succeeding more than I ever have, but I still feel like I was designed to fail. I love having a routine, but dread waking up to mine. I have so much to work with, but Iâ€™ll never be able to bring myself to put it to use. I know Iâ€™m not alone, but I wish I was, more than anything. 

I donâ€™t get why the more my life gets â€œbetterâ€, the more miserable I get. I canâ€™t tell whether I think I deserve more or less. 

Does it make sense if I donâ€™t want a bright future, I just donâ€™t want a future at all?
