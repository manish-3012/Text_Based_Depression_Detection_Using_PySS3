I just picked my death day.Iâ€™m 28, Iâ€™ve felt like I donâ€™t belong here since I was 16. Iâ€™ve always been too much of a coward to actually go through with it. But through a long series of fuck ups over the last month I have realized everyone I know would be better off without having to worry about me. Iâ€™ve picked my death day. I find comfort in knowing itâ€™s coming up. The only thing Iâ€™m going to regret is not seeing my children again before it happens. But their dad already took them from me so it doesnâ€™t matter anyway. 
Iâ€™ve picked my day. I just have to get what I need to end it. 
Thanks for reading. Good luck in your lives.
