Silence is killing me...I thinkReally didn't want to post this...I have no plan. Sort of, well, okay. Maybe a little bit, but it always fluctuates to something else, and I'm on a roller coaster of "should I or shouldn't I". I'm supposed to see a "real" doc tomorrow, my dad is helping pay for the visit, but I already see another doctor for free \- but the next appointment for that one isn't until the 19th. The doc tomorrow is supposed to be "better" than the free one, and I really don't want to go all because I think I can get different meds on the next visit to the free one. But I don't want to wait that long. See? Roller coaster. 

And with the "better" doctor, at least for the time being, I'm just going to end up asking dad for more money to help out and pay for more visits and medicine, probably bloodwork at a busy medical facility, and I feel that if I just save the money in my account for something else \(I desperately need cigarettes\), then I'll be fine. It feels like such a tug of war. I may sound coherent, but I'm tired of sitting around doing nothing, life is not going anywhere. I've been out of medicine for a couple of weeks now after OD'ing on Zyprexa for a quick high. I have a job upcoming late in the month, but I have no interest in it \(I guess no one has an interest in their job, but hey\). 

It feels like there's nowhere to go, and I totally feel like things would be A LOT better \(maybe a TON better, lol\) without me. Oh yeah, and my "best friend" of 20 years stopped talking to me the last two months \(he used to call me twice a week or more, talk for 30 minutes, now, we've talked maybe twice over the last month for about a total of 10 minutes. The latest call, during the whole three minutes, he was, "well, I got things to do, ttyl."\) \(okay, maybe he has a girlfriend now since recently being divorced, which is fine, but still\). 

  
AND, I even wonder if it's mental illness, because I feel my negative feelings come from having a shitty reputation everywhere I go, and I'd like to just say "mmmk bye, world!". Been pondering this for weeks, and I'm posting because I'd like some consolance, I guess, but I don't give af anymore...
