Ive had enough.Ive been feeling this way for a few months now and i think im ready to act on it. I am unable to live like a normal 20 year old because of an embarrassing medical condition that i cant even bare to type anonymously what it is, but there is no cure. I also have major anxiety issues, im very unattractive and ive never had a relationship. There is someone i love very much, but because of my inability to be able to do things any other 20 year old can do i cant be with him. So eventually i will have to watch him be with someone else who can be everything i cant. So really whats the point in living if i cant be happy. Without sounding like a whiny brat, its just not fair. I am a good person and i really want to be able to be normal, but i cant. SO my options are i live everyday feeling depressed and never do anything, or i just end it all now and find peace in death. Why me?
