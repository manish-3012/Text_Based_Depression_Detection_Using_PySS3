I'm thinking about jumping from a parking lot tomorrow nightI'm not sure if the building is high enough or whether I'd have the courage to step off the ledge. Not looking to be talked out of this. Looking for like minded individuals, I suppose. Read my prior posts if you're interested in why. Thanks.
