I can't deal with being so bipolar.Some days I'll be happy no matter what. I'll have all the energy in the world to do anything I want or need to do. I'll be able to function at either of my jobs, in grad school, around the house, with friends. Other days I can hardly get up out of bed. I feels like my entire life is crumbling around me. I worked so hard to get into grad school and now that I'm there, I'm failing my classes. I saw the school counselor and several others in recent years, but no one can help. The only thing that will end my lows is killing myself. 

I'm 22, trans, and alone and that's how I'll be when they find me. I don't want to burden my friends or what remains of my family with feeling depressed or suicidal. I told my mom that I used to cut myself, and she said she knew the entire time and that I was a failure. My dad can't stand to be around me. 

I'm a failure. I'm so sorry.  :'(
