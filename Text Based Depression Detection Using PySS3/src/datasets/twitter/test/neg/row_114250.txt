I'm unemployed, feel like i'm letting everyone down.I've only ever had a casual saturday job, and I'm 25. For the past 6 years, I have been diagnosed with an incurable disease - I now shit in a bag attached to my abdomen. I got my degree, which isn't very useful and for the past year since I graduated i have just been sitting at home, writing a novel, living on the remnants of my student loan. I have always been depressed, lonely - no friends, and increasingly suicidal. e.g. first thought in morning is often "get out of bed, leave the house and kill yourself. Some days I write 'kill yourself' on my to do list in hopes that I will actually do it. It has taken me a year to even begin to apply to jobs because I thought it would make my depression worse. Because I have also been unemployed for 6 years, I have no references. My father has just been made redundant and I need to get a job to help pay the bills. I feel so worthless. I feel like I'm always going to be an embarrassment to my family. I dont have any confidence and I don't know how to have. I sent my CV to someone, for a job not related to my degree, and they called me and I couldn't even answer the phone. I feel like, If i end my life, then everyone elses would be better.
