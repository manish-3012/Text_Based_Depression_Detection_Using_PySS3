School Makes Me SuicidalIâ€™m 17 years old from India currently in 12th standard. I have my boards coming up in March and then my JEE exam in April. I have totally no interest in what I have to study and the reason why iâ€™m so terrible at school. I have been an average student. I got an 8.8 CGPA in my 10th standard and they made it look like that iâ€™m a total failure. Now anytime iâ€™m giving an exam in school, my face and body goes numb and it seems like my brain takes this piece of paper as a matter of life and death.

My parents always want to me swallow books my throat down and they scream at me if they see me doing something else. They are constantly giving me lectures on what I should not and should do. They keep buying me extra books without even my consult. All this makes me feel that i'm wasting their money. I understand that they are concerned about my future but rote-learning and preparing for something that I wonâ€™t even remember for the next 2 years is enough to demotivate me from studying.

I have always been a practical kid. I love and have great passion to code. I know basic coding in about 7 languages while iâ€™m building stuff and having a great understanding in python. Iâ€™m fairly active and I think I have a good profile on GitHub (https://github.com/Ritiek) and I love the open-source community. I have also worked as a freelancer a few months ago and have reported a few vulnerabilities in software but nobody in my family seems to care. Iâ€™m now trying to learn about Artificial Intelligence but school interfering with all this and my parents always trying to force me study makes me depressed and sometimes even suicidal.

Thanks for reading this long post and I hope you guys can guide me out of this condition..
