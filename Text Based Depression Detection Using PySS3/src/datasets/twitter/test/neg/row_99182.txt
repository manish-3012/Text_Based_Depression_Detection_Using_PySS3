Should an ex be considered?Sorry if this doesn't belong here. I couldn't quite figure it out from the rules.

Hetero traditional marriage: Say you're the man and you were married 20-30 years, most of them happy, then divorced, uncontested, remained basically friendly with her but not close either. 10-15 years go by. Ex-wife bummed enough that s/he chose a loser (financially) but not blaming him all the time, just disappointed in her decision to marry him in the first place years ago. Could have had a much better life, more security, fun, etc. But she accepts that that's just life, just the way the breaks go. So if the ex-husband dies by suicide, would that make her feel even worse about how she may have made a bad choice to get married to him in the first place?

Or compare it to the opposite. Even if the couple was not compatible, would the ex-wife feel better about herself if her ex-husband went on to become very successful instead of having an ex-husband that did basically nothing then eventually did himself in? Does his suicide make her feel her original judgment of the guy when they first got married confirmed that he was a worthless, a bad choice, even worse than she thought? After all, maybe she feels she lost 20-30 years to this guy when she could have married a winner, a good catch. At least if he did well financially after they got divorced, no one could say he was a loser by nature that she married. More like just incompatibility. But if he sort of wanders aimlessly for 10-15 years after divorce, depressed, takes menial jobs, only treads water, no sign of success, then dies by suicide for reasons no one know but not related to her, does his suicide make it harder on the ex-wife? Maybe the ex-husband thinks about this and then doesn't want to make his ex-wife feel any worse. Any ideas about this? Sorry if this isn't clear but thanks for any insights.
