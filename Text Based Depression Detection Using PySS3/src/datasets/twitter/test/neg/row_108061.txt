AdviceHi! I am really struggling at the minute and cant get out of this dark mood. Ive been having mental episodes where I genuinely feel like im in a loop and already dead (hard one to explain) , and my sertraline has run out with issues at my doctor getting more prescribed.. Ive rang 111 and they havent arranged a callback yet. I am really struggling to stay on track amd just tell myself its the withdrawal and not me. Please, any advice needed.
