HelpI've been on a severe spiral for the past few months. I started hurting myself again, I forget to eat for days, and I've had severe suicidal tendencies. In the past day I've made a plan and I'm honestly scared. I need help that my family just won't give, so if you guys have any advice, I'm all ears.
