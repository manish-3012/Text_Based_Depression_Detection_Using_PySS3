Iâ€™m going to have to end my lifeI donâ€™t enjoy any aspect of life, and its been this way my entire life. I hate working a dead end job with no future, and I am not smart enough or even really motivated enough to study and maybe have a slim chance of getting something better. And even if I did, I still wouldnâ€™t be able to afford a house and retire quickly. Iâ€™ve completely lost interest in my hobbies, and the only emotion I feel nowadays is a burst of anger in an endless sea of apathy. I donâ€™t like this society. Now thereâ€™s this pandemic exposing the rich for the evil parasites they are, letting people die just so they can keep their money. And this is supposed to be one of the easiest times to live as a person. But I canâ€™t cut it. So Iâ€™m going to cut my throat and the artery in my leg, and finally get the peace I want. Not sure why I am posting this, guess I just wanted to feel special that Iâ€™m going through with this. Thank you
