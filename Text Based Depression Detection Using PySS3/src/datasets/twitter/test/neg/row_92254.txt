So close... why didn't she just leave me to die?!(Throwaway - obviously)

Was so close this time. Successful actually; it was just a matter of time. I was unconscious and fading. My body was going to lose the fight to stay alive.  Finally, blissfully, it seemed like it was done.

Until she came over...

Then i wake up in the ICU, spend a week in the ER, and then 3 days in "volunteery" in-patient care.

Balls.

Next time I guess =\
