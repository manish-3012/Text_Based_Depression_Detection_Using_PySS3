Why no one likes meAll my life Iâ€™ve felt like no one likes me. At work, at school and in my personal life. Iâ€™m always the one that is not appreciated. Like people donâ€™t hate me but they donâ€™t like me either. I do a little something that would passed completely unseen by another coworker but because itâ€™s me, itâ€™s a big deal. Iâ€™m I that unlikable? Iâ€™m nice and always try to do my best for everyone but for some reason no one likes me. Im I the only one?
