My chronic illness is killing meIâ€™ve been dealing with gastroparesis and IBS since about oct, recently Iâ€™ve been displaying symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome (maybe CHS). I also had to go on my second short term disability in a 6 month period. Is it even worth it anymore to try and fight this? I canâ€™t eat or drink anything I like anymore. I absolutely dread going to sleep because I know when Iâ€™ll wake up, Iâ€™ll be in such miserable pain. Maybe Iâ€™m just a fucking pussy, I should be used to throwing up by now. Now is the time when most people would show how strong they are, and all Iâ€™m showing is my weakness. Even my own boyfriend is getting tired of having to deal with my sick ass, making him stressed out. Life would be better for everyone including myself if I just would fucking die. Why wonâ€™t my chronic illnesses kill me? I want to fucking die, I donâ€™t care about life anymore.
