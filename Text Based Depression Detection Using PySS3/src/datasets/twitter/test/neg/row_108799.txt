How can I tell someone I am having suicidal thoughts without it turning into a huge mess??Long story short, I want to die. Well, its not so much wanting to die but I just wish I could stop existing. I want to disappear but without leaving behind any damage. 

I know wanting to die is not something to be taken lightly. Itâ€™s a horrible feeling. But at the same time, how can I begin to deal with this when I canâ€™t talk to anyone. The first thing I was told when I began school therapy was that if I made any mention of wanting to commit suicide, they would have to get people involved. What I want is to be given the chance to talk about it. Not with a friend or with someone who is also going through a similar thing. While its great to have someone to confide in and related to, the last thing I want right now is to know the only people I can relate to are people who also wish they were dead. Itâ€™s always nice to know I am not alone in feeling this way and that Iâ€™m not some abnormality, but I need to talk to someone who has no real reason to care for my existence but does anyway. Someone not connected to me as a friend or family member. Someone who wont get a look of terror when they hear me say I want to die. I just want someone I can unload everything on and I know they will listen through it all without scaring me with warnings of having to involve the authorities or whoever it is that is called when people wanna commit. 

I am at the end of my rope and need someone to talk to. But I donâ€™t want me trying to seek help to have repercussions.
