I wish Iâ€™d never been born at all.Should I live through the ordeal of my fucked up mental health or just die? I, for one, think that killing myself will be the kindest thing I can ever do to myself. Not like I havenâ€™t attempted before, itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m a loser. I donâ€™t want to live... not a tad. Why canâ€™t I just die?
