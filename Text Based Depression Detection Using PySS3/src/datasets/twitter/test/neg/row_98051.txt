One of these days I feel like Im gonna just do it.People around me keep pushing me to the edge. Even my brain. I cut myself when im very angry but not as how deep today after arguing with my mom.  My thoughts keep getting clouded everyday. I dont plan to commit suicide because of the process but what i did today im probably getting there. Someone please kill me.
