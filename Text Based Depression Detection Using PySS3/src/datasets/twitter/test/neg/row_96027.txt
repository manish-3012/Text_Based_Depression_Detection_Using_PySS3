been hospitalized twice in the past month and still want to dieso maybe it's fate / meant to be even though i don't believe in that shit usually.

granted the first time was for mixed mania with suicidal intent and i was a little too delusional to actually know what was going on but still. the second time i really truly wanted to die but i couldn't stand it when my parents started crying and i decided to try for them. i fucking regret that. 

i'm in intensive therapy and therapy and psychiatry and none of it is working. i still want to die and the only thing that's holding me back from doing something is the fear of failing and everything being even worse... i don't have access to guaranteed lethal means and i've read the statistics; i don't want a failed attempt.

people tell me to be patient but i fucking can't. i don't know what to do because i don't want to fail at killing myself but i also can't stay alive anymore
