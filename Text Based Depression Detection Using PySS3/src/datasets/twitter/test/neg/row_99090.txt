Itâ€™s kind of funny actuallyI work in health care, inpatient psych. Locked ward, pills in little cups, the whole nurse ratched thing. Iâ€™m sitting here, at work now actually, and I want to kill myself so goddamn badly. I have a bottle of sodium nitrite hidden in my car along with a pack of razor blades leftover from my last self harm breakdown. My boyfriend keeps a loaded gun under the bed and, when Iâ€™m alone, I practice where Iâ€™d put the revolver I keep in the closet in my mouth and give the trigger a few practice squeezes to get a feel for the weight of the pull.

For years, decades, Iâ€™ve had the thought that I should kill myself burning in my brain. Itâ€™s there when I wake up and itâ€™s there when I go to sleep. Iâ€™m such a massive stupid fraud. Iâ€™m lying to these people. Every person Iâ€™ve talked down through a panic attack or soothed when they start to sob when I ask â€œare you suicidal right nowâ€ Iâ€™ve been lying to them all. It doesnâ€™t get better, there isnâ€™t light at the end of the tunnel. Iâ€™m just doing a job and one day Iâ€™ll be gone and all of my patients will never know why.

Oh well, burner account. Another suicidal crybaby for the endlessly growing pile.
