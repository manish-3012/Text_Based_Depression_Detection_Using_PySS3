Ready to give upNothing has gone as planned. I've made bad career moves and found myself stuck in a dead-end job. I've been dating without success for years. My friends and family seem to have forgotten about me. I don't know why I exist. My dog is 14 years old, so when she's gone, nobody else will depend on me. I think that will be my time to exit the world. 

Previously, these were just hypothetical thoughts. Tonight I've begun researching methods and next I'll start estate planning. I have a brother who struggles, so I think I'd like to have enough in retirement for him to live off of. Also, I'll purchase long-term care insurance just in case this goes wrong and I become dependent. I'll probably quit my job first so my colleagues will just think I moved away, nobody will hear about it so nobody will be shocked. Some times I think about waiting until my parents are gone to spare them from losing one of their kids, but that could be 30 more years. 

It's our instinct not to want to die. I keep telling myself that I can just do this, or do that and it will solve my problems, but nothing I've tried has gotten me anywhere. I think it's time to stop trying and just bow out.

edit: the more I sit here, the less I want to wait. I don't want to live anymore. I wish I had access to my method of choice right now.
