I Want to Die and Never ReturnMy life is over. I cannot go on like this. If I can't go back in time then I'm going to kill myself because I have nothing to live for. I live in a country that scams its young people into taking out predatory non-dischargable student loans and where the standard of living for young people is going down. I can't live in this country but my family ruined my life by raising me here and not caring about me at all. I just want to die right now and not ever have to deal with any of my problems. They're not worth living for! The suicide hotline can't help me! They don't care! No one cares! I personally just want to murder my family right now for even having the thought of doing what they did, they deserve to die and honestly they are a disgrace!
