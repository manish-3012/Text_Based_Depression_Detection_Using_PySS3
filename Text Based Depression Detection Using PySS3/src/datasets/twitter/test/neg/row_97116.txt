I feel like I've completely changed as a person, but I don't like who I am now any more than the old me.My girlfriend broke up with me like two months ago. We have very interconnected friend groups (my best friend dates her best friend and I'm friends with another one of her friends) and we all planned on going on a trip during March break. 

In the past two months that we've been broken up, we've continued to talk. Three days before we left for the trip she said wanted to rekindle while we were at the destination. This made me very happy, obviously. However she didn't tell me she changed her mind but instead started flirting and making out with other guys. 

I've changed a lot recently and she's been teasing me so much with the hint that I could be as happy as I used to be. 

She always had these priorities that were above me but she was always my top priority. 

I want to be happy but it seems likely that that's not feasible. I feel really numb and empty all the time. I don't have any goals and I don't know how to have any because the last one sort of ruined everything good I had going for me. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts since a few weeks before my last post. They stopped for awhile but the trip really changed some things. 

I don't want to do this because I can't be with the person I love, I want to do it because I really don't like life. If I get through this I'm just gonna become a pessimist or a misanthrope or even more pathetic than the person I am now. Which isn't worth it.

Thanks
