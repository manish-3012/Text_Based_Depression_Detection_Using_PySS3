I guess I'm annoying, but I don't know how to stopI'm a 17 y.o. kid living with a personality disorder. I don't have any friends who care about me. I do everything I can to be a good friend but whenever I need help no one wants to even talk to me. I get super clingy, I know, but I can't stop it. I'm just so broken. Most of the time I feel like the only one who truly wants to be around me is my dog and that's because I give her treats. I'm just really depressed and tired of being so alone. I'm not in the position to kill myself right now but I will be soon. Part of me is scared that I'll just end up in the hospital again but the other part wants the attention because I'm so starved for it. I just need a little support but no one cares about me.
