Did heroin, ruined everything.I (22 f) have been struggling with my borderline personality disorder, anxiety and depression for longer than I can remember. I had been in a 3 year relationship that just ended today. For the past 72 hours I called out of work to spend time with my heroin addict friend thats in love with me, he convinced me to do it and shot it up for me and I did it about twice in between smoking crack, something I have never done before. I use substances to cope but normally just pot, xanax and klonipin. I'm already going through withdrawal from the heroin. In that time period I also cheated on my bf with him. 10 months ago I had an abortion and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done and it put a major strain on my relationship, I cheated several times, justifying it by the fact that he had done it in the past. Since then I've fallen into a massive hole, every time I try to crawl out I just fall harder to the bottom. I don't know what lead me to wanting to try heroin, but last night my mom busted in my friends house and dragged me out. She had my boyfriend and my dad in their cars behind her. They brought me home, demanded the truth and it was mutually agreed that I need serious, extensive help. My boyfriend left last night because he had to be up early for work. He came over after work to tell me it was over, that everything that comes out of my mouth is a lie, and that he could never trust me or be with me again and that I need to get help, alone. He left about 10 minutes ago. As much as our relationship was strained I just can't even imagine my life without him. I can't get better by myself. I dont have any friends. I don't have anyone to talk to except my parents. I haven't vocalized that I want to kill myself out of fear of being bakeracted. I just can't do this, I've never functioned like a normal human being and maybe this life just isn't right for me.
