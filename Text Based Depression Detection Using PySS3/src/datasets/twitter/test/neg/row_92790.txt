Need someone to talk me downI've been doing well with this the last couple of weeks but today is the worst in a long time. 

I'm stuck at work now, so I can't call the hotline. My wife is also at work and I don't want to make her day as difficult as mine is. Texting her to let her know how I feel will distract her from her own job. My work has suffered severely through this, and I can't make the same happen to her. So basically I need someone to talk me down enough to make it through the work day. 

As much as they call these things crises, it seems impossible to get any help in a timely matter. It's like I already need to attempt the deed before I will get any help, but I'm not about to half ass it as a cry for help. If (when?) I do it, it's going to be for real, and the potential for help at that point disappears with each second.

I have an appointment with my therapist on Wednesday. But that might as well be years away with how I'm feeling.

I feel trapped and unable to control even the smallest aspect of my life. I work a job I worked really hard for, but now frills me with self hatred. My coworkers hate me because I was promoted above them in a fraction of the time they've spent employed here and they try to make every day as difficult as possible to see me fail. My supervisors can't trust my coworkers to do their jobs so they come to me with every little thing that needs to get done. I want to quit, but that would mean I lose a source of income and insurance that my wife desperately needs for a chronic condition. It would mean not being able to pay off loans or bills that would fall on my wife or parents to cover. I've already used all my PTO trying to cope with this. I haven't been able to land a job anywhere else either despite applying to all sorts of positions, even jobs I'm over qualified for, but still being turned away without even a phone interview. 

My wife has threatened (offered?) to have me committed, which sometimes doesn't sound like a bad idea, but then I'm stranded away from the only person I love, not being able to fall asleep next to her at the end of the day or hear her laugh at my stupid jokes. That's really all that's been keeping me going this past year anyways. 

Basically it all comes down to feeling trapped and helpless to change anything. So I guess if you're reading this and have some time to spare, PM me or something and help me make it through the day. I have half a mind to take a long lunch to go home and grab my straight razor and take a swim in the river, but I really don't want to do that. I just don't think I have many other options left. Thanks for reading.
