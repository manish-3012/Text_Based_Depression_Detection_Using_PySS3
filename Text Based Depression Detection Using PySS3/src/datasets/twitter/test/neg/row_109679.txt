Why do good things make me want to die even more?18/F I don't really know what to do anymore. I just want to die in the most painful way possible. I'm tired of living in pain, guilt and embarrassment because of my IBS. But good things happen too, like if I don't feel sick for a day, or for instance I got my fifth university offer today, but all of these things are just making me want to die even more. 
My counsellor told me to recognise the good things and be positive about them, and to try recognise my strengths from them. But I can't. I just want to die. I don't want to go to university, I don't want to think about my illness, I don't want to go to school tomorrow, I don't want to finish my (long overdue) coursework, I don't want to live to sit my exams in May, I don't want to do anything other than end my life. And I don't know why. I can't sleep, I can't stop eating, I can't stop crying, I can't stop myself from self harming. The only thing in my life I have control over is whether I stay alive or not. I don't want to. But my only friend has always said if I go then he goes, and his life means more to me than my own, so I'm balancing on the fence between ending my own pain, or going through life for as long as my friend does. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm asking from this post. I guess I just felt there was nobody else to turn to to vent. I don't know.
