Hey folksAs a quick heads up, I don't think I'm an immediate risk, so if you have someone else you need to take care of go for them.

I'm male, between the ages of 27 and 32. I've had a grandparent commit suicide and a close suicidal, but still here, relative that I grew up with. I'm currently in a rough patch with my work life as I'm trying really hard to get out of a dead in career path and I've had no bites on my resume for months. I live with my girlfriend of a number of years and we are pretty happy. She's letting me skip on rent (she owns the home) and the remainder of the bills I'm paying with help from family. Said family is encouraging me to chase my dreams, but I know statistically, even if I'm skilled in those dreams, I likely won't be able to make a living off of it. 

You've noticed I'm being vague. That's because I've tried to commit suicide before and, pardon my language, it turned into a huge cluster fuck involving jail time for a number of people, myself included. I won't talk to people I know, I won't talk to the suicide hotline because they will send police, and I won't talk to a therapist for the same reason. I don't want to be locked up, costing more people more money. 

I'm smart. I have a number of college degrees, each obtained with honors, and overall I have a pretty good day every day. It's just when I get to the end of it, I'd like to smile, close my eyes, and turn the system off. 

I'm good to go. I've played this game, it had its entertaining parts but I think I'm okay to turn it off now. And yes, I'm fully aware I can't turn it back on. I'm in a tough place, true, but I'm not really miserable. I'm just done. 

I'm also not sure what I'm looking for here. I guess, how was your day?
