How do you do life without wanting to dieI really wish I could just be open to when things go wrong and let it happen. I'm so tired of feeling so guilty about everything.
Today my teachers were talking and all I wanted to was to cry. I feel like a failure and not good enough to what I should be. I'm tired.
Yesterday I cried so much my eyes are puffy today. I've been wanting to die for a long time and I thought it would be better by now, and it was for a short time but here I am again. I thought I would never want to die as much as I did before and it's getting scary cause I can feel it getting closer.
