I don't know what to do anymore. I need help. I'm 21 and a college student. I'm all alone and I feel like I've taken every step to beat my horrible crippling depression. Talked to peers, didn't help. Talked to family, didn't help. Talked to counselor, even he gave up on me. I can barely get up in the morning and I don't give a shit about my schoolwork anymore. I used to love school but now I don't care, obviously causing my expensive education to go to waste. I want to take time off and get myself together but I can't do that for a number of reasons. I reach out and no one listens to me, just gives the same "pull yourself up and look ahead at the new day" platitude. No one gets it. I want to be dead. The only reason I'm still here is because I know my family would be devastated, and deeper and deeper I get into my horrible depression I feel like they're just brushing me off. No one cares other than them, and even they're getting tired of it. I've never had a lasting friendship and have never gotten close to being in a relationship. And I never will. Even with psychotherapy (the next step according to my physician/previous therapist) I know it won't get better. I'll have to engage in a lengthy process that will destroy my quarter of schoolwork (and of course the school won't give a shit when I appeal the expenses I pay) and it won't help anyway. I want to die, reddit. More and more every day. I mean that. The desire to kill myself is only slightly outweighed by my family, who's interest is waning more and more. I know that someday I am going to kill myself. Whether it's sooner or later, it's going to happen. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, and I know turning here is futile, but I don't know what to do.
