In September a friend of mine drowned while on a camping trip at a state park. They were camped by a lake and one night the weather got rough and a pontoon boat from the campsite next to theirs got un-tethered. My friend (being the hero-type working for the game and fish) decided to hop in a kayak and chase after the pontoon boat to tow it back in. Well as you can imagine by the title he drowned and was found a few days later. I knew this guy since we were 5 years old and this was just such a shock to me. This wasn't as dificult as the following story because it was an accident and he was trying to help out his fellow man. I feel I had a typical mourning process but I still feel like I never got over his death._x000D_

Fast forward to this last night. I get a call telling me one of my friends shot himself. He was close to graduating and again I am just completely shocked. I have only known him for a few years but others tell me he had been suicidal since he was a teenager. This is just a lot more difficult to deal with than my friend in September because again my mourning process seemes to be all messed up. I feel angry at him for leaving us, I have been crying, I accept that he is gone. I just feel that I shouldn't be going through all of the stages of grief at once. I've lost loved ones before (great uncle and two grandparents due to old age, and a schoolmate due to cancer). I'm just so confused about why my friends my age are leaving._x000D_

EDIT: Is this normal? Or should I be grieving in stages? I feel like not grieving properly may lead to long term damage._x000D_

**Tl;dr I feel like my grieving process happens all at once instead of in stages. Confused about why my friends my age are leaving.**_x000D_
