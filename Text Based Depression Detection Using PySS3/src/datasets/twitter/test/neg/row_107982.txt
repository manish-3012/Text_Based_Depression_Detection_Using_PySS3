I'm so aloneMy mom is in the hospital. The hospital fucked up again. So she's mad and taking it out on me. I have no one. My God mother is my only family and she's an unreliable drug addict. 

I havent slept but a couple of hours in three days. Mom broke her wrist Sunday. I've been having to do everything. I've been trying to tell her since Monday I have nothing left to give and she's not listening. 

She never does. 

Every time I fall asleep she wakes me up within 20 minutes.

She's mad that I can't stop crying. 

I'm sitting alone on the beach and thinking about how easy it would be to just walk into the water and let go. 

I'm disabled, I'm uninsured, I can't find a job I can work with my disability, I have no healthcare. 

I don't want to be here anymore.
