I'd just like to talk?I've called suicide hotlines in the past and they're all bitches. "Oh you're not SURE you want to die?" Ain't nobody got time for that.

Yes I WANT to die. I've wanted to die since I was 13. I'm only now becoming aware that's not all the way "normal" (I'm 27). I'm medicated, I'm in behavioral therapy, I have a psychiatrist. It's just sometimes it gets so impossibly hard. 

I'm embarrassed over being *that girl* that's always having an awful time and weeping at her friends. I've gotten to be real excellent at pretending I'm o-k just to keep folks around - because I need them. Even if I can't tell them that I feel this way. 

I reckon anyone that hasn't suffered what a pal of mine calls "brainsick" can't imagine what this sick brain is like - I don't get a lot of empathy. It's largely impossible for anyone to imagine themselves in a position where they're actually incapable of just "getting it together" or "seeing the bright side" or "being better". I can do all those things - logically, in my head. It just makes me feel more worthless in my immediate bullshit inescapable emotions.

Anyway if anyone's bored and would like to have a gossipfest over my woes, I'm told I can be very entertaining. 

PM me?
