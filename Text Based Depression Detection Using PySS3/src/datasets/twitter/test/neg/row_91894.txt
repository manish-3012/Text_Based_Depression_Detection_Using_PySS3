I think Iâ€™m ready to go now.Nothing I do matters in the end. 

Iâ€™m going to sound horrible and pessimistic here but, the world is over populated anyways, itâ€™s better if I go. All I do is waste energy and resources. I donâ€™t love anyone. I have no aspirations. I wake up and feeling this utter loneliness and worthlessness.

Iâ€™m ready to leave this world now.
