You all hate me for no reason
 
I've been struggling for years to understand why people don't like me.When I was a kid, based off of the insults I received, a lot of the hate was because I was an ugly, short, poor kid.I'm an adult now, the criticisms have changed but the hate persists.
 
 
I think a lot of the hate defies logic because when I go back and analyze my actions they are objectively innocent.A lot of the times I was clashing with people who had their own issues and unique ways of thinking.
 
 
I'm not saying I'm without fault I am completely aware when I'm in the wrong.People throw around sayings like "If you think everyone is an asshole you're the asshole." It's hard to complain about this situation because people automatically assume I'm the problem THEN when I get defensive or lash out they think that my reaction proves the fact even more.WHAT!? 
 
 
I could see if I was this imposing figure who dressed shabbily and had BO but.I'm fucking not.I have a sister who exhibits similar weird quirks and mannerisms as I do but she is seen as adorable I am seen as a villain.
 
 
I think with the tiny bit of youth I have left I should be meeting all of types people and share experiences.When I examine the family members and friends that people really like, I'm not seeing anything valuable.They're just a person.Hi, I'm just a person too yet you resent and ostracize me.Okay.
 
 Since the hate has been going on for so long I'm growing numb to it, it's more of the lack of love/support that's been bothering me.Once upon a time when I was in a relationship, I swear it made me feel 
powerful and less depressed.If I had some talent/skill I could immerse myself in I wouldnâ€™t need people buutt yeahh about thatâ€¦.
 
I know there's nothing any of you can do.I'm just venting.As you can imagine, being in this disposition puts my mind in some really dark places.I rapidly losing sympathy for my fellow human beings and I'm starting to believe people should suffer.But it'd be easier to kill myself.
