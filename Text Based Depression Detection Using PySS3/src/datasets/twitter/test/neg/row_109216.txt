My brotherIve told my brother about me wanting to die, Iâ€™ve shown him my self harm cuts, Iâ€™ve told him why, and Iâ€™ve even told him how I want to commit suicide. And you know what that jackass decides to do? First, he doesnâ€™t care about the fact Im even considering this shit, second, he calls me selfish, third, he mocks me for one reason Iâ€™m suicidal, fourth, he says mockingly â€œooooh my life so hard!â€ 

I donâ€™t even feel like anyone in my life cares about me except for like two people. Itâ€™s so hard to find more reasons to keep on living. Iâ€™m miserable, and itâ€™s so hard to even keep living.
