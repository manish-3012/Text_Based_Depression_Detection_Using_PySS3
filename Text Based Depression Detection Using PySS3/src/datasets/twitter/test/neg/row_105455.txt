One more week and I move out, but why do I feel like shit? Isn't this what I wanted?I'm moving out of my dad's house to live with my mom's full time that way I can devote my full time and attention to this day program my mother and I are discussing.

We took a tour today and it was really nice, and now we have a date. October 12, 2019. That's the same weekend the breaking bad movie comes out. But today is only the second. I have ten more days before I can move out of the house for good and it's driving my anxiety through the roof, because my mom said she's gonna talk to my dad tomorrow which means I have to deal with my dad for another week.

My mother says I have to suck it up and deal with an uncomfortable week since it may be sensitive around my dad but is there any way I can be less stressed out about this whole situation? I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it...
