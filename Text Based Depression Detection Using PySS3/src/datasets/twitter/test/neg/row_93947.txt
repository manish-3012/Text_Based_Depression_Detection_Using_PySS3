i'm feeling down and need helpI've been depressed a while now, and hide it through shitposting online, mainly because of the changes going on through my life, my uncle in jail for a crime he didnt commit (no proof whatsoever that he did it) my friends have changed and hate the shit i like, like rock music, some video games, and what i wear. They now are a bunch of assholes who vape, listen to garbage rap music, and are just a bunch of arrogant assholes who think they are above the law, i've been trash talked by them, but one of them has been my friend since 2014, and i've stuck by him since then. i need advice, and way to get through this, otherwise i feel as if my conscious wont carry on for longer, and i'll be dead before the age of 19, i'm sorry if i seem selfish or just downright a pussy, but i've been contemplating this for a while now. and i hate explaining this to family members. Thank you.
