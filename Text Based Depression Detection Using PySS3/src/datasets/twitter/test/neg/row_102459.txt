I feel like Iâ€™m going to do it todayIâ€™ve written a note and prepared my method. Iâ€™m just hoping that somebody will hit me up to hang out so I will have an excuse not to go through with it, but that is unlikely to happen.

I feel like my life at this point is just a series of arbitrary deadlines to keep me from another attempt. The last few years Iâ€™ve told myself to just wait until my life gets so bad that it couldnâ€™t possibly get better, and then to do it. But right now I feel like it would be better to do it while Iâ€™m in a relatively okay spot â€” leave on a good note and all that.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for by posting here. I guess I just figured Iâ€™d tell someone(s) and give myself a chance to be talked down before going through with it, without bothering people who know me irl.
