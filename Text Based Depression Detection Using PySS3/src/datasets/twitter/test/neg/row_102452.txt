I thought I was done with seriously considering suicide, yet here I am againIt's been eight years since my last attempt, probably more than a year or so since my last serious consideration to the point of planning. I really thought I was past this. 

It's not that I haven't thought about suicide since, I do it basically every day and have done so since middle school. Lately, and mostly, they are more fleeting than anything, thoughts I usually forget about within a few minutes. But not now, not today.

I fucked up once again at a job I'm not even sure I deserve to have. I started going to school for hvac, completed one class and got hired by a company. Mostly all I do is cleanings and checking to make sure everything is still working. Ive messed up a couple times, not too horrible, but still not good. This time was something stupidly simple, a limit touching the metal next to it shorted out and blew the fuse. My attempts at finding the problem blew the transformer and more fuses.

Dispatcher told me to move on, that they would send someone else out in an hour or so. On my way out the door our head tech calls and talks me through and finds the problem. To fix it I need a new limit, but I don't have one on my truck. They start calling the other techs to see who's closest and has one and hang up on me. I assume they're sending someone out, like they said, and move on to my next call. 

Upon arriving i get a call asking where I am, in a very confused tone. I tell them, they tell me I was told not to go anywhere and they were bringing me the part. I left with an assumption, never calling to confirm it. I broke the part, and another one, eith my inexperience and carelessness. I ruined someone's night with an inoperable furnace. I ruined multiple people's days with it still not being fixed and the guy they sent out just to get me the part now having to do the repair himself. 

Mistake after mistake after mistake and I don't seem to show any sign of getting better at this. I'm sure if I quit to go back to school and try to learn more I'll never get another job in this industry, let alone be able to pay my bills, especially for this van I got just for this job. 

I'm sure this all seems silly and miniscule compared to your problems, but fuck if I'm not at my last straw with myself. I'm thirty god damn years old, I'm a constant fuckup and I'm just ready to be done with this failed experiment called life.

I just need a way to do it quickly, quietly, and a way no one else gets injured. Maybe I'll hang myself in the forest preserve tonight.
