I see no reason to live.I have been abused physically and mentally since I was 6-7 years old. But since 5th grade it has been hell. Parents do not give a fuck about how I feel. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now. I am fearful to bring up how I actually feel to anyone other than very specific friends due to me being a minor
