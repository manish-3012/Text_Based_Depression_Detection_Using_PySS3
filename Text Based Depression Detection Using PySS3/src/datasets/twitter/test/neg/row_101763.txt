Canâ€™t take it anymoreEveryday my heart hurts more. Iâ€™m so alone, Iâ€™m so unhappy with myself, Iâ€™m so incapable of change. Iâ€™m stuck and stagnated and so so so alone. I miss my ex more every day.  I know every day will be a little shittier than the last. Fiends growing more distant, body aching more, heavier workload.

I just want to escape. I had to get surgery last year and when I was put under anastasia it was the most at peace Iâ€™ve ever been. No nightmares, no pain, just nothingness. If thatâ€™s what death is like I welcome it with open arms. 

I canâ€™t take the pain of missing her anymore. I canâ€™t take the pain of knowing Iâ€™ll never be as high on a mountain as I was before, I canâ€™t bare the thought of knowing my crappy life will only get crappier. 

I am trying to find the selfishness necessary to do it. I donâ€™t want to hurt the few people who care about me some, but I just donâ€™t want to live this life of constant sorrow anymore.
