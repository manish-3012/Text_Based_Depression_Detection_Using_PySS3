Please Don't, ignore I need advice!Please don't write this off.  Lately I've been struggling with a problem I now believe is video game addiction. I play super smash bros for a few hours a day and have really high Gsp (online ranked point system). Well now I consistantly lost a few round and lost so much GSp that my main got de- ranked  I feel so sick and angry I don't know what to do. The near 300 hours I clocked into the game are going to waist I'm just so mad. I feel like throwing up someone please offer up advice. This is my only talent and everything I am good at is slipping away from me!
