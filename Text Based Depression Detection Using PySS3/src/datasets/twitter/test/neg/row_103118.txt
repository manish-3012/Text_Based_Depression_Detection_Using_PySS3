My mother might have Covid. Sheâ€™s 6000 miles away. And if my mother dies Iâ€™m committing suicide. Guaranteed.Ok, a little about myself. I was born and raised in a small poor country in South America. My father was abusive and absent and my mother was a stay at home mom. I have one sister. I am 32 now and Iâ€™ve been living in the US for the past 4 years. My sister is living in Europe with a man, now her husband, that she met online when she was 19. Time did its thing and now her life is in Europe with her husband. She cares very little about our parents and me, the last time I saw her was six years ago. 

I am 32 and I  am a doctor. I trained in my home country and I am in the middle of becoming licensed in the us. I have one more test to go but I canâ€™t take it because of Covid. Medicine is brutal and my chances matching into residency are slim because of the time it has passed since I graduated from medical school. I live with a wonderful man who takes care of me and loves me very much. Iâ€™ve known him for 5 years. I am unemployed and feel worthless. I feel like any chance of having making anything out of my life is gone. The future used to feel like a promise and now feels like a threat. I am in somewhat ok health but I have chronic back pain that I need surgery for but I canâ€™t get because of corona. I might also have nerve damage and my pain might not go away even with surgery because itâ€™s been too long without proper treatment. The doctors I saw first ignored my complaints and my suggestions of getting imaging and I had to hunt for a pcp who would order an mri for my back. I have a herniated disk compressing my nerves. I donâ€™t know what life without pain feels like because everyday I have pain. Some days are good, others are bad but the pain never leaves. 

About my mother: sheâ€™s experienced tragedy after tragedy. Her brother was brutally murdered in Motherâ€™s Day 20 years ago and her parents died in 2012. I saw her grieving their death and she has never recovered. Sheâ€™s living  alone in my home country and sheâ€™s   complaining of Covid like symptoms. Her  country is under lockdown and even if I wanted to I wouldnâ€™t be able to go see her one last time because there are no flights. 

Honestly, Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself for a while however I would never want to put my mother through that. I always told myself that I would kill myself after she dies, I love her and I want to spare her the suffering. 

Life hasnâ€™t been bad to me but Iâ€™m just tired. I have my needs met but Iâ€™m in pain and the career I worked for for 15 years might never materialize. I have a plan. I will shoot myself in the head inside of a rental car in the parking lot of a level 1 trauma hospital and call the police to warn them so that the hospital can go ahead and harvest my organs for donation. I just wanna die. Every day I wake up, the first thing I say is  â€œoh no here comes the nightmare againâ€  and â€œI want to dieâ€. 

Iâ€™m useless. Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m in pain. I want this to be over.
