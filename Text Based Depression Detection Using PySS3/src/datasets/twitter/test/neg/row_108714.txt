When FAILURE is more than a FAILURE! Have a nice day everyone :) (30 M) Had to share my story (not too long) for some reason?!I was born in upper middle class family, I was healthy kid, good at high school and athlete who is about to get full university scholarship.. I had "devil" side in me back than but it didn't seem out of the ordinary much, I liked drinking, getting in trouble and liked girls very much which was mutual... 

Fast forward few years later I got sick, had to stop sports, was tired off everything and was high school drop out.

"Devil" side took over and was mostly drinking and gambling.. I had also bad health issues all that time, also looked like shit all the time and didn't get attention from anyone very much..

Fast forward I "accepted" that I can't solve anything and continued to live stupid stupid lifestyle.. drinking, video games, gambling and actually accepted that I'm loser now... 

Then I was 21-22 yo when I met one girl I liked and we started relationship.. I was never in love with her but over the years I got to love her so much... It was crazy love-hate relationship .. In that relationship I decided to fight again, started some training and got back to school.. Finished school and somehow enrolled university.. I was still mess, got addicted to some very bad prescription drugs and was fighting but was also chaotic...

Meanwhile my family got from upper middle class to losing basically everything because of economics, politics and some shocking business decisions by my father...

I never tried to kill myself but sometimes I took so much drugs with alcohol that my ex thought I was dead several times. Eventually we got very evil towards each other and break up...

I kept training and even got bachelor degree from university, learned foreign languages, trying to change things etc..

But after that nothing positive ever happened... Injuries, bad financial and family situation (look at some russian drama movies, it's like that), was always fighting but fading little by little..

Now I'm still fighting and I even train in gym at least 5 times a week and trying but I feel like I'm doing Einstein's definition of stupidity for last 15 years -  "Stupidity is doing same thing and expecting different results" if he said that..

Then I relaised I was surrounded by all negative people and wanted to change it but couldn't change it and find positive, creative people so I did another fail and am now mostly socially isolated. I don't even have any social network not because I think it's stupid (which I tell people and also think that) but because I'm ashamed of who I was and who I became...

I don't expect anything, just had to write something .

Have a nice day everyone :)
