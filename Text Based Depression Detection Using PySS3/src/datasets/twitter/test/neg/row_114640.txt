..I really.. hope he doesnt find this post.
I dont want him to find out this way. 
Today has been a weird bad day for me. and i love him. And he really does try to make me happy, which he does make me happy. i just keep pushing my suicide date, and i cant do it anymore. today i feel so emotional, i feel soft. i feel very sensetive and sad and i dont know why.
and i want him to know i love him. because i spent 3 years without him, loving him. we didnt talk or anything for years and i still.. see him as this perfect, amazing person,
i lay with his flannel, i wore his flannel to my psychiatrist meeting today, i hate when he doesnt respond, i always want to call him. i just feel bad that since im still depressed. that he thinks it means hes not good enough to stop me. and its like. it hurts me. it does.  because i been through alot of abuse and if he cant stop everything thats making me upset then its his fault and its not his fault.
i been in counseling for 7-8 years. i been in family counseling.
i been on medication.
i see a psychiatrist
its not that hes not good enough to stop me.
its just that i cant tell him tonight that its the night i leave.
this house is so abusive (read other posts if you must to see the reasons why i say this)
im just tired. im very tired. i dont know if im going to leave him a note or not.
but im more worried about him right now because i dont want him to find out.
ugh. he doesnt know how much he means to me and how much i love him.
but he doesnt know how much i need to do this and take my life, even when im gone, and im dead, my last moments, my heart still belongs to him.
but for the next few hours im going to act so happy with him so he doesnt know im going to kill myself tonight ah
