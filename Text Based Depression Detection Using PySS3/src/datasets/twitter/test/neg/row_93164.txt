Can you give me a reason why I shouldn't do it?I'm lost. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I'm a failure of 22 years old that doesn't do literally anything all day. I am not able to do anything other than being on the internet. 

My mental condition is killing me. Since I was a child I suffered from clinical depression, anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. How can I live a life like this? 

I cry every night thinking of what a lonely, miserable and failure of society that I am. I don't have anything or anyone, I'm alone with my body and my thoughts since the moment I wake up. 

I am not able to study in order to create my future like I always dreamed of, I'm already 22 and time is passing by. I don't have any social skills in order to make new friends or meet a partner to start my own family. I don't have any reasons to be alive. 

I'm trying to build the courage to commit suicide, but I still have a little voice that tells that I shouldn't do it. I sincerely think this is just fear of the act and that there is nothing important that keeps me away from doing it.  

Aside from stuff like "you matter" or "don't do it, you will make people sad" because, deep down, we all know this isn't true; can you give me a rational reason why I shouldn't do it? Even though we don't know each other, I will listen.
