seriously considering suicide like never before I am not sure what to do..For the past 2 years I was addicted to video games and online gambling. I was a 13 year old that had lost 10,000 dollars in a video game and racked up 4,000 hours on the game in 2 years. It was a serious problem and I didnt know how to get out of it. I gained weight, lost all my friends, and was seriously depressed. Over the past few months I turned my life around. I have lost weight, gotten my friends back, and gotten a new haircut that looks pretty good. I am friends with this girl and things were starting to get close. We have been hanging out alone alot for the past 2 weeks. But, last night we were doing my science project and I jumped on her as a joke and I accidentally smashed her science project. She was crying and laughing but she also was seirously crying sometimes. I kept saying sorry and I was hugging her but I do not think that helped. We spent the rest of the night together and we had a good time but she said it would have been a lot better night if I had not broken it. Anyways, I had gotten the haircut I liked like 2 hours before I hung out with her. Today she sat next to me in class but this boy she is good friends with sat next to us as well. She mostly talked to him and I think she could tell i was a little sad because she like would say something to me or something idk. Anyways, I really feel like I ruined this whole thing. She also keeps saying my old hair was better because it looked funny and like a mop which I do not get. Everyone except for her said its awesome. I am feeling really depressed and I feel like I ruined everything by breaking that project. I have already planned out how I am going to kill myself but I do not want to. Help?
