helpso i tried thc on halloween. i thought it would help my anxiety, but it actually triggered derealization because i took too much accidentally. iâ€™ve been trying not to panic. iâ€™ve been stuck in this mental state since then and i dont know what to do. iâ€™m desperate and iâ€™m starting to feel like doing something irreversible is the only way out (i dont have a plan or anything of that sort) i feel awful, not present, so terrified. please help. it feels like i lost a chunk of time since then.
