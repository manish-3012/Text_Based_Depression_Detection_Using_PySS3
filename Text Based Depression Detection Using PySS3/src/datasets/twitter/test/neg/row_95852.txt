The Only Thing Keeping Me From Killing Myself is Keeping My Job and To Save My Mom the Heartbreak.I recently got broken up with, after feeling like Iâ€™d never fall in love again he came swooping into my life, making me feel safe, treating me better than anyone has ever treated me, and now he left me. He has his own battle with depression, I understand that his leaving is not my fault but my depression doesnt. I love him, I miss him. We were long distance and I know that the relationship is almost completely irreparable because of that. I want so badly to just let it all end. It was so sudden. A complete 180 and all the love and affection he gave me is gone. Itâ€™s like his feelings for me were wiped from his hard drive. Anyways obviously from the title I wont do anything. If I fail itâ€™ll make my life worse. Iâ€™ll never be seen the same by my family, Iâ€™ll be placed in in-patient care and lose my job, and itâ€™ll hurt my mother to a point where Iâ€™m afraid it would break her. I just want to be numb. Any goos advice on break ups would be helpful. Distractions, hobbies, etc.
