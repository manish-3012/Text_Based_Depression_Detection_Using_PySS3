Yet another breakupI have never felt so hopeless in my life. Iâ€™m 20 years old and Iâ€™ve been hurt so many times in terrible ways. I found someone almost a year ago who I thought I would spend my life with but at 3  this morning I got a text from him that gave no explanation, but he was breaking up with me. He blocked me and all of my family and close friends on every social media site and phone numbers so I canâ€™t even ask why this happened. Itâ€™s so sudden. 
Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more but it would make me feel so bad to leave my mother behind. I have no reason to live and Iâ€™m constantly hurting but I donâ€™t want my one last selfish wish to ruin the life of the only person who loved me. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m lost and crying and trying so hard not to off myself right now
