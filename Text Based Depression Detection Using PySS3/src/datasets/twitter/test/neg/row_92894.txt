Living sucksIm torn. I (18m) donâ€™t have anything to look forward to. My gf broke up with me. I dont enjoy doing anything. Id probably kill my self tonight if I had rope. But I dont. Iâ€™ll get some this weekend.  I donâ€™t even know if i have enough energy to even kill my self though. I just want to go back 2 months and live that week over and over again.
