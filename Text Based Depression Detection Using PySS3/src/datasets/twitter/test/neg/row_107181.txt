I want to get worseI still love life and Iâ€™m good enough to keep going, but I donâ€™t want to anymore. I want to leave. I want out. Iâ€™m nothing but a parasite and a burden and I donâ€™t deserve to be here. But Iâ€™m too healthy and comfortable to be properly suicidal.

I heard that weed/psychedelics can wreck your mind if you have the right predispositions. I reckon I might. Canâ€™t get my hands on any though. I donâ€™t want to know myself anymore.
