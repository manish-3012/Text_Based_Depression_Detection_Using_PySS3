I treat others the way I'd like to be treatedI believe in the right to bodily autonomy. It goes both ways. The first way - I have the right to kill myself. It's my body and I get to do whatever I want with it. The second way - I don't have the right to hug anyone. It's their body and I don't get to tell them what to do with it. I haven't been hugged since late September 2017. As much as I'd love a good cuddle, I know it's not my right.
