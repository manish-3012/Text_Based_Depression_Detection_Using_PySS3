(x-post r/depression) how do you cope?Its been almost a year since my last post. Here I am in almost am identical situation, listening to music drinking my night away. I feel like I've done nothing and cant move forward. Everyday is a struggle to tread water. Sometimes the only thing keeping me afloat is my guilt for what it would do to those around me. I don't know what to do.
