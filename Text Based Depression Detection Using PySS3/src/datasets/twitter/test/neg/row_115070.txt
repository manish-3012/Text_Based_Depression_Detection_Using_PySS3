Mom says to get better or die but I don't think I canSo yeah I've had severe depression for as long as I can remember. I fucked up my whole life because of it. Now I'm stuck living with a sick disabled recently widowed mother who is in debt up to her eyeballs, a useless degree from a shit college, almost no money left, and no friends or girlfriend for support. Now all of a sudden she's demanding I get better or she'll kick me out onto the streets where I no doubt would die in about a week. I can't move out because I lack the money, and there are no jobs that pay rent that I could get around here. Death seems pretty near already. Why not just give in and get it over with?
