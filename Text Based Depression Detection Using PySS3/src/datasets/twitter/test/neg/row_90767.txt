Think it's about that time...nothing is working.My life has deteriorated for years.  I have medical problems and have never been able to get good care.  I have been sidelined and screwed with by every system I have ever reached out to...and people too.  I am alone.  I have no family I can get help from.  I moved far away to a cheaper place to try and somehow survive but those who said they would help me here have not.  I tried every social system that is supposed to help you and was denied.  I am tired of pain...tired of drugs that make it worse...tired of people taking money for nothing.

I don't want to end my life but I cannot stand it...I have a couple of reliable methods at my disposal...and the "just keep going and hope it gets better" isn't working anymore after years and years.

Why am I writing?  Because I am angry I have been driven to this...I am angry I have been ignored and blamed...I want someone to REALLY help.  So I am here out of desperation.  Throwing one last grappling hook at the wall before I go.  But I don't expect anything...people can't fix my pain, won't help me live comfortably enough to tolerate it, and generally are unreliable.

Going to write notes to some people...keep going back and forth between being honest about how I feel and writing nice notes saying "don't blame yourself" etc.  I have been through this over and over.  There is no good or easy way to do this.

I don't have the health or money to make a life and have no support system.  The ones people think exist don't really exist and there are a lot of poeple just like me.

Tired of it all.

TL:DR - Middle aged guy with medical problems...causing depression,loss of all I had, and inability to live normally...can't stand it like this...nobody will help...nowhere to go but cannot stay here.  Nobody has anything to offer but bullshit platitudes and words...nobody will REALLY help.
