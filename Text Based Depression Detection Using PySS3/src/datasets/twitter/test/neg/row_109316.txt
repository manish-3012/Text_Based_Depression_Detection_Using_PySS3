Thinking about suicide moreBeen thinking about suicide on and off for years, but recently it's been intensifying. I'm a lonely gay man in his 30s, living alone in a new city. My family lives thousands of miles away. I finally met a guy who I really liked with but he rejected me. I stupidly decided to become friends with him, and I've seen him hook up with other guys twice now within hours of meeting them, after I had spent months taking him out and getting to know him.  Yes I know I'm not the first to get rejected in the history of the world, but I'm very old by gay standards and I feel like I will never meet another guy like that again. I truly felt like I met the one person I could spend the rest of my life with. Without boring you with my life further, it's just really hard because I don't feel any more reason to live.  I have no lover, no local friends and no family of my own. I have a job and pay my bills, but I feel like I'm just going through the motions.  I come home to an empty apartment, I eat alone, and go to bed alone every single night.  Is this a life worth living?  

Ironically a gay friend of his recently committed suicide and that really hit me...
