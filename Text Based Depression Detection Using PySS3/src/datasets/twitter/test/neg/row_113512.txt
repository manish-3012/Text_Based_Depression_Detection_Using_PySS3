I want to end it all nothing seems to work for me ... please give me advice I feel so hopeless..i know it seems i have it all but trust me it doesn't feel like itI am 19 y/o girl. I have a huge and strong dream of becoming a professional snowboarder but it can never ever become reality because of the country i live in and the money I don't have.
It ruins my mental health that I have to follow a path really far from my dreams..
I am currently studying and attending courses for entering a medical university in my city to study pharmacy. 
My boyfriend of 3 years and I never stop fighting i try to do everything to please him but when I lose it he is never there for me. He uses disgusting language on me and screams at me and always puts the blame on me. I cant leave him cuz I always say to myself that he'll change. And I love him.
I want to end it all because I'm crying every single day over my situation. The dream of my life is unachievable and it's killing me and being made cry every day isn't cool. My family wants me to become a pharmacist or sth similar.
There are no chances of me becoming a pro snowboarder even though I ride pretty well. I'm sick of crying everyday my body can't handle it anymore. I also have health problems and I have borderline personality disorder and my emotions just can't be controlled. 
I don't want to waste my life. I don't know how to climb out of the hole. Please help me I want to die .....
