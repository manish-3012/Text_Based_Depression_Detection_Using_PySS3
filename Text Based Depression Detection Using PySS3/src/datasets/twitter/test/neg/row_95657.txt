I need helpWhy canâ€™t people just understand the fact that being suicidal is not fucking easy to over come... this is why I have a very hard time trusting people and telling them I feel this way and all they say is change.... ok like itâ€™s as easy as flipping a light switch... well I hate to fucking say it itâ€™s not that fucking simple... if it was I would not have felt this way for over 90% of my life.... I finally admit I need fucking help but Iâ€™m scared of what they will do to if I go talk to some one... my wife is scared she might wake up and find the inside of my truck repaint with me just sitting there lifeless.... or that I might not make it home one day from work cause I just so happen to run off the road doing 120 mph... I think about this shit all day and itâ€™s coming to a point as to where I canâ€™t handle it anymore... I do nothing but make people upset and mad... I canâ€™t keep living like this.. I just canâ€™t.. some one please help I am lost and I donâ€™t know what to do
