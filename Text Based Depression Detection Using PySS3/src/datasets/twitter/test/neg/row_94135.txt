The final stage is acceptance, right?I think I spent so much time worrying how the people â€œclosestâ€ to me would feel if I died, but I finally realized this: they donâ€™t even care while Iâ€™m alive. And itâ€™s okay. I shouldnâ€™t expect much from anyone. 

I have been fighting so hard to stay alive because I felt like I owed it to them. I owe nothing to anyone. I donâ€™t even owe it to myself to keep fighting this. 

Iâ€™m just so exhausted. Maybe itâ€™s time to go.
