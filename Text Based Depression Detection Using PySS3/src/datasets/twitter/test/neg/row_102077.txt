I wish I wasn't a total cowardI wish I wasn't too cowardly to kill myself. Nobody cares. They only say they like me so they can use me and laugh at me. They say they are there for me but never call or answer my calls. Even my own father doesn't even call me on my birthday or generally ever and we are supposed to be close. Everyday I realize more and more I am on my own and that I am there for everyone else, even though nobody clearly needs/wants me around.


I have had one hug this year last week from a coworker. I often cut myself on my back because I know nobody will ever get close enough to see them. I walk around bright and chipper. But deep down every minute I just want to die. I hate how unlovable/untouchable I am.




I have nothing to live for at all except old age and decrepitude. So why do I have to be such a fucking coward. I wish I could summon the courage end myself tonight.
