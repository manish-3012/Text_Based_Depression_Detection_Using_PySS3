maybe some people just aren't supposed to make it past 17I can't do this anymore. I hate who I am, I absolutely hate myself. I hate how I was raised to be socially awkward and my family is so dysfunctional. it's like I'm literally incapable of carrying conversation with anyone unless it's about something negative and event then I'm terrible at it. and I've tried to work on this for years but there's nothing. I've been told by boys I was interested in that I'm boring and have no personality and they're right. what even is there to talk about? it's just meaningless. I can only get close with one person at a time, be it a friend or boyfriend. my best friend and I have been fighting a lot lately and she's been getting (rightfully) angry at me because I don't know how to talk to people so I say mean things around others. it's like I physically can't stop myself from being negative when I'm trying to get people to like me because I have no idea how to talk about anything else. she's also been getting on my nerves a LOT lately and I can feel our friendship falling apart and I have no one else I'm close with because I've only ever been close with one person at a time.

the boy that I'm in love with has feelings for a close friend of mine and while it's not reciprocated by her, it still hurts. she can carry conversation with him and be a nice normal, not awkward, not constantly on guard, person. he deserves that and I wish I could be that.

I just don't want to scar my little siblings by killing myself. I have a little sister and a little brother and they both seem to love me, but then again maybe my death would make them closer and be good for them.

I also have no idea what I want to do with my future, my gpa is 1.0, and I feel constantly hopeless. I'm so lost
