Suicide ideasI used to think it was impossible to pull off successfully.
I wanted to stop existing but I didnâ€™t know how to commit suicide
But then out of nowhere I realized that itâ€™s possible if you try. You could stab yourself for longer and longer each day and estimate how close you are to death. And even though I donâ€™t know exactly how to carry it out, it scares me that one day I could figure it all out and then carry out the plan across several days.
Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself however. This is of course a promise and not a guarantee because I canâ€™t know how my future self will think and feel.
Please donâ€™t kill yourself.
