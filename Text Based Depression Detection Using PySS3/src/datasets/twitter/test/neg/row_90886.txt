At what point is it okay to be selfish?I think about this a lot. It's selfish for me to kill myself because I know it'll affect other people. Does that matter? Should I live this eternal hell for other people? People who barely talk to me and don't really care. If I do decide to finally end this, the fastest closest guaranteed way to die is for me to go to a gun range down the street and shoot myself there. There'd be people around so it'd be super selfish for me to make them see that. Even if it's a slow day, they would have to close their store for at least the end of the day as someone cleaned up my mess. It'd take too long for me to buy a gun outright, I'd have to get a new ID and wait for it to come before I can apply to purchase a gun. 

I can't think of any way to get around being selfish at the gun range but I could leave rent money for my roommate to help her out at least.
