I have no more ambitionsAll my dreams, all my ambitions, everything that made me happy.. gone. Everyday is a struggle. 

I thought I was a good person and I was satisfied with myself, but I'm no more. I did things I regret, I regret so much. And I've read some comments about people like me, you don't like me. You think I'm trash. And maybe that's what I am. If I did something great you'd say I don't deserve it.

I am hopeless. I have gone to a therapist once and it has been awful, he has been a dick with me. 

One of the few things that comfort me now is just being aware that there's an escape and it would make people happy. I think of it everyday even if I'm a coward and don't have the guts of doing it. But the pain is growing and growing, I can't do it anymore, and the day I'll think that suffering a little for the last time for ending it all I will act on my thoughts
