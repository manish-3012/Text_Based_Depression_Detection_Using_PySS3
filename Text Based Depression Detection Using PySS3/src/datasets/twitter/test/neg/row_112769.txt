After I have nothing left..After I have nothing left keeping me here I will depart this world on my own accord. There is just too much suffering and a lack of a quality of life to keep me chained.

I often wonder what it would be like to be popular or truly loved and have your shit together. I knew I wasn't going to amount to much anyways with my troubled life. 

It's really a travesty of a life serving no purpose but time itself. I guess when you're gone and nobodys there to miss you, it won't matter anymore. 

It's a very cold world being a man that doesn't measure up. That being said atleast there's a way out, which I find comforting.
