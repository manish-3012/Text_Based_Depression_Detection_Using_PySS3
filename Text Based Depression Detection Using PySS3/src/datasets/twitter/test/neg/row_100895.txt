I want to be done with this life.I can sit here and post my life's story but I won't.In short,I don't want to live anymore.My total situation is insufferable. I was saving up a little money towards a car but I might just take that and plan my last week or so on Earth with it.I can't do this anymore.I called the suicide hotline a while back but it felt hopeless.As time goes on,I find less of a reason to exist.I'ma just gonna get really drunk and high,then end it all.Thanx
