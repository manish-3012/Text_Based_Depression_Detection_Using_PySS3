14 years old boy here :'(Well, my english isn't very good because im 14 years old and dutch, but I'll try to explain as good as i can :x

So, im just 14 years old and i already want to suicide for 6 years. And its not because i don't have friend, or because people hurt me, or because people hate me, or because my parents get separated or because i think that nobody cares about me, or whatever 'normal' reasons there is for suicide.
But it is more because i can't handle my angry anymore. Because, when i was young, i became angry very fast, and i was angry very long. And when i was 8 it came so far that i let almost choke an other boy. Because of that i had to go to a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist learned me to become not angry anymore. And that worked, i don't become angry anymore. But inside, i'm realy angry, and i try to get that away by hurting myself and trying to suicide. But now I told a friend of mine about this, and she wanted me to stop hurting myself and trying to suicide. So now i stopped doing that. Don't ask me how i did, because i dont know. But now the only thing I can wish is that I'm death... I don't even want to suicide anymore, i just want to die and i don't care how that happends.

Thats not everything, but I think this is the most important. You don't need to say anything.. I just wanted to tell you guys (and girls), and i was wondering what you think about it.
