Autism makes me feel completely aloneI have autism, so it's very difficult for me to adapt to change and also understand other people. My family keeps getting mad at me because of it, as if it's my fucking fault.

I only have one friend that I completely trust, and it's so difficult to make new ones. I keep hearing about how people have known each other since like first grade, and I met my one friend in sixth. It makes me think, "Am I just a shitty person?"

So with that, there's only one person on this entire planet who I trust with personal information, but I still can't bring myself to tell him that I'm struggling. I'm scared that he won't like me anymore and then I'll be completely on my own.

I try to spend most of my time playing video games or watching TV, because- unlike people- those are things I can actually understand. But anytime I'm not, I think about how I just want to end everything.

If I kill myself, what the fuck would the downside be? One person misses me for a month? If I get to stop all of this pain and struggling instantly and at no cost, isn't it fucking worth it? It's gotten to the point where I can't feel happiness anymore. I haven't been happy in years, excluding some very rare and short 30-second moments. If I'm able to put an end to this, then what is the downside?

There's literally nothing for me to lose. Sure, I sort of enjoy wasting time and playing video games, but I would gladly get rid of that if it means I can, you know, stop being in so much pain.

The worst part is I can't really trust my parents with this info. If they get mad at me because I have autism, imagine what they would do if they found out I wanted to kill myself. Probably call me selfish and make me feel even worse.

It feels like it shouldn't be true, but looking at it logically... I have everything to gain and almost nothing to lose by killing myself.

Please help.
