Existence is worthlessI don't feel emotions, and I don't see the reason to life. Why struggle now when it won't matter in a hundred years. It's a waste. I'd make the world a better place if I wasn't here. I'm tired of pretending I'm a good kid everyday. I don't enjoy faking every little fucking thing. I want to die, I don't know how yet. I wish I could find someone who actually likes me. Maybe that would make life less of a waste but I probably won't find anyone.
