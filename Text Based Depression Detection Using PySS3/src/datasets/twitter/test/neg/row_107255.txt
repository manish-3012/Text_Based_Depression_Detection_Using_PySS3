Feel like Iâ€™m destined to be alone, so I might as well dieIâ€™m an only child and grew up spending most of my time by myself. Both my parents are dead, so no family. I donâ€™t have any friends either. I feel like my only option for getting any type of love in my life is through relationships but I absolutely hate dating culture today. Most guys my age just want sex. Iâ€™ve also got too much baggage and issues, Iâ€™m suicidal for fucks sake lmao. I havenâ€™t thought about killing myself since July, now here I am again. Iâ€™m starting to believe that my life will end by my own hands, it has to. Even if I donâ€™t do it today or next year, I know that I will always be suicidal.
