Let Me Pull the Trigger, and End This Curse Called Life*Let me pull the trigger, and end this curse called life.* 

Hello, my name around here is PK Edge!, but you can call me Reid. Reid Schafer Thomas. â€™m a simple 14 year old who spends his days like any other teen and goes to a private school, but like many others here I have a few...issues. For about 2 years now I have been through an endless loop of slowly growing anxiety and depression, and this year this barrier Iâ€™ve been fighting for so long to contain has broken. For the longest time Iâ€™ve always had problems with my emotions. I would cry at the dumbest things, feel anger in the skip of a heartbeat, or maybe forget what I was working on for a few seconds until it hits me again. This school itâ€™s been different, though. Iâ€™ve grown and matured into something of a shadow. I never talk to anyone outside of my small friend group, I donâ€™t trust anyone, and I never show emotion. I feel like itâ€™s best to mask the pain, mask everything Iâ€™ve been feeling over the years and forget about it, but now I canâ€™t. **In December of 2018 my academic anxiety and my major depression had gone to a level where I had to skip my exams this year because I had to tell my parents I wanted to kill myself.** I was instantly put on medication, Lexapro, and sent home until I came back January. By now it was supposed to die down, but every once in a while I can feel myself coming SO CLOSE to just taking a knife in the kitchen and slitting my weak and mortal flesh infront of my neck. All of my depression is coming back, these thoughts are becoming more frequent, and now I canâ€™t fight it. My soul is a slave to existence. Iâ€™m not contributing to anything, I just hurt those around me, and I canâ€™t bear watching it. And itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m scared, either. **I want to die, and Iâ€™m not afraid to be the one to end it.** 

I can even see this on the side with my athletics and video games. Voices kick in my head and tell me, â€œYou waste the oxygen on this earth,â€ â€œYou will never be able to improve,â€ â€œYouâ€™re a retarded piece of shit and should stop trying to do something you will never achieve,â€ â€œGive up and bang your head on the wall as hard as you can.â€ I feel like such a disappointment, such a patch of dried up grass in a field of luscious green grass stretching for miles, just waiting to be put out of misery. It even keeps me up at night, at least once or twice a week. Now, ontop of all of this, I have a old grandparents, one with parkinson's disease, and the other with cancer. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to take anymore pain, whether it be because people regard me as a wasted slot at school, or because of personal problems or family talks. This may not sound as extreme as it should be, but I just donâ€™t know how to put how I feel into words. I just want to lay down and dream forever, never having to watch the world take what I love away from me. Even better, never having to watch me take what others may love one day. This prevents it. 

In short summary: I only have one true friend, I feel like people hate me, I have grandparents that could die in as little as 2 years, I love to write about depression and death, I donâ€™t think I deserve to exist, and I know where Dad keeps the just cleaned shotgun. People will forget me when I die, and I accept that. My parents think I'm fine, and I lie about those words. I could cut myself to death at any moment, and I accept that. I feel like an empty husk walking the earth, my mind, internet, and games the only things keeping me alive. Maybe I am not as tragic, or have as much suffering happening in my life currently but I still feel lonely, and devoid of hope for the future. But, After All, Death will bring me to a better place, a place where I can be myself, without a single care and no way of destroying those around. It is always sunshine, and filled with our imaginations and dreams. Isn't that what Death will be, and not an empty void to laugh at us for our sins? Right?
