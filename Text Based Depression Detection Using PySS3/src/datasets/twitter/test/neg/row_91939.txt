broken heartedIâ€™m not great with uncertainty. I need to be sure that my feelings are being reciprocated and that Iâ€™m not just chasing pavements. Iâ€™ve done uncertainty in the past and I was left with a broken heart. I canâ€™t revisit those feelings, so let me know if this is what you want. If not, Iâ€™m okay with that too.
