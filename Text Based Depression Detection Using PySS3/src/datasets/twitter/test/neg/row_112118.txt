QuestionA lot of people in my experience are suicidal due to emotional or physical pain. However, im suicidal mostly because i want to stop causing pain to others. Its all i do it seems and i dont know what im doing wrong. Im not an overtly angry person and i try and do whatever i can to make people happy but it always devolves into me causing people i care about, and im so fucking tired of it. Im feel extremely guilty for doing so, i feel guilty because im planning, i feel guilty when i isolate due to not wanting to hurt anyone else.


 Theres also the fact im recently divorced, which i didn't want, and at a dead end job after recieving a doctorate and getting fired because of my undiagnosed bipolar at the time
.  

Mostly im just curious if others have dealt with this and how they handled it. Cant hurt asking when youre planning your out, right?
