My brother attempted suicide last night. Itâ€™s a sobering moment for me.I was sleeping and my mom woke me up around 10 AM. My brother was lying sideways in his room, this blueish green vomit on the carpet. My mom asked me what we should do? At first, I thought he did some weird drug mixed in with his Juul, but then I sniffed the vomit and it smelled like cleaning product. I said to my mom we need to call 911. The lady on the line was kind and empathetic as I gave her details about the situation. I was shaking on the inside and I felt my heart pound fast. My brother and I are not on good terms, he often incites domestic violence on me. I knew he was depressed, but not to this extent. Yesterday night, I saw a kitchen knife on the hallway floor and I peeked into his room and his expression was not of this world. He looked so far away despite being only like physically 3 feet from me. I have thoughts of suicide daily too, but I never had the courage to attempt to be honest. I just feel really empty on the inside, but this feels like a wake up call for me. To get my life together. Iâ€™m also worried about my brother of course. And the possible permanent damage itâ€™ll cause. Because of COVID, only one person is allowed per patient so my mom is in the hospital visiting him while Iâ€™m waiting in the car as of now. I donâ€™t know what to feel. I just keep thinking bad things keep happening amidst this quarantine. It doesnâ€™t help the weather is cold and dreary.
