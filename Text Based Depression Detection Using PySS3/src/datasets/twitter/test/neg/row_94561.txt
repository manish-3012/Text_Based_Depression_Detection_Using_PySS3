I can't continu much longer. Its just pointlessI know that my story is boring because its the same a couple of person in this subreddit.  Approximately 2 and a half years now that I have suicidal thought and living with depression. I've lost the majority of my friends because they were tired of listening to my boring life, lost my job 2weeks ago. At this point I'm not even able to cry its so pathetic. Why continu to live in this ugly world if its just to suffer again and again and again... I legit dont understand where is the point of living another day. Im sorry if I distract someone in reading this I know its paradoxical because its a post but for whatever I needed to at least tell to one person what I was really thinking. Anyway cutting myself like each night will probably be my solution...
