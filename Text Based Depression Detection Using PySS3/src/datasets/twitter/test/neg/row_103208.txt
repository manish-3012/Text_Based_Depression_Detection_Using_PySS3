My friend just shot himself in the head and we are left with nothing but questions and miseryThereâ€™s really nothing to say.  He had a beautiful five year old child and parents who cared about him and friends who are now very fucking pissed off.  This is bullshit.  Iâ€™m sitting here on reddit because there is nothing to do or say.  He was a great friend and the only person who didnâ€™t criticize me or call me a coward for attempting suicide.  He would always say â€œme too bro.  It hurts every dayâ€.  And now heâ€™s gone.  Fuck you.
