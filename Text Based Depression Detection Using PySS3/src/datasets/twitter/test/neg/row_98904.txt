I'm tryingI keep getting closer and closer to actually ending it, I keep grabbing for the bottle of pills, opening it, pouring it over myself or putting it up to my mouth. I don't want to kill myself but I want to no longer want to be alive or be in my skin. I'm trying to find hope in anything or give myself a reason to not actually go through with this, I'm trying to reach out to people for help but it seems either nobody cares or they don't know how seriously bad it actually is in my head right now. Idk. I'm holding on but surely losing grip. I don't know how much longer I can do this
