WI feel so little and worthless. I feel like I never have been loved. I hate myself for being in relationships that being me pain. I don't understand why I'm not good enough or funny enough or whatever I'm not. I can't understand what I did to deserve this life. I have everything I ever wanted, and I am so alone. I'm sitting here so tired wishing I wasn't alive. As soon as I give up and turn the light off to go to bed I just start crying. I hate feeling pain and I hate that I let pain happen to myself. If I can't protect me who can, and who will ever respect someone who can't respect themselves. I'm going to try and sleep again.


I'm sorry I forgot to finish typing the title. I'm on my phone and can't figure out how to fix it.
