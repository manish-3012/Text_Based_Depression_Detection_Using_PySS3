I drove my car into a tree and I regret nothingI've been in the hospital since February. Coma, 3 weeks in the ICU, surgeries, and now psychiatric hospital. I lost teeth, injured my lungs, broke my jaw, femur and humerus and hallucinated my imaginary balls off. It took about 20 firemen to get me out of the wreck. Still can't walk right or bend my arm all the way. 

I swore I'd never be one who survived an attempt, but somehow I did. I've heard before that "everyone who tried to kill themselves, regretted it the moment they did it", but there wasn't an ounce of regret in me and there isn't now either. Well, the only thing I regret is choosing a tree instead of a bridge. Silly decision. But people die all the time from way less severe car accidents, so I thought I'd be good. 

Right now I'm only alive not because I'm scared of death, but scared to survive. And I don't wanna deal with the consequences of running away from the hospital in case something goes wrong. So I'm waiting it out. It's almost fun seeing them struggle to help me, me knowing they'll never be able to. So right now I'm just chilling in my hospital room day in day out, playing a good girl. I'm certain I will die by my own hand fairly soon.
