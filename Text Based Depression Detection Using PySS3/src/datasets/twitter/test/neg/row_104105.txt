I really feel like a burden. Well, I know I am but itâ€™s crushing me. Iâ€™m annoying, boring, and I have no significance, really.Probably just another reason to give up because I am; I know I am and so do others and people think I donâ€™t realize it.. I always seem to be the one that people come to last or donâ€™t talk to much. I donâ€™t have many friends because most of them ghosted me,, I canâ€™t achieve anything in life, so whatâ€™s really the point? In school, I am terrible, and even at home I am terrible. I canâ€™t do anything right for anything much more keep up with life too. I just feel like I am burdening everyone and I feel like the worst person on the planet.
