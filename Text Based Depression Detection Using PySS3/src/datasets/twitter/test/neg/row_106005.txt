My handwriting is terribleMy fucking handwriting is terrible 


Every time a take a Calc test I panic and my writing is all over the place 

I write to big and my hands keep shaking 


How the fuck do they expect me to write long form math equations on such small pieces of paper!?!?!

I feel like a failure because the teacher canâ€™t read my handwriting.

I always type everything else why canâ€™t math be the same!?!?

Equation editors have gotten so much better why canâ€™t these colleges make the jump to digital!?
