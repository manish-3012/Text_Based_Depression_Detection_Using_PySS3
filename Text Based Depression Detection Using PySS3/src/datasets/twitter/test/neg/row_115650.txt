Iâ€™m so close to killing myselfAll my friends have ghosted me. I have no one now. Just recently, my close friend got bored with me and cut contact. Iâ€™m so lonely and all I do is cry. I tried to make new friends on Reddit, but mods make it impossible because they keep deleting all my posts on every subreddit even though I am following the correct rules. Please donâ€™t tell me to call the suicide hotline. I already did and it doesnâ€™t help.
