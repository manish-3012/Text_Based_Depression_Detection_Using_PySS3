I think Iâ€™m readyIâ€™ve been saying it. But today has hit so hard. Iâ€™ve made a bunch of mistakes these past months. I donâ€™t have much anymore. Just reminders of stupid shit I do. I have to depend on drugs and alcohol to numb everything out. But its momentarily. Iâ€™m growing ever so tired of this. Iâ€™ve accepted that I donâ€™t want to find the light. Yeah Iâ€™m still heartbroken. I adored that girl from head to toe. I could go on and on about her. And thatâ€™s what hurts the most. Iâ€™m ready to go. I wish I had died that night a couple weeks ago. I regret not having been stronger and taken the rest of the pills. I regret not getting to my destination and ending it. I wish it was done then and there. I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore.
