My parents don't know I already want to die but they've told me they hope I dieMy dad once told me to go to hell several months ago (I nearly attempted/did a very weak attempt) and my mom just told me about 30 minutes that she hopes I die. Those were her exact words. I'll be fine I think. I won't attempt, I promise but this whole spring break so far I've just been at a nonstop low and done nothing. They say they try to talk to me (they scream btw) but all I do is "talk back" (but then when I shut up they want me to answer them and when I do they call it talking back agan, idk what they want me to say) and they expect me to do and remember things but I either am just too done with the world or I don't know that I'm supposed/expected to do them. And I feel so guilty for not doing said things. Idk I can never be satisfied and neither can they.
