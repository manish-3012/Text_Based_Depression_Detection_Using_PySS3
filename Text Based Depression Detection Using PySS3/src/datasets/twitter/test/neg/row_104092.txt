Someone want to tell me why my life is worth living?Iâ€™m an unemployed 29 year old obese woman whoâ€™s on the spectrum. Iâ€™m stuck living with my parents because I proved Iâ€™m not capable of living by myself. The only times my â€œfriendsâ€ actually gave a shit what was going on in my life is the last time I tried killing myself. All Iâ€™m doing is leeching off of my parents money. The only time Iâ€™m happy is when Iâ€™m asleep or when Iâ€™m cutting. Which I canâ€™t cut anymore without my parents seeing.

So....whatâ€™s the point?
