A comfort?Does anyone else get anxious over life and think well, if it ever gets too bad, I could just kill myself? I do that a lot and I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s called. Iâ€™m not actively thinking about killing myself at the moment but man, the thought is never far from my mind as an emergency escape plan. Itâ€™s been this way for years. Please tell me Iâ€™m not the only one.
