Just tried itSo here is my story. I'm a 21 (almost 22) male in his final semester of college. I just spent the last two hours writing a note to my family friends and loved ones that explains my decision. 

I am fed up with the bullshit. life is full of bullshit and im done coping with it. My gf who i was serious with for the past 2 years doesnt love me for me anymore, im failing out of school and i dont see any fun in my life anymore. i have friends yes but i feel like i dont have anyone to confide in, the last 4 years have been me shrinking deeper and deeper into my own hole and i just cant get out of it.

ive tried to "just deal with it" and move on but honestly i cant. i just tried to hang myself with my belt and a chair...by tying the belt around the chair and my neck then sitting down. two things happened:the chair wouldnt fucking stay upright no matter what i did and the belt came untied the first time. idk how else to do this. 

please either help me or tell me to go fuck myself (both are opinions i welcome). I just need something to help with the emptiness im feeling, i wouldnt even call it pain as i became numb to that long ago but please. this is my last chance. i cant promise you karma or gold since this is my first post ever on reddit and idk how that even works. 

im sorry this is such a lame post. but its the last reach of a desperate person. you dont have to help at all. just hear this.
