Why do they always leave??People always leave me. I meet someone and we're super close for a few weeks, and then they find the real me, I fuck up and show the real me and they LEAVE, and I'm left alone until another unlucky motherfucker decides to be my friend.

I just fuck every relationship up, I can't seem to help myself. The only real friends I have are other ppl who are like me (complete fuck ups). I want more than that. My therapist told me "you are your five closest friends" and its true, so I've been trying to find other friends who would inspire me to be better. Its been going great, I befriended a lot of ppl, except they all left me because I fucked up and got too comfortable and started being toxic me.
