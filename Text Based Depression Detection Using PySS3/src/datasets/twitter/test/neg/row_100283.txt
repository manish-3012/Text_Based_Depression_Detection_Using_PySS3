why does no one care also haha here's a joke - meno one cares, even here idk no one probably even reads these what the hell is happening

i dont know why it bothers me  
i cannot trust anyone, I dont have the energy to persist and push friendships and no one puts in effort  
like am i that stupid, i feel like I drive every conversation ever and its so tiring and if i stop they dont even try  
i left a few friend groups this week and they didn't even notice

i vent about this and people say 'I care' like no you don't shut the fuck up I met you 2 seconds ago stop lying to me you piece of shit and then making me feel weird for saying no one cares, because no one does  


i feel like i should be ok with no one caring but it bothers me so much like i cant tell whats wrong  
shit just keeps falling apart, it feels like I was destined to kill myself, tbh. like everything in my life ever was something that leads me on, makes me happy and when i am about to feel ok about it just fucking crashes, every fucking thing follows the same pattern

I CANNOT CONTROL THESE, it always happens to things i cannot control and it makes it worse like what the fuck am i supposed to do

whoever's reading this also doesnt care but whatever man no one cares n o o n e 

I have a few mental issues and i cant get to a doc and its been literal hell solving those issues  
i ask people to just hold on and put up for like a few days until I figure things out and no one does they dont care   
they leave and i cant say anything because respecting boundaries and w/e  


like what the fuck is wrong with me, i cant tell if its me having a shitty personality i dont even know i dont know i try to be nice when i can or if its just bad timing  


im like miserable as hell right now and very suicidal i have a very strong urge of doing it

ive been looking at ways of doing it for a bit now and the only thing keeping me alive is a million thoughts about what happens to me and my ideas and thoughts after death, all driven by anxiety  
and honestly that is wearing out too and i might just do it sometime later impulsively because

n o o n e c a r e s no random person online, you dont care. you say you care for 5 seconds and disappear. that's not caring. how the fuck would you even know if i died tomorrow and how would it even affect you

people i know would say 'haha gasp he was a nice guy' for like 4.8 seconds and go on with posting cringe memes on their stories and i dont think they'll care bec if they did they'd check up on me when i was breathing and almost dying with brain issues

if i get sad at people not putting in effort when i put in effort they'll probably tell me im manipulative and im guilt tripping them and they owe me nothing then leave me again like what the fuck, yeah you dont owe me anything but dont conveniently leave when im going through a rough patch man like what the actual fuck is wrong with people i dont even ask them to be my therapist i just ask them to hang out and talk and help me distract and that is apparently too much but they have time to do it with other people and when they need my help they come up to me 'haha how are you nice youre doing ok i hope can you help me with this thing'

i cannot stop ranting my fingers hurt from typing like i cannot tell if something is wrong with me inherently like if i have the personality of a bug spray or if im just stuck in a loop of bad timing events because like i dont know man i might even be overlooking people who care but i dont know im just having a huge urge to just do it and get it over with

id be ok probably if i had some help from a therpist to process my fucking traumatic past and emotional abuse and get better and maybe solve some issues of mine but thanks to a few other dumb fucking reaons i cant talk publicly i cant get a doc like i seek for help and yet i cant find it like fuck you fuck everyone who left conveniently when i was a little hard to deal with i apologized so many times fuck you in the asshole

it wouldnt affect anyone and also fuck people im not doing it because of no one caring, i want to do it to end the pain caused by the disorders, it hurts a lot

fuck everyone and everything 

haha cherry on the top im lgbt and i have an orthodox fucking family and there's that lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cant stop laughing yes this is a mental breakdown and i dontk now what to do other than kms
