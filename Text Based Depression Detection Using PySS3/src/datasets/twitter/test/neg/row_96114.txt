One of these days, I'm not going to find my way out of the depths of despair.Trying to make this short as can be...

I'm currently in the middle of a depressive funk. My depression is typically not severe - although I am prone to situational depression for sure. 

It just dawned on me that what this was as I went through the mental checklist - unable to bathe / hair dirty. Not going to the gym. Basically not moving. Seeking escapism through sleep and food. 

The good news is, I typically pull out of these quickly. And then it dawned on me - one of these days, I'm not going to. I will reach the bottom if my despair and there will be no coming out of it. 

Maybe that's what this is. Maybe I won't bounce back this time
