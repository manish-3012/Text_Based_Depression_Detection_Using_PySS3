felt like the psychiatrist was judging me because I told her Iâ€™ve only tried to commit suicide twiceShe asked me a series of questions and then asked how many times have I tried to commit suicide and I said two. She repeated back â€œtwo?â€ and I said yeah. The tone she said it in sounded like â€œpft only twice thatâ€™s so lessâ€ if you know what I mean. I could be remembering it wrong but Iâ€™ve been thinking about it since the meeting.
