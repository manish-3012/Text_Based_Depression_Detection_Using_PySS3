I feel like a parasiteI am hideous and gluttonous and feed off of everything anyone will give me. Attention, money, food, validation... Anything. I can do nothing for myself. I rope people in and trap them into having the mispleasure of knowing me... Any sense of hope to change this is impossible. I don't want to hurt anyone else but I am selfishly wanting to take my life so I don't have to hurt anymore. It would be the final thing that I take from everyone.
