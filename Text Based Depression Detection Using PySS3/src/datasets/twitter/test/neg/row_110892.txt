So girls and guys - men and women of the world. Shut the hell up. You have nothing to be insecure about. All of these things that I've listed have been the reasoning for my planned suicide. It's not fair. These flaws of mine are horrendous. I don't understand why I was born with so many. I could have lived with just a couple but this is just too much, you have no idea how much I hate myself every day. I compare myself to everyone I see. You don't understand. Nobody understands. Unless you can list about 60 physical flaws about your body, quit feeling bad about yourself. Go on with your life and forget about them. Feel grateful that you don't have to live in my body.
