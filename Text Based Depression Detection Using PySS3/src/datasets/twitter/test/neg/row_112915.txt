smilemy father today smiled at me but it looked so forced and fake. it looked like the type of smile that youâ€™d give to someone u despise. his smile went away as soon as he broke eye contact. he never smiled at me ever, at least i dont remember it. i get that im a failure and that he thinks that im the most hideous stupid person in this whole world but i am able to recognize whats real and what isnt and it hurts.
