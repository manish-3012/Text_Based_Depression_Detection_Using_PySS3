I fell asleep during my suicide attempt.About a year and a half ago, I decided I was going to end my life. I felt like a disappointment to my family and knew that I was never going to amount to anything. That night, I was sitting on the floor of my room bawling knowing that it was going to happen. I closed my eyes trying to build up the courage to do it, but when I opened my eyes again it was the next morning. I had completely fallen asleep which was so weird for me considering I toss and turn for what seems like hours every night. How could I just fall asleep like that? 

One thing is for sure: I'm really happy to be alive. Some days are absolutely terrible, trust me. However, every once in a while something will happen and I'll think "I would have never experienced this if I would have died that night." I'm very thankful for my life and I take things one day at a time when it gets hard. 

If you're thinking about causing harm to yourself just think of all the amazing things the future could hold! Future you will thank you for staying strong and pushing through the hard times. You've made it this far; keep going!
