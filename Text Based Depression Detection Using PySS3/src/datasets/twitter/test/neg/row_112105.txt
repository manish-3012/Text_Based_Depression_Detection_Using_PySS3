Poor grades lead me to suicidal ideationI just got a D+ on a programming exam. It makes me sick to the stomach to think that I have failed myself. I understand that I can potentially do better next time around given that I am only 1/3 through this semester, but I feel weighed down by the pressure to compensate for mistakes like this. Every time this occurs, I become depressed and self hating until I manage to improve my academic standing. It is getting to the point where I can no longer deal with even minute failure when the implications are subsequent struggling for an uncertain time span. I know that it would be absurd to off myself due to something seemingly trivial like an exam grade, but I am just so sick of failure. I am sick of being depressed over these things and I am sick deriving no pleasure from life less it be from proving my competency to peers. It is just a terribly cold environment to live in and I fear that it will never get any easier. I am tired of struggling when the payoffs are so meek compared to the effort I must put in. I apologize as this is not urgent, but I wanted to be candid about my feelings for a moment. Thanks.
