For those of you who are empty and ready to end it all...hereâ€™s one thing that saved my lifeMany of us have been there. Those who made it through the feeling all have our own unique story. Today itâ€™s time for you to start yours. Here is mine. 



For most of my life (24M) Iâ€™ve been depressed, unhappy, felt alone even in the presence of my wife, family, and friends. I live a pretty normal life on the outside, but on the inside Iâ€™m not who I appear to be. I donâ€™t know why I feel like this. But, two years as a police officer pushed me over the edge. I wanted a way out but I felt stuck. After a while I just wanted it all to end because I wanted the pain to stop. It was hopeless. I just couldnâ€™t do it to my family. I never would hurt them like that.



I was able to find one thing to give me hope...a purpose in life. Nature. In todayâ€™s society, people are so focused on working just to be able to live that it takes away from what life is really about. We forget about the world around us because we are so stressed with whatever we have experienced or are experiencing in our life. All while at the same time, an amazing and beautiful world full of tremendous places, landscapes, and animals goes on.



Take solace in the beauty of nature and all that comes with it. Clear your mind of all your pain and worries. Take a walk on a trail. Go on an overnight camping trip. Take a day to photograph somewhere you have never been. Pick up trash. Think of all the things you can do in nature. I assure you that if you can focus on right there and then, your pain will go away even for just a moment. 




The thought of being nature is the only thing that gave me hope until I could find a better place. It may or may not help you, but I urge you to try. Even if you just cry alone in the woods it could be the one thing that saves your life. I am always here if anyone ever wants to or needs to talk. We all have to be here for one another.
