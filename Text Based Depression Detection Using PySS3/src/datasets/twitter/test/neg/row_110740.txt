Frick off dadYesterday my dad told me that he could make my life miserable and I immediately thought of killing myself just to make his life even worse. Now I want to kill myself a whole hell of a lot so that my life doesn't have to be miserable but his does. I've been stocking up on some of my pills each month so that I can take a bottle plus those and die. I think it would be nice to just have him suffer and be completely helpless.
