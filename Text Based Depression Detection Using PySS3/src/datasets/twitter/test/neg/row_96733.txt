It all goes to shit.I've posted here before but right now my mental stability is deteriorating. I don't even know what's wrong with me anymore I thought I was depressed but things have evolved into more than that. My head is fucked up. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years even before I was diagnosed with depression. But it's gotten far worse than depression. There's nothing on this planet that could change what I feel. I've got a tied noose with me right now. Just need to muster the courage...
