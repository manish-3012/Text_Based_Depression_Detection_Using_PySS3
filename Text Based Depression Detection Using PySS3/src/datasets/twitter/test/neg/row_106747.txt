28-year-old guy tired of these thoughtsI don't know what I'm expecting posting here. I honestly have no idea if I am actually suicidal or just overwhelmed, but it would be nice to hear something I haven't heard before.
I'm 28. I don't have a job. I don't have a car. I just moved in with family in a small town where I don't know anybody. I have a warrant out in my hometown for missing a court date for fucking shoplifting and I haven't told anyone about it. I don't have any money.
I don't feel like I really want to die, but when I try to sleep, I keep seeing images of me shooting or hanging myself. They also come when I'm stuck alone with my thoughts during the day.
Regrets from years ago still haunt me. I fucking hate myself. 
This is incoherent because I'm tired. I just want to sleep. 
If you read this and want to help, maybe PM me. I need someone to confess things to. Nothing terrible, but it might help to get it off my chest. I can't stand the thought of lowering the already pathetically low opinion of me in family's eyes.
I hate asking for help, but I'm fucking desperate. I don't want to kill myself. I just want to sleep. 
If you've read this far, thanks for your time.
