Got two prescriptions for migraines, I want to keep them if all else fails (along with some other meds)Before you harp on about how overdoses will only kill you very rarely or how it will be a slow and painful death if it does, 1st off I know that, if i have the opportunity to do something more serious Iâ€™ll take it and 2ndly, if it kills you it kills you. I donâ€™t care if I go painfully as long as it happens. Iâ€™m done holding out hope that Iâ€™ll magically heal one day.
