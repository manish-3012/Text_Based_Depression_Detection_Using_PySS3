Living doesnâ€™t seem to mean anything anymore.Friends mean nothing. They all wither away and die, and any relief they provide is 100% temporary. I may as well start doing drugs, because the changes they make to my life are just as temporary and meaningless- on the plus side, a lot of drugs greatly reduce my lifespan. Happiness feels falsified. School feels useless. My entire life is just a rat race of nothing, completing a maze, and maybe having a kid so they can go through the exact same thing. My life is standardised, packaged neatly, and advertised year over year with a cake: 

1.	Year 1: baby! Cry a lot, etc. 
2.	Year 2: Start talking and walking, wow! 
3.	Year 3: Full sentences, little concept of the world still
4.	Year 4: Getting ready for preschool and going to preschool! Wow, learning! 
5.	Year 5: elementary school! Kindergarten! Time away from mom and dad, holy cow!
6.	Year 6: First grade! 
7.	Year 7: Second grade!
8.	Year 8: Third grade! 
9.	Year 9: Fourth grade! (Anyone else feeling the monotony yet?)
10. Year 10: wow, double digits! Iâ€™m old!
11. Year 11: Fifth grade! 
12. Year 12: Sixth grade! 
13. Year 13: Seventh grade!
14. Year 14: 8th grade! 
15. Year 15: Freshman year! Wow, work is actually starting to feel challenging and all these fancy future questions are really stressful. Huh. Classes feel just as unending, and friends further split from you. 
16. Year 16: Sophomore year! Wow! You can drive in most parts of the US. You can have a job. Youâ€™re way closer to adulthood! Pressure, pressure, pressure!
17. Year 17: Junior year! Plan your future and if you screw up youâ€™re as good as dead. See that fry cook over there? Thatâ€™ll be you if you donâ€™t perform perfectly. 
18. Year 18: Senior year! Graduate, college apps, military? so many choices. 
19. Year 19: Get into ok ish college and realise your entire life will change nothing and that if you died the impact would be low enough as to be irrelevant and it wouldnâ€™t even be a blip on the radar for most. 
Nothing changes. Nothing at all. Very little helps. Passions flare up and die within months. Relationships donâ€™t last. Jobs do nothing. Good classes feel useless, bad classes feel like theyâ€™ll matter more in the grand scheme. The moment one opens up to a friend, that friend is immediately *oh I am always here for you* and then never is, really. They treat it like a problem that, like the rest of oneâ€™s life, can be neatly packaged away and forgotten about. Like medications and therapy help (they make no difference). As if, just by saying they want to help, one will feel less willing to end their pathetic excuse for a life. As if they donâ€™t already have some semblance of a plan for killing themselves, as if they havenâ€™t poured hours into the most effective way to ensure that pain only has to be endured once and then there will be sweet nothingness, that, even with their countless mistakes, this is one thing hey will get right on the first try, because they have to. As if they havenâ€™t had friends say the same things before, only to become a seasonal flower, dying away when things suddenly look out of favour. As if they donâ€™t lie awake at night, staring at a blank ceiling, trying to ascertain even one simple reason why they matter. Why their life has any value at all. Wondering why they should bother to continue, because there are 7+ billion people continuing on themselves, and they make no difference in the grand scheme of things. Life is awful.
