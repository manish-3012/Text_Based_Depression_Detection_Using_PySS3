Someone I know on the internet from my anonymous support group is going to kill themselves right now. HELPI tried to talk them down but she stopped responding and I think she is going to end it. I do not know where she lives or any of her contact info. Is there anything else I can do? Would calling 911 be pointless since I don't know her location? Please respond ASAP
