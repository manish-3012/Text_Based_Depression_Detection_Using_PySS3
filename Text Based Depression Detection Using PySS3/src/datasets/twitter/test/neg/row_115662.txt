I just feel empty nowWho'd have known once I had decided that I wanted to hold off until I was ready that I'd become so hollow? I don't even feel angry anymore like I used to, just completely void.

I want my old depression back. I want to feel anger and sadness again, I don't want to just feel completely emotionless. At least then I had the energy to make my decision, to research methods and to be able to say to myself "I'm going to do this". Instead of just feeling completely drained of energy and wanting to sleep everyday. Heh. Suicide is what I wanted and to achieve that I had to be depressed. Now I'm complaining about not being the "right" kind of depressed. Stupid isn't it?
