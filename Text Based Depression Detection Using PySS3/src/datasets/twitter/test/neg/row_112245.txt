I think I'm really going to do itI think it's serious this time. I've been thinking about ways to do it. Which would be less painful, faster. I've thought about it before. But something feels so different about it this time.

I'm not crying, really. It's like I've accepted that I want to do this, that I'm going to.

I'm not so concerned about who I'm leaving behind. I need to do this for me.

I don't want to go to a hospital or inpatient facility. I've gone before. It's dehumanizing and made things worse.

I just want this to be over. I just want all the pain to go away.
