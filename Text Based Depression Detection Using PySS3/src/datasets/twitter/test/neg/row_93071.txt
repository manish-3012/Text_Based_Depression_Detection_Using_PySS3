Gender dysphoria fucking sucksEverytime I wake up and look in the mirror all I can feel is just fucking sadness. I hate myself for multiple reasons, and I donâ€™t feel comfortable being male. There is literally nothing I can do about it. Going through one of those operations does nothing in my mind and all that it does do is fuck up the mind of people close to me. I play online with a team and I donâ€™t have a mic, my character is female and eventually they asked what gender I am. I hate lying so I just told them I was male and I felt so bad. I wanted to cut my arm completely open but my blade recently got confiscated and all I have now is a dull pencil sharpener blade that doesnâ€™t even make me bleed. Iâ€™m so unbelievably frustrated. I wanna end it so badly but Iâ€™m so scared at the same time. Iâ€™m young so a therapist is not an option as my family would eventually find out that way considering that theyâ€™re the ones that have to organize it. I feel incredibly uncomfortable talking about it so thatâ€™s not an option either. Now Iâ€™m just here ranting on reddit because there is nothing else I can do. Add all this with my self hatred and depressing surroundings and youâ€™ve got an incredibly frustrating life. I wish that there was just a button where I would wake up as a female and it would be as if I was born like that. I almost never cry but right now Iâ€™m seriously starting to drop a tear as I just donâ€™t know how to continue anymore.
