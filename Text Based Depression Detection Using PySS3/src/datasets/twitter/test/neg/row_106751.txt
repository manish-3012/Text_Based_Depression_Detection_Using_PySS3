I can't cope without my ex.So, I just want to be clear that I actually fucking love her. 
At 5 am me and my gf split up. She wanted to end it because I was rude. I don't see how because I told her how I feel. I can't cope without her at all. I can't eat drink nor sleep. Any sleep I get is riddled with nightmares. I love her and I can't survive without her
