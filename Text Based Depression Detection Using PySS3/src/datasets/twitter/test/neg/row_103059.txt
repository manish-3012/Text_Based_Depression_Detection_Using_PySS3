I have no hope left. I really don't know how to keep going.Im 29 and My life is basically over and I don't know how to go on.

I've been sick for like 5 years with horrible stomach issues and getting very dizzy when I don't eat. I have horrible brain fog and I can barely focus on anything. 

I finally figured it out after my doctor basically gave up on me and wanted to try all these weird mental drugs like thorazine a fucking schizophrenia med. I found out I have sibo it's bacterial overgrowth in your intestines. It's very hard to cure and I have to be on a diet of no alcohol no dairy no wheat no grains almost no fruit basically just chicken fish jasmine rice and vegetables. I'm supposed to eat like 15 pills a day. I kept it up for like 5 months but this past month I've just given up. My life is so fucking horrible I just want to die. My doctor did some tests and my blood work shows that I might have cancer or organ damage. I have a CT scan Feb 11th and it's all downhill from there. I'm supposed to have my 3rd endoscopy and a colonoscopy too. Test after test with no improvement and more problems each time. I've been on this diet for 6 months now and spent thousands on treatments that never worked.

I have a severe case of generalized anxiety disorder and I refused to take ssri because I didn't want them to mess up my head. I tried to get benzos from multiple doctors but no luck. I have no relief ever from this constant suffering.

I snapped last year when my best friend died and a girl I was seeing tried to kill herself the night before his funeral. She sent me pics of her taking benzos and wine and then passed out so I had to call the cops to help her. She told me she hated me more then anyone when they showed up to revive her. My friend had died from choking on his vomit after too much booze and benzos.

I snapped and smashed my whole house. Many of my favorite possessions were destroyed.  All my friends stopped talking to me because i snapped and I ended up living with this girl for a while and we got together. Even friendships like 12 years old stopped because I snapped. Things were not great we fight a lot and she has hit me a few times in the past but I have no other friends so I still see her. It is nice to atleast have someone to talk to instead of sitting in my house alone every day.

I got too sick to work and had to quit my job. Ran out of money and I have to move back in with my parents at the end of the month. I'm totally freaking out about that.

I can't see anything in my life improving. I had such bad brain fog and anxiety I can't learn anything new. My job was all physical labor and I'm too sick for that now. I lost all my friends and I'm too sick and depressed to even leave my house let alone make friends. I burp constantly all day and I'm really gross to be around. I'm super high maintainance and I have to have a premade meal with me every where I go.

I can't see anything more for my life then sitting around my parents house watching TV til they kick me out and I move into some shitty room on welfare and do nothing alone until I die.

I really don't see the hope anymore. I used to smoke weed to calm down and every time I smoke now I just get panic attacks so I literally have 0 relief whatsoever.

I don't want to live anymore. I'm really contemplating killing myself. This is a pathetic excuse for a life.
