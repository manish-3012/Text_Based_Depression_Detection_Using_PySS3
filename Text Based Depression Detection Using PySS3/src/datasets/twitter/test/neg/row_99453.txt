My problem with realityWriting this might take all the energy out of me, might not even express correctly what "My problem with reality is" because there is no problem with it the problem is me knowing It's potential, because as I go through life I found that everything I can hope for and want for this world and for me in it might be impossible as simply as friendship.

So many of you just like me feel like there's no reason for living and then I come across with small pleasures that will fill me with joy for a few hours, minutes or seconds, in the form of a Movie, a Video game, a Good song/Album, small acts of Kindness and then I wonder why...? why can't life be always like this, this good!? The answer? It can and It should, I'll repeat myself just so you know that there's no doubt in my mind; **It can and it should**.

Something is dragging us down, so much so that by my calculations the world I envision won't ever come to be for as-long as I live. This was suppose to be a pessimistic post about how and why I don't want to be alive (Not that I want to take my life, but I feel like there's no reason for me to live) but If you ever, EVER! feel like you are the problem, I'm happy to tell you that probably that world that I want so much, you're most definitely in it, the people who truly want to be better, the people trying to leave this world early.

Stay, because I don't know what I would do If I am left alone, more so, with the oppressive.
