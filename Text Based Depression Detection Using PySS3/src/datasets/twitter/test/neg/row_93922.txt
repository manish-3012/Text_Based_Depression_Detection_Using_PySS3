Part of me wishes it would get better, but at the same time I hope it doesnâ€™t.I want to be happy and not think of dying every day. I want to look forward to getting a career and having a future but then I think whatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m just going to die soon anyways. 

If it gets better, iâ€™ll be happy. Iâ€™ll do things I loved in the past and enjoy life itself. But if I stay like this, I can just end it all and be done. Part of me wantâ€™s both of these things. I hate myself for being so suicidal and unstable. I wish I was normal. What the heck is normal anyways? I never felt it all these years. I donâ€™t think I ever will either.
