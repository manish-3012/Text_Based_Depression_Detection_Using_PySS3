LostboyIve been dumped after a 5 year, "we're twin flames" relationship. Its been a month. She has found someone. I know im not some special case, but this kills me. Im unlovable by anyone id actually be attracted to and im so jealous and destroyed... Nearing mid 20's - minimum wage - no drive to further education (nor am i that smart)- not good enough at hobbies or have any skills to become something more than a grunt -  depressive in general...balding already...feel fucked. I dont know what to live for. Im a stereotypical suicidal person i guess. Im impossible - i cant take advice evwn when its good. Idk why im posting this i feel bad for being a puss. I think Earth can be a beautiful place if you are the right kind of person. Feeling ugly/meaningless/ etc blah blah all the cliche suicidal person feelings. Can someone just tell me its ok to leave earth? Can someone analyze me and tell me why i post here so often? Is it for attention? Feeling real existential 24/7
Was not made for the planet...scared ill just reincarnate also. Why do emotions have to exist? Im an alien...cant socialize or connect. Prob on the spectrum. Feel no joy...
