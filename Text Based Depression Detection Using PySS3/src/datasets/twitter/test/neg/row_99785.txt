I just need to leaveEver since my ex broke up with me 7 months ago I've been living with my dad. I'm 22, no college, no license, no good work history,  because I always quit my jobs. I feel like I'm stuck here and I'm going crazy. I'm so lonely I can't take it anymore. 

I have an opportunity to go to job corps but I don't want all my shit stolen and to deal with fights. I've heard too many horror stories. 

I just want to move to a bigger city so I can get to work without a car, but I have no money, I don't talk to my mom and my dad is disabled. I'm just fucking stuck. I'm so sick of this. I don't know how to get better. The loneliness is the worst of it. I just have no human *affection*. Not from my dad, not from my mom. 

I just can't take this anymore. I'm thinking of somehow gathering enough money for a flight to nyc and being homeless. At least I will have human interaction.
