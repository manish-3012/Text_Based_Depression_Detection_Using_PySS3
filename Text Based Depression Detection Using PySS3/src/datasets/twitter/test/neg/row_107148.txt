SometimesI was kicked out of home as a teenager when my anorexia got bad and they thought I'd die, my brother was kicked out one day later. I spent 3 years supporting us alone, getting us a house and buying us everything we needed. I worked legitimate jobs, but had to enter into the adult industry several times when things were tough. I decided I'd kill myself when my brother was able to support himself. 

Then I met my boyfriend. He was in a bad place too but we did everything together. Increasingly he'd lash out at me for little things to the point I measured things going well by whether he was presently angry.

Yesterday he left because he wanted to work on himself. I'm still in shock I guess and not feeling it. Today he comes to take his things and I'm scared that will break me. We were together two years, talking about marriage, kids and building a home. I have one friend who lives in a different city and no money because I sunk it into the relationship.

Reddit, I don't know what to do with myself.
