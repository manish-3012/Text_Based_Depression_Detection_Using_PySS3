Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s the first time...I want it all to end. Iâ€™m depressed and ruined the one good thing I had in my life. The one rule was to not cheat on him and what did I do... heâ€™s not talking to me. My best friend is trying but what do I have left. A dead end job with no future. Parents who despise me because Iâ€™m gay, a life with only 1 friend is not a good life to live. I love each night at the bottom of bottles, Iâ€™m just ready to end it
