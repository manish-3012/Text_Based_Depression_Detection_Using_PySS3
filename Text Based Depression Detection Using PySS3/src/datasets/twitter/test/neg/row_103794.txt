Just broke up with a girl and now I want to dieI've pretty much already been diagnosed with depression. I thought about suicide a lot before I moved back home from school to focus on my mental health. Anyways I just broke up with a girl who has BPD. I know it was for the best. I wasn't very happy and I was stressed out 90% of the time but right now I keep remembering the good times and it hurts so bad and those suicidal feelings are coming back. Idk how to deal with these feelings please help I have no one else
