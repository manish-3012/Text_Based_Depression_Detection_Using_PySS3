People like me shouldn't exist anyway right?My life is potentially over anyway so whats the point of sticking around to watch it burn?

I will probably get a lot of hate from here anyway.

I was just outed as a pedophile. Now to be clear I have NEVER touched a child in a sexual manner I even go to therapy every week. I was just born with sexual attraction to prepubescent and I hate it. I don't want this, if I could change it trust me I would.

Anyway, awhile ago I accidentally made a post on this account instead of my alt account I had made for the post. The post was a confession letter, even my therapist thought it would be a good idea to write it all down, well I was drunk and didn't switch to my alt account. After finally realizing I had posted it on the wrong account I deleted it. however someone had a screen shot, and gave this screen shot to someone that is a tad vindictive bc I made fun of her in modmail on another sub. She posted it, now its climbing on /r/drama 

If this was a completely anon account it wouldn't be a big deal, but there are people in my real life that know I am Toucan, they know this account. They will see it and most if not all will not be friendly about it, one of them I even work with, will I even still have a job soon?

What will happen when my family finds out?

The internet was the one place I could create a new persona for myself and get away from the shit hand that the world dealt me IRL, I've spent years being this person and now that's been taken from me.

So that's really the deal now, my life is going to burn down around me so why stick around to watch it right? People like me are fucked up in the head and probably shouldn't exist in the first place right? Surely it's only a matter of time before I hurt someone.

There is nothing left for me, I wouldn't ever find peace or happiness in life anyway even if no one ever found out what I am. This has been a long time coming anyway. There's my final confession.
