iâ€™m tireditâ€™s supposed to be the holy month for muslims but i feel nothing but dread. god hates me. everyone hates me. i should just die and burn in hellfire. thought that maybe this year these thoughts would go away. theyâ€™ll never go away. iâ€™m tired. i thought that these thoughts were caused by demons. now that the demons are gone theyâ€™re still here. iâ€™m so useless. lol.
