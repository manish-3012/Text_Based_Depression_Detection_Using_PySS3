I think my mum might kill herselfShe lives on her own in solitude, doesn't like anyone (or give them a chance), is lazy and won't work. She has spent a decade in hope that she'll find another man to look after her (divorced for 20 years) that she'll write a best seller or win the lottery and I imagine she'll end up broke falling for some get rich quick scheme or fall into gambling addiction and then kill herself out of shame and embarrasment. I've tired talking sense into her and being honest about what I've said here but she's convinced that I don't get her, perhaps she's right?

The sad thing is that I think I could help the situation but recognise that she'd be a burden on me until she dies and I think that I'd rather live my own life (just started traveling asia with no intention of going back to the UK).

My biggest worry is that her death might trigger my mentally unstable older sister to do the same which would suck.

Am I morally corrupt, overthinking this or does this shit actually happen?
