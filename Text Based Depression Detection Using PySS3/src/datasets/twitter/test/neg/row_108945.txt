I think I might have tried killing myself.From that title alone it sounds that I don't really know what happened. And it's true, I don't.

I have lost everything that matters to me. My dog and more importantly best friend of 15 years died. My relationship of 4 years broke, very badly. I have lost my home (living with my mother right now). I have lost the best work I could ever have, I really loved going there.

Now, the only, the very last person on this earth I care for, my best friend who I love oh so dearly... She decided for another one, even though she said that we would be perfect together. I just can't get this in my mind.

I feel only pain. I feel so much anger and sadness. Pain became physical.

The only thing I do is to sleep. I feel not awake anymore.

A friend of mine invited me to go to the cinema. Because he can't drive, I did. After I brought him home, I was on the way to my own. It was already night.

When I was driving on this lonely road, knowing that soon there will be a sharp turn at the end of this road... My foot just became stuck on the gas pedal. I drove 100km/h. 110. 120. 130. 140... (87mph)
My mind shut off. I coudln't really see anymore. All I felt was this pain. I saw no future, no need to be there...

Only about 150m before the sharp turn, I could finally move my foot again, kicking the brakes.

My heart raced, my lungs filled with air...

There I was. The man who saved a lot of suicidal people in the past, was actually becoming a victim of this himself.

I see no purpose anymore... even though I'm afraid that my mind will take over again.
