I find it hard to keep going, but I never got any help. How do you go about talking to a therapist?*I know this is a really long text post so I understand if you just read the title - the text below is just some of the background/my thoughts*

I don't really know what to write, or how I'm supposed to write. But here it goes. 

As someone who has a degree in psychology, you'd think I'd seek help because I understand that treatments do work, but I haven't. So I haven't been officially diagnosed or anything but I've been anxious (panic attacks) and I have depressive/suicidal thoughts for 6 years now (I'm in my mid-20s)

The past week has been particularly hard with everything that's going on in my life/head. There was a moment last night where I really wanted everything to stop and end. Two or so months ago I chose to do a few things I'm not proud of at all and I now have to deal with the consequences which is taking a toll on me.

I also have a very unique view on suicide compared to most people I know and probably the rest of society, and the only reason I'm still living is because of my parents. I don't really see a future for myself - or it's hard to imagine one. I don't have any hobbies, and lately I've been staying in my bed more and more. I'm so lazy I don't even bother with dinner anymore (I love food and this makes me even more sad). 

I think the worst bit of this is, I seem like someone who should be happy - I can support myself financially, my parents love me, my friends/colleagues/even people I met once are really fond of me - but I'm just not happy and I can't find a purpose. This might be a bit greedy of me but there are things that I want that I don't think I can ever achieve or get. For example, I've been working towards and learning how to love myself for the past few years but I can't because I need the reassurance that someone can love me before I can love myself.

Someone told me that the purpose of living can be broken down into little achievements like getting through a day, a week, a year. But "getting through" and "getting better" isn't something I desire at all, I don't like the idea of medications either - which is why I never sought help. I just want to stop feeling and for everything to stop. 

If anyone reads this, I welcome any kind of questions because I felt like I kept this to myself for too long and I just want to be able to be honest and open about it. Hopefully this can encourage me to see someone, or give me an idea as to what to talk about if I get professional help.
