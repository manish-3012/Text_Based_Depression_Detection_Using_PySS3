Too much of a coward to kill myself.I'm a self diagnosed depressed coward.
I've had thoughts of ending it all since I was 9, but til' this day, I'm still too much of a coward to end it all. 
It honestly pains me that I can't even gain the courage to end it.
I have a good life, I've got a Girlfriend, I've got a loving mom and brother, I have friends and a social life, but recently it's all gone down hill.
Why? Just why? Why do I have to be burdened with the feeling of emptiness? I don't feel as if this body were my own, everything feels bland. Every action I make doesn't even feel mine.

What do I do??????
