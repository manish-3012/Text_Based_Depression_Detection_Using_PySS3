22 M God had plans for me... But my ungrateful ass didn't recognize it... I was being ignorant all the way... Didn't thank God for what I had... Because I had everything and I still threw it all away just for a girl because universe kept sending me signs that she is meant for me...Engineering was what I was interested in but my ego won't allow me getting along with other people... Rest is history and even after signs from the universe I still sleep and smoke like this life means nothing. I tried to comitt suicide by smoking cigarettes. Now I my abdomen hurts and I am getting muscle twitches all over my body... I am very much lost because now I don't know what should I do. I can't focus on my studies nor can I focus on other people because I am in my head all the time trying to listen if universe will tell me something.
