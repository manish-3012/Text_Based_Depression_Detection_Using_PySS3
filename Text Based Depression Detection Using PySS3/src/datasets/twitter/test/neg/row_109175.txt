I'm ready and at peace with itI tried a couple days ago but my girl found me and saved my life. We said we were working things out, but I feel like I've just been placed in a box and shes getting all the fulfillment she needs while I'm just here to fill the gaps in her life. 

I feel alone and unwanted. I had planned to wait until my pay cleared two weeks from now so I could do this right, but now I'm thinking of doing it in two hours. 

The plan is to go to a place no one knows of and cant  find me. I'm on like 5 medications and I have enough for a place and 2 boxes of coricidin.  I have a bottle of aspirin and two bottles of nyquil so I know bare minimum I got what it takes for hypoxia I've stayed up all night so I'll fall asleep when I do it. 

Anyone want to be on the phone with me so I'm not going out alone?
