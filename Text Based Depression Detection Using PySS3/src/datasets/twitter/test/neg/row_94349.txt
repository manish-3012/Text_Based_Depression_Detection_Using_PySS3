Each day feels the same.Working from home and living in isolation has driven me mad. I have bipolar, and I spend my days abusing my body with drugs and alcohol. It feels pointless. The world sucks right? And, not just from â€œourâ€ perspectives either. It truly is horrible, and it doesnâ€™t seem like it will get better. Suicide has never made more sense.
