back againI posted here a few days ago about my previous attempts but somehow words of other users have kind of reached me. I think it stopped me for a while but then the idea of committing to it comes back. My work only gave us limited hours for now so there are days that I am stuck at home not knowing what to do. At night, I get the urge again to take those meds to overdose myself.
I think I just postponed when to do it. Now I am also having these thoughts of revenge to the person who hurt me before I am gone. I still have her pictures with me (thinking of a leak) then hurting physically (or worse).
I donâ€™t know what is this...feels like itâ€™s not me anymore... I want to get out of all this...
