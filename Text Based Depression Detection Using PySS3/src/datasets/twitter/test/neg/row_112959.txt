I love my mom and I'm ashamed of myselfIt's painful to be alive today. I hate myself, I hate the son that I am. I'm 29, I have a lifetime job, good salary and everything that I want. The only thing that's missing these past couple weeks is happiness. I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. I opened up about it with 3 coworkers and my doctor. Yet yesterday I went at my mom....but I lied to her, I hid everything that I'm going through.

When I came back to my appartement I cried and cried and cried....And I still am. I haven't slept...I'm ashamed...I love my mon but I don't want her to worry, I don't want to break the image of the happy successfull son.....I don't want to be alive anymore
