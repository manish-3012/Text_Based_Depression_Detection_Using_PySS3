Girlfriend broke up with meMy girlfriend broke up with me last week, and everything is too much for me. She said the relationship was good and that I was a great boyfriend, but she wants to be with a female. I canâ€™t understand it, probably because Iâ€™m straight. I feel so disgusted with myself. Or maybe she just wanted to let me down easy, but sheâ€™s not that type of person. Iâ€™ve hated myself for years. I look in the mirror or at pictures of myself and Iâ€™m just disgusted. I canâ€™t look myself in the eyes. I want to kill myself. I was going to move in with her, since I was at her house for basically the whole week anyways. She went from wanting me to move in one week to breaking up with me the next. My home life is terrible, thereâ€™s holes in the drywall that I punched when I was younger and had anger issues, my family is toxic to each other, and it just overall sucks here. Weâ€™re not necessarily â€œpoorâ€ but weâ€™re definitely barely making ends meet I think, and theyâ€™re always fighting about bills, and itâ€™s been this way for literally as long as I can remember. Every fucking day of my life. I canâ€™t stand my life. Iâ€™m addicted to video games and play them from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed at night, even if I donâ€™t feel like playing anymore. It usually ends up being 16 or more hours a day, if I donâ€™t have homework or work. I no longer have the will to go outside. I barely have the desire to eat. Everything felt so much easier to handle when she was around. If I wasnâ€™t dating her I wouldâ€™ve killed myself by now. She gave me hope. I never thought about my future other than â€œI want to do computer scienceâ€ until I met her. I started taking care of myself more, and actually started to care about myself. God she made me so happy. When I was younger I genuinely didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d still be alive now. I have trouble trying to convey what Iâ€™m trying to say, so this post is probably all over the place. Iâ€™m basically just as sad as before I was in the relationship, but going from feeling better and feeling like Iâ€™m growing as a person, as an actual human being, and then just feeling like Iâ€™m rapidly declining again is awful.
