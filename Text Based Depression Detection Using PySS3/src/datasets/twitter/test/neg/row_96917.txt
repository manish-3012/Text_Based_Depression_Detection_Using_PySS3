When i commit suicide I know there'll be a bunch of people that will claim to be saddened by my death. I hate that. I hate the fact that people I haven't spoken to in years people that never reached out to me. Will claim to have always cared about me, they will post on social media about my death.They'll claim that I was taken to soon 
they will say that they loved me. 
But in the end no one was ever really there for me.
