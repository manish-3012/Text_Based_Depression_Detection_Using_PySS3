Maybe I should do it?I'm just a financial and emotional burden to my parents. I feel like my friends have been gradually caring less about me and drifting away from me and finding better friends. And I've been a horrible girlfriend and have never been good at being there for him when he needs me and I feel like he's just staying with me and trying to be nice to me to not hurt my feelings.

I feel like maybe I should just do it. That way I'm no longer bringing anyone down or continuing to burden them with my existence
