I Couldnâ€™t Fucking Do ItI do this weird thing where once or twice a week I head down to the railroad tracks and get mad at myself for not throwing myself under a freight train.

Yesterday, a made a short series of videos saying goodbye and explaining why I want to die. I havenâ€™t shared the videos with anyone. 

I checked the train schedule and timed my walk so I would reach the tracks on time. Then I got there and stared at the tracks for half an hour before a very late train whooshed by and I felt like an idiot.

Now Iâ€™m trying to sort out what I really want.
