fuuuuuuuck my lifeidk why im still alive at this point, ive wanted to die for so long now but my fucking family wont give up on me and i resent them for it because i dont want to hurt them when the inevitable happens, but they wont let me just be isolated from everyone. i just re upped on pills so thats tempting the fuck out of me, im already high as fuck so maybe ill stick it out a bit longer, not that constant smoking, drinking, coke and pills are much of a fucking life anyway but at least ill be fucked up until the end. idk why im even posting this shit, none of it matters anyway, i guess i just need a reason to not end it all yet and cant find one myself
