Thoughts Wondering exactly how I got to where I am and why. Every intuition I have is screaming at me. Why am I ignoring my own instincts? I'm told I romanticize death. It has been my longest, most loyal affair. It's become the old lover I turn to for comfort. Thoughts of just...over. He never leaves me. He is true to me. Without knowing I could check out if i wanted would probably panic me to death. Ha.
