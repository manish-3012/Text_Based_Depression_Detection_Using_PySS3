I can't handle "living" anymore...If I could have it my way I would never exist so I wouldn't be able to hurt anyone or have ever hurt anyone, but I can't so the only thing I want is death. A long time ago I was curious about many aspects of life, but now all I want to experience is death. Everything I do is wrong. I could give all the money I get in a month which is next to nothing to someone I know that needs it, and be blamed anything and everything they can somehow connect to that action. I can't change who I am and I've tried, but I can't handle the pain it causes. I want to help others, but all I do is make things worse somehow. I try to be kind to others, but all I do is hurt them and myself. All I ever do is hurt everyone and everything around me. I can't handle "living" anymore. I can't support myself, or change anything about my situation. I'm worthless. I've tried talking to "mental health professionals" and all that did was make things worse. No one wants me around. What's left of my family, and extended family have have told me this. I'm tired of being treated like s**t, and being blamed for everything. I'm extremely ugly, and I will never be able to be who I really am. I'm just a burden, and no one would miss me. I don't have any friends, and I never will. All I think about anymore is ways to kill myself, and how hard it would be for someone so poor to use. I don't know why I'm typing this nothing will ever change. I don't deserve to exist. I'm just wasting space and resources.
