My rats are all that's keeping me goingI brought home 3 new baby rats last Thursday. My two boys are getting older so I got another companion for them and I fell in love with 2 pretty little girls. Now I have Churro, Chutney, Chestnut, Kimchi, and Mochi.

Today I laid on the bathroom floor for awhile in complete meltdown. One leg is bruised from punching myself and the other is all slashed up. I've been in a downward spiral since June. My SO has called me a fucking psycho and a fucking freak in the past few days over a fight. I lost a part time job I kinda liked. I thought about the train tracks that aren't far away or even the bathtub a few feet from me.

Today I got up off the floor, snuggled and fed my ratlings, and made plans for dinner and a movie with my friend who is always to lift me up.
Tomorrow I will make new hammocks for my rats and let them explore the bathroom floor. They will get lots of treats to train them to come to me when I call.
Next month I start a new fulltime job and have a scheduled doctor's appo,intment. I think it's time I start getting serious about finding help. No one here will love my ratlings like I do now.
