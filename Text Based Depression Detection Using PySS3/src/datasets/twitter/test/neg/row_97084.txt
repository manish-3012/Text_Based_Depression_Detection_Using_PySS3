its continuing in my dreamsi love to sleep because i can just get away, not have to deal with anything for a while. i havent been sleeping for very long, but last night was especially hard. i dreamed i was looking at myself in the mirror telling myself how i just wanted to die and should just off myself, but i wasnt angry or sad that i can remember. i was weirdly at peace with it. anyways i woke up crying. it was scary. 

do any of you remember having dreams like this?
