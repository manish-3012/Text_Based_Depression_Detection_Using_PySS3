I'm fucking pissed my mother chose to have me.She knew my father would abandon me. She knew she was miserable. She knew she had no money. My father asked her to abort me. It was literally the most selfish thing she could have chose to do. I have been pregnant and I suffered through a traumatic abortion because I know I would have fucked that kid up. My mom has given me nothing it life. She still is messing me up. Not having a father is an absolute curse because I'm only attracted to people who have commitment issues and cheat and abuse me. And I'm pissed that she had me and now I have to go through something as shitty as having to kill myself. And I don't feel bad about leaving her or anyone else behind.  Nobody really cares. Everyone just sees you as a background character and if you have nothing to offer than fuck you. God forbid your honest and real about your mental illness. Fuck this . Fuck her. I hate everything.
