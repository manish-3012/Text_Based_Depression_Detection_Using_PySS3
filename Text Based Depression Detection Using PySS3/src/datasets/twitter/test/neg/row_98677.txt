Why canâ€™t I get over thisI fucking sick of going every night with no sleep. Every goddam day with you in my mind. . Why canâ€™t I just stop giving a fuck like you did with me. You seem to be doing just fine with everyone around &amp; meeting thing people &amp; coming around your ex again. &amp; Iâ€™m still here crying over your fucking self. I meant it when I said you were my only one &amp; I was gonna propose to you.. I already had the ring &amp; I was waiting for the right moment.. I fucking hate it. Itâ€™s been months &amp; to me still feels like you left yesterday.. how can you move on so quickly?. I thought we meant something...
