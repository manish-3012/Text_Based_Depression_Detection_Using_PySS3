Iâ€™m just so fucking stressed out that I canâ€™t seem to relax.I already feel like a piece of shit knowing in the 1.5 months Iâ€™ve been unemployed, Iâ€™ve only gotten *two* interviews and didnâ€™t get *either* of the jobs. I have 3 years of kitchen and 1 year of bar backing experience at a fast paced bar. And, Iâ€™ve been doing the freelance dog sitting/walking for fucking 8 years. I had to ask my grandmother for money and she asked â€œFor *what* again?!?â€ I calmly reiterated to her that *she* was the one who told me to get out of the bar and she would pay for everything and now sheâ€™s going back on that offer. Now, I *need* to find a job when Iâ€™m seriously not even slightly holding up well right now. Iâ€™m so fucking depressed and such a piece of shit that I havenâ€™t been able to drag myself out of my bed to walk my dog in days, not that he seems to mind much, but still. I just need Odin to get groomed tomorrow and have his nails clipped, thatâ€™s all the money was for and a bone he can chew on while Iâ€™m taking my exam tomorrow in the disability center. I have one exam today and a final paper due at 11:59 pm. I didnâ€™t even read the book because I havenâ€™t had the money to buy it and itâ€™s not at *any* fucking libraries, so now, i have to totally pull this final out of my ass when itâ€™s literally my passion (itâ€™s a Deaf culture class and Iâ€™m an ASL interpreting student) and thereâ€™s like literally like 3 online resources that even give a small synopsis of the book which I can definitely work with, but Iâ€™m gonna hate myself since Iâ€™m super unprepared. 

Iâ€™m just a piece of shit person who wants to die.
