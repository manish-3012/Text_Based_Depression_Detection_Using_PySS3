What the fuck am I even supposed to doI know there we just share our stories. So do I.

What the fuck am I supposed to freaking do. My father was a depressed fat abusive alcoholic with a miserable life but good piggy parties. My brother went other way, way of reconstructing, having fun, building a healthy family. Left alone by wife because of his paranoid manic stage and killed himself.

And there I am. Same genetics. Same fucking problems. It's either I get food or anything to get any addiction, or rot in depression with self\-harm. Fuck this, I've tried so many things. I've been in different fucking worlds due to different people with different vibes for months, the same result. Here I am, a fucking miserable creature.

Now struggling to stay low weight, though fuck it, gonna eat, feel emotions and see what will be within a freakin month. No more. I won't repeat the same old story. I don't want to fight it anymore, it doesn't bring any good, only delusions. I won't let the life\-long misery take me further and I'm just fucking 18. With a history of abuse and all that shit. Thanks for reading.
