Iâ€™m gonna test something (Update)Literally only one person read my previous post, but like I said I'm gonna update on this.

I was actually able to have a nice day by not looking up negative things or anything that could lead to intrusive thoughs. It was mostly through playing videogames (thing I do not do very often this day). I don't think I'm able of keeping this distracted the rest of the day or on days I'm not on break and have to go to school and wake up early. I don't think this is gonna work. Fuck. It just works momentary or for a few days and then I fall down again. It happened before. I hate being so different every day
