I just finished writing a goodbye to everyone.This is the closest I've ever been. I'm not scared. I'm sad that it has to be this way. I'm sad that I am doing this. I'm sad that it's going to hurt some people. But this is the way it has to be. I have continued to fall deeper into this. I don't even think it's depression. I've been on various meds, none worked. I've talked to professionals, did things to get mymmind off it. I think I'm in pretty good health. But these thoughts keep drowning out any positive parts of my life. I should be happy, I should be thankful. I have a great family, great friends, a roof over my head. But none of that matters. The thought continues to get louder. I'm scared to live any longer. Maybe it gets better but I don't know if that's a chance I'm willing to take. I've spent ten years waiting and working on it. I've busted my ass trying to get better. Nothing has gotten better, in fact it's gotten worse.

I'm so sorry
I'm so fucking sorry. This isn't what I want but I'm pretty sure this is what has to happen.

I'm so fucking scared.
