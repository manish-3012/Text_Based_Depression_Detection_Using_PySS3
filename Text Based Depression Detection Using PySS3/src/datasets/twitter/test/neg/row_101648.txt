everyone i love leaves me.i grew up in an abusive household and have always had trouble connecting with people. when i open up to someone i end up trusting and loving them fiercely and it makes it so much worse when they hurt me like everyone else does. this year my best friend of twenty years ghosted me and it was just the final straw i guess. if the one person who always loved and cared for me when no one else did will leave then who wont? every single day is a struggle. i try so so so hard to make something of myself but i know deep down i never will because i just dont have the means to get myself help. i was finally able to pull myself out of depression and start functioning on a normal level (still far below normal for any normal person) and was even feeling happy for a while. but im sinking even lower than before and i dont think i have the energy to pull myself out again. even the hobbies i use to distract myself from the emptiness arent doing anything anymore. im just done.
