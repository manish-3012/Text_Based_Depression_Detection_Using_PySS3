People that suffer from BPDWhy does it seem like no one ever discusses what it's like to actually have BPD? It's always someone who's been friends or partners with someone that had the disorder ranting about how they're victims and BPD sufferers are monsters, yet, no one ever discusses the fact that the hell that those with BPD suffer is far far greater. Those that deal with people like me will suffer for as long as they know me and never again, and they can leave me whenever they want (my life is ultimately inconsequential). Me, I will suffer forever. Always feeling everything so fucking intensely, always afraid of being alone, always considering ending my life, they're suffering is momentary while mine is infinite. They will never begin to comprehend my pain. So, how dare they pretend that they have it worse than me, that I'm the monster? I don't want them, so why can't they just get the fuck away!?
