Friend legitimately wants to kill himself, called cops, and nothing happenedI have a friend who has become suicidal. He is a veteran and suffers from PTSD. As of recently, he has made specific and seemingly legitimate threats of killing himself soon. He's gone so far as to say how he'll do it and when. (Suicide by cop, tonight/tomorrow). 
With this information, me and his mother went to the police and explained the whole situation- backed up with his and his wife's texts about what he was going to do and how. We told them the whole thing. It seriously seems like it is imminent and legitimate- not just a cry for help or him talking out of his ass- but seriously real. 
After going to the cops at the sheriffs station and explaining everything and voicing our serious concerns, he put a blade to his throat and threatened to kill himself right then and there, and if the cops came he'd grab his pellet gun and act like it was real so they'd shoot him. When the cops arrived all they did was ask him through his window if he was suicidal. He said no and they left. They said he needs to either come out or admit he's suicidal or else they can't do anything. 
This puts us in a real shitty situation. We had called the VA crisis hotline about suicide and they told us to involve the police, but they literally told us unless he says he is suicidal they can't go inside or get him. 
I don't know what to do right now. I know he's about to do something terrible but the police won't help. What do I do??? I thought there was some kind of process they could get him and put him on some kind of suicide watch. But after tonight, all I know is he is seriously suicidal and there's nothing the police can do until he kills himself. 
I feel really lost and out of options. To me it doesn't make sense how they handled the situation, but all I'm concerned about right now is how do I make sure he's safe. Please help me if you know.
