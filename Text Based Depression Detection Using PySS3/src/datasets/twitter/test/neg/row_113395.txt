Any advice?I really don't know what to do anymore. I've been sleeping in my car because I'm just stuck and I feel mentally paralyzed. I don't want to go home to my house because of the stress that my roommates cause me and school in general. I don't want to go home to my family because I have ptsd from being there. And I don't have enough money for hotels. So for the past few nights I've just been sleeping in my car and everytime I try to leave the town I'm in I start crying and almost crash. I've been trying to kill myself for a couple days now but I just feel like a coward and I can't do it because I'm afraid of the pain. I just wish there was something to do. I wish I had the strength to just leave my old life behind and start over or the strength to kill myself but I don't have either. I don't have the strength to go to my family home or the home that I pay for. I feel so hopeless. 

I officially have no one. My mom is homophobic, my dad was abusive to me in high school, my sister is on the opposite side of the country, I lost all of my friends, and my girlfriend just broke my heart into a million pieces. I feel trapped and I don't know what to do. 

I've been in several really bad car accidents and I never died when I was supposed to so I honestly don't think that would work. I tried taking several adderall pills, liquor, Benadryl, and weed and all I did was make me feel like shit and my body hurts like fuck. So I'm just sitting here again in my car mentally paralyzed. Just stuck and I don't know what to do.
