Is it determined or is it just life? No matter it is. I think I had enough.Looking back at myself, I was not like this few years back. I was an honour student in High school. Excelled in Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology. I was active, very active. I was in taekwondo and volleyball.  

Now,, I turned into a complete different person..

Im a 2nd university student trying to get into Nursing program + minoring Philosophy. These past few months just been a roller coaster ride for me. My grades are failing, family is breaking, my health (both physically and mentally) are crumbling.   
For my family, my parents are divorcing. Parents have been fighting for a year now because of financial struggle. I tried to contribute by working extra time so I can give money, but its not enough. I even went to the point of having two simultaneous job while in university. I even tried to reconcile them together. What would a single child in this forsaken family can do? Isn't my efforts not enough to bind them once more? I always cry myself to sleep everytime I hear them fight.

For my health, both of my physical and mental health have deteriorated these past months. I quit going to the gym because of my double job and university, and no motivation to go as well. My mental capacity have reached its limit overburdened by all of these problems. As a result, I became depressed and started taking antidepressant pills. I even started abusing narcotics as a result..   
I have two final exams tomorrow, well later, and  I have lost both motivation and focus in my studies. I tried to reached out for my friends but it doesnt seems no one of them really wants to listen to me talk about how my life is shit.  I cant blame them because its natural for students to talk how their life is shit since we already reached that point of life that we need to be independent. But I was hoping even one of them to truly listen to my stories and someone I could share with my problems with..  
 I know people will say "Oh youre a pussy for giving up. I had worst",  
Some people will say, life is a sacred thing, and some people are suffering more than you (dying from starvation, dying from war-torn country, dying from illness).  
So now we arrive at a question, Why do you want to take your life away if you have consider all of those? Arent you being selfish?   
For me, my answer is:  
I just had enough. I had held the rope for too long. Ive tried and tried, but to no avail. Im exhausted. I do not have the motivation to live.  Its not that I am weak,, I had held for too long..Ive been strong for too long.. and you know,,

 even the strong people fall down sometimes.   
As Im writing this, I am currently struggling with my inner demons.

Should I give in and drink this powdered pentobarbital that I bought online and ending my suffering once and for all. Or should I resist them and proceed to live this fucked up life until my inner demons swallows me completely.  
I... just dont know...    
Is it my fate that I ended up this way? or is it just life?.. I do not want to believe that theres a God planned my life this way.   
I do not want to believe that theres a God controlling other people's fate.  
If there is, I just had one question for him. What did I do to deserve such fate?
