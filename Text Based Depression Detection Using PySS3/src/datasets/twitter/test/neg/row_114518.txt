I'm so much afraid of death I want to meet it already.My life is not easy, I was dealing with problems more or less but less propably :D Well my problem may be a little diffrent from others - at the end every problem here is diffrent so yeah. Well I'm so much afraid of death, I cant stop think about it, it's in my mind 24/7, I'm at university I think about death, in home think abotu death, before sleep think about death - just whole time think about death. The problem is I'm very afraid of dying and not existing, but at the same time - becouse I'm so afraid, and becouse at the end I will have to "meet the death" sooner or later everyone will I have suicadial thoughts, so finally my problem would be solved. Well my fear of death is paralyzing me, in last few weeks I just do everything what is really needed and I dont even make an effort to make things good for example I dont learn for my University tests becouse I know it's possible to write it in later term but then ofcurse I can get only the lowest mark (needed for pass) but the point is I dont care coz Im afraid of death too much.
 I would like someone to tell me why I shouldnt be afraid of death becouse I know living is nice but my fear is so paralyzing I just cant.
