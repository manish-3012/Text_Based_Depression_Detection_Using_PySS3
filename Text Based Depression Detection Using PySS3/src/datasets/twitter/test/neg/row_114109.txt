That's it, i'm defeated. You win, lifeI'm just done, i feel like i can't go on anymore...  
I'm 32 and my whole life has been nothing but suffering inside. I've been bullied since age 7 and it didn't stop, ever. that along with someone in my family with an antisocial personality disorder who could get violent in any moment, left me with nowhere to turn to to be myself.   


I grew without developing social skills. I eventually made friends, they would tell me i was different once they get to know me. of course, when i was comfortable i was loud, cracked jokes, a total contrast to the guy who would sit on the corner trying to not stand out, to avoid my fears of rejection.   


With life, people grow apart, lost the few friends i had and stayed totally alone, trying to do my best in college, being destroyed by my anxiety, even developing psoriasis on my back because my anxiety was just too high.   
I started art as a way to relax and take my mind out of my stress, and I loved it, eventually dropped out of school to follow art, and made a life out of it. I love drawing, it's what i wanna do until i die... and that's the problem. 

due to circumstances, my ability to make money out of my art could be taken away now, it's a real possibility... and i just can't do it anymore! 

My whole life trying to be happy only to be denied, and when i find something that makes me happy life's just "lol imma just take this away"...  


i'm done. I was shown this world where i could make a living with what i love, a world where i could be proud of something i made with my own hands, and its being taken away. Life took away my opportunity to grow as a normal kid, my opportunity on a normal family life, and now it wants to take the only thing that makes me truly happy and gives me the only sense of accomplishment i've felt in my entire life?!?!

it's so unfair, i never did anything to anyone, all i wanted was to be happy, all i yearned for was having a plain, normal life...

so now i look out of my window, 8th floor, and think. if they do this to me i'll just leave on my own terms. it'll be quick, i'll set all my affairs straight beforehand, get rid of the things i don't want my family to see, and i'll just jump. 

I don't have friends to turn towards for support, i don't have anyone to keep me calm... if it wasn't for my family, nobody would even notice i'm gone, not even my roommate, who isn't interested in hangin out with me and won't talk to me beyond a "hi". i'm pretty sure he won't notice if i died right now in my bed, until the smell made it obvious. 

Art is the only light in my life... without it, i just wanna get out, it's not worth it to keep living a life like this. Today i cried for the first time in over 10 years. went through funerals, breakups, and a lot more, without sheeding a single tear, and this broke me. This tore me apart on a fundamental level. It feels like all my life was life driving a car, with the foot constantly on the brakes, and i finally allowed me to take the foot away from it a little, only to crash.

I've been going to therapy for half a year now, due to my anxiety issues... i'm not depressed, i'm just an anxious mess. i've been making progress somewhat in finding this source of my anxiety, but with this, i'm just angry, angry at everyone that made my life hell, but most of it, angry at life. 

so yeah... thanks to anyone who read this, i just wanted to take my feelings out of my chest. i though i would feel better by writting my feelings down, but i just ended up angrier, for some reason. 

sorry for taking your time.
