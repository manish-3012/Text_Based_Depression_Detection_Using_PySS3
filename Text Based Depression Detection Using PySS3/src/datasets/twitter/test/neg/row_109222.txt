I Have No Will Left to LiveMy life is incredibly painful for me. I know other people have it worse, I know I'm relatively privileged. None of this matters to me. I hurt the people around me, I'm a bad friend, a bad brother, a disappointment to everyone who has ever believed in me and a laughingstock to everyone who didn't. Whatever advice you might have would be appreciated, but before you try and talk me out of it I need you, the reader/commenter, to know that the idea of killing myself is the only thing that has motivated me for months. I have permanently screwed up my life and I may have a completely incurable and potentially untreatable mental illness (may wait to see a psych about this if it happens before I get the stomach to end things). There is nowhere else for me to post this, this is my last resort.
