Hello there, care to enter my thought process?Well honestly I can't say I'm "suicidal" but I desperately want to die. I honestly want nothing more than nothing, just black, emptiness. I actually fear the afterlife, because if it exists then I'm obviously going to hell, I mean aren't we all? Anyone who believes in God has to be crazy, I mean if he really exists he's batshit insane right? I mean look around... But back to the point, Me! I feel like these things are just for attention but I'm always open to others ideas. I would kill myself in a heartbeat if it honestly effected no one, I know it would effect others, every suicide does. But on that note I don't believe they actually love me or anything of that sort, I just know they probably think they do and in their minds they would be hurt and I don't wish to hurt anyone. I don't find any value in life what so ever, I mean it's all around pointless, eventually you will be forgotten right? Even if you help someone else who cares? They will forget or they will die eventually and that gesture is forever lost. Sorry for rambling, I haven't really asked my question yet so here it is. Why can't I just die already?
