I was publicly â€œbooooooâ€d today. Fuck meThis is kinda dumb school bullshit, but it was just the reminder I needed to make me remember that not only do I have no friends, but everyone hates me.


I honestly just want to end this. I wish I could just not exist. 

How stupid of my to enter the Halloween costume contest when nobody likes me? I thought my costume was pretty damn cool. I was the plague doctor and I was proud cause I made it. But Iâ€™m not sore that I lost by a landslide to a popular girl with a poster, but I got fucking oooooooooooooooooo. Assholes



I just left immediately and went to hide in a classroom to eat my fucking lunch. Kinda weird that I didnâ€™t cry or anything. Iâ€™m just sort of numb and I feel like hollow on the inside. Like I want to cry but I hurt too much.

I keep telling myself that collage will be a fresh start but I just wanna die.  As if the traumatic nightmares from my past experience with mental health treatment, physical illness, and my family filled with mental illness including me wasnâ€™t fucking enough. I have to deal with bullies too.
