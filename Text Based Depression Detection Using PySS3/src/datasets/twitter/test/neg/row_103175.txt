Iâ€™m loosing hope in humanity and feel like I donâ€™t have a place in this world.   The way that the western world I live in (Canada) is going is leaving me baffled, lonely, and, frankly, pissed off. This world is full of misinformation and blatant lies. No one wants to have honest conversations. Everyone just wants to be right. I live in a world full both deeply bigoted ideology and those that want to make language and hurt feelings illegal. I already feel like life is pointless and as days pass I feel more and more removed from society. None of it makes sense to me. This world doesnâ€™t make sense and I desperately want out. Am I alone on this? Part of me wants to off myself out of pure protest to the shitshow thatâ€™s happening.
