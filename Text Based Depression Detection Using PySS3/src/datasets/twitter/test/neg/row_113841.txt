I am scared this time i will do itThe past two days I am just one wandering ghost trough the streets of the city. Day and night I am restless. I constantly thing of my useless pathetic existence. I don't want to die, but living means only pain for me. I am catching myself thinking of ways to end my life constantly... Only my fear is stopping me, but this won't be for much longer. I write this with fresh bleeding cuts on my skin. I was able to stop the blade, I am here because I don't want to die... But soon, I'm afraid, I will do this final step, separating me from death. 


I am not living now anyway, I am just wandering trough life. 
I've lost everything. There is nothing holding me here.
