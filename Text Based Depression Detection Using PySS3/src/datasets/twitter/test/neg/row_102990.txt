This cruel thing called lifeThis is my first time posting here, but i feel like I have no where else to look for support.. please bear with my lengthy story..

  It all started way back, years ago. My highschool sweetheart and I were finally done, a 6 year relationship gone. My life instantly went into shambles, and the irrational decisions came. I've always had social anxiety, but now my depression was king.. I went through years worth of moving, romantic heartbreaks, unemployment,losing friends and the other things life throws at you.. this all piled up and one day I just felt nothing. I started writing in a journal, the start of my emotional breakdown was begining. I had thoughts of suicide, what was left to live for?.. this went on for over a year, until by chance I met my current SO, things were great and she turned my life around. Shes the only one who has been supporting me non stop. I went on meds to help my anxiety amd everything was looking up! Well, July 17th, 2014 I recieved a call from my step sister. She just said, (my name), it's (Brother). He was rushed to the hospital by medflight. No information to go off. I contacted my other sister and we started our 5 hour drive to maine. It was stressful, sure.. but my life was about to take a huge turn. When I arrived at the hospital, I saw my dad (the only time ever) crying. He just said, (me).. he's not going to make it. My 14 year old brother died from a brain aneurism..
  Time stood still... and the descent began again. This time, bad.. 2015 was the worst year of my life. My SO took me on several vacations, and has helped me along the way.. but there is a huge hole in my heart that cannot be filled. I tried to climb back up from this, and I was doing well.. i had gotten a new job and things were looking good again.. 
  Who am I kidding. December 10th, 2015 I got rear-ended by a mack truck.. he was on his phone going 55mph, and I was stopped in traffic. I had no idea what was about to happen, no warning. But in an instant when I felt the impact, life stopped. I saw my brother. But i opened my eyes, and I was still alive. Part of me was upset.. to shorten this up to date, my car is totaled, I was in the hospital that night with sever back and neck pain, ended up with a concussion, and still in pain. I ended up losing my car, my new job fired me, and have been dealing with this since. My SO and I have NEVER argued, until now. We have been bickering and pointing out flaws constantly. 

I feel hopeless, lost and exhausted. My mind and body are tired. Everything I worked so hard for is gone, the things I love are gone, or falling apart..  and as much as I don't want to say it.. I just want this pain to end. The pain of life. What's the point, I already have nothing left. 
 All my doors are closed, I have no keys, and I'm walking down and endless hallway.
