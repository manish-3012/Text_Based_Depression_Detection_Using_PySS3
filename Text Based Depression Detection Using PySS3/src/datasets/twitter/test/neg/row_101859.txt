Why live if I know I'll never be normal?I'm almost 22 years old, and I know a lot of you will think I'm too young, but I can't see my life turning out any other way. I'll always be alone, because I'm "me". I was diagnosed with Asperger's at an early age, and I've always been introverted. I've never been a social person. I've always hated parties, and I don't like going to bars. If I'm not at work or school, I'm almost always at home, and once a week I get together with some acquaintances to go bowling. That's it. Over the years my social skills have improved slightly, but they are still below average, and I'm still known as the "quiet" guy. I can have small conversations with people, but can't develop anything more than that. Combine my boring personality with my below average social skills, and it's no wonder that I've never even gone as far as to kiss a girl, and probably never will.

I wake up everyday wishing I was normal. Knowing that it's not something I can fix just eats me up inside. It's something I will always be forced to struggle with. If I was born a different person, I would be able to live the life of a normal 22 year old. I should've had a couple of girlfriends by now, and should've graduated from college. But no, I have no experience with girls, I'm only a freshman in community college, and still live with my parents. Not only was I born different, I'm four years behind everybody my age in every aspect of life (some of which is entirely my fault). I don't see why I should live the rest of my life knowing that I'll be alone forever and I'll never be normal or live a normal life. I just want my life erased. I have everything set up, but I'm giving myself till tomorrow to make a decision. As of right now though, I don't see any other option.
