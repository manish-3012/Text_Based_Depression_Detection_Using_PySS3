Living for others? Why?Obviously most of us on here are suicidal or have been at one point. Iâ€™m wondering what stops us all from actually going through with it. Is it guilt about the people that will me left behind? I tell myself thatâ€™s why. Is it fear of failing? I looked on that bestgore website that someone posted about. Yes itâ€™s gory and honestly it mocks almost everyone who committed suicide. It shows the truth of some forms but not others. Are we afraid of the pain? 
If it is living because of the guilt left behind, why are we so worried? It wonâ€™t be our problem. Are we afraid weâ€™ll push others over the edge? Iâ€™m honestly done, my body and more importantly my brain is just done with depression, anxiety, migraines, body aches, etc. I donâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. But I canâ€™t get past the thought of my mom finding me in bed. Or the idea what no parent should have to bury their child. I say when sheâ€™s gone so am I but my grandmother is almost 94.... not sure I can stay around that long.
So basically whatâ€™s the point of waiting?
