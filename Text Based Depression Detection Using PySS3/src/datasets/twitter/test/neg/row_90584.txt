it always get better, but they didnâ€™t ever wanna tell me that after it gets better it gets even worse.Hey, guys. Itâ€™s been a while since iâ€™ve posted here. for those who know, iâ€™m okay. well, no, iâ€™m notâ€” but iâ€™m alive, i guess. yay. 

for those who donâ€™t know, iâ€™m not even sure how long ago it was, but i basically made what i thought was going to be my last post ever. i made a post on this sub describing to those who decide to read it that i was going to kill myself. i got a multitude of messages, some of which i saw at the time, some of which i saw later. anyway, i went through with it.

it did not work.

so now, iâ€™m here. what, 3 months after? iâ€™ve heard stories of many people who claim to have regretted their suicide attempts after trying. i did not. some people claim to be great til to be alive shortly afterwards. iâ€™m not. i wish it would have worked. 

i wanted to post this sooner, but wanted to try clearing my mind beforehand. unfortunately that never happened, but iâ€™m posting anyway.

i hope yâ€™all have a great day. seriously. i do. i know youâ€™re currently scrolling through a post on r/suicidewatch, so your day probably isnâ€™t going too well. but i hope it gets better.
