Unemployed. Can't get job. Denied disability. There's no way out.I'm going to be 30 this year. I can't hold a job because the anxiety of having a schedule is unbearable. I'll be in physical pain from anxiety all night and then not go into work the day after. The only way I can see myself working is working from home but the act of even applying for a job is overwhelming, I can't handle the rejection of not getting any results. I'm useless. I have no skills. Even if I manage to do an application it doesn't matter because I won't get the job anyway. I fucking hate myself so much. I'm stuck. I have no money, I live at home, I'm pathetic.  I cannot handle the humiliation and suffocating feeling of being stuck like this anymore and the only way out is killing myself. I have a therapist, they know my problems with this, I've tried some vocational rehab thing but it didn't work for me. Applied for disability multiple times and didn't get it even after a court hearing. Please change my mind because right now I just want to die. I'm not fit to live in this world because of my broken brain. I'd be doing everyone a favor by killing myself.
