Another step forwardWell, as Iâ€™ve posted on here before, timing is everything. I canâ€™t let her get any of my insurance money so I have to wait... I have the bullet on my dresser and it sees me every day and waits. Now...now I have my gun back. My S&amp;W .45 shield. It was kept away from me but tonight, unbeknownst to anyone I got it back. See? Timing.  Now we wait until the divorce is final. We wait until the court takes everything else from me, then itâ€™s done. I hate everything. I have no joy, no happiness, no reason to continue in this shit storm. Fuck everything and I hate that I have to wait.  But she wonâ€™t win my money. Fuck her.
