Iâ€™m fine, how are you?Just because I can physically make myself do some things, doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m telling the truth. 

I can put on makeup and a clean shirt and fool even myself for a second. 

I can smile and laugh and do the things I â€œloveâ€ as if all of it is easy. 

I can listen to meaningful music and talk poetically.

I can go on walks and try different medication and read a book. 

I can clean and make food and eat it. 

I can do a whole shit ton of things that just might *just might* help. But they donâ€™t. Nothing helps. I have no support system. I think about killing myself every fucking second of the day, mostly in the back of my mind, but often in the front of it too. 

I canâ€™t drive my car without thinking about ramming myself into a pole or a tree. I canâ€™t take a bath without thinking about drowning. I canâ€™t go anywhere or do anything without thinking about just not being here anymore.

My dad is so happy pretending heâ€™s not a narcissist. My mom is so happy poisoning herself with every sip. My other family members are perfectly â€œnormalâ€ but they are so repulsively rude when it comes to mental illnesses. If only they fucking knew. 

Iâ€™m sinking deeper than i ever thought possible. People are just watching. 

When I lie again and again and again, who will hear my truth behind it? Who will care enough to just say â€œreally?â€.
