I wish I had the balls to kill myself nowEverything is wrong with my so called life. Misery, poverty, hopelessness, family woes, being alone all the time. All feel unsolvable despite me having done everything correctly and right growing up. Each day I wish was the last. Yet I don't even have it in me to put an end to my miserable existence. All I can do is hope that I luck out and die.
