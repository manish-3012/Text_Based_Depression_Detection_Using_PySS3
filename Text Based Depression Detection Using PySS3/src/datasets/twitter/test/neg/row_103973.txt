I'm 27 and attempted suicide for the first timeI don't expect to live the rest of my life without another life-ending breakdown and I also know now how not to fail the attempt again. The only thing holding me back right now is knowing how devastated my family would be, but when I was in the black hole of the first attempt, that didn't even cross my mind. Anti-depressants are helping, I guess. My therapists tell me that I'm doing really well, they tell me I have good instincts and they tell me I'm kicking ass at the therapy. But I don't trust myself. So do I trust them or my own instincts? 

Being that close to ending everything puts me that much closer yet.
