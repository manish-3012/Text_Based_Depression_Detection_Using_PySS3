I set a date 6 years ago. I'm still counting down the days.Hi,

I set a date 6 years ago as a goal to either fix my life and myself or end it, and I started counting down every day since 2015. I'm down to 111 days today and it will be less than a hundred before next year. Every single day I tweet the number, I guess to tease all the people who know me of what's coming or maybe as a desperate plea for help.

I've decided I will quit my job by the end of February so I don't leave any debt behind and I can also leave some money for the people I love. I also purchased life insurance so I can maybe leave a little extra though I don't know if it covers suicide and I didn't ask for obvious reasons. I'm quitting my job so I can rest during my last month, even though my job isn't too stressful and I'm treated well there. 

I don't really know what is wrong with my life that makes me so sad and hopeless. I never had a romantic relationship but I don't think that's the reason because I don't like people and I push them away. I've had little to no sexual encounters (I'm almost 27) and I never had a "proper" sexual relationship but the little I had I didn't enjoy at all and I think I don't even like sex. I have a career, a degree, a job that doesn't pay bad, a loving family, loyal and caring friends, pets... And yet I feel like this, have been for the better part of my life, ever since I was a kid. 

I tried therapy, I tried medicine, different kinds of both and nothing worked. I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I had mental breakdowns, psychotic episodes, anxiety and panic attacks. I abandoned the last therapist I had earlier this year because I deemed it a waste of time and money. 

I just want to be at peace.
