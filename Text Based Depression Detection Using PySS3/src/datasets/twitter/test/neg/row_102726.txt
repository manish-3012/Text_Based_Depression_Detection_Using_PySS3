Thank you to this SubAbout 10 months ago I posted here that I was going to take an overdose. I did, but it didn't work and thanks to someone I got the help I needed, this started my journey into recovery. Someone from all the way over US phoned New Zealand and while I was mad at the time, with two police officers showing up at my front door, they did save my life. I would've probably escalated things like jumped off a bridge. I was extremely depressed and needed to be in hospital. I'm stable now. I just finished therapy, have a part time job, go to university and keep a good circle of friends around me. My life isn't perfect, but it's worth living.

 A lot of people msged me and that too was helpful too.

Hang in there and get help if you need it.
