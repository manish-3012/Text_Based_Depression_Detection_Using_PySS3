Been feeling suicidal... but can't bring myself to do itI am 16 years old and recently I have been feeling scared, alone, and most of all backed into a corner. I have a distant relationship with my parents, however my brother has always gotten along with them much better. I have ADHD and I have recently been having extreme bouts of depression and suicidal tendencies. I constantly lie to people without even thinking about it and have close friends yet remain distant from them. I feel like I have been backed into a corner by everyone and that no one wants to help me. My parents only care about grades and have tried to condition me to believe this (which worked on my brother, but not me). My mom is currently going through cancer treatment and I know that I can overdose on her pills which should kill me, but I was questioning buying a gun. I have been feeling suicidal almost every night and I found you guys.
Edit: I always get close to killing myself but I can never follow through with it.
