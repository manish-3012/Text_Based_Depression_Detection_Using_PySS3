Wishing I could dieIt sounds so nice. Waking up early, making a cup of tea, and sitting down to write some goodbye notes. Just simple and sweet, to let them know I care, and give them and myself some closure. Then clean my room spotless - wipe down the windows and rearrange my books, launder my sheets and remake the bed. Put some flowers in a vase, spray some perfume, leave. Take a bus to the cliffs with whirling winds, climb over the simple wooden fence, and stand on the mossy sandstone slabs looking at the ocean. Then, Iâ€™d jump, let my body go limp, and end this life. Hit the waves and sink so that Iâ€™m wiped clean from the world. It sounds so nice.
