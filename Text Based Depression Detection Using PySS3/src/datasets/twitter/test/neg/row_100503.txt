i really wish i could kill myself.I get it. I *can* kill myself. But I'm so scared. Of failing. Of life. (and honestly a little afraid of heights which is kinda the best/easiest way for me i can think of) I thought I was done feeling this way but I guess not. The past year or so Ive tried so hard to hide how i feel and act like a normal person. but i can't. i let my grades suffer because i was too busy being a fucking baby to get out of bed and do things most of the day. i didn't even make any new friends and blame it on being "shy". i am kinda utterly disgusted with myself. i feel like a fucking loser.
