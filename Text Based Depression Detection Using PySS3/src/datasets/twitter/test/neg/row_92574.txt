Loneliness hurtsLoneliness feels to me like someone stabbed me in the heart but I still can walk around, sometimes when I have my mind busy or there are people around the pain goes away, but it always kick back in and all I can think about us that I santos it to end. I can't explain how painfull it is, sometimes i want to tell people how I feel, but I'm too scared to do it. Sometimes I want to see a psychiatrist, to at least say it out loud how I feel, but I don't know if I will be able to say anything. Sometimes all I want is a bit of affection, maybe a hug, maybe it will make this feeling go away, but there is nobody to do it. My hope is my son, he is 1000 miles away, I will be going to see him in 2 months for his birthday, he will be 4 years old by then, and I hope he can help to keep going forward.
