update: i posted earlier that i was gonna try to die todayso i called the suicide hotline for one more try to feel better and they werenâ€™t helping so i said i didnâ€™t wanna talk anymore. they sent cops to my dads house (which is four hours away and i havenâ€™t talked much to my dad since i was 16) and he called my mom and my mom was like freaking out and called me. she says sheâ€™s gonna call me back after she talks to the cop. i call my therapist cause now iâ€™m stressed and a cop bangs on my door and scares the shit out of my roommates who were smoking weed. i have to go to a crisis center and tell them iâ€™m fine. 
today really fucking sucked and i wish i didnâ€™t reach out for help in the first place. please donâ€™t comment iâ€™m glad youâ€™re still here.
