Just need to ventThis post wonâ€™t be too long, hopefully, I just gotta vent out some crap, get it out there, know what I mean?

Pretty much, the first semester of school just ended, so I got 2 weeks off, so that isnâ€™t all that bad, Iâ€™ll probably try head out to the cinema with some mates or something, not sure yet.

Anyways, as of recent, I havenâ€™t been feeling the best, not gonna day Iâ€™ve been suicidal, but relatively close, at school Iâ€™ve mainly been alone in the halls, just sitting next to the door for my next class, but now the schoolâ€™s decided that to be an out of bounds area, which really doesnâ€™t help because they were the only quiet place in the school that where â€œin boundsâ€ and I get bad headaches whenever it starts to get loud, so thatâ€™s been a problem, talked to teachers about it and all Iâ€™ve really gotten are things like â€œsuck it upâ€ and that bullshit, no one actually believes me in it.

Luckily my friendships havenâ€™t been too bad, they know Iâ€™m going through the shitter right now and know to give me space, so I thank them for that, but I somewhat feel as though they can give me too much space, and can have me feeling alone at times, and i canâ€™t really communicate to them.

About a month ago, I had a couple tests done, so far it looks as though I have glaucoma alongside tinnitus/ pulsating tinnitus, really gives my head a good drilling at night, doesnâ€™t hurt much, sorta gotten used to it, anyways, Iâ€™m also gonna have teeth pulled out in 7/8 weeks, braces put in in 9, pretty sure itâ€™s costing my family about $4800.

All right thatâ€™ll really be all for my venting for now, once again, not really feeling suicidal, I am open to have a PM convo if anyone wants to, I would prefer if you start the convo with what topics to cover and such, could also maybe play some games as well, anyways, gonna hop off, you wonâ€™t get a response till this post is about 8-9 hours long, gonna have a rest seeming itâ€™s 00:36, good olâ€™ Australia, but, thanks for reading.
