Officially killing myself soonIâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve really tried. Thinking not all girls were the same. But they just are. It seems so unrealistic that a girl would ever even want to as much as touch me. Iâ€™m just so pathetic. Girls may have different personalities and beliefs but if there is one thing they are all common with is that none of them will ever love me, and before people tell me to be â€œpatientâ€, â€œlove myself, the right one will comeâ€, and to â€œembrace rejectionsâ€, that doesnâ€™t help at all. And before you say itâ€™s because Iâ€™m negative, Iâ€™ve been optimistic trying to get to know them. But I still get rejected in the end. After recently getting rejected by the love of my life Iâ€™ve officially decided to kill myself. I hate to generalize but in my case every girl is the same
