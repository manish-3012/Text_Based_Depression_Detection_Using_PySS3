Love is what I need! Just take me back home my lord.Although I have an amazing family who takes care of me unconditionally, there's still that void within me about craving for love, attention and some sweet conversations. I'm not able to blend with them and anything I talk is wrong apparently. It feels like I have no voice of my own. I wish I could feel contented with myself. &lt;3 That'd be the greatest achievement of my life. Take me back home, my lord.
