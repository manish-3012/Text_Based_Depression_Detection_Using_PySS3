Anybody want to get killed by terrorist?I'm pretty depressed, I've got no friends and I don't think my degree is worth shit. I've had two recurring daydreams. The first is to just hop a train to Colorado, go out into the mountains and hang myself. The other is to travel to Syria or Nigeria and just sit out to protect a village as long as I can until somebody shoots me dead. Both seem pretty reasonable to me what do yall think?
