Need help, hope all but goneI'm only 18, but last night at a party it just hit me all at once. I feel worthless that I'm only moderately liked, sure people want me around. But not enough for a meaningful relationship. I have friends and they are great people, but I convince myself that they are out to get me, they only hang out with me out of obligation. They found me last night and drove to my house when I had a bunch of pills and I still resent them, what is wrong with me.
