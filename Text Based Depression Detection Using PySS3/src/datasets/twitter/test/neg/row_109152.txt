I don't want to kill myself, but i had some thoughts about not living...Have you ever thought about what would happen to the world if you'd stop existing, or you wouldn't even be born in the first place? Like since there is this whole COVID19 bs, i have to do online school now, and there is nothing interesting outside (i live in hungary, there is no full lockdown yet, but not advised to go outside, not that i even wanted to), and ever since this started i have more time to think about things. And the only thing that pops up in my head is "what if you die, or what if you didn't exist in the first place?" It's kinda weird 'cause i never had these  thoughts, and worst is, i get them at nighttime, and they keep me up until like 2-4 AM. Doesn't drive me crazy but it's still sad. Thank god tho because i don't have worse problems, and my prayers go out for those who do at this moment. God bless everyone (yeah, i'm kind of a christian, but i don't really "follow" my faith, but my family is full christian)
