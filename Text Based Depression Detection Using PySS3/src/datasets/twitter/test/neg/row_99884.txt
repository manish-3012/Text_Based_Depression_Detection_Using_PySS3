The only reason I haven't done it is because I'm scared of the pain.I live in the UK. I don't have access to firearms. There's really no way for me to kill myself that isn't going to be incredibly unpleasant. My parents are paying for me to stay in this nice student accommodation while I attend University, but last year I only went to about 4 classes. I recently was told that there was some error with my booking for next year and I honestly don't even want to deal with fixing it.

I'm a waste of space to society. I sit here in my room playing video games and watching TV shows. I don't do anything productive and everything I have is paid for.

I wish I had a gun.
