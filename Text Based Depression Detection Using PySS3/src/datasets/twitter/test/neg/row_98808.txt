Loneliness is making me really suicidal.I [18F] went into meltdown a couple of years ago meaning and lost all my friends. Back then, I needed to be alone and lost all forms of social communication. Now, that I've accepted recovery and want to speak to people - I can barely function around humans(I know basic social skills and small talk but struggle to take it further) due to the lack of social skills I have. It sucks as I want to make friends but I can't as I end up just freaking out due to the pressure. 

I try and keep myself busy like doing hobbies and have a part time job and go to school but humans are social animals right? The loneliness is killing me to the point where I feel suicidal everyday due to the fact I have no one to speak to most days. From going from quite alot of friends to no one has really taken a tole on my mental health as I have no one to help me get though. 


Can anyone relate to this?
