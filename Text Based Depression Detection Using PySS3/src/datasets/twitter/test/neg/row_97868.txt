16 years old, and I already can't live with myself.I'm a sixteen year old girl and I've tried to kill myself many times. I can't even remember most times, but I can't even do that right. Everything I do is wrong, I'm fat, ugly and stupid. No one ever wants to be around me because I'm such a downer, even when I'm at my best.. kids in school always tell me to kill myself, and some even offer to help. They've even tried to set me on fire because I'm that horrible I guess. I don't have friends, my dad's a psycho, my mom's too busy for me, my boyfriend doesn't Gove a shit, my brother's and sisters moved to get away from me. I feel like I don't have any other options...
