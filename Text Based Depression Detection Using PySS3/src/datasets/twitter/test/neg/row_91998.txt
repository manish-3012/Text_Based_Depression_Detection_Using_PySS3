There's too much accountability in suicide.Obviously its different for everyone. It might weigh heavy on you or it might not depending on how much responsibility you feel you have in this life to begin with. I know that before I have the desire to take my own life, I first have the desire that it will be taken from me. That I might have an aneurysm in my sleep or just simply stop breathing slowly. Then I would be absolved of any crime against a loved one. I could not know that I died. I could not know about the pain I cause my child when he grows up without me. Perhaps he is young enough that it wouldn't matter and it would just be normal that I wasn't there. At least normal by the time he starts school and starts forming that permanent chain of memories we all identify with. Or, more likely, it isn't normal for any child and I am left with the responsibility even without being at fault. 

I can't take myself away from him. Or my mother. Or my best friend/cousin. The person I am now will always shun the version of me that just takes his own misery and transfers it to the only people alive that were able to give him joy. And I hold in high esteem the version of me that was able to will himself out of existence entirely. Future, present, and past.
