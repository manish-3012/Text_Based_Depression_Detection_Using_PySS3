In a terrible place, your typical relationship issueI'm in a bad place redditers and I think I need help. Ive been drinking non stop, have wrote suicide notes that I have not followed through with. I went from a 3.7 gpa average college student to failing all my classes this quarter. I was in a relationship and I thought I was doing what was best for her, but as it played out it wasn't. I was planning on proposing this June but things took a turn for the worst, and we ended things. This breakup is wrecking me, and I recently met up with her on a trip to Los Angeles and I'm just broken. I don't know why I let her slip out my hands, but I feel so terrible that she has been going through so much heartbreak, I have been wanting to kill myself because I don't want to cause harm to other people. I have told myself that from now on I will never date again or ever get married, and usually I'd think I'm just being crazy but I feel like I just want to disappear from the world. The worst part is that I am still trying to talk to her, and get her to be mine because I love her but I feel like I am just making it harder for her to move on. I am a 23 year old male ready to just leave this world because no one needs me here. What should I do...
