I'm the guy that set a date. I've decided to talk to you about it.I'm 23.

Things are a little more complicated then I mentioned in the last post. I also suffer from massive Depersonalization/Derealization and a basically persistent existential crisis as well as paranoid psychosis. This has been going on for 5 years. 

I'll try to explain:

All meaning is defined in terms of other things, which themselves are only meaningful in relation to other things, etc etc etc, rather like how you can only define a word using other words. Strip away the recursion and you find that existence is a state utterly devoid of inherent meaning, and potentially purpose.

Once you realize this, it activates a homunculus inside your head that vetoes all attempts to make an order from disorder, sense from nonsense. All purposes in life get subconsciously dissected to reveal their empty cores. Meaninglessness, ephemerality, and universal indifference towards your condition â€“ how to live with these constants? How to reconcile that anything but those constants is, well, inconstant?

Once this goes on long enough objects themselves lose meaning. You look at a car and no longer see the car but the shapes that make up the car. "Car" becomes strange sounding and just some vague concept in your head that doesn't actually associate with anything that you perceive. It's like a constant dream world. That's the derealization.

Along with that comes depersonalization. I'm not really sure how to put it into words. I simply don't feel real. Everyone has an internal feeling of "self". That inner ego. That doesn't exist in me anymore. I don't have thoughts. Everything I do is a series of unrelated automatic actions that feels unnatural but somehow turns into normal human behavior. Even as I'm typing now it's not really me doing it. I see hands doing typing and I see the words on the screen but they don't feel like my hands. 

I feel like an alien.

Then add in the paranoid psychosis and occasional illusions of grandeur. At work I hear my phone ringing to look down and see that it's not. I think the network administrators at my work are monitoring my connections and posting stuff on reddit in response to my main's posts taunting me. I think that people are trying to tell me things using hidden meanings in what they say. Like there is some hint they are giving that I'm not picking up on. etc. etc. etc. It's a constant battle between my rational mind and my paranoia.

So far all of this has been a battle of attrition and New Years is the date I give up.

Before you ask, yes I have been under the care of multiple psychologists and psychiatrists. I have tried dozens of medications, self medication, and no medication. I have tried a change of city, change of job, regular exercise, good diet, and regular sleep (when I can).

Edit:


Forgot to add: Sometimes I cause myself pain to feel real. I try to not cause obvious or permanent damage.
