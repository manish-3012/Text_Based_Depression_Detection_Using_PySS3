Worthless and Unable to ChangeI've just been turned down for yet another job. I actually had hope for this one, was qualified and even know the operating system; I think this time feels worse because I got my hopes up. I already had to move across states to move back in with my parents as I can't hold down a job or get a new one to afford living on my own. I'm 23. I've had 2 actual suicide attempts. I'm fat, unattractive, I have loads of debt (mostly medical from seeking help, ironically), no reliable transportation anymore (car is falling apart), and have no friends in this new place. Diagnosed with ADHD, dysthymia (constant depression basically), and periods of major depression. Guess I'm just ranting. Feeling suicidal again; parents are going out of town this weekend and I can't think of any reason not to try to kill myself again. I find no enjoyment in the few hobbies I have, I have no one to socialize with, I have no reason to leave this tiny apartment. Don't really even care if anyone reads this, let alone comments, just felt like typing it out. Originally posted this in /r/depression, but after rereading the sidebar, may be more appropriate here.
