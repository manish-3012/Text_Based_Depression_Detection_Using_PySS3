Fuck your adviceIâ€™ve asked for help. On reddit, on /adv/, on other forums, in real life. 

Aways the same shit. Get a job. Get a hobby. Be productive. I KNOW I have to have these things Jesus. Itâ€™s fucking hard when you have a mental illness. I KNOW that I have to â€œbe disciplinedâ€ but I donâ€™t know HOW. And when I point out that their advice is vague, they get angry and go straight to ad hominem. â€œContinue being a defeatist piece of shit loser thenâ€. 

Bro what? When I ask for ACTIONABLE advice I donâ€™t want â€œjust go out broâ€. You think Iâ€™m just gonna bow to you and thank you for being so enlightened? EVERYONE knows that working out is good Fuck off.
