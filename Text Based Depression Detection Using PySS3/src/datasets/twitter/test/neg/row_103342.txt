What is the point of living?Iâ€™ve started asking myself that a lot. And the voices in my head keep getting louder. School keeps getting more stressful, Iâ€™ve told my mom I donâ€™t believe in God (I was raised in a Christian house) and she was pretty much pissed off at me. My friends seem to keep getting distant from me. Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where itâ€™s so hard to find a reason out of bed. Iâ€™ve started self harming again and Iâ€™m now starting to think Iâ€™ll be better off dead. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Sorry if I wasted anyoneâ€™s time with my problems.
