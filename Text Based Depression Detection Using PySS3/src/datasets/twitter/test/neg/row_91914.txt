Everyone loves me, I hate myselfIdk. I just don't want to live anymore. But a lot of people really love and care about me. I cut a lot, I wear arm warmers to cover it. I'm not the kind of girl that anyone would suspect anything from. I'm always making people laugh, always happy, always fun to be around. I have so many friends. They all love me a lot. But I don't really care anymore. It's just not worth it. My mom and step dad are the best ever. I have a seemingly perfect life. I'm so miserable though. My boyfriend is the nicest guy ever, he tells me he loves me all the time. My best friend (girl) always tells me how important I am to her. My other best friend (guy) always tells me how funny I am. I'm dealing with some rape trauma from my childhood that I've finally started talking about. I'm also dealing with a sexual assault case from a boy at my school. But it's too hard to deal with. I think I'm going to send out the "I love you, you mean so much no matter what happens I'll always love you" text messages tonight. Then I'll get a trolley to downtown, and jump off one of the bridges. Sounds like a plan.
