So here's the dealAbout a year ago my wife moved into her friends house because we were in a weird living situation where the owner of the house we were staying in constantly smoked. I understood. After that, she almost never saw me, despite her college was literally 2 minutes from where I was living. When we did hangout we had a great time, the last time was just this New Year's. She then moved to Indiana without even telling me. She is an immigrant from overseas and I helped her get her green card, paperwork finally went through back in August. After that she really just stopped even texting me. I know how it seems, used me for green card, I get it. I may report her for everything.

It's not just about her. I do not have any friends (in person, only online) and it gets pretty depressing. I try to make friends constantly but it seems that the people that do answer me online from around my area just like to hide behind their screens. I took a step back and tried to evaluate myself because maybe there is something wrong with me? The two major flaws I have is that I drink on weekends (almost always without anyone around so nobody would really know that), and I smoke cigarettes occasionally. I mean I have a good paying job, educated, fairly good looking and treat people well. I really don't get it. 

I did have a goal to teach English overseas. Multiple times I would make friends in the country I was wanting to go to, then when I mention this goal everything changes and seem to not want anything to do with me anymore. I can't figure out what is going on. Is this just what life is, because I am tired of feeling so damn alone every second of my life. I truly do not think I can take much more of this.
