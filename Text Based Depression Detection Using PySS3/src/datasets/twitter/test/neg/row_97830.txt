Side effects of Zoloft?After going through this alone for around a year, I finally said enough was enough and talked to my family. After seeing a therapist and going to the doctor, I'm now on 25 mg of Zoloft every day. Can anyone tell me what kind of feelings I might get/when it will start working? Thanks.
