I am alive....and upset about it. I did not want to make it home.

I checked the mail, then for some reason started walking in the cold and I don't know how I made it back, I just stared at the road the entire time. I was hoping a car would hit me...even though it probably would not kill me...I don't want to be paralyzed...ugh, I need to think these things through more. No, the drivers were responsible fucking human beings and they avoided my walking corpse. I came back home and got in my car and drove, and I don't know. Ah, at least I saw deer. They did not run in front of my motorized vehicle. haha, I'm talking to myself and losing my mind. I think the walk released positive chemicals into my brain...but I do not want them. I do not want to "get better," like I always do. I am so sick of the cycle. I don't want another 8 years to fly by, nothing accomplished, just wasted consciousness. Wasted on thousands of hours of trivial work just to convert my time into "money." That's my life. Nothing else. Just using my life to convert "time" into money. I don't need some physical manifestation of time to be happy. The universe does not care. I don't know what the fuck I am talking about. I am tempted to open up a drink, but I have to be at work in a few hours. I don't know, maybe I'll just drink a bit. No I will not, I am being silly. I don't know why my body/mind is acting out like this. It's like it wants attention, but my usual conscious self is strictly against it. I'm so confused.
