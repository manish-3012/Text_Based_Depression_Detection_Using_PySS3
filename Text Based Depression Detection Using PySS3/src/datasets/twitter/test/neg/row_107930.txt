I broke up and she attempted suicide..Okay so I dont want to make this too long and complicated, but I have no other place to seek advice. I have been with this girl for about half a year, and we truly found a soulmate in each other. After 2 months she told me she used to cut herself in the past cuz she suffering from bipolar depression, but she dealt with that with medication now. I told her I was pretty shocked, but glad that she overcame that.   


Now we had our ups and downs due to the long distance we lived from each other, but yesterday it was finally the last straw. She was lying about some trivial things but made me think she was potentially with some other guys. It turned out it wasn't the case, but she put me in a position where I wasn't sure, and told her I don't a relationship like that. She was devastated and told me her hands were clean. I told her I didn't care if it was true or not, she lied to me and made think she was fucking around, so she should fuck off and never speak to me again. After hours of her on the phone telling me she doesn't want to live without me, I told her again I don't want to be with her no more.

Now, 

Today I woke up to a message of her basically apologizing and telling me her goodbyes, and it was pretty clear that she was implying she was gonna kill herself. Now I woke up hours after the delivery date, so I called her up.

Turned out she took all her pills and then she cut up her whole forearm, like the whole forearm from top to bottom is cut up. Now I've talked to her for hours and how I wouldn't ever want her to harm herself in any way. She told me she wanted to change in all kinds of ways and all that, but i told her it i'm standing by my decision to break up because the relationship isn't healthy for both of us.   


Now I feel extremely remorseful because I love her, and I know she has to go through a rough time dealing with the backlash of her suicide attempt, and I feel like i'm leaving her on her own. 

I do really love the girl and would like things to work out down the road, but she has these issues which she needs to work out and I'm just not sure whether to let her go, or forgive her and be there for her. I told her I'm not gonna stay with her because she attempted the suicide, because then she would trap me in the relationship with that. She told me to come back on her own terms, but I'm not gonna promise her anything cause I want her to better herself for her OWN sake. 

  
So for my question: Is it fair for me to break up with her and should I break all contact with her or not? I'm her first serious bf and I know she doesn't have too much people that support her on a daily basis. I was her rock and she is madly in love, but at the same time I can't bring myself down for the sake of this relationship. I'm really lost because I want to be with her, yet at the same time feel like i'll slowly suffocate myself. 

Any advice is appreciated
