Talk to me.Itâ€™s not so much that I want to die. Itâ€™s that I cannot imagine living on the path that I am on for all that much longer. I have a couple dogs, and a couple friends, and very loving (but unaware, due to my choices) parents. 

Sometimes I just want to work at a gas station or a convenience store and get no personal satisfaction from the work I do. (Please, no offense to those who do that for a living.) 

I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to start over. Or. I dunno. Maybe to die because I donâ€™t know what else to do? I feel trapped. I am angry. And hopeless. And also I am intelligent and know these feelings are irrational. But so were the feelings of buying a bottle of Knob Creek. 

Iâ€™m just so over it. No one gets me. No one I want to care, cares.

Help.
