Reddit i need your help... (long read)Im sorry in advance for the long read, but I need advice. Soon.
I am a 20 year old male engaged to a 19 year old female. Its a long distance relationship. South Dakota, USA to New Zealand. Like i said, long distance. A little backstory, we met online about a year ago playing League of Legends. Call us nerds or whatever you want i dont care. We really hit it off. I slowly started learning more about her and fell in love once i really got to know her. She was born in South Korea and moved to New Zealand when she was 10 years old. She speaks extremely good english and its mostly self taught. For those of you that dont know, the way Korean parents raise their children is quite harsh sometimes. They can be very strict and in some cases dont care about what their child is thinking or feeling as long as they are 'living up to their standards' Her parents are no different. I will get more into that later.
A little backstory about her. She told me not long after we were dating that she was raped at the age of 15 by her (then current) boyfriend. She planned on breaking up with him but took the mature route and wanted to do it in person rather than over the phone. So she went over to his house and ended it. He didnt take it very well and said that he was going to get her pregnant so that she couldnt leave him. The only people that she could turn to was her family. She had only a few friends and she didnt feel comfortable telling them. Her family blamed her and turned her away. For what reason i have no idea but it was very cruel of them to do. She started blaming herself and became depressed. She cut herself. She smoked 2 packs a day. And at one point in time even attempted suicide. Twice. All of this happened before i met her. She has always blamed herself since then and no matter how i try and say it to her that it isnt her fault she still blames herself. I understand why she feels that way. Blaming herself for so long that she believes it that its right that way. That she is used to blaming herself? Might be another way to say it. Idk. Me and her skype all the time. And text all the time. (we are both relatively clingy people and this is the most serious relationship either of us has had) I talk her to sleep just about every night on skype. There have been a few days where she was depressed and was talking about suicide but i was able to calm her down and bring her down from thinking like that. And she would always thank me and tell me that she was happy to have someone like me. Makes me feel good inside.
Back in November i took out a loan and made a trip to New Zealand to visit her. I was there for 21 days and by God it was the best 21 days of both of our lives. I proposed to her when i was there. She said yes in a heartbeat and i have never seen her so happy before. As expected, when the trip was over it was hard for both of us. She definately took it harder. she was depressed more. We talked about planning our next visit, that she would come see me in the states, but it felt so far away it was hard to stay positive. She was down a lot and depressed. Keep in mind that the whole time this relationship has been going on, she has been getting shit about how she is a failure of a daughter and how they would rather disown her than let her do what she wants in life. So she is stressed. A few weeks ago she started a new job to help raise money for our next trip. She also started school this week. She is going to an art school (she origionally was enrolled for psychology but hated it and dropped out, needless to say her parents were not happy) between school and work she had even more stress. She has a hard time meeting new people due to her past and so it was nerve racking for her. Here is where the story really starts. Its been a few months since my visit. She is still stressed and depressed. With everything that has been going on in her life, she confessed to me that she was starting to forget what it felt like to be next to me. She forgot what it felt like. And she was depressed about that. I was sending her some of my things to have and hold to make that feeling go away and it helped a bit but it never went away completely. She made a friend with a coworker of hers and i was very supportive about it. I was happy for her. Until she told me that she wanted this guy to like her. She said that even though she knew it was bad and wrong.. she wanted to do things with him to remember what it felt like to be with me. I tried my best to clear those thoughts from my mind, and about 2 weeks ago she cheated on me. She confessed everything without me having to say anything. She did it all on her own, she felt terrible. The feeling that she wanted to remember wasnt there. It didnt give her the feeling that she wanted. She had no feelings for this guy. And now she was more depressed than ever. She was down that she had hurt me. I said that i forgave her. That i still loved her. And that i didnt leave because she was honest with me. That she justhad a weak moment. Even tho i have forgiven her, she still feels terrible and stayed depressed about it. Its been like that for almost 2 weeks now.
Now tonight.. what happened tonight is why im on here. Is why im typing this all out right now. I learned more about her tonight. I learned that she was victim of sexual assault at the early age of 5. From a schoolboy that would touch her down there and said that if she told anyone he would tell the whole school. That kept her silent and hadnt told a soul until she told me tonight. She then told me that between the ages of 11 and 14 she was also sexually assaulted. By her brother. He is 3 or 4 years older than her i dont remember which. Its started out as him saying he was curious what a female body looked like and asked her to show him. She did. He then said that he wanted to 'play' doctor with her. And he would only play if he let him do 'surgery' on her 'down there' He touched her. I wont go into a bunch of details, but he made her give him oral and he gave oral to her. This behavior stopped not long before i met her. She has also never told anyone that before. Now what happened next was scary. we were voice chatting in bed because she said she was tired and wanted to lay down. She was depressed again. When she is depressed she has a soft, sad voice that sounds like she is about to cry. She normally just listens to me talk as it helps her calm down. I could talk about anything really and it would help. She would only talk if i would ask a question. It was right after she had told me all of the things about her past. Her voice changed. From the soft, sad voice. To a not loud but very firm voice. It was almost creepy crisp clear. Didnt sound sad or scared but sounded.. possesed. Angry. I dont really know how to describe it. She started talking about how she wanted to just kill her parents in detail. I was telling her to stop. Not to think like that. Trying to talk to her and calm her down. But she started laughing. Not a happy laugh. A demonic laugh almost. Imagine how someone would laugh after they say how they would kill their parents. I knew that she didnt really want that. Its not like her. I know she is angry and doesnt like them much but its still not like her. I kept telling her to stop. I was getting scared because it didnt sound like she was listening to me at all. And then her voice changed back. To the soft sad voice. And when i said that she was scaring me, she asked why. And when i told her she had no idea what i was talking about. She said i was scaring her and she started to cry. I told her that everything would be okay. We said that we loved each other. No sooner did we say that her voice changed back again. Creepy crisp. She said that she didnt believe me when i said i loved her. She started telling me that if she ever found out i had another family she would find us and she would slit my childrens throats right in front of me and would make me watch the blood spray. And then how she would move onto my wife and kill her and make me watch too. And then she said she would burn me. And during this whole thing, she was laughing. I started crying. I didnt know what to do think or say. I had a mild panic attack and between the attack and the crying my breathing became kinda fucked up. Sounded like i had just run a marathon. she was laughing. all of the sudden her voice changed back to soft and she started crying asking me why i was breathing like that and that it was scaring her. I told her why. She said "why would i ever say those things to you, thats horrible" and she kept crying. I was crying. She didnt remember. She had no idea. I knew she telling the truth. I could tell. I started talking to her again and not long after it sounded like she had fallen asleep (i had talked her to sleep enough times to know what her breathing would sound like when she finally slept) so i said you sleep tight tonight. And in the creepy voice right after that was 'Dont tell me what to do' And i said all i wanted to do was help and she said 'well you arnt being a good help right now' It was so creepy how she was talking to me. I said i didnt like how she was talking and she told me to hang up. I refused and she started laughing and saying 'what are you going to do then? be scared? are you going to cry again?' and how she said that.. i started crying right then. She was laughing calling me a baby for crying. It was real hurtful, to hear it from your fiance. I started crying out 'why are you doing this to me, what did i do to deserve this' and she got soft again and said 'you didnt do anything, why are you crying' as she started to cry. Once again, she had no idea what she was saying to me. Im really freaked out. She ended up falling asleep not long after. It was the last i heard of that creepy voice. I sent her a long text talking about what happened because i believe that she wouldnt remember any of it. she woke up to text me back and said that she only remembered me crying and breathing funny and that she was scared. right now she is asleep and i have no idea what to do. I dont know what to think. I dont know what all of this means. Its was the first time that she has had these personalities appear. I looked up online and found Dissociative Identity Disorder. It describes the multiple personalities and the apparent amnesia of the memories prior. It talks about how some cases are reported because of childhood sexual trauma and extreme stress. Can anyone help me out? tell me whats going on? give me advice, tell me what to do.. Im scared for her. and i dont know what to do..
