Hey guys.Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for 12 years. Every time I tell someone, I am always told â€œquit being such a babyâ€ and â€œyouâ€™re faking for attentionâ€ and I canâ€™t handle it. I feel like my life doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m bullied by everyone I meet. I am very quit so people always think Iâ€™m a school shooter. Please help me escape this nightmare.
