CopycatIâ€™m really scared. Around where I live, thereâ€™s been a lot of people attempting suicide via the rail network. Thereâ€™s been 4 in the last 2 or so days. And I was at the station, waiting for my train to work.... and I just had the thought. 

Iâ€™m not majorly suicidal, but the fact that Iâ€™ve seen so much in the news, on the station announcements, it gives me thoughts about doing the same. And Iâ€™m scared. Because I donâ€™t really want to die, but my intrusive thoughts keep telling me to. And I donâ€™t know what to do.
