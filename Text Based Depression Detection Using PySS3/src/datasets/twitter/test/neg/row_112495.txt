Cut myself profusely while drunk on my fathers birthday.Iâ€™m really embarrassed to say this but I literally slashed  myself with a Bowie shaped knife on my left arm. Itâ€™s my dads birthday today. 
Iâ€™m 21 and still living at my parents place while I go to college. Iâ€™m still pretty drunk atm. Idk how much whiskey I drank. All I know is Iâ€™ve had a bad day. While Iâ€™ve been playing poker with my family I lost and I donâ€™t know why but I decided to repetitiously cut my arm with a knife. I canâ€™t even bother to count how many cuts Iâ€™ve made. My dad walked into my room to see my whole arm bleeding and I tried to tell him sorry. He works in medicine so he helped me clean everything up but Iâ€™m worried about the cuts on my forearm showing. I felt like I finally just broke and went crazy. 
What we both knew and talked about was the stress about my cousin visiting. My cousin molested me and my sister when I was about 7 years old. I didnâ€™t think it bothered me until today. Iâ€™ve been depressed for at least 7 years (Iâ€™m 21 now). I cut myself when my family told me he was visiting but I kept it a secret. After all, it wasnâ€™t the first time I cut my arm. I havenâ€™t seen him the whole time he has visited because Iâ€™ve requested it so.

Iâ€™m just at my breaking point. I feel crazy and I feel alone... idk what to say.
