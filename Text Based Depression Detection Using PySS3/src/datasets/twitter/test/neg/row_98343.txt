I just want to die and stop being a burdenI'm tired of being a burden on everyone around me.

I'm trans, and no matter what I do in life, I won't be able to pass.  My appearances put a strain on every single relationship I've ever had.  I lost most of my friends, and my family detests me.  

My family was letting me stay with them until I graduated college, but I ended up dropping out almost a year ago at this point and I haven't been able to find a job or anything.  I pretend to go to college every day, but I don't.

As soon as they figure it out (May at the latest, when I was supposed to graduate), they'll throw me out and I'll be homeless, unable to keep transitioning, and unemployed.

I feel like I should just get it over with now instead of having to go through all of that and having to put my family through the trouble of throwing me out when I'm the issue.
