Realistically, how long would it take someone to notice my disappearance and decide to take action?I think about suicide ever day. Hardly a moment goes by when I canâ€™t link something I said or did to wanting to kill myself. I have a plan and the necessary tools ready for me when I so choose. Iâ€™m looking at this methodically - Iâ€™m not going to kill myself in a emotionally charged rage. This isnâ€™t something you want to half-ass. So the ball is in my court. 

Anyway, realistically how long would it take people to notice Iâ€™m gone? 

All my rent and bills are being been paid via autopay so no one would come knocking on my door anytime soon. I could be a rotting corpse in my apartment for months and months and no one would know the difference. Minus the gun shot but thatâ€™s besides the point.

I donâ€™t have any friends so I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anyone stopping by. I doubt the few people I talk to over Snapchat, etc. would even bother finding out where I went if they even realized I was gone in the first place. 

For my family, I talk to them pretty regularly so they would be the first to question as to why I wasnâ€™t returning their calls. If I wanted to prolong their worrying, I could lie and tell them I was going to be busy with work and wouldnâ€™t be able to really get to my phone for some time. But they would look for me after probably a week. I wish I was distant from them. I really want to save them from the trauma of discovering that I killed myself. If they didnâ€™t care this would make everything so much easier. 

Work would probably be later. But I have enough PTO saved up that I could easily take two weeks off and schedule myself at the end of the third week. And when I donâ€™t show up, maybe they would figure out where I went? Idk I give it three/four weeks tops before they try and find me.

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m thinking about all this. I guess Iâ€™m just curious of how much impact my life really is for people and if Iâ€™m truly a insignificant and invisible as I believe myself to be.
