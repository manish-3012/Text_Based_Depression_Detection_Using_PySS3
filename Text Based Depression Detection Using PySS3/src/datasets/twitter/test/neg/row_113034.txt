Crying on a bench in the cityI feel so alone and helpless. I attend music school, which is intensive and requires many hours of practice that I just can't do. How am I supposed to go through college and complete assignments when I hate myself more than anything? 

My emotions are getting the best of me. I can't go to class because I can't stop crying. I just think about how much of a colossal loser I am and it just goes south from there. I used to be on meds but they made me throw up all the time so I stopped cold turkey

How am I supposed to be successful when I know for a fact that I cannot keep going? I can't take much more of this whole life thing. Been having some seriously harmful thoughts. I've never felt this low before. People look down upon me now. "That kid who can't hold it together"

Idk what to do
