No income soon.I'm a failure. A homeless, disabled Hawaiian trans girl with less than 200 dollars in the bank with 33k debt with no education except for a GED

I might lose my. Job tomorrow.

I cried in my car all day. I disown my family and I don't have any friends being 29.

I thought I had a second chance at life with this job but I'm afraid I'll be terminated by the end of tomorrow for accidentally hitting a concrete barrier with a trailer.

I grabbed all my personal belongings and put them back in my car (house). I don't wanna die without them. They're the only things I can say it's mine.

I don't believe in God but I do believe in a balanced universe. 

Moved to a new location for this job. Thought I had something good happening. â˜¹ï¸
