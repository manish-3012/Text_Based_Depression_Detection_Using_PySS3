Im don't want to be here anymoreI can't do this anymore, i live in a toxic house,i work in a toxic environment,  i don't have friends, i literally contemplate suicide 24/7. These violent day dreams just get worse. Ive had 10 attempts and 8 hospitalizations and nothing works or helps, been on literally countless medications and treatments. Ive struggled with major depression,severe anxiety,  and eating disorders for 14 years. Im more afraid of my next attempt fucking me up and causing permanent damage but not killing me. Im in a suicidal limbo. I keep my suicide note in my wallet just in case i come across the perfect opportunity at the perfect time. Im sick of how the world operates and im sick of  what seems an abundance of assholes in the world that surround me. I don't see my worth, my purpose,my meaning. I don't see any evidence supporting that my situation will get better. But soooo much evidence proving that things will most likely get worse. I don't have a lick of self esteem, i don't have confidence and im becoming careless and started dissocoating. I really just want to fucking die and i don't know what to do...
