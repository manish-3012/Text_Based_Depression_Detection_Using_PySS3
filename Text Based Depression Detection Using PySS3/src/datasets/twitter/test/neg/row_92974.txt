Don't want to live anymore.I'm 23 and right now I'm thinking about ending my life. It's not that I have aparticularly bad life. I just don't want to live anymore.. I don't feel any happiness or sadness.. I don't feel any fear or anger.. I just don't feel anything.. Each and every day I am just going through the motions.. There is nothing I look forward to in life.. I don't want to look forward to anything... The only and only thing stopping me is my family and my girlfriend.. But at this point.. I've cause so much dissapointment and hurt to them and I don't want to do that anymore.. They don't know any of this.. I don't know how to tell them that I don't want to live anymore.. I just don't want anything in life.. There is nothing for me here.. In case any of my friends comes across this post.. Please let my parents know that I love them so very much.. And I am sorry for being such a dissapointment..
