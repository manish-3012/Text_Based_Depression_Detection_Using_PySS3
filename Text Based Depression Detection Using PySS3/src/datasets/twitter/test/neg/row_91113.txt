I think Iâ€™m finally done.I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for years. I have failed attempts due to cowardice, and honestly I think Iâ€™m finally ready.  

I typed out my letter, and now Iâ€™m just sitting here thinking over and over about this. I truly do not think I can continue on, I am absolutely miserable, negative and overall I cannot look at myself in the mirror any more. I truly think this is it.
