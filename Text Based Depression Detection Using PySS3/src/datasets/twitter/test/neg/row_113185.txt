I'm tired of lifeI have never cared for life. I never had any passions or any desire to do much more than staying at home and not do anything.

I am in my first year of college, and I'm just feeling like it's not worth it. I hate it all, I don't have energy to do any assignments, and most importantly, I don't really want to.

I can't see a future for myself, I feel like I'll either end up becoming homeless or I'll live the rest of my life with my family supporting my laziness, something that I don't really want to happen. I feel pathetic and worthless.

I feel like I'm just going through life, doing what other people want me or expect me to do. But I don't really know any other way to live, because I've never felt the motivation to do anything else. 

I feel like I'm rambling and not making much sense, but my point is, I don't think life is for me, if that makes sense. I just don't care about anything, I never have and I don't think I ever will. But the pressure and stress I feel everyday to do something with my life to not disappoint others is too big, and I hate it. I've made a couple attempts to end my life, but even that seems like it's too hard for me to do.

I honestly just spend every day hoping life will be over soon, one way or another. I don't really care how, I just want to stop living. I don't want to keep feeling like this every day, it's too much for me.
