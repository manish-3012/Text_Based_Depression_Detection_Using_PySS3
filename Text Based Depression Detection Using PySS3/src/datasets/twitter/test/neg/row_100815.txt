FEAR IS LITERALLY GOING TO KILL MEIM GOING TO BE HOMELESS I KNOW IT; everyone around me is telling me that iâ€™m not saying what i want with my life and how im not taking little steps bit i cant take no steps if everything they say could have double meaning. Iâ€™m thinking i might either become psychotic and/or homeless and thereâ€™s nothing i can do about it even if i tried. I want to see the positive but my thoughts keep pushing me and i keep snapping out. I odâ€™ed didnt do much i can barely stop myself from living anymore bc thereâ€™s no going back anyways. Everyone rejects me im already dead basically. Even if i didnt become homeless i wouldnâ€™t be able to get back on my feet. Iâ€™m a mess. Let me just surrender to dead it canâ€™t be worse than being so scared of everything in life. Itâ€™s not ok to live terrified of living everyday ( i have pdd-nos), i really would be better off not having to worry anymore
