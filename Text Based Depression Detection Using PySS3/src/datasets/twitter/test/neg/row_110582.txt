FriendsAll of my friends including me are all suicidal and depressed. It fucking hurts to see them go down spiraling into self hatred and further pushing others down a collison course to out other friends. It fucking hurts to see the people you care about get treated like abysmal garbage and are hurt, beaten and physical and verbal abuse. It most definitely fucking hurts to have your best friend completely back stab you and try to ruin your relationships and reputation. 

I was fucking with you through thick and thin and this is how you fucking pay me back. I was with you when everyone was against you, when you were at your witts' end helping you through a metric fuck ton of problems. Now I hate your guts more than anything in this god forsaken planet. I remember a time when I still cared for you. I cant believe you would fucking do this. More than 7 times have I stuck with you through every one of your problems and breakdowns. When you had the smallest, little inkling of a problem. When it wasnt even a fucking problem you fucking dramatic bitch. I helped you. You said you would change time and time again, with your half-assed apologies and fake as fuck tears. I used to be really happy with you and all that wholesome shit. A few months ago it just got too fucking hard for my little fucking mind to handle. I gave you one last chance to finally better yourself and you squandered it. 

Tiresome 
It got so fucking tiring and annoying to here your whore mouth yap on and on. You were toxic and irritating. You could fix those 'problems' in 5 fucking seconds if you actually put your mind to it. Chance and chance again I yearned for breaking things off. But everyone else were still hopeful for change. They were wrong.

Peace
I was so relieved when you said to me those magical words "goodbye". It felt like an abysmally large weight was lifted from my chest. No more drama, no more fights. Just peace. It was hard with our other friends not wanting to break it off. For those few last months I yearned for you to slip up one more time. So I could show you how much of a horrible person you were being. Childish, fucking retarded, idiotic, prideful, weak, scared and an asshole. I almost fucking killed you. Be grateful for our friends being more than generous and helpful. I urged them to get out like I did. But their compassion over powered their common sense. They were so commendable yet fucking idiotic. 

You hurt us a lot and yet they still care for you.

Shits getting numb.
