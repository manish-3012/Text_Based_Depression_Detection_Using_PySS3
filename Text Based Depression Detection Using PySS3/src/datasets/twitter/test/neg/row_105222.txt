Just woke upToday was the day I finally decided to quit putting off and finally hang myself, specially since the roommate is away. Took a shoelace fixed a taut-line and secured it to the doorframe, then just let my body go limp. It was maybe a minute, minute and a half before I started to fall asleep on the line.  Obviously, things didn't go to plan, else I wouldn't be writing this fucking post. Next thing I know, I'm slouched over on my knees, head pressed against the wall - turns out the fucking shoelace snapped. It was a lot less scary than I was anticipating, interestingly enough I actually felt.. euphoric maybe? I don't know how to feel after all that.. ya know, I used to be one of those "how do you fail at suicide?" types, but I'm not ready to give it another go right now. I'm sure it's gonna be fun explaining why I have bruising around my neck, if it does actually discolor. Fuck me.
