TrappedI'm locked in a room, been here for days after waking in the icu due to an overdose. I feel hopeless and trapped. They are supposed to be getting me help finding me a mental health facility. Instead I am being watched 24/7 sitting in a room with no escape and the time is mving in slow motion. My life outside these walls is falling apart. My boyfriend of 3 years texted me after I woke in the hospital to say he is done and cannot deal with my mental health anymore and that he is moving all of his things out. I sit here trying to take my mind off of the things that brought me here and the sadness that awaits me when I leave but every second I'm stuck feels like hours. There's no end in sight of when I will be let go or get actual help because health and welfare are dragging their feet. Being in here is making me more and more deppressed and I feel like I'm going to go crazy just sitting here as my life deteriorates.
