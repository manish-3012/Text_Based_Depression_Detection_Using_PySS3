I've decided my profession isn't for me. Too bad I wasted so much time and money pursuing it.I'm teaching college students and I just did an absolutely horrible job this morning. I taught so bad that I honestly feel like I shouldn't be teaching anymore. I spent so much time trying to become a teacher, and today I realized I'm just terrible at it.

I thought I would like it. I thought I would be good at it. But after six months of teaching, I realized I shouldn't be doing it.

The massive depression and anguish from today from my horrible lesson plan seriously is making me want to jump from a nearby tall building. Or go to Home Depot and buy some rope.

I have no will to go on right now. No motivation to finish the week out. All I really feel like this evening is just ending it all.
