I donâ€™t even knowI canâ€™t believe how bad Iâ€™ve gotten over the past few years. My legs are covered in scars and I canâ€™t stop drinking. Iâ€™ve pushed away all of my interpersonal relationships and hobbies and goals and I just donâ€™t care anymore. I have a good old Gatorade/Prestone cocktail that I canâ€™t throw down because of the fucking bitter agent they put in the antifreeze. 
I have an appointment with my psychologist in two days and I think I need to come clean already. Iâ€™m just too afraid of being sent to a psych ward and seeing the looks on my parentâ€™s faces.
