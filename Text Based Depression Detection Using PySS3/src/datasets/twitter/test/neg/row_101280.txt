If suicide were a solution, I'd take it, but I know it is not, and now I feel even more stuck.I have never been suicidal, but I think about suicide all the time. I do not believe in the self and thus I feel that if I killed my"self", I wouldn't be helping "my" problems because I do not exist in a vacuum, but would instead just be bringing more harm to the world at large.

I feel like everyone is lost, broken, and lonely. I was given every head start in the world (well-off, white, male, loving family, great health... etc. etc.) and I STILL can't seem to figure things out. I went to the top school in the country and graduated 2 years ago. Since then, I just feel like a total failure. I can't seem to be content or happy, I can't seem to find something fulfilling to do with my time, I don't feel like I have any friends since all my old friends drifted away to the far corners of the globe to live their own lives and the new ones I have tried to make just don't seem to click.

Life feels like a chore. Life feels like taxes and bills. I am not having fun. I try REALLY hard to be happy. I exercise a TON. I eat exceptionally healthy. I have tried going to a therapist. I meditate and practice yoga daily. I read lots of books that offer different life perspectives. I make changes when I notice patterns in my life that are causing me problems. I travel. I have a girlfriend.

I am not sure what I am trying to convey here. Life has just felt like constant problem-solving. It just feels like it takes so much effort. I can find peace and stability through yoga, meditation, exercise, and healthy eating, but it just feels like it takes enormous strength on my part to put together a day that feels happy and it drains me to do this day after day. It is hard not to feel discouraged when I live the most privileged life I can imagine. Like if I can't make it, how will anyone else? I feel like life is a constant slog to get out of negativity and that everywhere I look in the world, I feel hopeless. I have put a lot of thought into trying to build a fulfilling life, but just don't feel like anyone could genuinely convince me that life is worth living more than an obligation. I feel like I have thought myself into a corner.

I don't want to kill myself and never would attempt to kill myself, but I would rather that I had never existed. I look forward to sleeping every night so that I don't have to be awake.
