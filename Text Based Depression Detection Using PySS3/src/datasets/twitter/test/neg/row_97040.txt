2020 has been the worst year of my life, and I'm scared now. (Please, just listen to me.)Before I start, in case you don't know me yet, I am 17M, about 2.5 weeks until I turn 18M, straight white, autistic, atheist, and possible misanthrope.

Over 2020, I have considered myself a romantically- **(and sexually-** ***\[yes, I know I'm young, but honesty!\]*****)** \-frustrated individual. I haven't kissed a girl in 2 years, and I've just missed that sensation. It just felt so...blissful. Sexual energy flows through me uncontrollably, and I don't have a proper means of controlling it. *(Truth be told, that was really uncomfortable to write.)* I also don't think I have any real friends.

Also, to sum up my suicidal tendencies, I *am* suicidal, but I don't want to die. *(I have thanatophobia.)*

Anyway, that aside, in late February, I realized how insignificant I am in this hell that we call "home."

That this world WILL end one day. And there's nothing I can do about it.

I also realized that everyone I love will die one day. And I'll be left to fend for myself, which I am incapable of doing due to my autism that prevents me from learning how to perform adult activities normally.

I hate the life that I was given.

I hate the disgusting society that I live in.

I fear that I'm going delirious. Insane. Maniacal.

...what is wrong with me? What is this feeling? Is it fear? Hatred?

Or is it...*something worse?*

I want and need **all** the advice you people can give me.

I'm at my breaking point.

**I don't want to suffer anymore.**

I just want to be a normal person!

*P. S.: I'm super-sorry if this looks like a simple rant, a cry for attention or something straight out of NoSleep. I really am!*

*P. P. S.: I took* ***over two hours*** *to make all of this sound reasonable to you all. Please, PLEASE be kind.*

*P. P. S. S.: If you have no advice, that's A-OK. Just try to cheer me up or something.*
