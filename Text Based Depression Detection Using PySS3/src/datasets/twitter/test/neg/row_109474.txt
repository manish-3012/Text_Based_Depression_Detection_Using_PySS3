2012! I don't know why I wanted to expose myself to ct scans so bad.Well, I knew CT scans and xrays would give me cancer. So I think either the medications, the hospitalizations, and the hospitals gave me my wish. I'm bi-polar type 1 with psychotic features. I cannot function very well anymore because I've been overdosed on so many medications. I think the 3 ct scans and over 10 xrays have induced cancer in me. Plus I have a history of self-harm in a more medical aspect. Honestly I wish my mom would put me in hospice. The HMO I have is really crappy so I have to do my own research. I've tried to contact the fbi and other disability advocates but I've been bullied into submission where I feel trapped in a corner. I'm done with the xrays and I'm done with the bullshit. I wish I could be sent to some labratory and be torn apart and made into some kind of cyborg. I really don't give a shit about my body parts anymore. Like some kind of transhuman person. Not some mentally retard. I think I can be euthanized any other way it would be cancer and diseases and drug abuse. But what sucks is that most of these hospitals could care less and they just use big pharma drugs to conduct research as to how people react to certain medications.
