Im a cowardI'm feeling low today. Woke up with nothing but that desire to self harm and bleed out until I don't have to face the world any more. 

I'm just such a coward. I'm too scared to make it permanent. I know I'll have a good day again soon, but I'll also have so many bad days. It would just be so much easier if I had the strength to end things.
