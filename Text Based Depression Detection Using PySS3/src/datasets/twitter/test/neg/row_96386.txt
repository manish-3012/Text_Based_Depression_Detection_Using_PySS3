My fiancee is very depressed and wants to kill herselfI dont know what to do.  Right now we are in different parts of the world and am unable to help her.  The only thing i have is my phone and video calling...its driving me nuts that she wont listen to logic, seek help, or anything.  What can i do to help her? She has anxiety, and severe depression.  She has nobody that she can talk to, and i am the only one she hasnt pushed out of he life...i need so help.  This situation is currently going on as i type this and need immediate help.  Thank you to anyone that can help.
