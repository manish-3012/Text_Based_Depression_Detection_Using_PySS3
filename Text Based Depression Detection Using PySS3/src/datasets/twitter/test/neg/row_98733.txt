Some advice for you allAbout a year ago I posted that I felt like a failure who wouldnt do anything with my life, expected to head to a dead end job after high school and kill myself. I am now a year older and in my junior (almost senior year) of high school. 

I am going to college during my senior year to study in a field that I love and get a job im pretty sure ill love while being paid well. I never expected this just a year before and just want to say to all of you that things do get better, and life will be rough and hard but it gets better i promise.  Keep going and trucking through because life is worth it.
