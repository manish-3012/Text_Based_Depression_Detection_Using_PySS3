Can we for once look at what we can try for our situation?Don't get me wrong, I really want to die too and when I'm at my lowest, all I want to do is just get out of this whole reality but I also happened to be one of those people who are procrastinating on killing myself.

This subreddit is great to rant or let out those feelings but can we for once talk about suggestions on how to make baby steps? It's not possible to get out of this mental rut but I think we as a community understands the struggle best and it would be good to know what worked and how we can learn from those who tried. 

I know people who doesn't understand what we experience make dumb statements like "call the hot line" or "just do it, why cant you just do it" but I don't expect them to understand either. It's not on them for being wired differently just like how it's not on us to not have the ability to function the same way normal people do.
