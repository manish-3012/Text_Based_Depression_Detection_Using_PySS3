Donâ€™t you love when you try talking to someone about how you want to kill yourself... only for them to tell you that you only care about yourself...Real great. I never reach out for help and when I try to this is what I get. Before this, I asked another person to hang out with me and literally told them Iâ€™ve been wanting to jump off a bridge all day and could use a friend... they tell me â€œsure, we can hang outâ€ and then two minutes later say â€œactually Iâ€™m going to my boyfriends tonightâ€ and then proceed to ask me for a favor. 

 Cool. Thanks. All I wanted was someone to talk to.....
