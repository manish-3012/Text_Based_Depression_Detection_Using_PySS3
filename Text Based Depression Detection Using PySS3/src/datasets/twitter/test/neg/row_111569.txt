I promised myself 10 months ago that I wouldn't kill myself unless I couldn't change even one thing between then and now, the end of the year. Nothing has changed. In February I was going to kill myself. I got scarred after trying and called a friend who made me make the above promise. I tried to change. I went back to school. Made A's without trying and learned nothing. I tried to look for a different job. No luck. I got on anti-depressants and i just feel like i'm balanced on a seesaw. I tried dating and came up used and feeling empty. I hate myself and my life and I just don't see a point to the struggle anymore.
