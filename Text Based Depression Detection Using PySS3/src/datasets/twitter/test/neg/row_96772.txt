The urge to end it has been really strong these past couple of weeks. Donâ€™t worry Iâ€™m not gonna do anything for nowIâ€™m so over it, I donâ€™t want help anymore, Iâ€™ve been to like 4 or 5 therapists already. I have no friends or family. I have my mom but sheâ€™s not really there. And sheâ€™s heard it over a thousand times so itâ€™s getting old at this point. When I did reach out for help I got constantly invalidated and Iâ€™ve been feeling this way  since I was 11, Iâ€™m a teen now almost an adult. Iâ€™m not a good person anyways so it wouldnâ€™t really matter if Iâ€™m dead or alive. You guys donâ€™t have to say anything itâ€™s just me venting cause I always keep my feelings in for the benefit of others.
