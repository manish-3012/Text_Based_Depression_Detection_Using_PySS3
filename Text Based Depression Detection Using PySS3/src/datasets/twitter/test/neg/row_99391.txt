I feel aloneI wish someone care enough about me to check on me no one cares i feel alone i feel like dying i try to be happy i really do but its hard im flunking out of college i just decide to stop attending my classes i been having suicidal thoughts a lot more recently my mom is tired of hearing me i dont want to burden my family my friends have suddenly decided to stop hanging out with me and talking to me but they all hangout with each other and not me i know this because i see it all over social media im wondering why maybe its because im boring or i have nothing special about i know i wont be miss if i go away and die i wake up sad go to sleep sad i dont really want to eat anymore i eat a little everyday i cant tell anyone this because i dont want to seem crazy or be labeled as something im not  i wish i can tell my friends i miss them but i might come off weird or desperate or something no one know this about me. I need someone to talk to i hate feeling this way i do i dont want to feel this way maybe im the problem it has to be something i did to cause this i dont know why my friends dont want to hangout with me anymore
