Should I tell her?Should I tell my girlfriend I'm scared I'm going attempt suicide again? I have no one else to to go to. I want to die but I also can't stand the thought of her being with someone else.

(if you've read my past post history, she's referred to as male, my girlfriend recently came out as gender fluid).
