i honestly think i have the strength to exit bag and im not surprised and that freaks me out.i wanted to see what it would be like when i would go out and get helium to do it so i tried breathing in a garbage bag until i got light headed, typing this with a splitting headache. i got a doctors appointment and im not sure if im going to tell him that, i dont want to be in the horror story of being locked up for 72 hours, whats that going to do for me beyond wanting to do it even more. fuck
