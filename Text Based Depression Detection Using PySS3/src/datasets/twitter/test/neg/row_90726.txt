I feel detached and lost.I've struggled with depression and I've battled through times where I was suicidal before. I experience crashes about once a month and they tend to last about a week. When I recover I feel absolutely drained emotionally and physically for about 2 weeks. I don't recall feeling genuinely happy, I've had good days but I really can't remember a period of my life where I felt a slight bit of happiness and comfort. 

Anyways, about 4-5 months ago I started feeling detached, almost like I am watching other people live and I'm just a spectator. I have a really tough time enjoying music now because it doesn't move me emotionally like it used to. 

Everyday I'm at work and I always wonder why the hell am I even there. I don't hate my job, I just wonder why i voluntarily go there every morning. I feel as tho I am lost in Limbo and can't get out. I don't cry anymore, I don't smile anymore, I don't drink anymore, I don't smoke anymore, and its not like I quit all of those, I just sorta forgot I did all these things. 

At this point in my life, Its not a matter of 'IF" anymore, its a matter of when. I'm not even sad at the moment, but if I had a gun near me I could pull the trigger and not feel any emotion, or at least that's the way It feels. I am completely lost and stuck in this parallel universe it seems.

Has anyone ever experienced this?
