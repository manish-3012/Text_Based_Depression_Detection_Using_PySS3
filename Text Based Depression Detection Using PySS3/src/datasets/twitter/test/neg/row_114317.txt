End of my ropeI am a woman in her late 30s and I am ready to die. I always wanted to have my own children. My husband and I tried but it turns out I have severe stage IV endometriosis. Hahaha, I never knew and donâ€™t have a family history of it. I tried IVF and it just made my endometriosis worse and now after never having pain before from it I have pain. I had surgery for it and it only wiped out my ovarian reserve. Iâ€™ve never gotten along with my brother. I tried for years (20 years) to have a positive relationship with him. Heâ€™s never reciprocated. He has never even called or texted me. He is a wack job. But a wack job who got more of my parentâ€™s love and still does. He was the star quarterback and valedictorian. Everyone loves him. Heâ€™s intentionally chosen not to have a relationship with me and I donâ€™t know why. No one questions it. His wife ironically has severe endometriosis but they got pregnant their first try. Hahaha. His wife told me I havenâ€™t been positive enough and thatâ€™s why it didnâ€™t work for me. I prefer to die than live this shit hand Iâ€™ve been dealt. I am full of anger and rage. I am leaning toward opiate overdose or gun.
