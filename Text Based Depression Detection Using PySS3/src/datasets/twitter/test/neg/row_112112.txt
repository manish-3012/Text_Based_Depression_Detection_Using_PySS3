I can't trust people anymore and I don't want to fight.This guy that I really liked and for once really trusted left me for some girl who's a million times better than me. I don't even care about the guy specifically. I'm just upset that I lost somebody who I thought I could trust. But he just ended up using my insecurities against me. I hurt him but he didn't loose anything because of it. Yet he hurt me 100x over and I still would forgive him. 

I'm with someone else now. But I don't see people the same way. They are dangerous. Letting them know things about you if just leaving yourself open for an attack. I don't trust the new guy. I like him but I don't really feel anything towards him. He's nice though. 

I didn't really trust people before but I think this was just the last straw.
I don't want to be around people anymore. I'm scared of what they might do. 

I don't know if I can live in a world like this. Afraid all the time. Lonely. I have friends but they feel so distant even when I'm right next to them. I can't see people the same way. I just want everything to shut off. If my life ends after a while people will move on. 

When I get really depressed I imagine myself in a field all alone with nobody to hurt me. And I'm happy. I don't want to hurt anybody and I don't want anybody to hurt me. I want to feel okay again.
