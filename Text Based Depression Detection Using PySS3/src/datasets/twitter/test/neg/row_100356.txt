Excited to diePosted before saying my plans. My pre determined date draws nearer &amp; my anticipation is overwheming! Im more excited for this day then i am for christmas haha. Some family knows &amp; friends know. They're not so thrilled about it but hey, the world keeps turning either way. Have divided up belongings &amp; personal items to be given to close people based on what has meaning &amp; is most relevant to them &amp; our relationship/friendship. Unfortunately got myself in a situation with no escape which has rendered me a life not worth living. Just too much to ask of a human being. Trying to enjoy my last month..ish but has proven to be impossible. I'm only happy thinking about how i get to finally leave the living hell that is my existence. I am excited to die.
