when Iâ€™m drunk, I really want to kill myselfI feel so unloved and unwanted. I just want to die. Itâ€™s really late here and I know no one cares. I really wish this pain could end. Why is it so much worse when Iâ€™m drunk? Usually itâ€™s better but now I feel like no one wants me. God, this is painful
