I've had enough of being aliveHi, i'm using a throwaway account since some people know about my other account. Also forgive me for spelling/grammar errors since English isn't my first language. Let me introduce myself first, i'm a 15 year old guy with no life. I've been struggling with depression for a while now and recently i started having a lot of panic attacks. School is going really shit right now. Don't really have any friends anymore except a few from school since my parents won't allow me to go outside anymore. The reason i can't go outside is because i used to do drugs, nothing hard just some weed and sometimes a drink. I didn't even do it because i liked it, i just wanted to be with my friends. Ever since i lost the privilege to talk to them my life has been going to shit (sorry for the language but it's true). I don't get any enjoyment out of anything so the only thing i'll be doing is either studying, sleeping or eating. Tried to do some new things but i just can't find a reason to do something. I'm studying a lot so i can go to a university and get out of here so i can finally get my freedom back. But due to recent events i'll probably have to redo my year. I can't handle that. I'll lose the only friends i'll have and i probably won't be able to make new ones because of my social anxiety and autism. I'm just so tired and i've really been thinking about killing myself. I don't want to go to school anymore. I don't want to be at home. Can't go anywhere else. I just lock myself in my room every day when i come home. I'll wait till the end of the school year and i'll see if i passed or not.

If i don't that will be the last straw

I just can't deal with this hell

I also feel like a piece of shit because a lot of people on this sub have it a lot worse and i've got struggles with these minor problems.
