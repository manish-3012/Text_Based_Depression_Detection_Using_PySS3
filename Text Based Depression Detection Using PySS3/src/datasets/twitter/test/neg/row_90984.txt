I know the changing of the seasons is comingI know it because my antidepressants aren't working well and I keep wanting to go to the hardware store and get some rope, I think it might be the perfect time of the season to do it since people might see me hanging and think I'm a realistic Halloween decoration.

My energy levels aren't really there and I feel like garbage might be too good of a word to describe myself at times. I still try to fix my current situation but with the changing of the season, it's getting difficult.

The upside in all of this has to be the fact that I recognize what's causing all this. Winter is coming and my depression is telling me how close it is. It's time to find a way to counter this depression.

Even with winter around the corner I got to look ahead, this is just my mind fucking with me. I recognize the situation and now I have some clues as to how to counter it.
