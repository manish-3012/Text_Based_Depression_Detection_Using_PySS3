I can bare the prospect of living no more than the obligation to not leave a mess and my family a wrrck.Feels like im between a rock and a hard place. I would like for some freak accident just to claim me so my apathy and feelings of inadequacy dont drive me to cause undue grief for those i will leave behind. 

I'm going to work out getting a new passport so maybe i'll just run away. But i cant be sure i wont think of something in the meantime. Razors in the bath or neckties in the closet would be too jarring a sight for a loved one who comes around to check on me. I think a tall building or a train encounter would be better, except for the poor innocents in the vicinity. Honestly the instantaneous relief of a bullet would have delivered me already, everyone else be damned. 

Years of untreated depression and anxiety, perhaps borderline personality disorder, plus a career ending legal fuckup and few friends. Wasted money on a worthless degree, and so working for peanuts while facing a mountain of legal hoops and fines. I cant contribute anything that ten other people couldnt do better, what's the point?
