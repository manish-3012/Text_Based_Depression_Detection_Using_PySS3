I can't do thisIts funny how our entire world runs around a little piece of paper.
Let me get to the point I don't want to waste anyone's time.
My real name is Simeon Olegov Ivanov( I hate my last 2 names), I was born in Bulgarian back in 1994.
Truth is I have not been really happy for the past 3-5 years, I have had the bad luck to have a series of bad events alter who I was, how I think and what I have become.
I tried to be a good person, but the world is not a big fan of that.
Three years ago I met a girl called Venny Ge, she was my 1st big love and after about 10 months of love she just dumpes me out of no where, later I find out she is back with her ex and that she has blocked me from everywhere.
My father is what I call a poor excuse for a human being,
When I was about 15 my mother got a promotion in Dubai and she left us, a few months later she told my father she wanted a divorce and that she would not ever be coming back, I was destroyed, I did not leave my room for a week.
But wait it gets better, my father because he was not able to pay bills anymore, went to work in germany, yes I was left alone, and he send me money to pay the bills and live on, the only problem is my father is a cheap piece of shit, he would usually send me about 450 leva if I was lucky, from those 450 leva, 200 go for rent, a 100 go for Utility bills , so in reallity I was left with a 150 leva which I would have to survive a whole month (buy food, go to school).
That was not something easy...
One time my father was late with the money for a week, and I had ran out of food for me and my cat, prety much all I had was a handful of rice which I shared with my cat (echi), that was for a whole day's ration.
The reason he was late was because he did not want to give extra money to the banks...
When the money did arrive and I bought food I fed my cat 1st, it had no right to suffer because of my father. 
Seeing as our money situation was bad and I did not want me or my cat to starve any more I asked my father if my mother had send some money.
My father lied to me that she had not send 1 lev, in reality my father keep the money and did not send it to me so that I would start to hate my mother (which did happen).
The money problem became so bad one month that I did something I was not proud of, I used photoshop to forge a payment for the rent, I was well aware it was only a matter of time before it was found out but I would not have survived if I didn't do it. A few months later my father came home found out about the forge, tried to beat me but when he was I got a baseball bat he just left the room and I kneeled on the floor and cried.
My relationship with my mother got better due to the fact that I started talking to her and asked her why did she not send money and has just left us like this,  she told me she had send money every month, money that was supposed to go to me, it was at that point that I began to see what my father actually is.

I finished high school and my mother came to Bulgaria for that even and we all talked what I was going to do now.
I told them I was going to study Art in the Netherlands.
They agreed it was a good decision and we spoke how we would pay for this, My father would pay the rent and 200 euro for living, My mother would pay the university and 200 euro for living.
And so it happened I came to the Netherlands and began to study I met some really amazing people and for a time things were good.

Untill I reallized I did not pick the right study for me and I quit it.
At which point I started looking for a new study that would better suit me, fun fact my father does not make little money, my father bought a tv,  a house ,  and land all while I was in University, I am telling you this because my father did not like the idea of paying for me and told me get a job or come back to Bulgaria, that does not sound that bad right, so I started looking and a week later my father told me Im not paying for you anymore, I will pay your rent one was that but and I quote " DO NOT WANT MONEY FROM ME ANYMORE".
Keep in mind I felt horrible that my parent would be paying this much for  me and they both knew it, I felt like a burden, and after hearing those words from my father well yeah...
I did try and find a job and I am still looking but I know only english and well the Netherlands want me to know dutch.

Its come to a point where I can no longer handle what life keeps throwing at me and killing myself actually looks really good, I will no longer have to deal with this retarded amount of bullshit, where my own father does not care about me or where I am in the middle between my parents.
I just can't do this anymore.
