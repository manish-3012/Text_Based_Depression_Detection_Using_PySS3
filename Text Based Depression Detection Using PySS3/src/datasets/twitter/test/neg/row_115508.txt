I thought my pregnancy was keeping me alive, now it feels like a reason to go.Two babies Iâ€™m trying to stay alive for until I give them up for adoption. But I donâ€™t know anymore. Theyâ€™re a product of sexual assault. Maybe.. give therapy a last try? But terrified theyâ€™ll just lock me up somewhere.
