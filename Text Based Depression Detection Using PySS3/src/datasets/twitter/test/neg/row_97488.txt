I feel like suicide is just the obvious choice instead of the irrational one...I've just run out of excuses for not killing myself. My self preservation instinct is just gone. There's nothing left but self-loathing and dread for the next day and the next. I self-medicate with food and exercise, which helps keep my mind off it for a short while, but it always comes back. I'm 30 and my life will never amount to anything; I'll never have an impact on the world. I'll die and no one will remember me. So why not just get it over with and finish the stupid thing now?
