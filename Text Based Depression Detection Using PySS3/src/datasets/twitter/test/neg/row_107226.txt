I think that I'm going to end my life today.Today is the day that I think I can't take it anymore. This week, I have lost my one true love, my adoptive family, three of my best friends, and my second home. I am 17. When I was 6 I was molested by my cousin, when I was 12 I was raped by a girl at my school, from 8-15 I was physically, and mentally abused by my father, last year I was sexually assaulted and raped by another girl, and yet none of that has felt worse than this.

I will start with what has happened this week: Me and my girlfriend were interested in having a threesome with this girl (whom is one of my best friends, and has been in love with me for over 3 years. Though I have never felt the same), and she convinced me to do it with her, and once we did we grew very attached, and protective over her, because our friends that we hung out with and stayed with us at our second home were trying to do the same thing with her, knowing how uncomfortable it made us. In response to their decision we decided to make her our girlfriend so they would stop, which succeeded but the both of us just wanted it to be us again, because neither of us had those kind of feelings towards her, but neither of us could break her like that. We didn't think much of it, but it was a constant problem because one of us would get upset or angry at the other thinking they were intentionally giving the other person more attention than the other. Then one night one of those two friends, who is a few years older than 18, stayed with me at my house and got very intoxicated. He sat on the couch and talked to me until one in the morning about how he has been trying to get with me and my girlfriends third person to dump our other best friend, and that he is a user, a meth addict, and only sees people as ways to get sex (It makes sense, because at least three girls have come out saying that he has raped them, or that he has tried raping them, and he also tried forcing himself onto me in school at one point), and that he is using our best friend who is under the age of consent, for sex, and a house to stay at because he is homeless. A few days ago I tried telling my love, and his girlfriend what he had said, and no one believed me, calling me a liar, saying that I only wanted to start things. So they kicked me out of the house for the night, I walked home in the rain for 6 miles in the dark because of them. Then the one friend who didn't want to own up to what he had said, had the audacity to tell my love that when she isn't around that I supposedly call her a bitch, and say that I hate her, and wish she was dead. I have never said or wished these things, it breaks my heart even thinking about it.
She believed him because of the night that they thought I was trying to start problems with everyone, and so she left me. I asked him why he would do this to me, in which he responded with threats of harming me, and killing me. Afterwards he went and told my adoptive mother (Who was just diagnosed with 3 heart diseases and problems), that I shouldn't be allowed back because I just wanted to start problems, and that she couldn't handle the stress anyways, which she agreed to.

So now I will never be able to see my adoptive mother before she dies most likely, I lost my one true love, which I love and care for more than anything else, I lost an adoptive father, uncle, aunt, brothers, sister, nephew, and a few of my best friends, all because a user doesn't want to stop using people. 

I don't think I can handle all of this..

(I'm sorry if this post is a complete shitfest. I can't think, or breathe, nor cease crying. All of my thoughts are pointing to killing myself right now.)
