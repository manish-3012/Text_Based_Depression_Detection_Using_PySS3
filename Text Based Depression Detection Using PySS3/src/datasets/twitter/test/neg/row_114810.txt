My ex girlfriend, the mother of my children, committed suicide on Wednesday night.She was self isolating from this shitty virus and was home alone for 10 days. She went quiet on facebook and wasn't messaging her mom who got concerned and called the police to her house where she was found.

Don't know how I'm going to tell the kids about this.

Don't know what to do with myself.
