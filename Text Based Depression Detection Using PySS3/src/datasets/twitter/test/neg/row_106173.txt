Drunk suicideI tried to stay sober for approximately 4 days and have already failed. Ive had severe issues with weed acid and alcohol for the last 2 years and its ruined my life and I just want to die. Its the only way to escape this hell. Couple all that with my financial woes, going through a breakup, and PTSD/psychosis symptoms/depression/anxiety/gender dysphoria and we've got a prime recipe for a statistic my dudes.

So I intend to ingest my entire pill bottle of Wellbutrin and go from there because honestly I'm supposed to go into my minimum wage job at Starbucks tomorrow at 7:30 am (its 10:30 pm) and I am just done. So done. So fatigued and dizzy and sad and I can't do it. I love you. Goodbye.
