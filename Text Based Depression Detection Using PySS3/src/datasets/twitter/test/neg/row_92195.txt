Can you trust your brain when it says "I'd never actually try it?"I've never attempted, I just think about it, and have done so for years.  Lately (extended period of unemployment) the thoughts are more frequent, and incorporate more reference to methods.  They come at "opportunistic" times; I pause to look down from bridges, high windows, and train platforms, and sometimes that triggers the consideration instead of the actual "reasons" doing so.

Of course then I go through the ritual of explaining why I don't get to actually do it like a parent rationalizing the refusal to buy candy for a disappointed child.  "Yeah, yeah, I know, I was only looking." 
 But I don't think I've ever crossed the threshold into real risk of attempt, and I can't imagine that I ever would.  When I do have the odd desperate breakdown (rather than a baseline level of debilitating but usual dread and misery) it comes with the understanding that it's just going to have to suck for a while and that's that.

I wonder though whether I should trust my own assessment of risk.  I wouldn't have guessed I'd be thinking through logistics much at all, and I am now.  I respond poorly enough to minor instability, how can I predict my reaction to something major happening?

Does anyone have experience moving between different states of certainty re: whether you'd attempt?  Or if there's professional wisdom on this I have not heard it, having never received treatment or diagnosis (thanks, privatized medicine, and also my inability to commit energy to finding treatment).
