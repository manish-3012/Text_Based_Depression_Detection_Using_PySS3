I'm done.I honestly don't know what I'm still doing here. Last year I've already attempted once and lucky enough no one even knew it was an attempt. I just ended up in a hospital. At any case, after that incident, I continued on... Just dealing day to day basis. I go to school and do my school work just because it entertains me. After that, I usually end up playing video games or chatting with a friend to keep myself cheered up and not think about it.

Lately the only friend I talk to has decided I don't exist. I feel like I'm just invisible and no one would even know I exist. So what stops me right now to not just end it? Before because I know my friend would wonder where the hell I am. Now, honestly... nothing. Nothing is keeping me from doing it.
