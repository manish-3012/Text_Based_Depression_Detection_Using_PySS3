I have an easy way out and I have not much reason not to take it. My husband is an addict and wants the drug more than me and the kids.  I'm depressed and just can't find it in me to give my best to the kids when he and I are on the outs, which is always because he doesn't care.  It would be so easy to go to sleep and not wake up.  While he struggles with addiction, I struggle with my old enemy, depression and suicidal ideation.  He doesn't care what he's doing to me or how close I am to calling my life a bust.  I can't live with someone who doesn't love me, but I can't live as a single mother, either.  Maybe my death would force him to get his shit together.  The kids would be better off without me, anyway.  I get short with them when he leaves us.  I am a bad mother.  No one else likes me, anyway.  Everyone has always said I was a shitty person.   He was supposed to love me and prove them wrong, but all he does is shit on our little family.
