I really want to kill myself.Iâ€™m questioning my long term relationship, I have no job, I have no friends or family to go to in my times of need, my physical and mental health is slowly deteriorating, and Iâ€™m just done with it. Years of going nowhere but down have made me hit my breaking point. Iâ€™ve been to hospitals and stayed in mental facilities, Iâ€™ve been in therapy and Iâ€™ve seen psychiatrists. Iâ€™ve exhausted just about every option I have and my life continues to drastically go downhill. Tonight I have been having an especially hard night, but I have no one to talk to to even just get my mind off of things. No friends, no family, and I couldnâ€™t even find someone on Reddit to talk to. If I canâ€™t even get one person online to wanna talk to me, what the fuck do I have to live for. I have seen zero improvement in my life in many years now. Iâ€™m exhausted and at this point, I think itâ€™s just time to call it quits and move onto whateverâ€™s waiting on the other side.
