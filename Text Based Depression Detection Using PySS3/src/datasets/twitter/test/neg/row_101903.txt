Got harassed and almost mugged, anxious and depressed alreadyTwo black guys and a hispanic guy pulled me aside off the street today and started saying I scuffed one of their shoes. I apologized and tried to leave but they atarting following and yelling at me. This made me nervous because there were people around but not really that close. I was heading to my girlfriends apartment too so I couldn't ask her to come out and let me in as I obviously didnt want to get her involved. 

They stopped me from leaving, yelling at me "his shoes cost 200$ what do yours cost?" I was guessing they were going to try and take my shit in "compensation" for his shoes. I didnt have any weapons or a way to leave, so I called 911. All the while they are just standing there stopping me from leaving and making fun of me for calling 911. Then a couple showed up walked me away from them, and stood in their way as they were trying to follow me. 

The worst part is that I was going grocery shopping a little high, and was coming back from it so it just felt 99999x more dangerous and scary. So when the officer showed up I was in tears. Feel so stupid about getting high.

I just dont feel like I'm being a man. On one hand I know it was a scary thing to happen and I know a lot of it was getting high affecting my emotions, but choking up in front of the officer was just shameful. Then I had to see my girlfriend right after and that was even worse. I know it was the weed that caused a lot of that reaction, but being in my early 20s as a man I just could have handled that decision a lot better. I feel like a coward, and weak... and did it in front of my girlfriend. It doesn't feel like real life. 

I've been really depressed and suicidal this past year and it got really fucking bad last year. It-s been so hard just to do basic things.This is just sending me over the edge. I can't handle how hopeless and shitty I feel. 

I'm nervous about leaving this apartment right now, it only happened a couple hours ago and I'm still having panic attacks.
