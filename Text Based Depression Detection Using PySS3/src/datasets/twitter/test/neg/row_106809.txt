Growing and getting better.I recently attempted to kill myself. Ever since then, my life has been improving so well. I've met someone who makes me happy, I can be happy on my own, I haven't felt suicidal at all ever since my attempt, and I haven't even felt that depressed--I'm super happy now. I hope all of you guys can experience this soon. I don't think I'll need this subreddit for at least awhile. 

Thanks to everyone who's helped me throughout these hard months.
