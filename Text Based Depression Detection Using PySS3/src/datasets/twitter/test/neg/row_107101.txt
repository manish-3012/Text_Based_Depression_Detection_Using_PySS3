Lost and confusedSo this whole bout of depression started about three months maybe a little longer than that.

I used to have friends that hung out with all the times and go out with. My best friend for aehile was my pot dealer who ended up using me for everything.

I helped him get a job, i drove him and his girlfriend around everywhere and i even sold him a car that he never fully paid me back for.

Back in january i got accepted into a university about 45 mins away and i was going to school anf working full time. By this time o was starting to get fed up with my best friends shit, so i decided to move near the school i was attending.

Arround the same time i befriended his sister who was engaged. Me and her hung out everyday never thinking twice about being anything morr than just friends with her. Me and her ended up becoming best friends right before i moved.

I knew her and her fiance were having problems cause she would always tell me and her mom that she was leaving him.

About a week before i moved to school she left her fiance and then asked me out. I said yes cause she was good looking and she was someone i thought i could trust.

For almost 2 months we were together, we spent everyday together that i could. She even quit her job and noved out to my apartment so dhe could be with me.

I got a new job and life finally seemed to be coming together. I had never had a girl friend before and im 24 so it was a big deal with me. We never fought really, just towards the end we started to bitch at eachother a little bit.

I never thought that i would be coming home to her leaving with her ex fiance picking her up to go back home.

I tried to kill myself twice, once by hanging and the rope broke and the second time i tried to OD some muscle relaxers but i didnt get the end result. I lost my new job 4 days after she left me.

I moved back home because i couldnt be by myself anymore. I finished out the summer semster driving back and forth everyday and got a 3.25 gpa for that semester. I got my old job back home and i traveled across the country to colorado to help move my cousin.

I almost didnt come back from colorado. I almost just stayed there. But i came back to find out not only my two bestfriends had alienated me but everyone doesnt really like me anymore.

All of my friends that i used to hang out with all the time dont want to see me or talk to me. Yet everyone says i didnt do anything wrong, even the girl that left me says i didnt do anything wrong.

I dont understand this. For the last 3 nonths i havent been with anybody. Ive tried making new friends and ive found a few but not like i used to have.

My sister and my cousin both dont like hanging out with me because im too depressed and down all the time.

Im a nice person and ive never tried to hurt anyone, i dont get why all my friends just through me to the side after this. I quit school because i cant focus, i got good grades yes, but i just couldnt keep my head in it.

I cant stop thinking about her. I dream about her all the time and i just want to forget and move on.

Ive been trying to wear nyself out and i got a second job so i could get more money and stat busy since i have no social life. Ive started drinking more and more because i cant sleep some nights.

I feel like a loser, i javr no one but my mom, and i still just want to die.

Im stuck in this miserable existance right now and all anybody ever says is that it will get better. But it hasnt, i still feel like my heart was rilled out, i feel like i am this awful person that doesnt deserve anything.

The only reason i havent attempted suicide again is because my mom and sister would be devastated if they found me, and i dont want to do that to them.

I dont know what to do anymore, i dont know whats right or wrong anymore. Hopefully i can get some advice or gelp from you redditors, because my therapist hasnt helped at all.

I dont know what i should do to move on, all i can think about is what ive lost and trying to make the pain and the thoughts stop!
