I should be happyI have everything I could ever want. I'm employed and don't hate my job, I have a loving partner, family, friends... everything. 

Sometimes everything seems fine but then I get into periods where I start feeling terrible. I have no motivation to do anything when I get home from work. I get angrier than I ever should get at minor things. I rarely enjoy things I used to enjoy doing, and usually I only can when I'm drunk.

I've tried changing up my life by going on walks, trying new things and forcing myself to talk to friends but nothing seems to work. Some days I can get by feeling empty but hopeful for the future because things always get better. Other days I want to kill myself. I haven't made any recent attempts, but it feels almost like I'm using procrastination techniques to counter the urges. For example, a friend of mine has a big exam or something next weekend and I've convinced myself that I would be a terrible friend if I let news of my death interrupt their studying.

I don't really know why I'm writing this or what I expect to get out of it but my mind is racing less now that I've slowed down to try and put some of the thoughts into words.

I hope everyone is doing well, and is as safe and healthy as possible. Otherwise I hope that things pick up. Cheers
