No motivation anymore kill me kill me kill meIâ€™ve had anxiety as long as I can remember and depression I was diagnosed awhile back though maybe 4 or 5 years ago and I just donâ€™t feel right anymore I tried to get help for awhile I took medicine and regularly saw a consoler but in those years everything has fallen apart the medicine gave me side effects and I got scared and stopped taking them I later gained a fear of taking pills and then my consoler moved to another office one that my insurance didnâ€™t cover and I slowly lost all my friends and my only friend (my girlfriend) broke up with me a couple months ago said we were on break and I call her two months later and she decided she could never be with me romantically again and already has someone new and now it feels like I have nobody I can barley shower or get out of bed anymore cause of everything my grades are terrible and Iâ€™m too stupid to get anything right Iâ€™m talentless and have no passion in life I used to enjoy reading sometimes and doodling but now I just get mad I feel sad and mad everyday I feel like Iâ€™m going to freak out and punch something I hate my shitty school consoler I hate the teachers who think Iâ€™m lazy I hate my mom for thinking Iâ€™m lazy Iâ€™m mad mad mad mad mad I feel like punching myself in the face most days I feel so utterly lonely someone kill me
