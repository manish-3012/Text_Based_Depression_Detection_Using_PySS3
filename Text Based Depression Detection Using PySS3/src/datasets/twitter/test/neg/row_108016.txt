I always hated life twAnd I came to realization that it's a chemical
Imbalance and that I shouldn't have been born 
I'm not one of these young people and I feel ashamed that at my age I haven't figured it out 

I'm such a fucked up screwed up who believe in the music industry so much that I'll be one of those great artist 

I have never made friends so angry with being an idiot because I didn't study hard or that im not smart but dumb and ugly and fat and 

I see my wrists every single day and I want to slash it and warm blood come out of that and little I have is always taken away from me so society is very much telling me that I'm a piece of shit because they won't even get me a fucking job so I can get better mentally.

So I won't be bored and each time I am bored and feeling suicidal because I can't get out of the house and do what I want 
Because no money and fuck all of these fucking life 

What a stupid shit 
And some people said money isn't everything but when I almost got better from my depression I knew that money is everything because money can help me cope with my life and move on with my life 


But nope all little things I have in life is gone
The motivations I have is almost gone

Feels selfish and greedy I know but here I knew that it'll never going to ok
I'll always try to be happy but always going to be so stressed with life and no one will ever help me to the point I don't and can't feel anymore feeling human 

It'll get better kids just do your homework and study hard don't be like a dumb ass like me 
Go to therapist and open your heart 

Me, I'm an ugly stupid person so I worth nothing
