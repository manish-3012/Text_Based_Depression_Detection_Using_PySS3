Just tired of everything.I am just tired of it all, I have lost so much in my life, I have no family left, they have passed away, or in jail. Going through a divorce, and yet she is still the love of my life. It is just hell living with someone with PTSD as bad as mine is. I am tired of the nightmares, quilt, anger, sadness and everything else. I tired of remembering friends and then remembering the last moments. I cant live with the memories of watching someone slowly dim to nothing. I am tired of blaming myself for them not making it back, I was the medic, I was supposed to bring everyone home. I am tired of not waking up next to my wife. I cant keep seeing the fear in her eyes as I came out of a flashback, or the fear in her eyes as she is calling 911 after I took a bottle of pills, or as I was standing in front of the tub with a hot electrical cord in hands. I have lost everything, everyone I loved. I lost the kind good-natured person I was, I lost my humanity and for what. I just don't know if can pick myself up again if i can go on. I think about just walking away so many time through out the day I am just afraid I am going to do it one of these times.
