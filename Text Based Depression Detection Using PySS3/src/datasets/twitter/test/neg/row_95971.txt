I don't know what else to do. I have a young daughter.
I cheated on her mom, once. It was a terrible thing to do, and I regret it deeply. Now I think I may have herpes, and may have given it to her mom. 
I am worried my daughter will have to grow up without me. 
I'm basically settled on suicide and I believe I deserve it. I see no other solution.
Then her mom can move on and find someone worthy, and she can just forget I ever existed. 

If anyone knows of a way I could make money off my death/complete disregard for my own life to help provide for my daughter. Please let me know in a PM. 

I suppose I could also try to fake my own death, move to alaska and toil and send her the money. 

Is it cowardly to kill myself in this situation, or is it the right thing to do? The deserved thing?
