I just want to end itThere's literally nothing I want to do more than kill myself. I have a shot ton of body hair as a girl. Literally I have chest hair and stomach hair and hair everywhere. My grades are starting to slip because I can't pay attention in class because a I think about is how much I want to fucking kill myself and end all the pain and self hatred. I literally don't want to do anything anymore. Every time I feel EVEN the tiniest amount of happiness I'm reminded that I'm a fucking disgusting hairy monster that doesn't deserve to be happy. 

Why shouldn't I kill myself? It would be an easier way to solve all my problems. Otherwise I would have to spend thousands on laser hair removal and medication and stupid fucking doctors appointments. I'd rather just end it easily. The people who care about me will be better off. My family won't have to pay for my college, my laser hair removal, and they won't have to deal with my dumb ass. My friends won't have to hear my complaining and venting anymore. Literally killing myself would be so much better than living. The pressure to be perfect and beautiful all the time are just getting worse and I wont  be able to catch up to it. I'll just hate myself for my entire life. 




FUCK this shit. I'm writing a suicide note today. I won't kill myself today, but I'll write it I'm case I'll ever do it. Which will probably happen soon. There's no point in I'm sticking around just to see my life get worse.
