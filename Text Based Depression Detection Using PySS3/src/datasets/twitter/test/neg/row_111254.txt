I wish I was hatedI wish nobody liked me. I wish I had no family. Nobody depending on me. Nothing. Then I could just end it. 

I hate myself. So much. Why can't I just end it? Because. There's just a few people that will miss me.  My parents. Grandparents. Siblings. Nephews. I can't because of them. 

How selfish of me right? I'm a failure. A nobody. A fuck up. But I have to stay alive. I have to live while others get to die. Why can't I be them? Why can't I add to the statistics? 

I just want to end it. So bad. Here I am. A pathetic excuse of a man. Crying. Because I can't do it. The day that I do will be the happiest day of my life.
