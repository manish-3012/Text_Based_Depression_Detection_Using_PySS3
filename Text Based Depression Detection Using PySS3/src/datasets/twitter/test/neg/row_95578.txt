Too emotionally stretched. Holiday Blues.This is going to sound horrible, and I expect no sympathy on this part, but I want you guys to get the full story, so I will be as honest as I possibly can.

Right after 9/11 of this year, a woman reached out to me on reddit, telling me about her situation. She has been married for some years now and it has been very unhappy, they sleep in separate beds and barely talk to each other. We got to talking and now we have been together for 4 months. Well, recently her husband found out about me, and she thought that they could slowly work on getting a divorce while being civil about everything, because they have a child together. 

Well, today was the first day of their trip that they were taking to go see his family and some of her family for christmas and he saw her send one message to me, and they had an argument and he told her basically that she has to move out after their trip is over. We are long distance and so it would be very inconvenient for her to come live with me. I feel useless because the only way I can help is by being happy, but I am worried for her. 

I try to put on a happy face and keep my emotions up, but i have very depressive episodes and that, along with her situation, plus spending the holidays all by myself is starting to make me feel really emotionally stretched. I am starting to become really depressed tonight and she told me to tell her if i am feeling like this while she is gone, but now i cannot bring myself to, because i do not want to make her worry even more on top of what she already has going on, so I am trying to keep it to myself, which is just making it worse.

I feel useless, for failing at being her happy escape from her situation. 

I feel lonely, from spending the holidays alone, just wishing to have someone to talk to. 

I feel like a bother, because I cannot help anyone, and if I talk to anyone I just bring down the mood of the conversation. 

I think that ending it would just be so easy. I wouldnt be a bother anymore. Nobody would have to deal with me, and I wouldnt always have them worried when my episodes attack me. 

Thank you for listening.
