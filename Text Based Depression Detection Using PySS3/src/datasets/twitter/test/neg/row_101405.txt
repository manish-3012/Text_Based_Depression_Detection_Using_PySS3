I just want to end itI wanna commit suicide, I contemplated it before and nearly did it about 3 months ago. I wanna do it because I moved from another country, I hate my stepmother, I lost almost all chance of getting into an Ivy League school because of the move and the recent climate surrounding acceptance, I'm fat and can't seem to get rid of it even after exercising for 2 hours a day and eating well, I was born into the worst economic depression the world has ever seen in modern history, I have friends but they are either half a world away or feel fake, I haven't even kissed a girl, I hate myself, constantly am anxious and only made my new friends by accident, I know the reason I don't dream is because my mind hides them from me because I have had nightmares that made myself sleep in my room with a knife because even though I knew it wasn't real I just couldn't and I feel as if I've already reached the peak in my life even though I'm not even in high school yet
