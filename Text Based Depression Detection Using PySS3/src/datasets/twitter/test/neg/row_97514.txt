A Silent VoiceFeeling really low today. The last 7 years of my life has been a shit show and today I really wanted to just disappear because I can no longer tell if I'm ever going to pull myself out of this mess. 

(i've deleted my story twice now) 
My experience seem ridiculous. I feel like an imposter. As if I myself am deserving of yet another bad turn of events. 

I watched this anime film "A Silent Voice" and it gave me a small glimmer of hope for myself. 
Even though I wanted to die so badly this morning, my child depends on me. 
Even if I feel like everyone has given up on me, this dumb kid never has.
Even though this last year has gone by so fast and I'm stuck in this constant battle against ending up homeless again.
 I can't change any of these things if I kill myself.
i'm just so tired of being a burden to others and suffering in silence.
