Reddit, my friend has tried to commit suicide multiple times.She always takes pills, but usually not enough to actually kill her. She was hospitalized once when she took half a bottle of Ibuprofen "to see if it would kill me".

She has ADHD and Bipolar I Disorder. I don't live in the same state, but we dated briefly about a decade ago. She's newly married and has been institutionalized before during a manic phase.

She always gets drunk during times of stress and gets manic. She calls me or sends me these rambling emails, and tonight is one of those nights. She always talks about death and tonight has sent two emails saying literally "I want to kill myself tonight."

Her husband knows about her suicidal tendencies, obviously, but I don't know to what extent or how much she tells him anymore. Honestly she threatens to kill herself so often it's a little like the boy who cried wolf.

What do I do? The husband's at the end of his rope and I feel like nothing I say gets through to her. I honestly don't know why she even still bothers sending me emails. A lot of it clearly has to do with getting attention, but I'm terrified that one day I'll see the Facebook update that she's dead and I don't know what I'll fucking do with myself.

I have had a friend commit suicide in the past and this is very hard for me. Any advice on how to handle this would be really, really appreciated.
