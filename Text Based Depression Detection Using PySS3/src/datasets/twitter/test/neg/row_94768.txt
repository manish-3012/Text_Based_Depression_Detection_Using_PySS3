My week was horribleMonday to Friday had to be some of the worst days of my life. I went through my day, got home and put on some music and just sat in silence thinking about how fucking useless I am everyday. I canâ€™t reach out to anybody either for fear of ridicule. I feel my life slipping into shit. Help.
