I need somebody to tell me somethingHelp me. I need to hear something but i dont know what. I almost went through with it this time. I had everything laid out. I even got so far as writing the note. The only thing that stopped me was that the anger and hate and sadness built up so much that i am laying in bed paralyzed by it and i cant get up and do it. Even typing this is exhausting. I have nothing left in me. Im actually to sad to bother killing myself. But since i get the feeling i wont be going anywhere for a few minutes i decided to try and get help one more time. Please anything you can say to help.
