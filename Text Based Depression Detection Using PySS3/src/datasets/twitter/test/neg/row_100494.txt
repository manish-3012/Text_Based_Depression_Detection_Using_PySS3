i dont know anymorei dont know what to do/think anymore

i say no one will care if i died but i know thats not true.  if have a few close friends who might go down the path i do if i died.  my parents will probably be sad.  the person who finds my body will be traumatized.

i still want to kill myself.  i just dont want to hurt others.  i know it wont matter once im dead, but i just cant stand it to know that if i do die, my close friends will be hurt for life.  i guess it's a good thing that there are people who do care about me.  but i sometimes wish they didn't, just so i could end this all.

and one more thing- i know that no matter where i do it, someone will have to find my body.  and that'll be horrible for someone to witness.  i don't want a stranger to be hurt just because i died.  i never thought i mattered much, but i guess to some people, i do.  and i fucking hate that.  i wish that i didn't matter to anyone, so everything will be easier.

i'm too scared to de-isolate from the people who care about me too.  like i know that'll probably save them from being hurt as much, but what if i fail?  i'll be worse off than before.
