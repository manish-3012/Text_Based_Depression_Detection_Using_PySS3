Feel like im deciding between two extremes.Basically im 18 and have felt depressed and suicidal for years but now that life is becoming real I feel as if I either want to do die or go get my face tattooed move out to LA and try to become a music artist. Ik that its not viable at all and sound silly but i guess its all i know that id like to try instead of suicide. Ik it limits jobs etc but im afraid ill die without ever being my real self and it doesnt matter if im not here to get a job. Im just stuck between a rock and a hard place and dont know what to do. Life just sucks and i wanna run away rn or die. Im in community college rn and am on my way to get a degree but the thought of going to a 9-5 everyday just makes me want to blow my head off more. What do i do?
