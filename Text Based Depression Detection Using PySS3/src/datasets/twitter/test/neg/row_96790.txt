I almost killed myself todayI wrote my will. Normally you do that when you're like 80, but I'm 15. I had the entire thing planned out, and for some goddamn reason I was so fucking happy. I was smiling like a loser. That was like, 7 hours ago. Now im just typing this out and fucking crying. 
I had enough money to get a bus ticket to the city near me, go to the hardware store and buy some rope, and just look for a deserted are near this one power plant that's obscured enough. 

I started texting my friends goodbye. Through their help and countless tears, I realized how stupid that was. How stupid I was. 

i don't know what im going to do with my future, but im so glad they talked me out of it.
