shit doesn't get better.35/M, own place &amp; salaried job.  stories of love &amp; loss in my life.  2 cats &amp; one father left, of family.  enough money, resources, nothing to want for.  no friends, but thatâ€™s a given, at this age, isnâ€™t it.

i cope with daily existence through alcoholism, Netflix, &amp; fastidiously cleaning my apartment.  chain-smoking out the window &amp; taking enough pills to help me sleep for 10 hours, if iâ€™m lucky.  sleep is the best thing; the richness of my dreaming-life counteracts the agoraphobia, the narrowness of the anxiety &amp; quiet desperation with every small bus-trip, every block i can bring myself to walk, or the weekly drive in the car i can barely use just to get groceries &amp; get home as quickly as possible.  to meet the needs.      
.    
but all that i do is meet the needs.  i suppose iâ€™m â€˜lucky,â€™ for being able to do that.  but it sure as hell doesnâ€™t feel like luck.  itâ€™s barely sufficency.      
.    
i gave myself *permission to go* once the cats are gone, &amp; Dadâ€™s finally succumbed to his cancer; it feels as though itâ€™d be too much, to leave any of them in the lurch.   but that looks like 10+ years from now, &amp; thatâ€™s *also* very much *too much*.  itâ€™s a fucking age.  a wealth of suffering yet in store, as i have to see them all go away.  all i have left.    
.    
even as everything i have left to love is sleeping, &amp; i pace the floors &amp; write, well---this kind of thing.

you can have everything you need in the world, but if thereâ€™s that certain sense of *brokenness* in your head---well, apparently youâ€™re always going to want to put a gun against it.

i used to aspire to having a girl; no desire, anymore.  money used to be a *thing*; no longer, no, i have enough.  at one time, i travelled; now i try not to leave my home for as long as possible, &amp; hate it when i do.  the world has narrowed into this.... *this shit*.  which has only gotten worse as iâ€™ve aged.

every night now, for several years, before the work &amp; the chores &amp; the *fucking life* of the next day, iâ€™ve asked some absent god that i could fall asleep &amp; not wake up.  i always do wake up, though.  i always have to do it, again &amp; again.     
.     
i look forward to the day when i can ask the same of the .44 revolver, aimed hopefully at the intersection of my brainstem &amp; cerebellum.  itâ€™s all i think about: *when i can let myself finally go from this*.  itâ€™s no way to live, this wanting constantly to die.
