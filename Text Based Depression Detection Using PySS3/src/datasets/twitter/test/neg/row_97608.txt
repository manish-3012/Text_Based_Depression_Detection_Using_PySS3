Im gonna commit sudoku ðŸ‘ŒIve been trying to find  a practical way to die.  that way I feel some kind of closure when I go. 
Like going out to a pond and hearing the frogs or crickets. Someplace Ive always found peace. Ideally, I want to go out slowly and almost painlessly even tho it might not come to that. I'm scared of what happens next. I'm scared there probably isn't a "next". Id be putting an end to everything I ever enjoyed. ill be Dying alone. Tbh The world is a great place and Im afraid to leave it. But Im not really meant for it. I tried my best. :/

I dont want pity or help. I just want comfort before I kill myself

 Idk, Maybe knowing I made someone's life better is enough.
