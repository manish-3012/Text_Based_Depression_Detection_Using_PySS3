Update on ''I found NOT the answer''I mentioned in my last text that if I was to fail this year. I would end my life. 
And today I got my results for my tests back. And I passed with 82%. I guess what made me think I was gonna fail are the first test results where I got 45% But I just worked my ass off day and night. And I'm glad it paid off. So this is a thank you text for all the ppl that helped me and motivated me to keep going until this day and I'm very happy that I did. 
Thank you guys. I owe you my life!
