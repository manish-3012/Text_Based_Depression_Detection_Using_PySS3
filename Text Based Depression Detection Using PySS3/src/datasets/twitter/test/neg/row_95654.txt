SF, Ca resident needs a place to go that wont haul me off.been struggling with depression for ever, suicidal thoughts and tenancies getting stronger. every doctor says they have to report self harm or harm to others, what even the fuck is the point of doing your job if i can easily kill my self better in jail?

pathetic sob story short, i need a place that accepts MediCal that can accept everything i have been going through and feel without the need to report it to the police.

this legal clause of doctors is total bullshit and it is no wonder why suicide rates are through the roof in this country...
