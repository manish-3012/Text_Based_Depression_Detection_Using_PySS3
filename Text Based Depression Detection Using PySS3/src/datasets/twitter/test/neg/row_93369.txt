whati know iâ€™m doing it to myself. holding myself back. but these thoughts donâ€™t go away. theyâ€™re always on the back of my mind. and sometimes they come to the front. i donâ€™t want to try. i want to do nothing and just exist. i donâ€™t want to worry. itâ€™s painful. even if i did accomplish want i want and what iâ€™m capable of. i feel like this emptiness will always be there. nagging me. so why should i even try. why should i even exist. it doesnâ€™t make sense to me why i should want to live in this world. what if i was just a ghost i could do whatever i wanted and no one would bother me. no one would tell me i need to do better or i should do better. not even myself because it would be impossible. thereâ€™s no way around peer pressure or self inflicted pressure if you donâ€™t fully exist. idk i just feel empty all the time. constantly trying to reassure myself that i have a bigger purpose and iâ€™m here for a reason is exhausting. im over it
