Professional solitary confinementThis has been the worst month of my life. The first significant romantic relationship I've had in 5 years ended around Thanksgiving because I bottle up my emotions and eventually had a nervous breakdown instead of handling them like a normal person. I had a rough few weeks with that, but it was going alright for the most part. 

I work two jobs, one of them as a projectionist at a major film theater. Star Wars has ruined me. Up until that point, we had been running short documentaries, so the job was relatively active. Now my schedule keeps me there until 1am, an 8-9 hour shift consisting of MAYBE an hour of work. The rest of the time I effectively babysit the machinery in a dark, soundproof box, alone by myself, unable to leave. I get no real breaks, since the downtime during shows is considered my break. The first two weeks of this I saw the sun for maybe ten minutes. 

The theater (for business reasons that I won't get into) decided to get through the run understaffed on projectionists, so there is zero flexibility with the schedule, and if I quit, the theater probably won't survive the loss.

The job gives me hours of time alone to basically sit with my thoughts. I've tried reading, surfing Reddit, podcasts, and the like, but they don't cut it. By the end of the night I will have seen Star Wars 30 times, and I got sick of it after 3. That's how I spent Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Years.

My other job is also complicated. I work at a coffee shop a few days a week, which helps me with social time and covers rent/bills. It's the only job that is willing to be flexible enough to accommodate my theater schedule (my bosses at both jobs are very good friends). The problem there is that one of my coworkers is my recent ex. We tried to make things work, and be friends, but I was genuinely still in love with her, and I'm not in a place mentally to handle it. After a month of trying, I realized I was hurting both of us, and cut it off. I didn't do it well, though. Looking back, I was childish at best, and emotionally abusive at worst. Every interaction we had made her feel guilty, even though I didn't intend to. I was horrible to her, and she didn't deserve that. At this point, we aren't speaking, and I asked my very understanding boss not to schedule us together anymore. Seeing her feels like a punch to the stomach, and I am completely terrified of running into her.

I decided it was time for me to move to Chicago, where all of my really close friends have migrated over the past few years. I can't stand being here anymore. The city I'm in is too small, and everyone knows everyone. I would say fuck it to the theater and leave tomorrow, but I have four months left on my lease, and unless I can find a friend to finish out the time for me, I'm stuck here until then.

I'm very charismatic and outgoing, but all that's earned me is a lot of acquaintances. I have one or two good friends here, but none who I feel comfortable opening up to about this. 

At this point my life is a cycle of work and staring at the ceiling trying to sleep. I have never been more isolated, both socially and physically. I'm in an incredibly dark place, and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to do that kind of harm to my family. I just wish I could stop these thoughts. Every day the voice gets louder and louder, and it's getting harder to rationalize it away. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow, but I'm seriously worried about surviving to the end of the month, much less May. I need help.
