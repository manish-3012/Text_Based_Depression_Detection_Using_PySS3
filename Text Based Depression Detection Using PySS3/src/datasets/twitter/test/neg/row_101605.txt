I can do anything right... Or well... Or.. I can't do anything.I just have to die before going to work. I can't stand life. My family is forcing a cult upon me. I moved out a few weeks ago and my body is broken. I can't think. My fibro pain is killing me and my pseudo tumor is making it hard to open my left eye.  I just want to kill myself so much. Tell me to do it. I have work at 5 pst and it is so much work I can't.
