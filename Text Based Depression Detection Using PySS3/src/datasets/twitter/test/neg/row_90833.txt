Any Married People Here?Chronically depressed wife whoâ€™s husband triggers suicidal thoughts. Heâ€™s being an ass tonight about my past trauma and making it all about him. Very tired of dealing with people like this. Iâ€™m giving up on resolving our issues for now. Iâ€™m moving somewhere soon with lax gun laws so if anything Iâ€™ll blow my brains out when it gets too much.
