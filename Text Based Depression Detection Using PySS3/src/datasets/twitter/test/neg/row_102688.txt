I'm killing myself slowlyA little back story before I get into the title. I'm 18 going on 19 soon and I don't see a future for myself I've stopped going to my college classes  after the first month of the winter semester and even though I've registered for spring classes I've only been to class once I'm going for adolescent history I don't want to be a fucking teacher, I don't know what I want to do with my life I don't see myself being happy in the future I'm not going to be anything I'm not going to contribute to society I'm going to be another worthless bum on the street I've let my mom down enough times in my life already I don't want her to see me become nothing in life I don't have any hobbies I'm not good at anything I ruin everything I touch. I've been having thoughts of killing myself, killing my family or just random people I see on the streets I get into fits on rage where I just punch anything I can and punch myself in the head repeatedly. So I decided I don't want to live like this I don't want to be considered crazy or mentally unstable So I've decided to end my life but I'm too much of a bitch to end it myself so instead I've been eating almost nothing but junk food and fast food for the last 3 months and stopped exercising completely I've gone from 260 to 305 in that time I just hope one day my heart will just give out (hopefully in my sleep) at this rate it's going to happen anyhow my dads side of the family has heart problems so I'm just counting down the days until I slump over and I can just be released from everything my non existing future my worthlessness to the world gone everything gone nothing can stop me its too late for me
