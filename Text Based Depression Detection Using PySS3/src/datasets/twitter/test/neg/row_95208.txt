My bestfriend tried to kill her self last night, what should I do?Some of you may have seen my posts before about how I've tried, and how I want(ed) to kill myself, but this isn't about me. My bestfriend may or may not have tried to kill herself last night. She got in a fight with her ex-boyfriend and he (accidentally, we don't know if it was self defense or an actual swing) hit her. She went home and took anti depressants and then ended up drinking. I don't know the full story and I wasn't told if the intention was to end it, but I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I'm going over her house to talk to her tomorrow and any advice would really help.
P.S. I know someone is going to tell me to call the cops, but she'd hate me if I did, and I want to avoid that if possible; if needed I will, but only if I need to, I've been talking to her (texting) today and she seems okay as of now, well not okay, but safe. If it comes down to it I will call the cops.
