I don't see a futureI've been thinking about this a lot recently. I think I've wasted my life and it's just too late to construct anything meaningful now. People are nice to you when you're young because you're full of potential and possibilities. I've wasted all that potential and goodwill. 

Rejection seems to be a common theme though. The more it's happened, the more I've withdrawn. You can't get rejected if you're not trying to be accepted, right? I always thought I could try later when I was in a better place but I'm having this crushing realisation that later has come and gone and I've missed the boat. No one is there now. People have died, moved on or just cut me off completely. I literally have no one and it's all my own fault. 

It recently occurred to me that I might be on the autistic spectrum. I've never been diagnosed but it would explain a lot. 

I don't want to be here any more. I really don't. I'm stuck and completely lost the ability to connect with other human beings. Life doesn't have meaning or purpose. It feels like a cruel trick most of the time. I think I want out now.
