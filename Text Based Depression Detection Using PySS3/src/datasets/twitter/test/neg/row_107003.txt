My resistance is futileI know I have some bipolar shit. I have told myself millions of time today my life changes for better, but every time I get shoved back down. I post shit here, someone cuddles me like a baby, and I go to sleep to feel good again. Then again hopelessness overcomes me, and the cycle repeats itself. I now curse the day where I failed to commit suicide. I could have been free from this shit that day. I tried, am still trying, but time keeps slipping away. The best years of my youth are being spent in fighting this meaningless war. So come on, give your sympathy, so that I can rise up to fall again. Because my resistance is futile. Only death will free me.
