I don't know how to ask for helpI really want to die. I'm too much of a pussy to do it, to man up and slit my throat. It would hurt everyone around me ; my parents, my little brother, and my friends. I have a plan to do it. I'd pack some clothes and money to live for a couple days if I need to, a note and my knife. I would just walk away from my house, into the woods below the mountains. I would find a good spot, a nice tree or a little dip in the ground. I'd slit my throat and die holding my note so that foul play won't be suspected. It would be over, for me and everyone I know, unfortunately. I wish people didn't care about me. Their feelings make me uncomfortable. When people cry it makes me sick to my stomach. It hurts. I want to ask for help so badly, but if it causes anyone pain then I can't do it. I don't want people to know these things about me.
