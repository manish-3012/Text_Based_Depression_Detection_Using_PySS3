My Last GoodbyeYesterday, I turned 24. I have never had any good days, and I used to give everyday a shot. But as the time has progressed, the constant let down of things never going right has eaten me away. And it's not a "things are good, but I'm depressed", nothing has ever gone right for me. Today, I tried to enjoy my birthday even though I won't be able to pay rent next month and I'll be homeless soon. I really did try. But I came home, and my dog destroyed some things that I really cared about. Then it all came crashing down. The loneliness crept in, the stress, anxiety, and suddenly, I felt nothing. No desire to keep moving forward, no desire to find something to live for, nothing. I finished my suicide letter instead, and I'm going to finish getting my plan together and offing myself as soon as I'm done. With that being said, I've always wondered a few things. Has anyone ever had such a bad string of "luck" as I have that it has made me not appreciate anything in my life? The 2 people I have in my life both think I have plenty of reason to live, but I honestly don't feel anything, and I don't care to try. Nothing turns out right, and there's plenty of reasons why, and I don't want to go through this anymore. I don't feel human anymore, so I might as well be dead. I was suppose to try to see a new psychiatrist soon (I'm medicated but that'll run out soon), but the time and effort into trying to trust a new doctor, getting medication sorted, etc. is just...I don't want to hurt like this anymore, yet not feel anything. And I think my loved ones will forgive me if they truly know why I did it. If they don't, I'll be dead so I won't know. I don't know why I'm rambling and telling anyone this, I guess I just wanted to say something and let someone know that I'll be dead soon.
Find peace, and please forgive me. Goodbye, guys.
