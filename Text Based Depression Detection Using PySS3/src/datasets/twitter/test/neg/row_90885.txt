Realization.I've had social anxiety for the past three years and I think the cause of it is because me and my family migrated and I know how to speak English but too shy to speak to  people so they think that I just lack vocabulary and treat me like I'm fucking stupid they don't treat me badly but just treat me differently like I'm an outcast.

I moved schools three times and I thought that I made friends but then realized that no one would actually care if I die or just disappear I tried so hard getting people's validation and tried to be my best self I tried exercising, meditation and all kinds of different shit that I thought would actually help me but nothing helps I feel drained, irritated and everything moves so slow most of the time.

I just feel like everyone just thinks I'm retarded the only thing that I wanted is a one real friend that would actually care but everytime I think of it I just see blur and I'm surrounded by narcissistic and egotistical friends that have crab mentality that will pull me down just for them to look better to people.
