I want to end my life but wonâ€™t due to the reactions of my classmates and itâ€™s something that disturbs me.I have been wanting to end my life for awhile but itâ€™s always been an on and off thing. I mostly want to end it because people are garbage and Iâ€™ve been made fun of and humiliated by my classmates for awhile. If I do end my life, I fear that they will say â€œhe was a good friend of mine and I will miss himâ€. No thatâ€™s complete bullshit, you were the one who made me do this. Iâ€™m also worried that they will do some stupid thing on social media to show â€œrespectâ€. I want to not exist for other people and be alone where itâ€™s only me.
