I just...I just miss her. I love her. I want her. I need her. 

Im not going to go into details. You can read my history and see for yourself.

I just miss her so bad and i cant take the pain anymore. Im literarily crying as i type this and my keyboard is getting wet. I wish i could hold you in my arms and call you mine.

Im sorry i wasnt good enough to be your Superman, but youll forever be my Lois.
