Waking Up, Back to Sleep  I've been dealing with integrating a lot of small truths for a while to make sense of all the pain I feel. I built the story of why I want to kill myself for a long long long time because I think I need some very good reason. The truth is I just felt like it, because I do what I want. It's terrifying to realize you made all your mistakes because you wanted to. I needed to end up in this rough a state to get through that. Self-sabotage is a hell of a trip. I think killing myself is selfish because I think living my life is selfish. I've been surveying my own inadequacy this whole time, and finally decided that I deserve to die. It's been a long long trial and I feel very guilty. I have always been the judge. It's okay it's okay it's okay. Everything is okay. Nothing is okay. Nothing I've done has been okay. its chill its chill calm down. What am I saying? Is this a story about myself or a story about how shitty I feel? Do I have enough money yet? Do I have enough freedom yet? Am I the master of my domain? Did I figure it out yet? Sure, why not. Is this a eulogy or a suicide note or self-reflection? Surewhynot. Of course. I know everything so of course I'm worthless and deserve to die. I knew it from the beginning! I'm so fucking smart! I figured it out before anyone else! I tricked everyone into thinking I'm worthwhile!!!!!!!!!!!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M A PIECE OF SHIT wait I went there already. Everyone who dies is great. Make America Great Again. Make Death Great Again. Make Life Great Again. IF LIFE ISN'T GREAT WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE OH SHIT IT'S A CONSPIRACY TO MAKE US ALL SAD! GOD DOESN'T WANT ME TO EXIST, OR SOMETHING! Isn't holding yourself accountable basically death? I don't want bad things to happen to me and that pisses me off because I *should* want bad things for myself. I want to learn something already.
