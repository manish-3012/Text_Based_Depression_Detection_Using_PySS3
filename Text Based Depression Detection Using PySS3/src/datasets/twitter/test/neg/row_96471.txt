I am just killing time.Jumping off a  10 stories building or a shot gun, those are the only two ways I have come up when I think of some "safe" ways to do it. How long I have had these thoughts in my mind? Probably for about  a year or so... It does not matter, these thoughts  do not go away. I am quickly running out of money and will. Death is the great healer... it solves everything in a moment. Problem is, I am dead already. And I say this mantra to myself every night to fall asleep: "you don't exist". Yes, of course I got this from Radioheadâ€™s: "The easiest way to sleep at night, is to carry on believing that I don't exist"... It does help, at least it does for me. After 7-8 h of good sleep I wake up to this reality: a reality of broken dreams. Or more precisely, a reality where I donâ€™t have dreams any more.  A reality where passion and commitment simply have been extinguished from my soul. I am a dead person, with no heart, with no dreams. I don't live, I am just killing time.
