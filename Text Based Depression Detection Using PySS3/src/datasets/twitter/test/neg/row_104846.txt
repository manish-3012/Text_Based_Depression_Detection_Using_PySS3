I made myself cry because of what I didI planned on committing suicide 6 years ago to the date, 5 years ago next week was the first of 10 attempts in a 4 year period. Well today I decided to delete all my suicide notes today, all of them to everyone I wrote one to; which even includes my dogs :â€™). I have no backups or anything of the sort, it feels so damn liberating yâ€™all I canâ€™t believe how free I feel now. I cried for 5 hours. This is the first step in the road to recovery mentally and I love it. I couldnâ€™t believe I ever wrote those notes, itâ€™s crazy how much better my life has gotten
