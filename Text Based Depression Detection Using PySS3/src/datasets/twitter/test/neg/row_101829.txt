I'm having suicidal thoughts due to potential sickness.I am 29 years old and suffer from hypochondria (undiagnosed). I go to the doctor at least once a month with various symptoms that I think I have and I have anxiety attacks because of it. I always have a thermometer and a blood pressure device inside my backpack that I use several times a day.

I write my blood pressure and temperature in a book I have always with me, I write what I ate, the times I went to the bathroom and the appearance of my feces (smell, consistency etc.)

I am always seeing on the Internet the symptoms that I have and I always conclude that I have something serious (cancer etc.). Lately I've had bowel problems (lots of gas, several bathroom calls a day, feeling unwell) so I went to the doctor and he decided to have my feces checked along with a colonoscopy and endoscopy of my stomach.

This causes me great anxiety to the point of having suicidal thoughts because I can not deal with a potential serious illness. I think I'm going crazy and I can't handle this anymore.

How do I deal with this?
