A poem I wrote since I saw a few posted, don't judge me pleaseDeathâ€™s View of You  
  
  
Suicide is courage  
Fuck what you think  
Itâ€™s a punch in the face  
To the people who say  
That lifeâ€™s worth living  
  

Itâ€™s a knife in the back  
To the ones you love  
Fuck the ones that donâ€™t  
And the ones who wonâ€™t  
  
  
When they hear your name  
On the local news  
â€œThey died in painâ€  
I take their abuse  
  
  
â€œHow could they?â€  
â€œHow would they?â€  
They scream and scream  
And scream but nothing  
Makes any sound to me  
  
  
The water looked nice  
From up high  
Like a doorway  
A sure way  
To the Nevermore  
  
  
No one asks if Iâ€™m okay  
No one begs me to stay  
They wish me away  
They wish I were dead  
I leave them afraid  
To hide under their beds  
Til that fateful day  
Til their day of death  
  
  
â€œHow does one die?â€  
I asked the water  
â€œIs it as easy as  
A step forward?â€  
  
  
â€œNo,â€ says the water   
â€œIt takes a millennia of lives   
For your shift to be over,  
For the night to be colder,  
  
  
For Death to die.  
  
  
But it takes only a day  
To stop having a say  
To follow the Way  
And grow a day older.â€
