I just made life 100x harder for myself by getting firedI worked retail for nearly two years. Always hated it. Graduated a degree in psychology which has made it very hard to find jobs. I've done 16 interviews since May and haven't gotten anything. Things are about to get harder because I was just terminated today.

Now on top of having a degree that hasn't gotten me anywhere, I now have to explain that I was fired from a job I held for 2 years because I was stupid enough to commit coupon fraud a few months ago and they rolled the cameras back and fired me for it.

I've blacklisted myself from ever getting a better job because of a mistake I committed a long time ago. I've learned my lesson, but no one will ever believe me. They have a million other applicants with clean records, why take a chance on me?

Everyone always thought I had a bright future ahead of me, but I've made terrible decisions and I seem to get further from success every day.

I was just beginning to bounce back from my depression, but the future seems hopeless now.

Any replies at all would help.
