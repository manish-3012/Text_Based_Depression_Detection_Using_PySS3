I have 8 days left and I'm going through with it I feel free finally.I have 8 days until my RX refills. It should be more than enough. I bought a rifle I even managed to get strychnine. But a rifle leaves to much of a mess and strychnine doesn't sound very pleasant for my family to watch. 
26/'m 
I've lost everything I'm tired of losing I'm tired of trying I've always had in the back of my mind if things get to bad I can always take the back door.
Well shits hit the fan and I'm just to tired to keep going. 
I spent the last week indulging myself I rented a room at the beach to watch the sunrise and sunset the waves come ashore. 

I've made peace with myself I feel this is the only way now and I feel comfort in the fact my suffering will soon end. 

I know it will hurt them, I know it will leave a deep scar where I used to be there will be one I reached out to for help to save me as I did her and she will act like she never saw it coming. Still even though it was clear as day I don't want her to feel blame.

But my plan is to leave a video of me explaining why I did this. Why no one is to blame and that I'm happy with my choice to end my pain.
I don't want any questions to go unanswered.

I figured the medicine will at least leave a presentable body less of a mess and I don't want the medics wasting time or equipment on me when there's someone who actually is fighting for their life.
It's a very odd feeling I have now I feel like I can already feel deaths embrace I feel like it's finally come for me the uncertainty is gone.
Life has finally pushed me to this point.
I finally feel like I've tried everything and now simply it's okay to die now. 
Maybe the quote is right we're not trying to kill our selves we're trying to kill the part of us that's causing us pain. 
Unfortunately those are one in the same.
PS. Wherever we go next I don't know I have conflicting views on it but whoever you pray to please pray for my safe passage.
