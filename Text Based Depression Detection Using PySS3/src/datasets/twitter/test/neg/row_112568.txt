Worst christmas ever ...   
 Hi, I don't even know why I'm here, maybe for help, maybe for advice ... Where to start ...I am a mentally ill person, I have several mental disorders and I have tried suicide before. I'm not exactly in love with Christmas, so it doesn't quite benefit ... Anyway, I'm not in a good financial situation, I'm in disability pension, where I only take a few crowns, which will pay for my phone and internet ... I wanna make my self happy. So I went to find a companion on the internet that I could have fun with ... I spent everything I got and something more because I was an idiot and drunk ... I didn't get anything at all, only blockages, none service back, nothing, it was just a scam, I don't understand that someone will do this for Christmas ... Of course I also have evidence of conversations, I contacted PayPal but unfortunately no one communicates with me, so I do not see much hope there ... The Christmas that I hate has been so fucking up to me that now I don't even know where to get food and I don't have anything for the fun I paid for ... I don't think I'll be here for very long.
