Iâ€™ve lost everything.. even the will to live.My wife left me because Iâ€™m ungrateful and undeserving. I lost my family, my daily habits, my little slivers of joy. I worked tirelessly to make them happy with what little we had and it wasnâ€™t good enough...

I want to die. I do. Itâ€™s been this thing in the back of my head since I was just a sad teenage girl. Iâ€™ve already drafted up suicide notes and I got a real informal will on some notebook paper. I donâ€™t want anyone to hate me for making this decision. I love everyone in my life so deeply and I donâ€™t want to hurt them.

But I need to take care of myself too right. What do I do? Each day is really hard.
