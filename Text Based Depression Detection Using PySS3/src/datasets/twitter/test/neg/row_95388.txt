I tried to kill myself a little while agoI'm starting a new job soon and I'm extremely overwhelmed and nervous. Because I was so nervous, I took a knife and aimed at my chest. I didn't stab myself because I'm too cowardly.

I've thought of suicide very often in the last couple of months and part of me wants to tell my parents, but I'm afraid of what will happen next.

I'm so nervous and ashamed. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm only 23 years old and I can't even hold a job. How can I get past this? I'm just so ashamed.
