My parents make me want to yeet myself off of a fucking bridgeNo, I'm not going to kill myself, but I'm just tired of it like my parents are so much more strict and mean compared to all my other friends parents and my friends are always happy and I'm just here being yelled all the time with depression and always thinking about how much better life could be. I want to die but I know how it would hurt the people I care about so I don't, so I live feeling like shit and annoying everyone and I just wish I was never fucking born because it hurts so bad
