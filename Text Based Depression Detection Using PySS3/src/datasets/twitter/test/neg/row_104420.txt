something thats been on my mind for a while.I cant stop thinking that everyone would be so much happier if I wasnt around, and belive me that alot of my family think of me in the same way. I am not a perfect person, I have flaws, I get my feelings hurt, I just want all this to end. I take antidepressants and they dont help. I have thought of drinking  antifreeze and I have devised other ways too, medication, I take lots of it. Recently I was told just how much I was hated, a brother in fact sent that message to me on FB, my mother dont speak to me since I had one of my brothers arrested for hitting me and breaking my nose. They have been harrassing me for almost a year now, I am so sick of it all. The only thing I can think of to stop me is my kids, but they have a daddy who loves them, and he and his girlfriend would be good to them.
