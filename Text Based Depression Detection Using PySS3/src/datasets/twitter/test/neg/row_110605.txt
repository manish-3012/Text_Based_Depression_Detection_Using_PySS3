my last daysHey, so i've been having suicidal thoughts for a really long time... i wanna die so bad. I've never wanted to die so bad in my entire life. i just wanna end it all in the most peaceful way possible. I used to dream of so many things, now I only dream of dying.

so whats made me so suicidal? In the end of july i was severely depressed cause my retarded drug addict mother left me at home all day all alone and she really expected me to not get depressed? So I was home alone all day and getting really depressed more and more everyday until one day i had an appointment with a psychiatrist who sent me to a mental hospital which makes no sense cause i wasnt threatening to end my life or do anything else stupid. 

So she sent me to a mental hospital for a whole fucking month. I spent a whole fucking whole fucking month there for no reason other than I didnt want to take any fucking medication. And eventually after 2 weeks they forced me to take that fucking garbage and ever since I havent been feeling the same. I've been incredibly empty with memory problems and no desire to do ANYHING and its been a month since I took that garbage and I still feel like this

So thinking more and more I realized "why the fuck would I wanna live anyway?"  Just give me one good reason why I should live... you cant. Why? because life is one big fucking joke. It doesnt make sense. Any of it. 

Whats the point of anything anyway? I mean if we're all gonna die one day, whats the point of doing anything? Im thinking of stealing some rope from the corner store so i can make a noose and end this nightmare once and for all. Fuck everyone and everything. I hope the world gets hit by a big ass meteorite and everyone dies. The end.
