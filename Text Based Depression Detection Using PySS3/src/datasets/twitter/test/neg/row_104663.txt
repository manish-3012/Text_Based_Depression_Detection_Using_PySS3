This is entirely uninteresting, though.Not planning to take any actions to kill myself rn. But Iâ€™ve been taking a bit more Tylenol than the recommended dosage almost every day for the past 2-3 weeks. Not trying to immediately kill myself, but I know itâ€™s probably not superb for my liver, and it feels reassuring to be taking some sort of action against myself. Does anyone else engage in this kind of behavior? I guess itâ€™s probably not terribly different from other types of self harm or whatever other rituals one might engage in.
