Constant painI was trying to remember the last time I wasn't in pain. It's been years since I remember a day I didn't hurt. It's either pains from my stomach or joint pains. There's no cure for my illness either, and I'm scared I'm hoping for a day that'll never come. A day where I'm not in pain.

I wish I could just "it's a wonderful life" it. I don't want to cause any pain to others that love or care about me. It's just too much at times. I just wish I had never existed because of the pain. I know it sounds pathetic.

I had it all planned out. But was scared of causing more pain. Not sure what to do. I'm just tired.
