Why am I even alive?I am a 21 year old girl, I honestly have nothing. My family is struggling financially and I am struggling mentally. 
I feel so empty, I just don't know what to do anymore. I constantly dream about how better everyone's lives would be if I just died.
I hate feeling like this, I hate being alive.
I live is a country where women and children have to fear for their lives. 
I'm on the edge. I don't see the point anymore.
