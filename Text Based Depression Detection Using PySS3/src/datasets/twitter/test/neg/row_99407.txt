Iâ€™m ready now.This morning seemed like any other morning, even better perhaps, because the sun was streaming through my window. I felt like maybe, this day could be better. I got up, had a bath, put a bit of make up on. Pondering on whether I should go out and have a look at a few Black Friday deals in the shops or go to a coffee shop to do some of the work I hadnâ€™t done from some missed lectures. I came downstairs. I put my contact lenses in. I looked in the mirror. In that moment I realised that I just didnâ€™t care. 

I didnâ€™t care to go out and buy material things, I didnâ€™t care to do my uni work. I didnâ€™t care. Life is so empty. No friends. No boyfriend. My parents hate me. In someways I hate them. I felt angry. Over the last few weeks I had begun to pin point where everything had gone wrong. And now I had gotten to the final stages of realising that I wasnâ€™t going to be happy again. I realised that Iâ€™m ready. I had made some light preparations for ending my life. But now Iâ€™m ready to put them into action. The last thing I have to decide on is how Iâ€™m going to do it. 

No one will ever hurt me again.
