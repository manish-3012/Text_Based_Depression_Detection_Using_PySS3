These are likely my last couple of daysHi everyone. Thanks for stopping by to read my story. 

I'm a 16 year old boy, turning 17 by the end of this month. I'm about to undergo my last year of high school,  the deciding factor of whether or not I go to the university my parents want me to go to,  going into the program of computer science. 

Now my parents have been encouraging me to go to this university ever since I was a kid. It is the best university in my region for computer science. My dad has always wanted me to be a programmer, like himself. He has always helped me in my studies and has pretty much done everything in his power to help me succeed. If you ever read this dad, thank you for everything you have done for me.

My mom has always been loving, she's always been there for me and has supported me and has helped straighten me out when my mind is in the gutter. Much like my dad,  she tries to help me with everything as well. Thank you mom if you are reading this. 

My sister has always been the nicest person to me. Of course we have arguments once in a while, but hey, who doesn't. She has always tried to inspire me and find things that interest me. She has offered me so many opportunities in terms of getting involved with the future of technology. Along with this she was always someone I could talk to. I remember telling her about my first girlfriend in grade 9, she was the first person I told about the initiation and the breakup. Pfft, grade 9 relationships,  what a joke. If you ever read this sister, thank you for everything you have done for me. 

Now I've been thinking about suicide for a good year now,  ever since grade 11 started. The thought has crossed my mind many times before that, but the beginning of grade 11 was really when it started. As the year progressed, I started feeling more and more stressed out, which is normal. 

The computer science program at the university my parents want me to go to requires a 90+ average. As you can probably tell, I didn't get that. My report card came today, and I got an average of 86 between my courses. 

Now back to the topic of suicide, the thoughts really started emerging in the last month. I was giving my exams my all. I was studying all day and all night when I came home from school. I wasn't sleeping properly, I wasn't eating properly, I didn't talk to anyone outside of school. I felt isolated,  and overall crappy. You can check out my other posts where I go more in depth into how I was feeling.

Now, where shit really hit the fan was one day before my first exam. That night, I was studying like usual. Suddenly,  a call comes. My parents pick up the phone and put it on speaker. From my room I can hear that the call was due to a family emergency. I found out that my grandpa had went to the hospital and passed. My mom was crying. Seeing her sad made me sad as well. I wasn't the closest one to my grandpa, but his death sure as hell did indeed hurt. 

My family originated from China, where my dad, mom, and sister had to make massive sacrifices in order to move to England, and then eventually to Canada, where my family currently resides. They came here to find a better life, and to have me. When they first got here,  they didn't have any money. When they had me, my mom had to stop working for a couple of years to raise me, leaving my dad as the only working one in our family, supporting us all and especially the expenses of me,  their newborn. They struggled for a couple of years,  making many sacrifices.  Now we are fairly well off. 

All the rest of my family is still in China. After my grandpa died,  my mom flew back the next day for a month. The night before the exam, I couldn't concentrate on studying didn't get much sleep. I was depressed. 

The one thing my mom said to me before she left was something like this:
"Make grandpa proud one last time and do well on your exams". 

Today I got my report card, and I got the news. An 86 average in 3 of my subjects. Given that I need at least a 90 to get into the university, I was not going to be accepted with these grades. My dad saw my report card and started arguing with me of how I didn't pay my efforts and how my studying method was wrong. He said I wasn't trying hard enough. He told me: "Is this how you are going to greet your mother?  With these grades?" This was the tipping point. He had no idea how hard I tried. He had no idea about what kind of mental baggage I was going through. I posted multiple times on reddit with this account, documenting how I was feeling throughout these hard times. 

My mom comes back tomorrow from China. She's going to exhausted, and depressed. I don't want to tell her that I let her down,  that I let grandpa down. Even if I do, I can't live with this baggage. I've been researching ways to kill myself. So far finding lethal injection seems like the best way. I have a plan. No one will know,  but depending on how tomorrow goes, decides whether I continue living or not. 

Thank you for reading this. It was quite the long post, but is it possibly the last thing I ever say on reddit. 

Thank you.
