Lost and not sure how to proceed.I am a 16/m. Nearly shot myself three times in the past month, nearly did it in front of friends. It's a long story but it involves a complicated family and social life. Recently suffered a concussion after a friend hit my head, a day after receiving the hit I have lost control of my emotions and what is real and fake, I have an amazing gf willing to do anything to help, but also have a love desire that's lived on for 2 years and will never go away. the love is a close friend we'll call X. X is a close friend and knows my feelings, recently she has admitted to feeling the same but afraid of rejection or pain as she's never dated before and doesn't think anything good would happen or that a relationship would be constricting. I love my gf dearly and she loves me but this is my dream girl who a day after admitting everything burned me, said she doesn't want anything to do with me, X does this whenever she gets scared. My family is of no help and neither are most of my other friends as we're all closely knitted and I don't want to hurt the social circle they all have. I told my gf everything that happened and I was forgiven. I don't feel worth her love, I hate X for the shit she pulls me through, I hate not being able to count on my family. I hate being suicidal since the age of 6. I have a long story and just, not sure where to place my next foot. Death is seeming to be such a sweet oblivion.  On the final note X said she'd  help me through my issues but instantly burnt me afterwards and my gf is long distance.
