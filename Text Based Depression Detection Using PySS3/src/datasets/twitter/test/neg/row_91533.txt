I can't even get help for how i feel, whats the point in trying.Ive taken 3 overdoses this year something i have thought about before but never acted on. 2 being quite recently one right after the other as soon as i was released from hospital.
Ive been home just over a week and literally the only thing i can think about is taking another overdose. Over and over and over again. Its like I can't rest until i do it.
I will likely lose my partner if i do it again but I don't know if thats enough to stop me.
Ive tried to get help and got nowhere, i was even sectioned and it was a waste of time, I don't know what else im supposed to do.
