If I could escape, I could see myself happy in a different lifeI used to think that I was trapped in this sort of life because I ended up in so many bad situations in my life.  Seemed like I had some sort of curse.  Thought there was something about me that would make bad always follow me.

I'm finally starting to accept that that isn't true.  I've just seen so much bad that I could never believe or imagine the good.  I know there's nothing wrong with me, that I can be loved, accepted, and respected.  I've just managed to always be around people who never loved, accepted or respected me by ill-luck (nothing to do with me).  If I was somewhere else, I could have a happy life.  Or at least it's easier to imagine it now.  But, I'm currently living with abusive people.  I wish I could just fly away, get out of here and go to that place in my mind.  But I can't.  No money, no car, nowhere to live.  I have a fragile body and can't just live on the street or on couches, though I don't mind damaging myself if i had to do it temporarily, knowing that I could find a happy place.  But I just don't have that much faith.  Most people aren't happy, it seems.  People just complain and put on fake cheer.  Why should I think I can be luckier?

I wish I had money, friends, fun, joy.  I wish I wasn't surrounded by people who are always trying to undermine me.  Sounds simple but feels impossible.  I'm stuck here and don't know if it will ever end.  This soul-sucking life goes on for eternity, day after day.
