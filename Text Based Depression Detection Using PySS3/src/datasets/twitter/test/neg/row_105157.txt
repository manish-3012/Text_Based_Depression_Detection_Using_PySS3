Already triedMy name is Marcie I'm 49 I have 2 kids I'm remarried.  I lost my mom on my birthday 5 years ago.  Since then I've been battling suicide.  I loved my mom and I want to be with her.  But I'm thinking of my kids they are both amazing and my dog.  I cry every day and it's getting worse I quit my job because I'm diabetic I have fibro myalgia I'm loosing my memory i have major back issues. What do I have to live for I'm in pain every minute of every day.  Last night I almost walked into traffic. How can I get me back ?
