I was never supposed to be alive
TLDR; my parents never wanted me so now I feel like I have no reason to be here anymore, and even if stay I feel my life would continue to be a shit storm because I donâ€™t see how thereâ€™s hope for people who come into the world being unwanted. 

This is why everything has been so hard for me. Everyday felt like a battle even before I was consciously aware that I was living one. Nothing goes right no matter how hard I try. And itâ€™s not supposed to be that way. Youâ€™re not supposed to be this miserable for years, thereâ€™s supposed to be peace somewhere within. All I know is misery. My own â€œfatherâ€ even told me recently, while my â€œmomâ€ is in the hospital dying, that I was never supposed to be alive. My parents are both abusive and also have an extremely abusive relationship. Stress literally kills. Thatâ€™s why she is dying. All of the stress life, my dad, and ultimately what she herself put her through, will be the cause of her death. My mom never wanted me. Sheâ€™s had like 4 abortions, maybe more, who knows at this point. But my dad forced her to have me and then had the nerve to not even show up to the hospital to sign my birth certificate. Itâ€™s so wrong on so many levels and youâ€™ve got to be a sick fuck in order to do something so incomprehensible. I guess thatâ€™s why I feel so stuck and lost now. When you come from something like that what are you supposed to do with the rest of your life? I mainly feel cursed. Love is one of the best parts about being alive and since Iâ€™ll never experience my family loving me whatâ€™s the point? Thereâ€™s romantic love but thatâ€™s really just built off the love that comes from your family so that wonâ€™t exist for me either. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life because I was never wanted here by anyone in the first place. Everything just feels vacant and painful.
