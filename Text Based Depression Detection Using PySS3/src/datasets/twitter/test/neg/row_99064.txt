Anyway I can help out a friend in need?I have this friend, seriously it isn't me. She is absolutely gorgeous, intelligent, fun to talk too etc. She has attempted suicide twice, and is pretty depressed all the time, but really good at hiding it. Her parents know, she sees a psychologist and might be institutionalized soon. 

Do you guys have any tips on how to talk/help her? She seems to be very self conscious about her weight although she isn't even slightly overweight, thinks she is a burden on her parents because they have to "deal" with her attempts and depression meds/doctor. 

I've been talking to her a lot recently and I really like her, she is a great person, never judging. How can I help, what should I avoid saying and what should I emphasize?
