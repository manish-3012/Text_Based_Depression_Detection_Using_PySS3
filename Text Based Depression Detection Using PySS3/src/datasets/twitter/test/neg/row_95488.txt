new hereI am self diagnosed with depression and have really bad anxiety. Iâ€™d like to share things about my mental health but Iâ€™m somehow unable to. I feel like nobody would care. Tbh I think of myself as a toxic person that only thinks about themselves. Iâ€™m considering ending it, but Iâ€™m too much of a coward and couldnâ€™t do that to my friends and parents.
