Iâ€™ve changed my mind and I donâ€™t want to die.So, some days ago I expressed the feeling of ending my life. Yes. My life still sucks but I wanted to recognise some signals. The day after I wrote my intentions, I woke up feeling slightly better. The very same day Iâ€™ve been called by the office with which I collaborate as freelance illustrator. The only office with which I collaborate for Iâ€™m too shy to propose my works outside this safe environment and Iâ€™ve been hired for a major project that will last until June 2020.
The pain of having been relinquished and hurt right after the passing of Mom by my last bf is still here, present and lively... the pain is still holding me with both hands but I donâ€™t want to die. I want to see if that life will bring me love for once in my life. A decent man who doesnâ€™t feel the need of rape me, beat me, insult me, betray me, humiliate me, abuse me and take me for granted. Someone who I crazy as me in believing in romanticism and kindness and tenderness and mutual respect. I know that happiness should comes from within but I accepted the fact that I am not that kind of person, anyway I will work on that with my therapist. It might be that the next week Iâ€™ll be suicidal again but I want to believe that there is something good for me in this fucking life. And I will start with some children booksâ€™ illustrations.
Hold on. Tomorrow may be slightly better, better enough to think that life can have another chance...
