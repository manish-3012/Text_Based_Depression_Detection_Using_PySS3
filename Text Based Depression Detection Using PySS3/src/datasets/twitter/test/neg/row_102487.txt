I can't stand to be in such a selfish worldOur thoughts are not our own, we have no free will. We are being controlled. Things are being hidden from us. Unspeakable horrors are occurring at the hands of people who we are told are protecting us. Humanity will never change. People may think they are making a difference, but when one problem is solved another is created. This is all because of selfishness. Everyone thinks of what will benefit them now, not what will benefit the world years down the line. Everyone merely wants money. And once you get money, you get bored. Your currency becomes human lives. Trafficking and slavery happening right under our noses. The planet is dying by our hands. Dare mention these things and you are called crazy. I have no desire to contribute to such a world.
