Looking for the right resources /should I get professional helpLast year on my birthday I walked into oncoming traffic, I barely thought about it, it just seemed like the most logical conclusion at the time, cars swerved around me until I gave up, I have a healthy social and family life, I have a beautiful girl who loves me but also a slight alcohol problem, I've had nightmares about headlights ever since.

I have diagnosed panic disorder,  depression and disordered eating,
I'm male, 6'1 and 120 pounds, every time I get drunk I think about suicide again, like tonight, I know it's selfish but it doesn't stop the feelings and I'm tied of keeping it to myself, so I thought I'd post on reddit  pathetically. 

I wish you all a fantastic evening/morning
