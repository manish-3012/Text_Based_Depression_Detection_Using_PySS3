ObsessedI'm completely and totally obsessed with trying to figure myself out. I'm only 19 but I feel like a total failure. I've dropped out of college 3 times, I have no friends, no relationship, I'm broke and I'm making minimum wage. I analyze my every move and action and thought. I've lost passion, I have no motivation for anything. I just lay in bed and think about how much I suck and how I need to take action, but I never do. I feel trapped in my own brain and I can't stop thinking for 5 minutes. I just can't take it anymore, what's the point? Will this ever go away?
