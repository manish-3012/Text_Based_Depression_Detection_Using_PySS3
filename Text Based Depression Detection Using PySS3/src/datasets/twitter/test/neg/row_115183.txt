Forced life.Iâ€™m not allowed to die, so I live. 
It doesnâ€™t matter if I want to or not, I told myself that I would wait until after my dad died. No parent should bury their child, so I waited. He died last year but blood still pulses through my veins. My daughter deserves to have a father, she shouldnâ€™t suffer because of my inadequacy. 

Iâ€™m not allowed to die, so I live. 
Maybe after she graduates high school. Whatâ€™s another 7 years after surviving 30? 

Sure I have other responsibilities and obligations. My partner and their child depend on me. 

Iâ€™m not allowed to die, so I live. 
My siblings, though not close, still would have pain related to my death. They might even blame themselves which would be unfair. Perhaps there are people to blame, but it doesnâ€™t matter. The events that caused this are in the past. Where they should stay. 

Why canâ€™t I die? I donâ€™t wish to take my life, just that it didnâ€™t exist. Who even decides someoneâ€™s worth? Can I get a refund? 

Iâ€™m not allowed to die, not yet, but one day.
