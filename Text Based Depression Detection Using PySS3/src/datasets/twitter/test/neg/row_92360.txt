From suicide.Iv lost 2 people very important to me. Iv had anxiety. Depression and tourettes that I have to go through. A few months ago to a year I was playing with the thought of suicide. And staying inside all day not wanting to go out. Now to this day, I love nature and love going outside. I push the thought of suicide away and love life. I'm happy.
