â€œIn the darkest time, I have always believed, the light will shineâ€First, if youâ€™re reading this I just want to tell you that youâ€™re an amazing person. A beautiful individual with an amazing meaning in life. You may not know that right now, but you are. If youâ€™re here bc youâ€™re in a dark place or feel alone let me be one of the many people/(or the first) to tell you that YOU ARE NOT. Whatever youâ€™re going through right now is a part of your purpose in life. This small part of your life is what will define who you are. Please donâ€™t hold anything in and please donâ€™t put a smile over how you truly feel. Donâ€™t hide your pain behind a smile bc it will build up. I have battled depression for 7 years and looking back on it today I appreciate that part of my life everyday bc I am stronger then I could ever imagined. Please if you need help reach out to me anytime. I donâ€™t judge, I donâ€™t criticize. I just want to help and guide you through the darkness so that you can see the light and embrace the beautiful love, joy and happiness that there is. I love you
