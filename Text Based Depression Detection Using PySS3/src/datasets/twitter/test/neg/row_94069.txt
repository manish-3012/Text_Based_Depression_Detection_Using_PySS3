Every relationship I have goes wrongI have trouble holding relationships. My most recent girlfriend and I had plans to get together and hang out today but she said she wasn't feeling good. I went to drop her off some ice cream with a note that I hoped she feels better and there was another car in the parking lot. 
  Every relationship I have tends to end this way and I've come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with me. Idk what it is but I can't take the hurt anymore. I just want to end the suffering but I don't want anyone else to feel like it is their fault. 
I'm worried that I'll hurt my brother and the rest of my family but idk what to do anymore. I hurt all the time. I just want to disappear.
I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes I've been drinking a lot.
