I told the closest person to me about how suicidal I've been feeling. Now I want to go even more.He said I'd be selfish and causing him a lot of pain and that people care. Despite this, I've been through a lot and no longer want to stick around; a lot hasn't gone right in my life including my relationship with him, which mattered the most to me. I also have an off my chest post anyone can read that relates to my descendence into depression. I told him truthfully how I love and care for him. I'm thankful for everything he has done for me including the wish he helped make come true. After saying he loved me and didn't want anything to happen to me, then he changed his mood all of a sudden and won't  even hold my hand or talk to me really. I'm spending the night with him but I'm scared once I leave, he'll never talk to me again and that makes me even more sad and hopeless. I want to kill myself much sooner, before my own personal deadline of before Jan 17th. Sorry for lack of format or whatever, I don't care much right now.
