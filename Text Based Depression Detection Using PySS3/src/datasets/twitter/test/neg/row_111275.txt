Fuck..I don't think I can do this anymore. Held on far too long and my boyfriend, my everything, will not even explain why he left me. Says its not anything I did. But that's it. Won't come speak to me in person. We just lose our second to a miscarriage so ..now he's gone there is nothing for me. I don't give any fucks..:(
