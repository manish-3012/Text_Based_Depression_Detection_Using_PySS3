Thank you reddit strangersI just want to post here that over a year ago I was ready to end my life. If it wasn't for a stranger that took the time to listen to me and talk me down, I might not be here. Sure, it took a few times and is was a rocky road. My life has not returned to what is was but on the bright side I am still here to see another day, hug my kids and tell them I love them. Life is worth living and I will fight for each day I am blessed to be give.
