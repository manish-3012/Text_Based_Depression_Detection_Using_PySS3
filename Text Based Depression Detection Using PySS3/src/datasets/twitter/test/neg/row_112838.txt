TomorrowOne of these days I'll wake up, and I'll be happy for the first time in 5 years. Happy because there's an end in sight. Happy because I won't have to worry anymore. Happy because no more pain, depression, or frustration is to be felt. Happy because I no longer have to worry about being a failure. Happy because tomorrow will never come.
