Denying Death, but Accepting InevitabilityIt seems like I only ever see people that are either not suicidal, or right on the edge. Maybe that's all there is and I'm weird, maybe I'm just not looking hard enough, or maybe society has just trained us that that's what it is so it's hard to talk about the inbetween. 

That's where I fall. I'm not worried about making it to tomorrow. Nor even next year. It's not even that hard to imagine 5 or even 10 on better days. I can see myself finding success in whatever I find after graduating, and if I'm lucky even finding a handful of people who will bless my days with their presence however fleeting. 

But all of that wears on your soul. It weighs you down with new baggage, and add new layers to old issues. It gives you a brief glimpse of that thing that seems to be missing. That piece that puts the whole picture together. It's a small, constant grind, slowly chipping away and wearing you down. 

Eventually that wear will put me at a point where the knowledge that I will NEVER have whatever little piece it is I'm missing will be more comforting than the torture of living one more day without it. And that will be the day that by what ever method is least scary to me at the time, I will tick my last tock. 

You can PM me, but I won't get them. I've already forgotten the password to this account.
