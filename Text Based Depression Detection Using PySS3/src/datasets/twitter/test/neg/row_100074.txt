I need to be hospitalized again. If I do, though, my life will crumble around me.Iâ€™m 21. Iâ€™ve never been this suicidal in my life. Iâ€™ve been forcibly institutionalized, and have had depression for 9 years, but It is taking an insurmountable amount of energy to not end it. I havenâ€™t shown up to class in 2 weeks. I have an amazing internship that Iâ€™m missing. I just donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve been in bed. 

I need to be hospitalized before I kill myself. But I live on campus. If I get kicked out of school or go on leave and have to go home, Iâ€™ll be sent back to my abusers. 

If I get kicked out of school for being in the hospital, I wonâ€™t be eligible for any summer internships. The life Iâ€™ve worked so hard for will be ruined. 

Someone, help. Any advice would be great.
