My life is a cruel jokeI hate it, I just want to die. I don't want to be trans, I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to feel hopeless every time I look into a mirror or take a shower. 

I hate my deformed face and body, I hate hearing my own voice. I'm a freak. 

I can't fucking wait till I have enough courage to end it. It's just not worth it, living like this.
