pls tell me im not alone?am i the only one who feels sad all the time but cant tell anyone? i dont rlly have anything much to be sad about (well nothing i havent been able to deal with for the past 2 years). maybe its the fact everything bad that happens doesnt seem bad to me it just seems normal? i recenly moved schools so i dont have many friends ( well not close ones anyways). i used to cry all the time but now ig it just stopped? i dont cry i just sit in school or anywhere thinking about what my life would be like if i wasnt me. if i didnt grow up how i did. if i didnt constantly make mistakes. if i didnt seem like a failure to my parents. i also get so so mad over little things and idk how to conrol it. i know that i cant get help because i cant talk to any of my family about this shit. idk ig im just a bit confused about a few things as i dont rlly have anyone to guide me.
