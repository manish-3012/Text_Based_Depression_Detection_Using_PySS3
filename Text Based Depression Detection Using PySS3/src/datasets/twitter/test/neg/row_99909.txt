rock bottom again.i don't know why i'm writing this but maybe its good to get things off my chest? im at the bottom of myself again... constantly spiraling, too many drugs, i lost everything again. i haven't been on my medication in months. i tried to kill myself twice this week.. even when i was up. i don't think i'll make it past friday. i'm crazy but at least im fucking free. goodbye reddit. goodbye world
