How do you minimize the pain caused by hanging?I've heard that the most painful way of going about it is with no padding on the rope with the rope digging into the front of your throat. Is it true that it can be a lot less painful if you were to put padding on the rope and have the rope dig into the side of your neck? I'm asking for a friend.
