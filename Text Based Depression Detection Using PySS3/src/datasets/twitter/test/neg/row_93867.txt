I canâ€™t do anything rightI canâ€™t do homework right. I canâ€™t dress the right way. I canâ€™t express my gender correctly. I canâ€™t fall in love with the right people the right way. I canâ€™t talk to my therapist properly. I canâ€™t talk to my friends properly. I canâ€™t label my gender or sexuality right. I canâ€™t think right. I donâ€™t even have adhd the right way apparently because I somehow have good grades despite it. I canâ€™t do anything in a way that makes others happy with me, nor will others accept me or see my struggles because I have the wrong ones. I canâ€™t even make myself happy. Why was I ever born? Why am I still alive?
