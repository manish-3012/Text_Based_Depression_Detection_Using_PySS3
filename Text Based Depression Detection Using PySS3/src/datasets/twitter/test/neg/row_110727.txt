I set a dateI have a date now, and a plan. I can't live like this anymore. I'm always getting fucking yelled at, nothing I ever do is good enough. I can't live this way anymore and I have no way out.  Nov 4 won't get here fast enough. 1 month to get things straight and then finally peace.  Fuck everyone.
