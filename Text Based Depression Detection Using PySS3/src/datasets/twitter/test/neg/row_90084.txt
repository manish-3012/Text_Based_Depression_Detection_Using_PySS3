I lost my job..Well, my life is even shittier today.

I was disabled (lot better, still some issues), so I needed a work at home job. Found one last year, was good. But, as time went on they made some changes and I no longer wanted to be there. So, I started applying elsewhere and finally got an interview for a different WAH company. Got the job. It paid a bit more and I was excited. We had our training orientation on Tuesday that was 8hrs long. During it my internet went out. For 3 hours. I called the company, waited, etc. After it finally came back up, I was told by my trainer that because I missed so much Iâ€™d have to start with the next training class. So, Iâ€™m waiting to hear back and all. Finally get a call today telling me Iâ€™m done. Because I missed it and itâ€™s mandatory, I canâ€™t continue nor apply for the same position in the future. Lovely.

We work from home.. the internet going out wasnâ€™t my doing, but it seems like theyâ€™d be a bit understanding. Obviously orientation is important but I didnâ€™t know that was gonna happen. Generally my service is very good. They were doing scheduled maintenance. I left my previous job because I had secured this one. Now I have neither. Iâ€™m so sad. I donâ€™t even know what to do. I have bills. Now I have no job... I was told Iâ€™d still be employed would just have to start a bit later. I want to kill myself.
