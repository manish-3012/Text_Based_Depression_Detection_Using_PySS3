Not suicidal, but uncomfortableI just feel like out of control? I mean I have a history of suicidal ideation and attempts, but not it's like every moment is unbearable and I just want to end it all. And I know I won't do it tonight but I feel unstable and like I'm going insane just from how intolerable life is. Is that depression? Or am I just wild?
