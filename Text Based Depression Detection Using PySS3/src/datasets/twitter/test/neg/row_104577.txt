fucking useless = meI'm just living to die the next fucking day, again, and again, and again. Nobody is left. Nobody I can talk to. I'm becoming a mute by the day.

I can't change myself, no matter how much I want to. Its always the same circle. 

My life is a JOKE. I am a joke. 

I can't be with just my head anymore. I fucking hate my head. It's all it's fault. Wish I had a gun so I could put one right between my eyes. Fuck this country for making it so hard to buy a firearm.

I know there's nobody that can help me, I just want my head to be quiet for once.
