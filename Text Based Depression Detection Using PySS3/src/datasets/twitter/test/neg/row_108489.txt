I'm a total loser that not deserve anyone's loveGuys, anyone, I don't know where to begin..

Where i live, this kind of problem is treated as fucking disgrace, no official hotline or anything, all volunteer text number are dead. I don't know who or where to reach...

Anyway here i am a total fucking loser, 26 with a fucking low income job considering all the people i know have more money than me, have a severe anxiety and gerd problems, and other shit things that happened inside me

Whenever i see the fucking social media, i just want to end it all... Seeing all of my friends with their cars, homes, girlfriend, or even their wives makes me really feel hopeless

I was the best student on college, even the average guy from my college doing sooo much better than me, what the fuck did i do wrong? 

Sure my family loves me, my mom loves me, but do you ever wanted to be loved by other person, like NOT from your family? 

I've tried to thinking positively, but it just doesn't work. All the bullshit quotes and internet article are worthless

Now, almost every night, I'm thinking to ending this, I'm just worried about my mom, on how she's going to take it if i do it... 

All i wanted just to unexist, not to die or suicide, just unexist... Erase away all the fucking memory
