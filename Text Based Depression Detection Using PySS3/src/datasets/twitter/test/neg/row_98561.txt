I can't keep going on alone like thisThe feelings just get more intense and I only ever feel relief when I'm on the cusp of killing myself. 
I tried overdosing on pills last night and ended up throwing them up. I don't know what to do. Talking won't help because nobody understands or feels what I'm feeling. I just this to be over.
