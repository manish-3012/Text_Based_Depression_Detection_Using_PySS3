Iâ€™m back guysFeeling really hopeless and shit, I just feel like Iâ€™d be better off not here, and fucking living hurts, Iâ€™m sick of trying to fight this addiction. Living like this is fucking dehumanising. I just want to die than no one would have to deal with me anymore and Iâ€™d be at peace, not constantly struggling and fighting with myself and others anymore. I just wanna be happy ya know, normal. Not wanting to die or cut every 2 seconds. To live a normal life where I can have a job relationship and just be happy. Not slicing my thighs up and not being able to trust myself around the medicine cabinet. I donâ€™t want to attempt again either in case I end up paralysed or cause myself severe brain damage. I just feel stuck. No moving forward to the future and no going back to a few years ago where I was happy and was able to honestly say â€œIâ€™m fineâ€. Iâ€™m just doing it for the people I care for at this point, because I love them too much and donâ€™t want them suffering when Iâ€™m dead
