numbI want to feel something. I haven't taken my meds in months and I don't feel any difference when I did. My boyfriend doesn't even love me. He's lying if he says he does. Im not worth anybody's time or space. I feel trapped in this sad world and I don't know what else to do. I feel like the only thing to do is just disappear and be like I was never here. I don't want to live this life anymore.
