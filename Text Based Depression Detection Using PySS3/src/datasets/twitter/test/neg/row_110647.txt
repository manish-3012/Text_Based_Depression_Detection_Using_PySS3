Clinic lost me during transfer, do I have options besides the ER?It's been a battle for years to find ways to stop myself to do it.

I've been lost in transfer 1.5 months ago. I have a newborn at home. I'm not sure where to find help urgently because there's waiting lists for psychiatrists/therapists.

I have an appointment this friday with the psychiatrist who's clinic lost me. He cannot help me with treatment, he's more of a prescription filler.

On a double dose of depression meds, have used different ones in the past, haven't found working treatment yet.

Can someone convince me to call the suicide hotline pls
