I'm tired of everything. Life isn't for me after all.I'm tired of having double the responsibilities of everyone at work because i have a key but being paid the same wage. 

I'm tired of heaving no family because i've been abandoned as a child. 

I tried to buy a dog because i was feeling lonely and shitty but i ended up getting scammed 500$  

And now i'm learning that i'll have to pay my rent 200$ more just because my roommate decided he wanted to leave 2 weeks after the new lease started. 

Honestly life has soom good in it but it doesn't outweighs the bad. I'm a good for nothing with a minimum wage,an unfinished education and soon i'll just be a speedbump on the metro line. Fuck all of this life i hope it gets better for you guys.
