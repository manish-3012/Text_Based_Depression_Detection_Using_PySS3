Many minor attempts, might "get lucky"For as long as I can remember, I've been sad. When I've grown to, 32 now, it's become note ingrained. But it's always there. 

I've been working hard on a difficult task for years now, and now that I'm close to the biggest thing in my prefessional life, maybe as soon as Monday, I've lost all will. I have zero internal drive. Never felt like that before. 

It reminds me of the intro in Sin City; "I'm sick of running...". 

I've had maybe 3-4 close calls, but never a full blown attempt. Half attempts. 

In the past month I ended a long term relationship, even though both did not want to, and this did not help. 

On top of all, my SSRI prescription, the one thing sustaining me the last 7 years, ran out before Christmas. Got a new fill today. 

But regardless, it won't leave. And I've figured out a way in which I could succeed by accident. But to not give anyone here ideas, I won't give details. 

So at this point, I would give myself about a 50/50 chance. Getting back on meds will hopefully push things forward. But I'm not made to feel good. I never did. Never will. It's partly in my genes, partly just the luck of the roll. 

This is the first time I've ever copped to this, and it's ironically making me feel weirdly good. Honesty for once.
