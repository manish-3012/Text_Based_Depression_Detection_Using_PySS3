I am going to kill myselfWhy am I writing here? I donâ€™t know. Maybe I feel lost. Iâ€™m just a teenager after all. I am only 17.  Can you believe it huh? Maybe itâ€™s my hormones. But who the hell knows. All I know is that I feel the most devastating feeling. Why? I donâ€™t exactly know. All I know is that this is my last night. Well let me start I guess. 

I donâ€™t have parents. They both died in a car crash when I was 5. Everyone always makes fun of me for that. Stupid reason huh? I didnâ€™t choose it. I forgot how real parents love feels like. 

I did have a boyfriend. 3 years actually. Started out pretty young aha. He dumped me 2 days ago. I think I was actually in love but who am I to know? I hope he reads this somehow. I donâ€™t know if that was love but I could never imagine a better feeling than that. I was the happiest girl. He always listened, supported me. Showed me to everyone in his life. I lost my virginity only 3 months ago with him. You know what? Maybe thatâ€™s it. I am starting to realise it just now. He started pulling away. For the last few days he didnâ€™t want to go out because I wasnâ€™t interesting enough. A few more days and he tells me that he is done with me. Why? Because â€˜Iâ€™m a fucking idiot without any brainsâ€™. Yes thatâ€™s the reason. What did I say? Nothing. I just broke everything I had around me. 

I am wonderful in school. I learn everyday until about 1am. I am so tired I canâ€™t take it anymore. I wanted to study in a uni but everyone said I wasnâ€™t good enough so why even try? I was bullied all my life. Why? I also donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not good enough. I donâ€™t have a single friend. It was only him. Not a single one. 

What I feel right now isnâ€™t what I wanted from life. I fought so hard but I give up. I know I know, I am so young, so many things waiting for me. Well I donâ€™t want to know whatâ€™s waiting for me. What I feel isnâ€™t happiness. Not even a little bit. My heart hurts physically. I think I am finally strong enough. 

I want to say sorry to my grandma and my brother. I love you but I canâ€™t. I guess Iâ€™ll meet my parents soon.  Although I donâ€™t believe in afterlife. And to my ex lover - You promised you would always be here. Look at me know. Are you happy? You told me to do it. 

Have a great night everyone. Life is amazing, never forget that.
