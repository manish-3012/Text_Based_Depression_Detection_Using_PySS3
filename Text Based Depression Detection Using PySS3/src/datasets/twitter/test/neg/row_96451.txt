Loneliness killsIâ€™ve been alone my whole life. No family. No woman to love that loved me. It really is getting close. Women never did take to me, and itâ€™s way past being to late. Iâ€™ll be 59 soon and thereâ€™s no one out there that I would want who would want me. Iâ€™m really bitter on life, and to be honest, I just wanna go.
