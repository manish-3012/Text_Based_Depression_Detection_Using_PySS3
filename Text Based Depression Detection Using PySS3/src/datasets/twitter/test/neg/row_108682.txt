Not sure why people keep telling me that I should be thankful for my birthday because I get to see another day when I don't even want to be here.My birthday is coming up in a few days and I'm really not excited about it. I have expressed to my friends and family that I'm not excited for my birthday and they keep telling me that I should be happy that I lived to see another day. I honestly don't really care that I lived to see another day. I would rather be dead and not be here anymore so why in the world would I be excited to be here another day?
