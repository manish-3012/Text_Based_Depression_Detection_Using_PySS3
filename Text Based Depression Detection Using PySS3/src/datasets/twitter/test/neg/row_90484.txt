There's too much painI'm 24, I've been to the psych ward four times in the past year, I just get treated like shit then I feign being alright when I can't bear it anymore. I'll never take their horrible sadistic fucking medications ever again. The last time I went I met a crackhead who I moved in with for three months, got to lose my virginity and feel love for the first time in my life. Then she dumped me and the loneliness has just eaten away at me. I have no driver's license, no high school, no energy. I do not have a single friend or any social skills, I'm a shut in. I've been abusing my adderall and staying up for days, pretty much just ruminating on my loneliness. I don't enjoy anything, even music is torture to me now, and I realize I'm too fucked up to ever learn how to drive or get a job let alone find another woman. 

I'm going to take the whole bottle of oxycodone my dad had from some surgery and never used then I'm putting the vacuum cleaner on the stairwell and hanging myself as soon as I run out of adderall and cigarettes. Fuck everyone and everything, this was such a horrible existence and I am so glad to finally be free of this world that demands so much of me. 

I hope the fucking gods throw me back to a time when I could just live without having to drive, compete for jobs and know stupid social bullshit to feel the warm body of a woman. This is pure hell.
