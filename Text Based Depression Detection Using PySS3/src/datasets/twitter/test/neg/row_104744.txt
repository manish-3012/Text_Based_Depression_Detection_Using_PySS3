Losing the fightIt's been 5 years, and the depression has upped its game, and I can't keep it up anymore. I've been on the breaking point about 5 times in the last week and a half, the only reason I didn't do anything is my housemates found me crying, or I went to them to apologize, but most days I can barely find a reason to want to stay. My self-harm is deteriorating and my life is changing too much, my only constant is my housemates, and they are all busy. My ex from about 2 and a bit years ago has started talking to me, I don't think I want to go into the field I'm doing my degree, unless I can work in one area, which is impractical because of my needs. My dad has cancer, and the drugs are destroying his body and most of the time I just want to be alone, I can't even find the will to live for my boyfriend or family. I can't do it anymore. I hope to be able to get online again tomorrow, I think I will be able to hold on that long, but I don't know if I want to.
