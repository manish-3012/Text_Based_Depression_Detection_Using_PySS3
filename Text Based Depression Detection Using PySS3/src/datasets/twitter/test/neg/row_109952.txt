Its all been an actI can't remember the last time i talked to a person as myself. I just don't feel anything for anyone anymore. I can't remember how its like being happy. I just feel so utterly sad all the time. Its been like this for years now, but i feel like i can't do it anymore. I hate myself. I hate every person i know. I hate my school. I hate this city. I just hate everything. 

Pain has been my escape for so long, but it does not help as much anymore. I just want it all to end, but i fear where i might go when i finally muster the strenght to end my life.

I can't have a good nights sleep any more. I spent most of the night aimlessly walking around hoping that i somehow could think about a way to keep going, but everything i can think of is how i hate myself for everything. 

This is pretty much a pray for help. I've never told anyone how i really feel before, and I've hid my scars. I just dont know what to do anymore
