I'm immobilized by money.I loath my life and hate being poor. 

Money continually immobilizes me and my plans for the future, the present, and even happiness.

I just want to kill myself sometimes...I can't fucking do anything and it's incredibly frustrating for me. 

i can't even enjoy life and go drive somewhere at the scenery.....because i always have to worry about money..and gas

i really would rather not be alive than to live like this.
