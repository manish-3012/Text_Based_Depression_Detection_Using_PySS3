We tell suicidal people to talk, instead we should tell everyone else to listen.Every text trying to prevent suicide tells the "victim" to talk about its problems.


So you actually get some courage and talk, and.. No one is willing to help you. 
People don't care and professionals either. 


I'm not surprised (but I'm still saddened) so many people actually commit suicide. 

When we always read "speak!", and then no one cares it's like a punch to the guts. 

What am I supposed to do, then?
