Iâ€™m shakingIâ€™m shaking so much every fiber of my body is on edge itâ€™s soo much worse than last time. Your sadistic laugh is echoing though my mind. Help me Iâ€™m drowning I can breath I canâ€™t take it. Itâ€™s too much Iâ€™m not strong enough for this Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m so so sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Sorry sorry sorry. Im in so much pain i canâ€™t take it . My heart is betting uncontrollably out of my chest the I want to scream but nothing will come out. I want to cry but my eyes are clogged I need to escape this. I need the  pain to end I canâ€™t take it. I canâ€™t take it. Someone please put me out of my misery please I beg you.
