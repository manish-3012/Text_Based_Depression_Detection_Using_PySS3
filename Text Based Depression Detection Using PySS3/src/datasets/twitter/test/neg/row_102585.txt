No desire seems worth itToday I have only been confronted with the BS in this world. The struggles of trying to sustain yourself, the cruelties of the political system. And then you just wonder do I want to go through that. I'm still in high school, I am far from being able to claim I've really struggled, really been at the bottom. Yet, even at this stage I cannot grasp why I want to go through with it all. That combined with the occasional demon of self-hate peeking its head now and again, which recently really go to me and had me believe I would end it that day. Usually I would just vent or ask for help on discord, but I can't speak of this to my friends there they too are fighting. Being all down might pull them with me. Doing it anywhere else on discord I know I"ll get the messages I've read before: "contact a hotline" I can't do that. There is so little I can do, not because I am physically incapable to. But just because of me, this weak spirit. It's so weak I can't do simple tasks without forsaking everything. I am useless. And they only way for that to change is to not be stuck like this. But do I want to be able to do things? Is wanting anything even worth it? I just know I'm disregarding a lot of things but everything feels so closed down on me. Naturally I am the problem.
