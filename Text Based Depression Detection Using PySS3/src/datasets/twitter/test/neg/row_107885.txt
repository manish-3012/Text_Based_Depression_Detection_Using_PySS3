I want to die but i'm scared of the pain.I just failed my test. My GPA is dropping. I can't focus anymore i don't see the point. I don't want to be around family I feel like i am nothing to them.

I started cutting again its even worse then before. I just want to feel like I am worthy or at least good at something at this point I just feel like I'm wasting others time or i'm stressing them out. I just want to die the thing is i'm probably going to hit that date in a few days...im sorry. I don't know if i'll make it past new years.
