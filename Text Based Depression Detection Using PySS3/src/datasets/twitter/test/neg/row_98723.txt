Oh god please just help me :(I'm so scared, so fucking scared, I am going to kill myself. I don't want to but this sadness, this loneliness is unbearable I seriously cannot do this anymore. It's been a long ten years of battling a mental illness and I have no shred of hope for the future left. I am currently at uni studying social work and I have a great casual job and a job interview for a disability support worker next week but this depression is debilitating, none of that stuff matters I don't think I will ever, ever recover. Please help, I don't know what to do. I have a rope tied up in my closet for when I gather up the courage to do it.
