I want to kill myself, but can't(i also posted this on r/confession, with a few changes here, so i apologize if you see the same thing twice. i just felt like it belonged here more.)  
I haven't been happy in such a long time. I see no reason to live. I don't have any friends. I'm almost 20 and I've never had a boyfriend or even kissed anyone. I'm ugly and fat and stupid. My body is so disgusting and scarred and fat and lardy that no one would ever want to be with me. Everyone hates me.
I've been thinking about suicide since I was probably 11. I want to kill myself more than anything in the world. The only thing that stops me is my mom. I love her so much, she's my best friend, and I know it would absolutely kill her, especially since she suffers from depression just like I do.
But that doens't stop me from cutting, burning, and self harming any way I can. I just deserve to feel pain. I hate myself. I want to die as soon as possible. I wish I could just get hit by a car or something like that so I wouldn't be blamed for it. I also have cancer which I know is a huge burden on my family, which I hate. I just can't stand being alive. Every day feels like torture. I hate myself.
