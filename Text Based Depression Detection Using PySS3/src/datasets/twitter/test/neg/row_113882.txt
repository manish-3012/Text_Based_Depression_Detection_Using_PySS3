I dont know whats wrong w meok backstory ive been in recovery for a long time and lately i *have* been feeling better. I had a breakdown in a long time tonight and, I felt suicidal to the point I unintentionally set an actual date for it? like I thought to myself â€œif Iâ€™m going to do it it has to be when ___â€ without realizing it. but short time after those suicidal thoughts the feelings kinda disappeared. what is wrong with me??? Iâ€™m drunk
