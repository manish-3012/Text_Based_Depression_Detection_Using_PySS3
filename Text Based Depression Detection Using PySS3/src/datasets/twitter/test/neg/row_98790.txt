I Hate MyselfI do this every night. Every night I go through the same stages. Every night I decide that I no longer want to be alive, and I sit there and think about how Iâ€™m going to do it and how there are so many people that would be better off if I werenâ€™t here and how obnoxious and intolerable and grating and despicable I am and how nobody would notice if I didnâ€™t get up tomorrow morning. Every night I write a suicide note and every night I write it directed toward somebody I  care about even though they donâ€™t care about me. The other day I tried to make a list of people I really enjoy being around, I got to three and was stumped. Then I tried to make a list of people I know feel the same way about me. It was three people shorter.
