My dumb dadthis isnt too much on suicide, but this moron's childish behaviour is really getting on my nerves. My extremely dumb dad doesn't even know what independence is and honestly i just cant deal with this man any longer. i just want to escape that idiot because he is giving me headaches and is such an unfair bastard! He always yells at me, yet i cant yell back at him. He takes what i own as if it were his. Really now. This idiot doesnt even know what independence is. He cant even accept the truth either because he is sooooooooo dumb. In an agruement he always loses and because of this decideds to use his "power" to literally punish me. Over what? A dumb arguement! but nooo this fucking guy has a mind of a  literal a 5 year old! (hes basically kim jong un because he also has "power"). I swear to damn god that one day he NEEDS to be called out on this shit and he will have no choice but to accept the permenent mental damage he did to me!

I was also very mad when i wrote this, but granted this is also supposed to sum up how long he kept on doing his childish behaviours. I do hope this guy changes. Like for real. Because he always fails whenever he even tries to fix himself.
