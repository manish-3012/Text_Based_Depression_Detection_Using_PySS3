Iâ€™m scared that my ex boyfriend will kill him selfI was wrong. I was straight up wrong. Please donâ€™t dig the knifed deeper into my wound. I should have ended our relationship before it began. Iâ€™m sorry. I will never forgive myself. He has nothing. What do I do? The medical system is awful he cannot go to the psych ward. What do I do????
