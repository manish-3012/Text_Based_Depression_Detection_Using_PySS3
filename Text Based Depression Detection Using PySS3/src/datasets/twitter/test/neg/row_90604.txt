How long can you wait for something before it's not worth it to live?Long story short, I'm in a job that I despise with people I cannot stand. As Woody Allen said, I'm not a morose person, and I usually don't dislike people. I know exactly what I want to do and am capable of doing it (and that is go to graduate school) but I will have to wait until fall of 2014 before I could even start a graduate program. Sounds like the ultimate non-dilemma with a simple solution: wait it out. But I can't wait that long because of how detrimental this job is to my self-esteem and personality and how purposeless every action I do is now that I have the knowledge I am in the wrong place. Everything I do between now and graduate school is not living, it is keeping myself alive. I have friends, I laugh, I eat, but I am just wasting my time, waiting for my life to actually begin. 

I have never considered suicide until now, and I find it incredibly calming. When I am miserable and stressed, I remind myself that life is a choice and that I could just as easily choose not to live. Several people would miss me, but then again, if they're really that sad, they don't have to live either. Either you buck up and deal with life without complaining or you take action to end it. And I personally have anything that needs doing in the next 50 years and nobody for whom I am responsible.

So: who has gone through something similar? Who has had to wait? And how did you deal with it?
