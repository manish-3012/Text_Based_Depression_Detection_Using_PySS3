I keep screaming but god won't answerHonestly i don't really know why I'm posting this. I don't care if people try to help me, i kinda just wanted to say it and get it off my chest because I don't know who else to tell.

I want to kill myself. Or just spontaneously die, I don't really care how it happens. I wish I was never born. I hate my family for bringing me into this world. I hate the people who care about me for forcing me to stay. I hate myself for many reasons, but right now I especially hate myself for being so afraid of the possibility of fucking up another suicide attempt. 

I wish I died the first time I tried to kill myself. I wish I had a gun so I could be sure I wouldn't fuck up again because I don't know how many times I've tried. I don't care if things get better. I don't care if I can feel good. I don't care about anything. I dont want to be here and i don't know why I'm still trying at all. I hate myself so fucking much, I really wish someone would kill me.
