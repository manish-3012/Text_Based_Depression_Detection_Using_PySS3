I feel stuck, and I canâ€™t stop thinking about ending things.My marriage is failing. Iâ€™m in love with someone else, but theyâ€™re married. Iâ€™m trying to fix my marriage, but counseling isnâ€™t helping. I canâ€™t stop thinking about the what ifâ€™s, but I know Iâ€™ll never be with this person. It doesnâ€™t feel like anything will ever change for the better. Things will change of course, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever feel okay. Iâ€™m struggling with MDD and C-PTSD, and I canâ€™t afford to get on meds. I feel trapped in my pain, trapped in my marriage, and trapped in my life circumstances. It feels like Iâ€™m in a hole I will never be able to crawl out of. I have no support. I donâ€™t feel like anyone really cares about me. The thought of ending things looks better everyday. I have plans to leave I just canâ€™t get past the fear of following through with them. What happens if I do? I donâ€™t think I have the courage to face it, but I donâ€™t have the strength to stay. I donâ€™t want to live, but I donâ€™t want to die
