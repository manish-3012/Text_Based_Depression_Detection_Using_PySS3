I might actually kill myself tomorrow or the next day. What should I consider to make sure this is what I want to do?Iâ€™ve located what I hope is a suitable spot. I have an open window on the 17th story of a building that I can access at the wee hours of the night. Iâ€™m thinking I would jump at 4-5 AM. There is concrete (or if itâ€™s not, somewhat hard - itâ€™s some sort of hard tile) below. Recently, my pain and unhappiness has become unbearable enough to where I am legitimately considering jumping and pushing through the short but likely intense-ish pain from hitting the ground. Iâ€™ve read that something that is good to do is to wait a day or two, to make sure you really want to do this and that itâ€™s not an impulse decision. What things should I take into consideration to make sure this is what I really want to do? Thank you for any help in advance.
