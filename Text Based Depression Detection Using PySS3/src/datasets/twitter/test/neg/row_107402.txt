Sliced my neck openWent well, as you can tell from my being able to post this.

I now have a lot of glue in my neck and have triggered my chronic illness to flare. My skin burns all over. Already sliced my wrist open a couple of days ago - again, clearly not well enough.

Hospital sent me home with antibiotics and told me to stop trying to kill myself this week please.

I'm still sadly very much alive and now permanently and extensively scarred. Brilliant.
