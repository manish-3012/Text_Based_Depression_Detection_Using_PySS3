iâ€™m completely lostiâ€™ve been suicidal for 2 years and 2 months now. i started college in september and i have no fucking idea what to do with my life. i failed my first semester so i changed my major but iâ€™m still failing because iâ€™m not motivated. iâ€™m dreaming of studying music but schools are too expensive and too far away. 
i am morbidly insecure about my physical appearance and i get mean comments about it on a daily basis. i am afraid of going outside because of it. everytime i am in public, i blush, sweat a lot, shake and stutter. iâ€™ve always hated school as far as i can remember, because i was bullied and i was bullying people. 
now i have no friends in college. iâ€™m back home from college for spring break and i hate it because i donâ€™t get along with my family and i donâ€™t have friends here either. i prefer being in my apartment where i can play music as much as i want and have some peace and rest. 
i have no money and i canâ€™t work because iâ€™m underage. 
i am terribly weak. everyone is tired of hearing me say iâ€™m suicidal and they donâ€™t take me seriously anymore, although it takes everything i have for me to open up and admit that iâ€™m suicidal. i donâ€™t know what to do. 
iâ€™m begging you, please help me. i tried therapy multiple times. iâ€™ve been on medication for depression and to sleep better. nothing is working. i am going downhill and it needs to stop somewhere.
