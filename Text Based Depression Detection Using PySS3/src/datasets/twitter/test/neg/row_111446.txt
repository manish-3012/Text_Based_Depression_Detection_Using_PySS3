Just So TiredAll I have ever done is push myself to work harder, care about those around me, and try to make those around me happy.  The easy answer is to say, just don't care. I literally cannot do that. It makes me feel so good when I see others smile. And yet at the same time I hate that I have to make them smile and not me.   


I have had multiple friends and acquaintances come to tell me that it was because of me that they didn't commit suicide. that as they were about to pull the trigger or slit their wrists, they thought of me and how strong I was that they didn't do it. I love that they thought of me and yet I am in the same position. I feel guilty that I am a liar.  


I had a long abusive relationship that tore my heart to shreds. I know that it was a bad relationship but I wanted to help her. Following, I had another long term relationship that had repaired some of that pain but in the end destroyed me again. Not long ago, I thought I found something good, only to be told I am a "great person" but they are not ready. The only thing that keeps my head up is this stupid cat laying next to me.  


Like my title says, I am just so tired and it really seems like this isn't going to end. I will never be whole again. I will just be some broken form of what I was. I don't want to go on being this broken miserable mess.
