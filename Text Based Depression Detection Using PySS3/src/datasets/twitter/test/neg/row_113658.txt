Ive been taking medicine but it hasn't been working.I've been functioning normally as in going into work and keeping up with friends and family, but I still miss my soulmate. She was my other half, together for almost 8 years and I was close to killing myself when she wanted to seperate. It's been two months since then and I feel totally numb. I haven't found enjoyment in anything or felt true happiness. I know breakups take time, but the most time we spent apart was 11 days when she went on vacation with her family. Every day without her feels like the flame in my soul is slowly burning out. I've drank almost every day since then because that is the only thing that numbs the pain.

I was checked into a hospital about a week after the breakup, but it was awful. I didn't get any help at all and I was just ready to get out of there. I'm afraid to tell anyone I'm starting to feel the same because I don't want to be checked in again. I just miss my animals, my wife, and the life I had before. 

I've been going to a psychiatrist and the medicine worked for a little while, as in I felt some semblance of happiness, but I feel nothing now. She keeps upping the dosage but it's just not working. I don't know how much longer I can keep going.
