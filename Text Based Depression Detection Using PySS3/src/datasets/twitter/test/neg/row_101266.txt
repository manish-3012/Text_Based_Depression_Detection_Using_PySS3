All is takenMy life has been a great loss. Since the day I was born I have lost. My tranquility was taken from me. As the years go on, life takes my years. My experiences took my innocence. My childhood years were taken by my inability to run. Then I had to leave my homecountry due to bad people. The family that cared about me was taken from me. My friends were taken from me. Then school took my curiosity, my reading habits, my enjoyments and my relationship with my parents. My parents took my happiness, my entretainment, and my love. All has been taken from me. I only have one thing left to take but no one will take it. I will take it myself.
