My friend is suicidal and I really don't know how to helpTo preface, we're both 15, we used to go to the same school, I'm now home-schooled due to health issues, so we don't meet in person very much. I hadn't spoke to him in a few weeks when he messaged me asking if I'd care if he died. This was a shock as the last time we spoke he seemed fine. He told me he was depressed and suicidal and sent me photo of his leg with the word kill cut into it. I wanted to know if he was looking for attention or if it was a cry for help so I asked him how he would kill himself he told me he hid a stash of tablets in the forest nearby. I realised he was serious so I asked him a bit more, he is smoking marijuana as often as he can, he does very little exercise and is doing okay at school. Then we just played video games online afterwards. The next day I asked him if he had told anyone other than me but he hadn't. He didn't want his parents to know, and I didn't want to betray his trust. Over the next few days I managed to talk him out of smoking and he seemed to be improving but then I couldn't get in contact with him for 4 days. So I told his dad about his depression. Another week goes by and I finally hear from him. He says he might as well just kill himself, I ask him why, he says life sucks. So I ask him if he wants to play video games. He says yes and we talk. He is seeing a therapist but he isn't opening up to him about anything. Over the next two weeks the cycles continues of him telling me he is sad and wants to die and me dropping what I'm doing and trying to take his mind off of it then lying awake at night wondering if he is going to off himself. We're now at today and I'm really bummed out, my stress induced migraines are back and he is starting to piss me off. I don't want to tell him how much he is bothering me, but I can't do another two weeks of this.

Sorry for the text wall, but I really don't know what to do.
