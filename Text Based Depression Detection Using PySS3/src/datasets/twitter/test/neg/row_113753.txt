I'm so confusedI been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. My life is great now, things are perfect and I have everything I want, but then I'm thrown into a deep depression and I'm getting so tired. There's episodes where I'll feel so high and up that'd last for a month or two then I end up hitting a rock bottom low when nothing situation wise is wrong. I do t know what the fuck is wrong with me and I'm tired of feeling so up and down and so down to the point I'm extremely suicidal.
