unmotivatedThis is one of my alt accounts.

I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since 2017 but itâ€™s only been recently (since maybe april) that Iâ€™ve been thinking suicidal thoughts. Every single day I think about it more and more and itâ€™s becoming unbearable. Iâ€™m not motivated for life anymore, everything has just become so boring and mundane. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore, Iâ€™m so sick of not being able to sleep at night because my anxiety is keeping me up. Iâ€™m so sick of not being able to open up to people because Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™re going to leave me or betray me. Iâ€™m so sick of constantly worrying if Iâ€™m hurting people by saying how I truly feel in my emotions. For fucks sake I wasnâ€™t even able to open up to a therapist.

I donâ€™t want to hurt my friends or my family but in turn Iâ€™m just hurting myself and I just want it to be over with, Iâ€™m going to wait out until after my birthday when I can see my best friend again but I donâ€™t know what will happen after that.

Sorry if that was slightly ranting, this is my first time putting these thoughts into text.
