It has been a week.It was last week around this time that I was throwing up the pills that I had taken trying to kill myself. It seems weird because I am still pretty numb from within. I feel a little more trapped. My inability to face up to my stress buttons and failures as a human being are now more visible. I cooked eggs and ate proper meal for the first time in the week. Well, if you call sunny side up with 2 slices of bread a proper meal. 

I have not been to a hospital and I have not seen anyone yet. My failures seem manifold now. I don't know how to dig myself out of this hole. I am unable to cry or to tell someone what is happening. I just sent out an email to a doctor asking for an appointment to see her tomorrow. Even there I felt ashamed of having to beg for the appointment. And ashamed that I don't feel more ashamed. 

I keep having horrible flashes of thought where I keep fantasizing about slashing my wrists or drowning. But I don't think I want to do that really. It is just that right now my pile of problems seem so large and interlinked that I cannot think of a way to solve it. 

I don't know what to do but I wanted to thank you for reading. I just needed to tell someone how I truly felt.
