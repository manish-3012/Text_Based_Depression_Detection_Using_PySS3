Quit telling me to "never give up"Just let me die, quit relying on me. I don't have anything else to give you. Don't you understand? She was the only thing that gave my life meaning, that gave my life purpose. She's not coming back. She'll never come back. She was right to leave to. You are the fools for sticking around. Are you blind? Can't you see that the man you once knew has been dead for a long time. I'm not him, I'm just his corpse, I'm just the rotted remains of your friend. You're stupid for staying. the longer you stay the more painful it'll be for you. I'm too weak and tired to do anything about this. I'm gonna be like this until I finally bite the bullet, tie the rope, and end this pitiful joke of a life. Look around, we're in the exact same situation we were just a year ago. It's gonna end the same way, except this time, I won't fail when I kill myself. So just leave now, I'm already dead anyways.

Not like I'll this to any of them. They all have their own problems. They don't need to also be checking on me every 5 minutes to make sure I haven't thrown myself off a bridge again. 

This happens literally everytime I start anything new. The last time was when I got that new job a few months ago. As soon is it's really real and everything starts happening, I get hit with this overhwhelming feeling: "Give up now. Kill yourself. It's gonna end the same as last time, so just get it over with now." There's seriously no point to keep fighting. I swear to you all, I'll kill myself before my 19th birthday. I was an idiot to not kill myself before the new year. Haha, as if an idiot like me could actually change.
