id rather die than be aloneand in a shitty apartment at that. I'm sick of running into career dead ends and career dead ends. internships that don't lead to jobs, interviews that lead nowhere, disorganized companies who under pay me because they don't have their budget. this is with an engineering degree that is now worthless because I haven't worked as an engineer for 2 years and by work I mean an internship. 

for once I just want to not have to worry about finding work or presenting myself. for once I want to have something solid for a year so that way I can spend it building a network and fight the mistakes I made in college. for once I want to get through life confidently knowing things will be ok. that I won't have to spend my entire life in shitty apartments with roommates who don't give a shit about me. for once I want to be able to be confident in telling people what I do for a living. for once I want to be able to date quality women without having to worry about them leaving me because I'm "a deadbeat who can't support a family" or a "directionless" because I'm 27 and don't have a stable career even though I spend 10 times the effort everyone else does developing skills, practice interviewing and networking. 

I don't want reccomendations or advice I want help. actual help. I want someone who will give me a chance to prove I am a great employee. someone who will go out of their way to put in a good word or even just someone who can get me an interview and not harshly judge me for nervous tics or quirks. 

if I don't have a solid career by my 28th birthday it's death  because marriage has an expiration date and it is my dream to have a beautiful quality wife, a nice house and loving kids.
