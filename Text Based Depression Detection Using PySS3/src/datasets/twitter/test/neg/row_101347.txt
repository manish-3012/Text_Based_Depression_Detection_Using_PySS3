I don't wanna suffer anymore!We're so far apart. I'll never have his touch again. I don't think I'll ever be able to see him again. I think O/S travel will become an activity for just the really rich people. I'm stuck here. Tell me in a few more months it will still be this way. If I were able to be in his arms I wouldn't be writing this. I know many are far worse off than me. What am I doing here?
