What is this helpline going to do?Iâ€™m 15, and Iâ€™ve finally emailed the kids helpline. I told them that Iâ€™m suicidal and self harming. I know that theyâ€™re required by law to â€œtell someoneâ€. What does that mean? Are they going to send police to my house? Iâ€™m extremely scared after sending this email and have no idea what to expect. Please, anyone who has had this experience, tell me what to expect. Preferably as fast as possible. I sent the email half an hour ago and donâ€™t know how long I have until something happens. I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s something I donâ€™t want to hear, just tell me anything. Iâ€™m really in a very shit place and need to be certain about whatâ€™s happening.

Please tell me whatâ€™s going to happen.
