Is this suicidal?I randomly have these episodes where I just go numb and idc about anything ,&amp; feel overwhelmed by life so I feel that being dead &amp; not existing would be soooo much easier ...the urges are getting slightly stronger . To the point I feel like Iâ€™m that moment I may act on it and do it.  is this normal suicidal ? Or is it not worth noting at all? I donâ€™t get super depressed or sad ,more like annoyed (for lack of better words ) and just numb like if Iâ€™m a different person. Idk. 

Thanks
