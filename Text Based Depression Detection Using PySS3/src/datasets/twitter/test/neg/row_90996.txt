Help me please.I'm a 20 year old man from the Netherlands, who is turning 21 in a few days. I've been dealing with depression for about 7 or 8 years now.

When I was a teen, my mother did not know how to deal with me because I used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive, which led to her and me having daily arguments. My father was almost always working, so he wasn't often there for me, and if he was home, he didn't want anything to do with his kids. My sister is a person I have trouble being around. She berates me for a whole lot of things I have very little control over (I'll state why later).

When my parents divorced, I quickly started to blame myself over it because I always fought with my mother and felt that I ruined their marriage. I was quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teachers expected me to score. Middle school was even worse as I quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth.

By the time I was in middle school, my mother had a new husband, who was a very abusive person, both verbally and physically. He is now out of my life luckily, but he gave my mother permanent hand damage, he gave my sister a scar on her leg, and he damaged my shoulder and upper back. Whenever I wasn't fighting with my mother or step-father, they were fighting with each other.

I had to go to my father's every two weekends, and half the time during holidays. The first few times went well, where I actually spend time with him, but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture. I started to shut myself in because she was someone I had never seen before and I couldn't trust new people easily already. My depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too, and none of my parental figures knew what to do with me. My mother and step-father argued with me all the time, while my father and step-mother didn't bother to ask me if I wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long. I even stopped joining them for dinner at one point.

When I turned 16, I was taken out of my home situation and I was put in a clinic so I could learn how to fend for myself (because no one had tried to teach me and I had literally no skills to do anything.) While I was at the clinic, I took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further: There was something wrong with my brain. For whatever reason, my brain is always overactive and takes up a whole lot of my energy, kind of like a burn-out. Over my whole life I got berated by literally almost everyone as lazy when it was actually a medical issue.

Fast forward some time and I was in court as a 17 year old because I originally wanted to remove any form of parental rights over my father because he didn't bother to do anything for me (because he didn't know what he could do), but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me, which was that he was forced to seek contact with me.

Around that time, I learned that I am bisexual with a heavy preference for men, which I confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone. I quickly learned that that was the wrong choice, as not even after a week, everyone on my mother's side of the family knew about it. My sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt, which she only didn't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid.

This resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing, and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth, and I was put on antidepressants. However, I was quickly taken off of them after telling them I started to see mental images of very gory self-mutilation.

When I turned 18, I was discharged from the clinic and now I live supervised in a home with 3 other people. My father had stopped contacting me completely the moment I turned 18, and by then my mother divorced her second husband. Fast forward 2 uneventful years of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning.

My grandmother on my father's side died, which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father. The contact between him and me is alright now, and I've stayed at his home for new years a few months back. The relationship with my mother is now okay again, and we don't fight as much anymore. However, that's pretty much all the good news that has happened.

My sister and I still barely have any contact, my mother and I barely have any contact, and even though my father and I are on good terms again, the contact is sparse. Financially I'm having trouble almost every month, as because of my brain problem, I'm unable to work, and I'm not eligible for a disability check, because "I have worked in the past so I should be able to hold a job", and now that I'm turning 21 in a few days, my alimony has stopped as well. I'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time. I was put on a different brand of antidepressants, but I couldn't bother taking them anymore because they simply didn't do anything. I have one person on this world that I am able to really trust, and he lives on the different side of the earth.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do, I mask my feelings without even thinking about it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be alive on this world. I don't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it. I feel alone, abandoned, with no hope left. People tell me to "look for a hobby to occupy yourself with" but even that's out of reach for me when I get tired after doing groceries at a store 10 minutes away from my home.

I've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me "you need to start finding something to do during the day" and "you need to start working on a sleep schedule" as if I don't understand that, and the professional therapist I would've gotten literally said the following works to me. "You cannot be depressed because you said it with a smile".

I think that I have no purpose on this earth and I'm beyond help. I've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone's sake, or cling to the (almost) fake hope that someone will find me, pick me up and help me through my problems.
