Resentment towards loved onesI guess i should tell some about myself, I'm 26 still live with my parents, don't have a job, can't even drive, and have trouble interacting with others due to extreme anxiety (although being extremely hard of hearing doesn't help that any). I'm also autistic have adhd and ocd and at this point I honestly feel like I was born to fail because there's no way I can do anything with all my issues. I've been depressed since I was 15 and had my first suicidal thought around 17, I've been fighting this for over ten years and I don't want to do it any longer, but I can't put my parents through loosing another child. My older sister died in a car crash seven months ago (I will never forget the sound mom made when we were told). 

I feel like I'm a worthless waste of space, I hate everything about myself and I don't want to live anymore. I feel trapped in this life because of my family and I've realized that a part of me hates them for it. Does anyone else feel this way?
