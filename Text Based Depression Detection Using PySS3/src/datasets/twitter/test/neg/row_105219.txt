I can't trust the future.16 years old, I have a sociopathic father that's too busy taking care of his other family, I have an overprotective single mother that cant leave me alone and has to make me a social failure.

I'm fucking tired of it.

I didn't have any friends in Primary School, not Secondary School. Sixth Form is alright just a bit, I have friends but they're not as dedicated as I am in this friendship.

I've suffered so much bullshit, I didn't have the life other kids have. I've never even been to a fucking wedding cause my mom is a lazy unemployed woman who no one wants to be associated with.

And everytime I try to do something, she stops me and makes these excuses on why I can't do this or that.

I try to be tough but for how fucking long? This isn't the end, there's more bullshit on my way.

What the fuck am I doing wrong? What have I done to deserve this? My dad beated my mom and cheated on her, but he's having fun he's living life I have to deal with an insecure paranoid BITCH.

Wherever I'm nice to people, they treat me like shit. And I mean GENUINE niceness, I look at them as old friends I don't even get clingy and then they do something that'll piss me off like ignoring me.
