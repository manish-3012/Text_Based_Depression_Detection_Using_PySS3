So long and thanks for all the fish.I'veâ€¦ seen things you people wouldn't believeâ€¦ Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the TannhÃ¤user Gate. All thoseâ€¦ momentsâ€¦ will be lost in time, like [small cough] tearsâ€¦ inâ€¦ rain. Timeâ€¦ to dieâ€¦
