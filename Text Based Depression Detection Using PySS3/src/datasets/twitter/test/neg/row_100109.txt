A moment of transparency and a question. I want to reveal a part of myself I have never told anyone.

I have been suicidal since I was 11 years old, I'm 27.

My best friend knows I have suicidal tendencies (And she has her own). We work through our problems together but she doesn't even know how bad it is for me.

The only thing that's been keeping me going these last 16 years is by distracting myself with a lack of self worth and by giving into my addictive personality. 

I'm addicted to spending money and hoarding- I focus these habits into buying games on Steam which has mercifully kept my life from getting cluttered.

My lack of self worth is the bigger issue. I live to serve and help other people. It's all I ever want to do and the terror of abandoning people and the sense that killing myself is selfish. There are days I yearn for someone I care about to simply say "You've done well, Jen. You can leave now if you wanted." If someone ever said that to me, I would take it in a heart beat.

Last year I almost gave in. I was so stressed and depressed from one of the worse years of my life and I decided to take the 'selfish' route and kill myself. The two part that still surprises me to this day are 1) I was happy to know that I was dying. I was honestly laughing at how I didn't have to deal with my pain anymore. 2) I still regret not jumping.

Awhile ago my best friend and I had an argument that involved suicide. She told me what gets her through her feelings is to have something to live for.

I feel like maybe this can be a path that can help me. 

I want to know. How do I find something to live for?
