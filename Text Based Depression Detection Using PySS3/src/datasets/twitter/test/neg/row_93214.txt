I'm tired of being mentally ill. I want to be NORMAL, and since I can't be, I don't want to live.I'm only 16 and I spend my days alone. I haven't been to school in 3 years. Haven't been on a social outing in 2 years. I'm tired of watching my peers go through the stages of being teenagers and young adults while I sit here missing out on everything. Getting a job, romantic relationships, being more independent. Basically just growing up.

And here I am. Depressed. I cry everyday over nothing, and it pisses me off, which makes me cry more. I'm TIRED of feeling sorry for myself, but its the only thing that gets me through the day. It doesn't make ANY difference when somebody says "You're not alone". I don't give a shit. I would actually RATHER depression be a rare illness because then doctors wouldn't push me off and think "Just another depressed teenager.." This shit isn't happening BECAUSE i'm a fucking teenager, I had a therapist at 5 years old and was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder. It escalated into depression at 13. Nowadays its not even just mental illness symptoms, but also physical symptoms. The worst being nausea and fatigue. 

Tonight has been rough because of all the pictures of people lighting fireworks, partying, chilling etc. It makes me really sad to be missing out on this because I am so ill. Its really made me think back the last 3 years and wonder how I have survived this long, as isolated, depressed and ill as I am. 

Right now i'm feeling apathetic. Kind of a mix between wanting to change and get better, and a mix between thinking its just time to give up. I'm really, really tired of being mentally ill. When I say this, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. Its taken so much away from me, and unfortunately the doctors/therapists in my city are complete shit.(Canada's government services are fucking shit in general, in my personal experience.) But I won't be able to recover without help so I don't know what to do. Please help.
