Iâ€™m thinking about committing suicide soonMy life just sucks and Iâ€™m sick of all the pain hurt and suffering and Iâ€™m sick of everybody and everything. The only things keeping me going are my grandma and dog but it isnâ€™t enough, especially after my dog was mean to me today. I originally planned to do it a day after my 14th birthday but that didnâ€™t work out. Iâ€™m considering doing it again and have been self harming a lot lately, probably for around a few weeks and I just donâ€™t see a point in living anymore my days just keep getting worse and worse and I havenâ€™t been happy in YEARS. Not months, not days, YEARS.
