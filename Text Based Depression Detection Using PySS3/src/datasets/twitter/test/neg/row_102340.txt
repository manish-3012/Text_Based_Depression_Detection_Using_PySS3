I set a dateAnd it feels so...calming. In a sense. I'm still depressed, but it feels less like I'm out at sea during a storm and more like I'm slowly drifting away from the shore.

August 29 is my date. I'll be 241 months old that day which just seems fitting for some reason. It'll be just after I start my sophomore year of college. I had a couple of attempts over the last school year so I've come to associate Yale in my head with suicide, and I can't really imagine doing it anywhere else. Plus if I fail I don't want to see my parents for a long time so I'd rather not do it at home this summer.

My girlfriend puts me through a lot of shit about going to Yale; she doesn't trust me around the girls there and is kind of an anti-intellectual. Two of my three main attempts last year were because of the stress she put me through. The other times were in large part because of school stress and feeling like a failure. So even though I'll be excited to see my friends again, I know I'll have the motivation.

I have some blades that I've been using for self harm but that I initially bought for suicide, so I plan on using those. I'm re-writing my note and putting together all of my poetry that's related to my depression into a single collection. I'll leave both of those on my desk.
