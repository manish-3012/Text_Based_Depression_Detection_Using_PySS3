The loneliness is killing me.For a while now, the only thing I can think of that I really want is someone to love. Someone to hold, who can hold me together when I've come undone. But fat chance that's ever going to happen. I feel like the loneliest damn person in the fucking state. 

Just this weekend, I was at the state competition for ACA DECA (I'm not a sad, introverted nerd, I also do football and other sports). A friend of mine was hitting it off good with this one girl there, and there was a dance at the end of the competition. He went with the girl, and I went with one of her friends. We're talking, and she seems nice. For once, I was genuinely happy, and I thought I had found someone who actually liked me. Then, midway through the dance, she just leaves me and dances with some other people. So, there I am, alone as always, and just standing there looking like a dumbass.

I later found out that she was playing truth or dare the night before, and the dare was she had to spend a certain amount of time with me at the dance. Really? Is that who I am, the fat, ugly fuckface that people get dared to talk to by their friends? Well that's just fucking great. I guess I'm just that repulsive,

I just can't fucking take this anymore. That's my life, shattered hopes and broken promises. Unloved, unwanted, and just kept around for a cheap laugh. Used like a tool, and then cast aside. Maybe it would be better for everyone if I was gone from this world.
