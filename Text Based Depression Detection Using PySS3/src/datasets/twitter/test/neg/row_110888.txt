Let me dieI wish I could die in some freak unpreventable accident so my family wouldn't feel the same pain they would feel if I killed myself. I pray for that to happen every day of my life. There's no hope for me so just let me die already. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes because I'm so fucking tired of begging for good things to happen. I'm exhausted. The thought of living through another year terrifies me. I want to die in my sleep
