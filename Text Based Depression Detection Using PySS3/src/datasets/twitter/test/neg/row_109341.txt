Looking to help my friendNot really sure if this is the right sub to post this in, so please remove if it isn't.

For a few months now, my best friend has, unbeknownst to me, been depressed. I found out around two months ago when he came over to play some games. He had a hospital band on and, when I asked about it, he opened up by saying that he had tried to kill himself a few days prior. Thankfully, our mutual friend managed to talk him out of it in time for help to reach him. 

He is going to therapy and seemed to be doing well. However, more recently, he told me that he's been having near daily breakdowns. 

Beyond listening to him and helping him through the breakdowns, I'm not sure how to help him. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
