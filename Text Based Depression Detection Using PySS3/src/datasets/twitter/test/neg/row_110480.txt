What should I do?All I want is to die. I'm only 13 and that makes me feel even more depressed. I have no friends that I can talk to, and my family won't take me seriously. I used to be a happy person, very out going, I was one of the "cool kids" at school. Then it all changed three years ago and I haven't even had a glimpse of happiness since.

January 30, 2017 my dad, who I thought loved and cared about me walked out without even saying goodbye and ran off with my moms best  friend. Nobody asked how I was doing. They just thought to themselves oh that sucks and didn't even think to wonder how I felt.

We've moved twice since then, to a completely different city and now I don't even have any friends to talk to, I'm just trapped with my own thoughts doing the same thing every day. I would be so happy if I could just die. But I'm too scared, what if it's just an impulse decision. Im too scared to ever actually kill myself, so I'll have to go through my entire life with myself, nobody by my side.

What should I do? If anybody has gone through something similar I would appreciate it more than anything if you could offer advice. My only goal is to recover. I won't kill myself, I refuse to waste my one chance at life.
