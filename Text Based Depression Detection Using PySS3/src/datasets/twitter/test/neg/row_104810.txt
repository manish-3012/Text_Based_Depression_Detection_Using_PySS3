What has happened here?Mods? You there? Have you thrown in the towel? I mean how has this sub turned from a suicide support system to a suicide encouragement sub? Half the posts and comments I see on here are words of encouragement and tips on better less painful ways to kill yourself. 

I mostly see comments in the likes of â€œOh I feel ya. Wish I could kill myself tooâ€, â€œSee ya on the other side, Iâ€™m killing myself soon tooâ€. 

I mean, how can there even be a sub that exists that is just a bunch of people in the same boat all ready to commit suicide and weâ€™re ok with this and upvote their words of support. 

This sub should be a shoulder to lean on. An ear to talk to. People listening and understanding the situations of people not living in their best of times. 

Mods, how many suicide successâ€™s do you have to see to wake up and not allow this sub to go down the path it is going? How many dead brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, cousins etc have to die before someone takes a stand and lends the support needed by everyone that wants to end their life? The damn guidelines donâ€™t even matter anymore apparently do they? 

So if you feel so inclined to delete this post for its criticism, go for it. Iâ€™ll then know your intentions for this sub and feel deeply saddened by the notion of a sub that exists that costs the lives of too many people.
