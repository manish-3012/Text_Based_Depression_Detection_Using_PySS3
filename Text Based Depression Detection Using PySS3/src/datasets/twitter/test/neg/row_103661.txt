Can a young person be really suicidal?This post was inspired by this exchange https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kfpjrv/what_are_the_conditions_for_not_feeling_finegood/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf .

Most calls for help here can be divided in two groups: the younger than 30 years old and the older. Both groups are capable of gulping too many pills, but Iâ€™m wondering to what degree weâ€™re observing very different situations. 

An 11 years old who wants to â€œkill herselfâ€ is in pain. The pain is overwhelming and her experience doesnâ€™t give her ways to find relief. There may not be relief. In any case, her focus on the pain of the moment makes the potential of a good future completely disappear from her option. So, ok, letâ€™s tell her that we love her and try change her mind.

But a 50 years old is an adult. She went through multiple experiences, the death of her parents, the birth of her son, a good job, a good friendship, an abusive boss, a betrayal. The 50 years old knows what sheâ€™s feeling, sheâ€™s less likely influenced by a road rage episode from that morning. If she wants to die, she must know what sheâ€™s saying.

If we really want to help, our attitude to responding to these two profiles must be very different. We could use white lies with the former, but we donâ€™t want to say bullsh*t to the latter and further destroy her already crumbling faith in humanity.

However, most of times, support comes only in the first form, like we were all 11 years old. Are we sure weâ€™re not making more damage than benefit? Personally, with the second category, I believe that empathising is more useful than trying to change their mind. Sharing that Iâ€™m suicidal, too, will make her feel less alone and think twice to her choice.

Any experts among the readers?

Thanks.
