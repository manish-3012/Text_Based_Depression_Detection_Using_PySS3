Hope is a dangerous word for suicidal people.I am truly tired.i am tired of hearing â€œjust hope for the bestâ€ â€œwhy canâ€™t you have some hopeâ€ â€œhope will keep you aliveâ€ etc.

Hope has crushed my entire soul. My being. My happiness. My attitude. I use to be so positive and then things crashed down one by one because of hope. I hoped to be the person even just a few people would like. I hoped I could keep the act up. I hoped I left a positive impact on people and left them better than I found them. I hoped my PTSD would disappear. I hoped my suicidal thoughts would go away because like got better. But then, as it always does, it got much much much worse.

Now I am completely alone and hopeless once again. Iâ€™ve been abandoned, yet again. I refuse to make the best of this, this time. The one person I thought cared for me unconditionally is gone. Quarantine is making me isolate more. Iâ€™ve lost all will to live bc not only did a business deal fail and get thrown in my face after the ceo of a major company gave me â€œhopeâ€ but I have nothing left to offer anyone. Now Iâ€™m â€œhopingâ€ my lack of sleep, excessive energy drink usage, and not eating will take me soon but if it doesnâ€™t I will â€œhopeâ€ for a faster more fool proof method ASAP.
