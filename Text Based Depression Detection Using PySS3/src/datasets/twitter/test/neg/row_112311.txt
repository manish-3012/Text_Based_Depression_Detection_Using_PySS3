I know of a person who plans on commiting suicide after graduation.2 years ago I met this girl who would always be mad at someone. Then I told her that she was overreacting; this isn't what I wanted to say, but I said it.  

Days later on Twitter we followed each other unknowingly who there other person was. The only reason I knew it was her because she posted a picture of herself, but for the most part she kept it anonymous. On her anon Twitter she would rant about how her friends don't love her and her family hates her and how she is just unwanted. There were many tweets like those and would simply overlook them. 

After following her for a couple of months she finally tweets something that I was actually waiting to see... The tweets Stated " I can't do anything right, but if I can at least graduate than I will kill myself after" somewhere along those lines. I took a screenshot of the tweets and had plans to show our school counselors, but then I didn't.

I choose not to because I believe that person should be able to take their life if they truly want to. So I backed out of telling the counselors, but Still for whatever reason I kept the screenshots.

Months later I go through my phone's storage and see the screenshots of the tweets. At this point I'm conflicted again. I began to felt guilty of not telling anyone. In all honesty I wanted to tell someone, but I choose not to. Why? Well I go back to the idea of them choosing how to live or not live. 

I deleted the screenshots this time and forget about it for a long time.

 However prom happens, this time I see here main Twitter where she does the same as in her anon Twitter account. On the night of prom she cried multiple times before the actual dances because she didn't have a date and her "friends" ditched her.

Now I'm waiting for her to die.... Graduation is in about 2 months. I don't actually know if she commit suicide or not since she said those things 2 years ago. In all honesty I will let her die if she want, but would much rather have her seek help. In the end it's not up to me to decide what she does or doesn't do. However I know people will be devastated with her dying right after graduating.


Tldr; I know of person who seeks to commit suicide after graduation, but don't actually know if she will go through it since the tweets I'm basing this on are 2 years old. I felt guilty for not telling anyone, but I've left it up to her to decide what she will do. We graduate in 2 months.
