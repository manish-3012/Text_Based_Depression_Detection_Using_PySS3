I'm gonna end it. Goodbye.I'm sick of people, sick of talking, sick of breathing, sick of thinking. I know some people will miss me but I can't live anymore with this pain. 

So I'm 15 years old and have been established with depression. I have depression for 3 years and I have light characteristics from autism. I'm not in a very good situation, I'm laying in my bed for serveral months because I'm too tired and depressed. I have social anxiety and I was addicted to selfharm, playing videogames and fapping/watching porn (It gave me a good feeling). I'm feeling very lonely but I want to be lonely (sounds weird). I have consider suicide with a rope a couple months ago and it was very painful. I have scars from selfharm on my left arm and I cry very fast. My mother and my father seperated/divorced when I was 4 years old and I have been mentally mistreated for a long time by my stepfather. He couldn't beat my because my mom will see. My stepfather have threaten me to not say it to my mom because otherwise he will beat my up. I had 5 stepfathers in total and I feel like everyone is against me and I can get really mad at people if they swipe about me. I'm done with this world but not everyone does understand that kinda thing.
