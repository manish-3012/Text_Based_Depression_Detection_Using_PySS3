I know I need help for suicidal thoughts but there are no psychologists to help me.(first post on reddit so sorry if I screwed something up.)  
Background: I'm an 18 year old guy from Florida. I have a kidney disease and some doctors abused me after a surgery which left me terrified of going to hospitals - so much so that I start shivering uncontrollably when I'm there. As for the depression, I can't point to just one thing specifically that causes it.  


I've searched for just over 1 year and there's no one who will take my insurance or isn't 10 hours away. I don't know how I'm supposed to overcome my suicidal thoughts by myself.  


I wanna save killing myself as a last resort because I love my dog and I wouldn't want her to lose her owner - but it's hard not to give up after so long of searching and getting nothing in return.
