New here- suicidal thoughtsI'm new here so i'll introduce myself. I'm Anastasia, 17, Female and I live in Australia. I've attempted to hang myself multiple times in 2013 and that was my last suicide attempt. I don't believe I have a mental illness.. people say i'm 'VERY' ill but I don't think I am. I've been diagnosed with BDD, but i'm certain I don't have it. My ugliness is completely real and it destroys everything. Till now, things were going very smoothly, very little suicidal thoughts- all I could think of was how i'm going to fix my appearance as best as I can. But it's hit me, maybe i'm too ugly to fix.. it really gets to me as i'm very unappealing sexually as well. I dream to be someone else... So lately i've been planning and I think I should do it early next year.. My (ex i guess) best friend is moving and my cousin might be going to another school next year which means I will be completely alone at school and I already do most of my classes online.. I wish I was someone else :/
