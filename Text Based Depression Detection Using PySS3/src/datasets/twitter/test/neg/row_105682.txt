Nobody knowsOn the outside Iâ€™m a happy and laid back guy. Iâ€™m 27M, go to school, hoping to go to law school after. But life is hard for me. Iâ€™m not going to bore you with all my issues. People would describe me as a fun and outgoing person to be around. But one thing they donâ€™t know, I want to kill my self. 

Iâ€™m so sad inside, and I feel like such a loser. I canâ€™t even afford to live on my own. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m still in school getting a useless degree and then another three years of law school - who am i kidding? 

Sometimes I think about suicide and think, â€œdamn it could allll just go away in a single shot.â€ I look at suicide and it just seems so simple. You take a gun, point it at your head, then bang, itâ€™s all over. But I canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t even have a gun.  

Iâ€™m hoping god can save me - god wasnâ€™t always my friend. Idk why, I never hurt anyone. Idk If anyone is out there reading this. But whoever is, I hope you can pray for me. I promise Iâ€™m not weak minded or anything. Iâ€™m just the â€œoutgoing guyâ€ that want to mill himself, and no body knows.
