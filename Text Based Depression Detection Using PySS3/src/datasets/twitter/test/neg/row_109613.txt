I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreMy mom told me if Iâ€™m so stressed I should kill myself, I donâ€™t know what to do, I just wanna take a knife and kill myself, Iâ€™m failing all my classes, my life is going down hill, Iâ€™m doing my best, please, I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m only fourteen, I just want my mom to tell me she loves me, I want to just chug a bottle of my grandmaâ€™s old pills and not deal with this anymore. Is there something wrong with me??! I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s left to life for anymore. I just want my mom to hold me and tell me she still loves me and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me.
