I need someone to talk toI've been trying so hard and I keep on messing up. I can't see an end to this. If I'm stuck being this depressed and anxious that I can't achieve simple goals, then what is the point of me? I'm just a burden on those that I love, on the social system, and I don't get any lasting pleasure from interacting with people anymore.
I've been having a rough year. More like years, really. I already gave my flat mate all of my prescription and OTC pills so I can't take them all tonight. I don't want to call my local crisis line. I just really need to chat with someone that doesn't know me and won't hold tonight's bullshit against me. Please.
