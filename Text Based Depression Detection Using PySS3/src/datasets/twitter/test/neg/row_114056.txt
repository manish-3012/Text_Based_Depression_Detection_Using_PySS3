Needed to tell somebody. Anybody.this isnâ€™t me looking for someone to come and save me, this isnâ€™t me wanting attention, i just wanted to tell somebody before i did it, because it just lays heavy on my mind and i want the hours before to be peaceful.

my boyfriend killed himself 27 days ago.
we were fully and completely in love,  we were sickly sweet and he was my reason, up until now, to hold on.
we were starting a whole life together, we were going to get our own place in April this year.
get two cats, Angus and Maggie.
eventually get married and live together happily.
things went SO well with him that it really was too good to be true. 
he was pretty much the reason i decided to try and get better, because i wanted a future with him and he wanted a future with me.
it went amazingly and for the first time in a long, long time i didnâ€™t want to die.

maybe i was too reliant on him to be happy but i cannot stand to be in this world without him.
everything is quickly caving in on me, thereâ€™s no way i can fix it.
his funeral was the absolute breaking point for me, there were so many people there that it was a standing room. to see his coffin, to hear the songs he loved, to see his family, to mourn in this big gathering of people.. something just completely snapped on me and i no longer even have that slight hesitation before doing this.
