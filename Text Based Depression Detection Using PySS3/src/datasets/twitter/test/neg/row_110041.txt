I'm really doing my best. But I just can't.Cancer took everything. I'm breathing, but I'm not alive. My only family just looks at me as a burden. My friends have LONG been gone. I'm paying my bills,  but not through an actual job. I basically never leave my bedroom. I have no one. Literally no one. I have a sister 1000 miles from here.. she won't answer a call. I have a daughter 700 miles from here. She cares. My dad died in my arms from the same cancer..  I'm alone. I'm going to die. Why wait?
