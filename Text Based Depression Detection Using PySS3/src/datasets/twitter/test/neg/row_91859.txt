For all those considering suicide, hereâ€™s a poem. Reconsider.The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime
His feet shift, teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, itâ€™s time
Toes untouch the overpass
Soon heâ€™s water bound
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down
A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal
Youâ€™re flying now
You see things much more clear
Than from the ground
Itâ€™s all okay, or it would be
Were you not now halfway down
Thrash to break from gravity
What now could slow the drop
All Iâ€™d give for toes to touch
The safety back at top
But this is it, the deed is done
Silence drowns the sound
Before I leaped I shouldâ€™ve seen
The view from halfway down
I really shouldâ€™ve thought about
The view from halfway down
I wish I couldâ€™ve known about
The view from halfway down
