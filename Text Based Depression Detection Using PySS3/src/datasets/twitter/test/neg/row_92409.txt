Conflicted About ConnectingWondering if anyone else has had (or is having) similar thoughts as I am. 

I've been dealing with clinical depression for the past year. I've been going to a therapist to try to talk through it. Lately, and since going through the devastating end of a relationship, I've noticed I've been making stronger connections with people in my life. I've also developed new friendships. These things make me feel somewhat good, however guilty at the same time. 
.
Due to the heaviness in my head and heart, and also health issues, I've been feeling strongly suicidal for the past three months. I put on my happy face, and most have no idea. The more I connect with people, and the more they rely on me, the worse I feel about my impending doom.
.
I don't need anyone to try to talk me out of whatever I'm thinking. I'm beyond that. I guess I'm just wondering if others experience overwhelming guilt, or selfishness, for those that they might hurt when it's over. I'm torn between continuing to be emotionally available to those I care about, or shutting down to create some distance while I still can.
