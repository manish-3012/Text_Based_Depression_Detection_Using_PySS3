Need something to have a taste of deathI want to kill Myself but at the same time I don't. Weird I know. Everyday I have to keep suppressing myself because of family and my boyfriend. I have no one to rely on. My best friend suddenly stopped talking to me after her promising me that she'll always be here for me.
I'm losing it. Everyday suicide to me sounds more possible. I want to feel it. I want to die because I can't stay stable anymore but at the same time I don't - I only want to kill myself as a cry for help. No one listens to me when I talk about my depression. They call me a burden, negative, drama queen etc. it's a waste of money to go to therapy when everything is back to normal when I leave my session. It's the same everyday. 

Why won't anyone listen to me? 

What's the best way to to commit suicide but not killing your self entirely? To knock you off for a while but not fatally killing yourself fully?
