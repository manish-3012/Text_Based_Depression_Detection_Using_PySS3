I don't even knowHello everyone. I never thought I'd resort to posting here myself, but I guess I am right now. Well, what do I say.. I've been helping people here on like 10 of my accounts and seems like now it's my time to either get help or end it. Honestly? Everything feels pointless. I come from school everyday without learning anything new (I'm close to finishing), most people in my country act like jerks to each other, I'm not really attractive, my only real (online) friends have situations of their own. My best friend? She's dating someone and it seems like she's growing distant. I met this new friend online. She seems cool and all that and I started having feelings for her. And now, after talking every single day, she hasn't talked to me in like three days. He messaged me this morning with something random and nothing since then. I've never asked anyone for help but I fucking need it right now. Me having easy access to knives, pills, weapons and high buildings doesn't make it much easier either. I'm just hurting and I have nothing to look forward to. I love my online friends, but communicating with them is not what it used to be. I just.. I don't know. Someone please help.
