What is a failure to you?When I see failure I see me. I have no talent and no meaning. My mother always pushed me to do clubs when I was at school. I failed. I was always the laughing stock of my friends. If one person got me grilled, my friends wouldnt stand up for me. They would just make it worse. They weren't friends tbh. But I still believe I am a failure and it ends TONIGHT
