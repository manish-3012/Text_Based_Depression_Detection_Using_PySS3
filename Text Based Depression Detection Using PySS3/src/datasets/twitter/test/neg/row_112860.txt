I can't do anything rightI wanna kill myself so badly.

I got angry at my mom for almost starting a fire instead of checking she was okay.

I was then having a conversation with a friend and everything I was saying was wrong.

I can't set up a controller correctly after trying for a few hours.

I've never held a relationship for over a couple months.

This is the first beg for help post I made in a while. I thought I was doing better with my suicidal thoughts but clearly not.

I don't understand why people want me alive. My therapist says it's because it would break my family's heart. I thought that at first but I hardly believe her. I don't know what to do anymore.
 
I wanted to kill myself on my birthday in a couple of months. I have enough money for a gun and some bullets. I just need someone to talk to me right now because I don't know why I should even bother being alive anymore.
