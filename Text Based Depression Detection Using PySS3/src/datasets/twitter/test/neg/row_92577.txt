It would be kinder to everyone to just end it, why canâ€™t I do it?I know I would be better off dead. I have nothing to offer the world, no redeeming qualities, nothing to live for. My family doesnâ€™t have anything to do with me. My sister was my best friend and she has cut me off. I just started a new job and I suck at it, so they wouldnâ€™t miss me there. I have no friends. My divorce was just finalized and my ex would be relieved if I was gone. He hates and resents me. 

I have absolutely no reason to live, but I canâ€™t bring myself to pull the trigger, so to speak. Why???  I donâ€™t want to cling to life, I WANT to go!  I want to rest, I want peace!  I am just a coward.
