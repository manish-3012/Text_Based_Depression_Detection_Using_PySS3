Last Words... "The Plan"Those who have attempted, or are fully contemplating, what will be/were your last words? Were they in the form of a letter? a social media message? a recording or voicemail? I've been planning my way out during my moments of "lucidity" (or times i'm not depressed or overcome with hopeless emotions) I plan to have a kit put together and ready, a little pamphlet I created of information that will help me see my plan through flawlessly, no room for error where I will survive. In this kit will be the info pamphlet, the means of which I will carry out my plan, some envelopes with the most important people in my life and a last letter to them, stamped, addressed, with another sheet and their phone number, (i would mail them myself but i want to make sure they get them) a last will, and a final phone-call will be made to the authorities so they can find my body quickly and make use of my organs. I'm going to have to time things precisely, that way i know my body will be found soon, but not soon enough to revive me. My debt card will also be in the case with my pin number written on it, attached to a proceeding of how i would like the little money i have distributed. On facebook (i don't really use it much other than to post nature pics and stuff) I will make a final post of 2 words "Roll Credits." Which will be in line with the other vague and dark humor posts I also make. I call the entire thing "Operation Exodus" douchy i know lol, has a better ring to it than "how i'm going to kill myself"

I want to make the least inconvenience as possible. Even down to fasting and prepping my body to make the cleanest autopsy possible. (better i not be covered in piss and shit when they find me)

It's bizarre because it feels like i'm planning a funeral or something for a loved one, only it's for me.

Does anyone else have/had a plan or wrote a last letter?
