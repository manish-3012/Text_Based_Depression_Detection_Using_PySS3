Why the fuck should I go through this for another 30 miserable years?Nobody believes that I am suffering. Closest family all make fun of me if I tell them and then tell me, jokingly, that I'm going to hang myself at age 50 just like my neighbor did. Fuck this. I want out now. I want it to end, please...

Sick and tired of spending birthdays alone. Of people saying I got lucky in life and should appreciate it while they themselves have it 10x better. That I should try harder at making friends when 100% of people get clearly disgusted by my presence after a couple of hours. 

Sick and tired of waiting for this carousel to stop. My life is boring and monotone and the only time I get to feel anything is in my imagination. Nobody ever stays, nobody cares that I exist or not. Not even my imaginary friends stay. What's the point? Why the fuck can it not end now?!
