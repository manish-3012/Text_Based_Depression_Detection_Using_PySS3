Too fat to functionMy weight has gotten completely out of control. Please help me. I'm not overestimating it either. It's gotten to the point that I have trouble reaching parts of my body. I fucking hate myself so much and I don't see how it can ever get better. Weight loss takes time and I don't think I can make it much longer.

Please help me. I want to fucking die.
