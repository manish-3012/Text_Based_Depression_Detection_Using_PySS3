I have mental health issues, want to dieHi!

I have mental health issues which prevent me from leading normal life. I'm failing other people because of this. Now I'm renting an apartment and have a job, but I'm failing my job and don't want to do it anymore anyway. I can't concentrate on things and do what I have to do, and it's always been like this. 

Thing is, if I quit then without a job I will lose a place to live, and frankly I don't want to try to find another job or fix myself anymore. I have this issues since I was 13 (or maybe even less) and now I'm 26, so one thing I know for sure is this: it doesn't get better. IT JUST DOES NOT. I tried treatment, doctors, pills, exercises, all of that. DOES NOT WORK. So I think my problem is permanent enough to consider permanent solution. And now I'll just go hit myself in the head because I hate myself.
