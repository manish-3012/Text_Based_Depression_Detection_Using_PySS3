I wrote my suicide notes todayIt's so crazy. I used to be so far from this point and now it just seems to have crashed into me at 100 miles per hour. I'm breaking down more and more each day. Today was a very close one. After some time passed and I got more clear headed I decided to sit down and write out my suicide notes. I feel like it's only a matter of time before it gets to be too much and I act out of impulse. For now they're tucked away and I so badly hope I never ever get them out but to burn them one day. But I honestly don't know anymore. Whatever happens I think I'll find peace with.
