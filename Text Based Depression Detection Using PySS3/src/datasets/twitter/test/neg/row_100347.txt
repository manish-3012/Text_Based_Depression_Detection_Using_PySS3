I'm such a messEvery single day I feel upset or just sad or miserable. I feel like all the people that I put effort into trying to be friends with don't even give a shit about me, and the worst part is that I'm at the time of my life when people CARE about making friends and having actual relationships with people. Why don't I matter to anyone? Why can't I get myself to matter to ANYONE?

Other than my parents I guess... thanks Mom and Dad. Seriously I probably wouldn't be here right now if they didn't care about me.
