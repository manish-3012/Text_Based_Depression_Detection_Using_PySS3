How do I do this? Trying to get help.Hi everyone, I've been lurking this sub for a few months now.I  have decided I really want to change my mindset, as it gets really tiring waking up every day feeling like you just want to give up. It doesn't help that my work always gives me anxiety, where at time I'd have to talk to HR and book the day off because of an anxiety attack. I have tried to book for an appointment a year ago through NHS (government), but it took 6 months for them to respond and they can only offer online or voice calls, which I could not take.

For context, I live in London. Currently living with my parents who don't know I have been depressed for years, and have occasionally been having suicidal thoughts, more frequently these past few months. The NHS offered treatment for my anxiety, but they said it would have to be done video or audio calls, sadly I cannot do this as I don't want my parents to know, and as I am working a 9-5, the only time I can do it is in the evenings or weekends, which most of the time my parents would be at home.

I came across this affordable therapy sessions, but I called them up and they said they only do zoom sessions. I told them about my situation and would rather have a face to face, but they really want to help me. Most of the ones I've found that offer face to face sadly cost way more than I can afford.

So, is there a way for me to do online therapy without being at home, or find a place to myself that I can rent for an hour or two? 

Thank you very much for those who read through this post.
