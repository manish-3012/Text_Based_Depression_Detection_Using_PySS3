This is the end.I can't stand another day of torture. I can't stand it. I hate living. I hate myself. My life seems like the same painful day on repeat and nothing ever changes. I couldn't escape it. This is the only way out. I wasn't strong enough to hold on. I'm sorry but there's nothing left for me to miss about this place. I hope everybody forgets about me once I'm gone.
