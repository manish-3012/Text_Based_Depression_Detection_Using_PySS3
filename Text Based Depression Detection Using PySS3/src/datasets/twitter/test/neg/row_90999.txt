Feel nothing for anyone or anything nowadays. Why keep going?I'm 25. I've never been able to connect with others or sustain long-lasting relationships. I don't know why but no amount of medication, therapy, or drugs have helped. I used to feel lonely. I used to feel happy or excited or even disappointed in my short relationships with people. Now, I feel absolutely nothing. Maybe tired, but that's it.

I finally have what I have been pining for all these years: a boyfriend. A loving, kind, smart, beautiful boyfriend who adores me. Yet, I feel nothing in his presence but boredom and self-loathing. I doubt his love. I wait for his inevitable exit. Soon he'll realize one of these days as we stare at the tube after dinner in our disgusting routine, that I'm empty. That I'm just a trophy, a body with no desires beyond eat, drink, sleep. I bring nothing to the relationship and my "independent" nature is just a veneer for my preference for isolation. I prefer being alone than with him, or any person.

I don't know. We live together now. I think about leaving every day. But then where will I go? Life can't get any better than this, yet I'm still empty and suicidal. I thought if I found someone, these thoughts would leave; I'd have to be accountable and present. I'd have a purpose. 

But I feel nothing. Still nothing.
