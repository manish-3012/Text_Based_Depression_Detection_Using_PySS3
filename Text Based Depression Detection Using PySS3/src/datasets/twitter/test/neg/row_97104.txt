It's too muchTons of stress at work, because I feel like I'm constantly being backstabbed and have to look out for the lazy uncooperative guy to ruin the software and me to be blamed for it not functioning afterwards.

The very few people I get to talk to (including my family) put a lot of stress on me for having to do something in my super long upcoming vacations. I didn't want to have vacations, just being alone every single weekend is hurting already. How will I survive over a month without at least seeing people on the train on my way to work? And wherever I go, I'll just be extremely lonely and miserable, so I might as well not go anywhere.

It's too much. I just want it all to end :( I can't handle this life, there is only pain and no hope for a better future :(
