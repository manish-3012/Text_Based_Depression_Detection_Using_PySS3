I donâ€™t know what to do anymore about lifeIâ€™m a 20 year old male and Iâ€™ve had depression for 8 years now. Just recently diagnosed with Persistent depression disorder, I take 100mg of Zoloft. It helps but on of the problems is sometimes I forget to take it or I run out and procrastinate about ordering more, and within in less 12 hours of not having it my mind goes back to that depressive state and I sit there and wonder â€œIâ€™m supposed to live life this way, taking medication for the rest of my life. Then breaking down when I forget to take.â€ I tried therapy but I hate talking to someone who gets paid to listen to my problems. It doesnâ€™t feel genuine. And I canâ€™t get out of this mode of being in fear of finding happiness because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to lose it. Like I donâ€™t want to be in a relationship because i donâ€™t want to know what life could be like, just to have it snatched away from me. And I know thatâ€™s part of life but my life has been this way since I was born. Getting these moments of happiness just to have it taken away from me. I canâ€™t face the truth that life does that to you. And when I get to these low points, I lose all hope and canâ€™t bare with the thought of living anymore. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™ve spent hours on the internet for advice but never came across anything helpful. So Iâ€™m hoping maybe someone on here can help me
