I need a hugI'm so disappionted that people don't understand what is to be unhappy and to have depression. They don't care even if you have suicidal thoughts and ask for help. My parents act like everything is okay and don't pay attention on my tries to say that i may have problems. People seems to be fake to me by being to much cheerful and happy. I suck in communicating with other people and i have no friends. I also have recently started to talk with items and i can cry for no reason. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. All i want is a warm friend hug which i can't get from no one
