This is dumb. My story.Just typing this as a form of therapy I guess. I tried to kill myself by lighting myself and my house on fire. I donâ€™t remember anything but that is what I was told. Fifteen days in an induced coma and 2 months in the burn unit with about half my body burned. Then I was arrested for arson. Taken out of a psych ward to a local jail where I was denied medical attention and dragged into court seeping pus. Thereâ€™s a lot more to the story but who gives a fuck? I was charged with the worst possible level of crime equivalent to capital murder but bargained down to â€œstate jail felonyâ€ whatever that means. I was released from jail after approximately 5 months. Spent almost 2 years homeless and on probation with the court breathing down my neck expecting me to pay money I donâ€™t have and no means to get it. Now Iâ€™m on disability, living in an apartment provided by a housing charity. Still on probation with an officer that wants to put me back in jail. Every day is a nightmare. My life is over and I have to keep living it. 

I donâ€™t know. I guess my point is that if you try to kill yourself you had better get it done right. No one cares. Youâ€™ll live in rot if you fuck it up.
