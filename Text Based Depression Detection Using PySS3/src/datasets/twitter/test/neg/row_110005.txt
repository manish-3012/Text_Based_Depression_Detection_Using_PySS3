Everyone hates me for things I never did. Iâ€™m tired of losing friends and Iâ€™m tired of being paranoid.Iâ€™ve been falsely accused of rape and itâ€™s ruining my life. I would never do something as evil as that, and the person accusing me has always been one to do things for attention. I havent spoken to them in over a year now and that rape rumors started months after we stopped speaking. And now everyone hates me. Another person had jumped on the wagon and was saying the same even though Iâ€™ve never had sex with them. But the second person stopped once they started getting attention from their new partner. I donâ€™t even know if the rumors are still spreading, but itâ€™s makes me feel awful that people still hate me because of it. I lost a good chunk of my friends and Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™ll be taken to court and my life will be ruined. Iâ€™ve struggled with suicide and depression since I was in the 2nd grade and now Iâ€™m in college, and itâ€™s stronger than ever. Iâ€™m so afraid of my life being ruined that I want to end it before it can be. I think about driving off bridges and hanging myself with a belt. Iâ€™m just so tired of being hated and being paranoid and being afraid to go to the gas station because I donâ€™t want anyone to see me. My quality of life is so low because I canâ€™t get over the nightmares and constant paranoia. I feel like I have PTSD from the whole experience. I just want to lead a normal life and be happy and have friends but these people wonâ€™t let me. And it makes me afraid to even be affectionate with my current partner because I just feel guilty over things Iâ€™ve never done. I donâ€™t to live like his anymore. Itâ€™s horrible.
