if there was ever a reason to end it all...i (m) have, well had, a partner(f). i always has feelings for same sex too, never acted on them, but always knew i would end up with the opposite sex. we have this mutual friend (f) that confided in us while friend was going through an issue. i was entrusted with talking to the ex (m) to make sure ex was doing okay. which i did. we were drinking a lot, talking, watching tv, and i did the unthinkable. i told ex drunkenly that i was attracted to ex, always thought of ex as an attractive person. i kissed ex.. told ex it was ok with my partner.. at the time i thought it was because partner always encouraged me to explore. it escalated with ex. completely drunk, vision blurry. not an excuse. i know this. in the morning, sober.. should have told my partner but i ended up feeling mortified. i couldnâ€™t bring myself to say anything.. months passed and partner found out from mutual friend. it should have come from me. i should have told him. i hurt him so much. i hurt so many people. i canâ€™t take away the pain. it hurts to breathe. it hurts to exist. my family is broken and i donâ€™t deserve anything.


2 failed attempts. thereâ€™s no one to talk to. no one thatâ€™s knows me that can talk me off of this ledge
