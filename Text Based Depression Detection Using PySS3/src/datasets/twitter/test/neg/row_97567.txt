First PostI have been suicidal for the last 6 or so years but not out right. I feel like if I were to be in a situation where I would die, I would not try to save myself unless someone else is present and they could be endangered. The only thing that really keeps me from committing suicide is because of the people I know. I imagine they would all wonder why I never said anything or asked for help and would beat themselves up and I don't want that for them. I also haven't given my parents back the money they spent on me, I often wish that either a different sperm had made it to the egg so I wouldn't have to exist or I wish suicide was super acceptable and I could just say "ok I'm done here enjoy guys". I go through every single day because I just so happened to wake up and I'm just waiting for the day I don't. However, I am a social butterfly, make friends real easy, good in crowds but I feel like every single new friend is a chain that binds me to this prison that is life. Figured I'd just share this because why not, thanks for reading.
