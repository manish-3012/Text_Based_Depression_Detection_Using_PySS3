Life is colorless and my PTSD is winningI'm so depressed. This last year, no, the last four years of my life have been absolute hell. Yesterday my boyfriend of almost two years left me, and blocked me on everything. I'm spiraling out. I understand why he left me, I know I didn't love him hard enough near the end of the relationship. He caught me meeting up with an ex-boyfriend. I didn't sleep with him, but it looked sketchy enough and I can't lie and say there weren't some feelings there. Plus I lied to him. I feel so fucking guilty for lying to him. I feel so ashamed of losing one of the only people on this planet that stood beside me through everything. He just wanted me to be happy and I abused his trust in me. Life feels colorless and aimless without him. He was the one good thing tethering me to this earth and now I'm completely alone and adrift. I just keep picturing his crushed face when he saw us together and I feel sick. I haven't been sleeping or eating. I took a few bites of food this morning and threw it up. I feel selfish for being this depressed... like I don't even deserve to feel sorry for myself. But I can't help it, normally when things got bleak I'd look to him to find some light. Now I'm just surrounded by static and I'm alternating between feeling pain and feeling nothing. I deserve this.

Earlier this year, on my birthday, my mom's boyfriend died. He was the closest thing to a father that I had since my bio father is in prison and hasn't been present in my life. I was doing alright up until that point, and then it's like I hit a brick wall. My grades tanked and anxiety became all consuming. My boyfriend and I were long distance and it was hard to communicate and get the support we needed from each other. He was busy working, and I felt like I was emotionally burdening him by talking about my problems. One of my roommates and I had a falling out because her drug addiction was impacting my safety, and so I lost her friendship. I lost another close friendship of almost ten years because he wanted a relationship with me and I refused to leave my boyfriend. I ended up performing average to bad in all my classes this semester, and I was so mortified that I've kept that hidden from everyone. I don't think I'll be able to get the career I want with the GPA I have currently. I feel like I've lost everything good over the last four years. My family, my grades, my friends, my boyfriend. 

I relapsed and started self harming today after over seven months of being clean. I burned myself on my legs with a hot razor. I drove my car into another lane earlier as well, but I swerved in time to not get hit. It feels like nothing is ever going to be okay again. I don't even have any friends left to pull me out of this place, and the few that are around don't understand how I feel right now or aren't being responsive. The suicide hotline wasn't helpful. My boyfriend hasn't said a single word to me after everything happened and I'm completely cut off from him. I understand and respect that even though it's crushing me. I'm considering checking myself into a hospital, but on the other hand I feel like just getting the inevitable over with so I finally stop falling deeper into this pit. I feel like a terrible, worthless person. I got into a massive fight yesterday with my mom who confirmed that she also thinks I'm a terrible person among other things and she wants nothing to do with me anymore. She didn't even know about the stuff with my boyfriend at the time. 

I'm trying to keep moving, but this might be it for me. I've been balancing memories of abuse and sexual assault on top of everything else and it's just too fucking much. Years of medication and therapy haven't been enough to undo the years of trauma, and now it's making it so I'm incapable of trusting and loving the people around me the way they deserve. This pain is isolating me from everything and everyone that makes me feel alive. I'm so desperate for love that I'll grab at it from anyone and everyone, and even when I had someone that was nearly perfect my insecure self couldn't believe he actually loved me and pushed him away too. I just want to slit my wrists and be done.
