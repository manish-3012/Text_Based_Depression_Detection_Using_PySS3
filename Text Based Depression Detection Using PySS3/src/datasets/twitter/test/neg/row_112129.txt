8 solid hours of panic attacks and no one to listenI'm out of perspective. I can't see an option where I get better. I was raped almost a year ago right after being dumped by my fiance of 6 years. January was dark and just a constant flashback. I thought it was looking up as I started therapy. But 3 weeks ago Wednesday I was raped again. My support system was there at first but they've drifted off as the crisis gets longer. 

I can't see a future where I'm not a victim. I can't see not being a burden. I can't see ever getting my body back under my control and not feeling like I'm walking a crime scene every where I go. 

Can I borrow some perspective?
