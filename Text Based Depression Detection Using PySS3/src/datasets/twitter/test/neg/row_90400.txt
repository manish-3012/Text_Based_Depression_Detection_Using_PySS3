Being at home would make me feel better, but I'm several thousand miles away.I'm on a trip with my best friend and boyfriend.  My best friend has spent the whole time with friends she previously met and my boyfriend has spent every night partying and drinking too much with them. When we get back to the hotel, he starts bitching at me for one reason or another. Tonight is the third night. I opted not to go out with them but was instructed to wait up since they were just going to have one last drink. He came back two hours later incredibly drunk and for the lack of better description, put me down again. I keep getting mocked for not having any social skills and not being able to stay awake. He knows  that very time I get told that I'm awkward or have no social capabilities I feel even more nervous and scared. For the past three nights, I've had only 2-4 hours of sleep a night because the schedule they've been keeping.

I just really want to fly home right now but the plane tickets are beyond my wallet, and I don't have a job. I went to him, he's passed out drunk now, and asked nicely if I could just get a hug and be told that he still loves me and that it'll be ok. He refused and said it would make him happier to not do that.

I feel exhausted, overwhelmed, unappreciated (I spent a long time planning the trip and everybody would rather party) and just lost. Normally when this happens I'd just go home, crawl into bed and hug every stuffed animal and my cat, but they're thousands and thousands of miles away.

So, just, some support or something. Or someone who can say I will make it through the week till I get home.  Sorry for rambling.
