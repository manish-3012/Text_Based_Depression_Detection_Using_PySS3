My mother is a stupid, selfish piece of shitI suffer from a schizophrenia like condition so I'm stuck living with my grandparents and having her in my life. She's done this since I was a child, just breezing through without a care in the world while everything burns down around her sending her every sign that she needs to turn around. I expected to come back downstairs and find her close to my gram (its her bday she she's visiting) without a mask on since I had gone up to my room for awhile, so I check and I was right. 3 feet apart, no mask, shooting the shit with her 78 year old mother who suffers from COPD and high blood pressure. My pap has just recently been a survivor and is HEAVILY obese. I am also high risk as I'm type 2 diabetic and having trouble getting that under control atm, especially since I'm afraid to go out at all during this pandemic... And she's just sitting there acting like it's nothing. Then she has the gall to get mad at me for calling her out! Every time. I don't care if she dies, I really don't. I haven't cared in years and years and in fact, after everything since birth, I'd be happy. She's just the same as my piece of shit "father." The only escape from this living situation and my "family" is suicide. I want a better life and that's the only thing keeping me going, the hope that I can be better one day.

But with everything, losing touch with reality, the health problems, my shit family, I'm just done. I can't even function in normal society, I can't be a real "adult." I'm 27 but it's like I never stopped being 5 years old. There is no happiness in my life, just pain and suffering and fear and anxiety every day. Death is an absolute mercy at this point and yet I still fear it.
