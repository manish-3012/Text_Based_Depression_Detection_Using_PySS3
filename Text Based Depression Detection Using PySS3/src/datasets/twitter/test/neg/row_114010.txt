Will my sons be ok?Their dadâ€™s ex military, handsome, successful. So successful he hasnâ€™t â€œletâ€ me work since we married. Girls flirt with him in front of me. He works with 200+ college/fresh out of college girls and is one of maybe 5 guys who work there. I have ptsd, anxiety, depression, and deteriorating scoliosis. He recently said he doesnâ€™t know if he loves me and called my back disgusting. I havenâ€™t worked in 6 years, actually since I got my bachelors degree with a 3.94/4.0 GPA, so I feel like I worked my fucking ass off for the 5 yrs it took me for squat shit. Now the mental and physical pain every day is unbearable and Iâ€™m sure my sad, shitty attitude is going to make me a piss poor mom and he could and will find someone else who would be everything I canâ€™t be. I just wish I could fast forward to there already being their new mom.
