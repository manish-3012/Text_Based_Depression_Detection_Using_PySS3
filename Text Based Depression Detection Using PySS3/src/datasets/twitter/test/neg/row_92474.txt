You might need therapy after I die.The closet or the forest.

The garage or a random parking lot.

The bathtub or the river.

Ending my life with you all on my mind.

Oh my friends,

Oh my roommates.

Your traumatic experience is in my hands.

I promise that I love you.

I promise that I cared.

But how much does my love matter once you've seen something,

you can't un-see. 

Yours truly,

Your

Eyes glazed over, tongue protruding, blue faced, bloated maggot riddled, decomposing friend.

Whoever finds me,

Wherever I'm found.

I swear that I never intended to make you feel

anything but happy.

Apologies for the trauma.
