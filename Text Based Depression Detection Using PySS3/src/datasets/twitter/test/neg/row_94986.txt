Looking for a reason to liveI am starting to realize if I was to kill myself everyone life would be significantly better. This is because my dad is extremely homophobic and I am gay. If I was to kill myself he wouldnâ€™t have to deal with having a gay son and he would be happy. My parents would not get a divorce either because I did not ruin there marriage. My brother and sister would not have to pick sides and fight. My friends would be happier because they would have to deal with my constant anxiety attacks. I am ultimately not going far with my life. So I am just writing this out hoping that there is a reason to live.
