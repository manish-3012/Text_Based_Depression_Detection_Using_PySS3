What am I supposed to do?I'm 17, male, and I'm currently a senior in highschool.

When I was child, my parents got along, but there were some fights between them. When I was really young I would cry when they fought but eventually I got used to it. My dad would sometimes beat my mom in these fights, but my mom always forgave him. This continued for a while. When I was in 4th grade (9 years old), the fights between the two of them got even worse. They started to not get along anymore and they eventually my dad left my mom when I was in 6th grade (11 yrs old). After that everything started going downhill for me.

During 8th grade, I started to develop some minor acne, and it eventually got worse when I started high school. I had cystic acne. I remember I was walking around my high school when I was in 9th grade and saw this girl pretending to puke after she saw my face. I was sort of hurt by it, but I soon forgot about it. Time goes on and I'm finally in 10th grade. My face was full of acne scars and it wasn't until 10th grade that I realized what the hell was wrong with my face. It took a while but I eventually had to accept the fact that I was ugly. Even without the acne and all my acne scars I was ugly. The acne just made it even worse. I had crooked teeth, my nose iscrooked, my left ear is a bit lower than my right ear. My face was so asymmetrical and because of that I didn't have much confidence in myself. I also wasn't smart or athletic. I got a shitty 25 on the ACT and my grades are average and I'm average/below average at sports too. I feel like if I was born with no talents at all.

Now I'm in the second semester of my senior year and I feel like if I've completely wasted high school. There are kids in my school that go out with their friends and hang out after school. I never had a chance to do that. I never had a girlfriend either. I recently confessed to a girl that I've liked since 10th grade, but I ended up getting friend zoned. I honestly don't blame her. What type of girl would go out with an ugly ass guy like me? I'm just thankful that she was so nice about it.

Tons of people in my school have great social lives. High school only comes once in a persons life and I feel like if I've wasted it. Everyday I'd come home from school, do homework, play video games or skateboard in my garage, and then sleep. I repeated this boring process every day since freshmen year.

My parents are divorced, I'm ugly, not smart or athletic and have no talents either. I'm hoping things get better for me in college, but if they don't I'm seriously considering committing suicide. I feel like if I've failed my mom. She has done so much for me, but I feel like if I haven't done anything to make her happy.
