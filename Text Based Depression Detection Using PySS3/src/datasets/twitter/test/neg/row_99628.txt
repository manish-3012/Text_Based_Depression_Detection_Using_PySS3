I think I'm pretty close to giving up.My friend who normally helps me with everything doesn't want to talk to me because I did a practice run of my chosen method. This was a couple of weeks ago now. It's all in my post history for anyone who cares.

I messaged her last week to see if she wants to talk, no response. I want to message her again but whatever I type seems absolutely pathetic and the more I think about it the more I feel she doesn't deserve me dragging her down anyway.

I was going to CBT, but I've had to stop my sessions as after I told my therapist what happened they decided to refer me to another service. I don't have high hopes as I've been assessed by them twice before and both times they didn't offer me any treatment. I've been stuck in limbo between being too severe for one service and not enough for another before and it fucking sucks. To be fair I don't think CBT was doing all that much anyway, but it was something. Even if it was just meeting and talking every week.

Long story short, my experiment wound up getting me closer to killing myself in more ways than I intended orignally. I know what I'm doing now and because of it I don't have access to the things that were really helping and keeping me here.
