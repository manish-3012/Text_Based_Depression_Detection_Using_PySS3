I'm so tired of trying.I used to have it all. I was married to the woman of my dreams, who treated me like a king. She gave me a purpose to live, a reason to get out of bed in the morning. She gave me my beautiful baby boy. But my joy was short lived. She got depressed, and grew resentful of me and my lack of money. I was working 50 hour weeks but the bills took every penny, and then some. She wanted to be at the end of the journey, when I was only just beginning. 

She left me. And took my son. 15 hours away from me to a different state. She never gave me a real reason. She said she still loved me but â€œshe just couldnâ€™t do it anymoreâ€. Now Iâ€™m missing my sons first year of life, and he doesnâ€™t even know who I am. 

I started cutting myself, on my thighs and on my chest where no one will ever see. It helped get rid of the pain for a second. 

I stopped seeing a purpose to life, to suffering any more than I already have. I lost my job, got evicted from my townhome, and went far into debt. I have no friends; I was a dumbass and let my life get completely absorbed by my love for my wife, and my friends stopped trying long ago. Now Iâ€™m living in the shittiest motel I can find, burning through the remains of my money.

I wake up every morning and look at my snubnose I have sitting on my night stand. Iâ€™ve only ever loaded one bullet, and it tempts me everyday. To finally stop feeling, existing. Iâ€™ve played Russian roulette 5 times so far but whatever higher power is out there wants me to continue suffering. But Iâ€™ve ran out of faith in myself. Every day I wake up Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t pulled the trigger already. I need help.
