Iâ€™m supposed to die this monthWhen I was 11 years old I told myself that if nothing gets better by the time I turn 16 Iâ€™ll kill myself. I turn 16 this month. Nothing has gotten better. I still feel absolutely hopeless. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll go through with it but I feel like I do have the ability to do it. Iâ€™ve done all the planning, I have everything ready for it. All thatâ€™s left is to do it. Iâ€™m scared though. I donâ€™t know what happens when we die. It couldnâ€™t be worse than this though right? Thereâ€™s really nothing else left for me. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do.
