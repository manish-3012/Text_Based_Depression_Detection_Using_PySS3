Should I tell my friends I'm probably gonna kill myself?Hello. Excuse the weird name, I made a new account in 20 seconds because most of my friends use reddit and they know the username I use in everything
I've been depressed for about five years now. I've tried therapy and anti depressants multiple times but nothing changed
Anyways, after so long I have finally made a plan to kill myself and wrote out a will
Most of my friends are depressed themselves and I know they will blame themselves if I commit suicide. I also had no chance to say goodbye to many family members who have died and still feel horrible for not being able to do so
I am gonna use the three day rule and wait, but I'm pretty sure I won't change my mind
I do not want them to worry but like I said, I also don't wanna make them feel guilty and make them think it's their fault
If I do settle on killing myself, should I message them saying I'm going to do it  and that it's not their fault and I want them to try and move on and be happy...?
