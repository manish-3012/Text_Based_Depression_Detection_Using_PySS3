THERE REALLY IS NO WAY OUTEven the obvious answer I am too apathetic/fearful to do. I don't want to drop a nuclear bomb on my family. I also do not see any other way out.

&gt; As you look at the screen,

&gt; it is possible to believe you are gazing into eternity.

&gt; .

&gt; You see the things that were inside you.

&gt; This is the womb: the original site of the imagination.

&gt; .

&gt; You do not move your eyes from the screen.

&gt; You have become invisible.

&gt; .

&gt; The images captivate you,

&gt; but still you drift off.

&gt; You can still see every detail clearly,

&gt; but canâ€™t grasp the meaning.

&gt; .

&gt; Whatever shift in your spiritual life occurs,

&gt; fragments such as these surface.

&gt; .

&gt; You wonâ€™t be distracted, either by the reflection of yourself,

&gt; or by the last glimpse of the things now being lost forever.

&gt; .

&gt; As you look at the screen,

&gt; it is possible to believe you are gazing into eternity.

&gt; .

&gt; For a moment it all interlocks,

&gt; but then a new pattern of order-disorder emerges in front of you.

&gt; Always the one before the last.

&gt; .

&gt; You are again in a dream, walking endlessly winding paths.

&gt; **And you canâ€™t find your way out of the maze you are convinced itâ€™s been created solely for you.**
