I finally had enough. Killing myself is the only good option right now.I have posted this before on my main account, but I found out a friend of mine discovered my Reddit account, so throw away

I don't really want to make this a wall of text so I will just sum up the things that have happened in my life (so far)

* I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers, every single one of us is from a different man;

* Both my sisters got kicked out of our house at an early age, so I had little to no contact with them;

* My real dad left us the day I was born;

* The man who I thought was my father, was a drug addict that was in jail constantly throughout my childhood;

* At the age of 6, my oldest brother committed suicide at the age of 25, because his wife constantly cheated on him;

* At the age of 11, I found my "dad" dead in the living room, covered in blood/puke, he died cause of an OD;

* When he died, my mother got together with a drunk that would beat us pretty much daily (this went on for about a year, I blocked out a lot from this for some reason);

* When I was 12, my mother asked my youngest brother and myself if "we wanted to be with daddy". I refused, so she dropped me off at my oldest sister. She tried to commit suicide with my youngest brother by taking pills, but they both failed. Youngest brother was in a coma for quite some time, while she was just under heavy influence. She got sentenced to jailtime (8 years), but she got out early for good behavior/agreeing on seeing a psychiatrist;

* My youngest brother eventually got out of the coma, and my sister agreed to raise him as well;

* 3 years later (us both still living with my sister's family), he sexually abused both of my sisters daughters;

* My sister kicked him out and he had to go to some institution (I think that's the word, sorry English is not my first language) and now I have no contact with him whatsoever, and I wouldn't want it any other way;

* Last year my older brother tried to commit suicide but luckily for him, my oldest sister was able to bash his door in on time and call an ambulance after finding him on the floor;

* I lived with my sisters family up until 6 months ago, she "kicked me out" in a nice way, because it wasn't possible anymore for me to stay there. Her daughters are getting into puberty so they both need their own room, etc;

* I currently go to college and about to start my third year, but I'm struggling heavily finance wise (I got 700EUR a month, for which I have to pay college/rent (rent itself is already 300)/food)


Last week I found out my contract on my apartment isn't getting renewed, and I can't find any apartment I can afford financially (I've been looking all week, up to 8 hours a day) so in approximately 3 weeks I will be homeless.

I have contacted "my government" (the department that helps me with my finances/living on my own in general) and they just bluntly told me "well we can't really do anything, so you better look out for a new place")


I am seriously in tears here Reddit. NOTHING goes right for me, I seriously feel so horrible you have no idea.

I've recently started cutting and I am honestly considering just going the whole way now.

I used to have my girlfriend to fall back to whenever I felt like shit, as in that she's a good enough reason for me to stay healthy/happy but now even that isn't a good enough reason anymore
