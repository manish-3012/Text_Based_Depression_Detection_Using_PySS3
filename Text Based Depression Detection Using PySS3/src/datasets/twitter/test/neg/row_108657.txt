Iâ€™m not sure if I am suicidal, so I donâ€™t know if I belong here. I do know that for the past... I donâ€™t know, 7 years?, suicide has not been far from my mind. I think about it every day. Every single day I have to convince myself itâ€™s not a good idea. Or at least it shouldnâ€™t be.I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed. I have depressive moments, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m clinically depressed. Iâ€™ve seen a therapist. They donâ€™t honk Iâ€™m clinically depressed. But I think of suicide almost every day. And not just in general. I have very specific ideas of what I want to do and how I want to end it. I have pets and I even have an idea on how to make sure they are taken cared of if I do go through with my plans. 

And my reason for killing myself is not because of HAVING a reason to do so, but more
NOT having a reason to live. Like why? I donâ€™t think my life makes a difference. Or anything Iâ€™m doing makes anyoneâ€™s life better. Why do I need to keep existing? 

I also donâ€™t know if I want my life to matter or if I want to make the effort of making a difference. 

Almost every day I think about dying. Sometimes thereâ€™s a trigger no matter show slight - like I feel my friends donâ€™t like me, or I had an argument with someone that made me feel worthless. I donâ€™t need a reason to kill myself. Iâ€™m looking for a reason to continue living. Itâ€™s hard.

I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m in my 30s and I feel like this has been my state for a long time. Iâ€™ve only survived this long because I havenâ€™t felt strongly either way, but as more time passes I just donâ€™t see the point in existing.
