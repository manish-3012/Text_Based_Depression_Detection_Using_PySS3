Fifth of Vodka and A .45Well, here I am reddit. I used to be a king of my castle. Had the girl I wanted to marry wrapped up. But like all good things 9 times out of 10 it's to good to be true. She broke me. Belittled me and has destroyed me over the past month. It has been such a messy break up. I have always been a manic depressive. I find little joy in anything. She was my only joy. The brightest star in my night.

She said she wanted children, marriage, and all around commitment. As did I. But today she said she doesn't care if I live or die. I have relapsed after being sober for months. This life really doesn't serve a purpose anymore. I really can't find happiness in anything. Life has always felt meaningless to I. So here I sit second guessing my decision of shooting my heart with a .45 acp. I was going to do it at midnight and now the time is 1:20. I do not fear death. I just fear for my loved ones. I told her even if we're not together I still want whatever it takes to make her happy. Which is staying out of her life completely and as she stated "Why don't you just fucking kill yourself already, you tried once and failed. LIKE ALWAYS You're a failure and will never amount to anything. You want a degree in astronomy WTF IS THAT GOING TO DO FOR YOU YOU FUCKING FAILURE JUST DIE." And all I did was ask how she was today...

It may seem sloppy what I've posted here. However, I am quite impaired. I just can't seem to find reasons not to go through with my plan. I already have my last words on paper directed at my ex love. Nothing harsh and no blame. Just memories of the good times and reminding her that even though she wants me to be dead that I still support her in everything she wants to do and will do what it takes to make it happen for her...

Edit: Well, how odd a strange turn off events. She texted me this morning and is sorry for being such a bitch and that she doesnt understand why I can't be a man and get over. To which i explained all the things she made me believe and why it's hard. Eventually I asked if she ever sees an us again and she said in a year most likely. Which i told her in a year i'll probably be loving on someone else and I won't crush that person to be with her. Then she got mad and said "Don't talk to me. Bye" Just said Okay bye.
