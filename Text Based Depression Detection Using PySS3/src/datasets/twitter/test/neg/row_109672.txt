This virus, the stress, everythingI'm getting extremely uneasy.

It's been a while since I have felt genuinely suicidal, but everything to do with this Coronavirus and the lack of a response to it is scaring me to death. My stress levels are through the roof. For the last week, I have woken up wondering "is this going to be the day I get sick? Is this going to be the day I get laid off, because my boss can't afford to pay the workers with the slowing business?"

Not only that, but my family. I only live with my brother, but we both basically depend on each other to survive. We help each other around the house, we share our money to pay the bills, and we are just barely getting by. We can't afford a medical emergency. I also firmly believe that if either one of us gets sick, we won't have the option to "stay home" because the alternative is a serious hit to our income.

I'll be honest. I'm already stressed beyond my normal limit, so I have a bad feeling that adding to that stress with the reality of actually getting sick means I would die regardless. Despite normally having one of the best immune systems in my entire family; that doesn't mean a damn thing if I'm too physically worn down to take care of myself. I am supposed to be the head of household, and I feel like I'm falling apart.
