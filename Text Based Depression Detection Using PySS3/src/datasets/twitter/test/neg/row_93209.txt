Tell me why suicide is bad.... and I don't mean silly platitudes like, "because things will get better" or "because sunrises" or "because people love you" or shit like that. 

I want a logical reason why suicide is bad. Why are people deemed mostly autonomous, told they can do anything, be anyone ... except when the only thing they want is to die?  

I consider suicide in much the same way I do abortion, and I'm pro-choice. How can anyone call themselves pro-choice if they don't respect another person's right to die? To rationally decide that their life is not meaningful or valuable to them. How does that affect *anything*, realistically? The earth will keep spinning, sun keeps shining, etc. It doesn't *matter*. Nothing matters. 

Meaning and value are very personal things, so what makes life meaningful to you doesn't change anything for me. Me dying wouldn't change anything for you. But I'm just supposed to keep on slogging because I "matter"? To who? Not to me. 

So why am I supposed to just keep going through these painfully pointless motions for the rest of forever? Is there an actual reason?
