I don't knowIt's taking a lot of effort to stop myself from going to chill at some train tracks right now. This is the worst year of my life. Everything has fallen apart. I have nobody anymore. I push everyone away. I don't want to just give in and kill myself but I also don't see any point in living anymore.

I feel weak not being able to deal with life but I also feel weak by being too scared to end it all.
