Christmas is so hardEvery one is so happy and excited but Iâ€™m just here crying in the bathroom. I hate Christmas because I never have fun. I have to return most Christmas stuff because my family hardly knows me. They get me things but every year they get things I donâ€™t like. My family doesnâ€™t know me. Donâ€™t get me wrong I see the good intentions and Iâ€™m thankful but really hurts knowing your family doesnâ€™t know you. And Iâ€™m about to have a family dinner. How can I look any of them in the eye. I canâ€™t handle a family dinner. Iâ€™m not emotionally strong enough at the moments. It all just wants to make me die more.
