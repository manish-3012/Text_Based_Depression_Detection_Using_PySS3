I need someone to talk to.   I've been going through a major heartbreak these past fews months. I can't talk to any of my friends because they just look at my like I'm a pitiful puppy. I've broken down in front of my best friend several times just for her to avoid my gaze and ignore me. 
   I'm just really lonely and so fucking hurt and I want it to stop. It's like I never stop crying. My heart feels like it's ripped out of my chest daily. It's to the point where I feel like I'm physically in pain. I don't know what to do anymore. I've let my grades slip. I used to be a straight-A student but I just don't care anymore. I used to cut when I was younger and sometimes I think about doing it again. I think about throwing myself into traffic or overdosing, or just slitting my arms in the tub. I just don't have the courage. Maybe half of me wants to live but the other half wishes to die. I'm just so conflicted.A day doesn't go by that I don't wish I was dead, and I just want it to stop. Please help?
