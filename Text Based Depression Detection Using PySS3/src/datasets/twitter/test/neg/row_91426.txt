I'm a failure and I've been lying to my family and friendsGraduated high school and started uni in 2010. I'm so lazy and I don't like studying. First year I got put on academic probation because I failed a bunch of courses. Couple semesters later I was required to withdraw because of my poor marks. I started taking classes at a local college because I thought they had the program that I wanted to study. They didn't. And I was too scared to tell my parents because they just want me to get a degree. I've been telling them about a fake graduation date and that date is in two days. When my friends asked when I'm graduating, that's the same date that I told them. No one knows I'm not actually done school and not able to graduate in two days. Ive told my parents so many lies and I don't know how to tell them the truth. I've been thinking of killing myself since last year when I found out the college didn't have the program that I intended to study.  Since then I had just been studying random electives and telling myself I must leave this world before the "graduation" day because I just don't know how to face the truth. I wanna die, but at the same time I'm such a wussy and scared of the pain. Jumping in front of a train seems painful but it should be quick right? There aren't many tall buildings in my area for me to jump off of either. I'm also scared of not dying. What if I drive a car into oncoming traffic and the airbag saves me? Fuck. My parents will be so sad if I died but I can't face them if I told them the truth. I love my siblings. I love my dog. I don't know what to do. I really wanna get this over with in the next day.
