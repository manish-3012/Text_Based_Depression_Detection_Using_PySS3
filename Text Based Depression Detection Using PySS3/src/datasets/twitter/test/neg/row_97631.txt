I've been having thoughts and I don't know how to fix it.My first thought about committing such an act happened ten years ago, I was only 13 and was almost sure these emotions would go away. I am embarrassed to admit that's when I started self-harming. It continued on for years, even when I hit college. Recently, maybe the past two years or so, I've started having panic attacks here and there, and have also noticed that I stop breathing in my sleep. I freak out a lot about these things because, to be quite honest, I don't believe in them. I never understood anxiety, and I always felt like panic attacks were just people's exaggerations, so admitting to this is kind of embarrassing. I've had suicidal thoughts everyday now for the past couple of months, I really need help shaking it off. I've lost so much weight, some days I sleep all day, other days I don't sleep at all, I want to get better. How do I do this, how do I go about this? I'm tired of being so dark and down all day!!!!!
