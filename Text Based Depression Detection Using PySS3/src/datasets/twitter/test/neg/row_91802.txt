I'll never not be a wage slaveThis world was not made for someone like me.

 Someone that just doesn't want to engage in the world around him. 

Someone that doesn't want to meet new people.

 Someone that doesn't want to take on more responsibility. 

Someone that doesn't want to make or create things. 

Someone who is incurious about the world around him. 

Someone who would rather live undetected under a rock. 

Someone who doesn't have the courage to play a part on the world stage. 

Someone who doesn't want to learn something new. 

Someone that doesn't want to put themselves out there.

Someone without hope for the future.

Someone who doesn't want to make plans.

Someone without dreams or desires.

Someone who doesn't like talking.

There's no hope.
