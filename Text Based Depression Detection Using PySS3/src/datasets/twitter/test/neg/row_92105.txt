I can't stop fucking up and I don't want to do this anymore.Everything is my life is an absolute shit-show right now and I really don't want to continue doing this. In the past week I managed to lose my $300 GoPro, develop a hernia, strain my meniscus to the point where I almost tore it and got a 6 point speeding ticket because of a school zone.

I've struggled with depression for a long time and this just feels like an uphill battle that I'm not going to win. This feels like pushing a large rock up a hill and once I get to the top it just comes rolling back down and knocking me to the bottom again in the process. I fucking hate being alive. Everybody keeps telling me the same shit that it's going to get better but it doesn't. Things always have a way of getting worse immediately after something good happens. I don't have the motivation to keep doing this.

I'm feel like I'm fucking friends over constantly, I feel horrible about get a speeding ticket in the car my parents gave me that's now going to fuck the insurance that they pay 50% of. I lost my job and I have no clue what I'm going to do with that ticket unless I get it reduced by a considerable amount in court, which might be possible as it's my first offense ever on my record but I just don't want to even try. I fuck everything up and knowing my luck I'd end up waiting two hours at the courthouse for my number to be called and be told that it can't be reduced afterwords, meaning I'd lose my license and pay a shitload in fines.

I hate myself and I hate everything I do. I have plan set up to just overdose on painkillers tonight, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to get myself to follow through with it. I don't want to keep doing this. I don't know what else to do.
