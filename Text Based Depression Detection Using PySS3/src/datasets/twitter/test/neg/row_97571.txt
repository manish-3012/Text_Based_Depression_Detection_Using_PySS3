Nothing works outMy whole life is a series of Good things happening with promise that inevitabley fail or are ripped away from me. Every decent band I've been in breaks up, every relationship, everything, any decent job. I thought I had toughened up after a lot of it but I met a woman and fell in love and she let me fall, encouraged it, and two days removed from being in my bed she decides she no longer wants anything to do with me. There is no fucking point, everything I do leads nowhere. Brief glimmers of hope squashed out. I am poor and unemployed, college drop out. The only thing keeping me from ending it is thinking how my parents would feel. And that just puts more guilt on me. I'm already a shitty dissapointment of a son. Cliche depressive person. I try to stay positive, and it seems like things get better, and then like clockwork it all fucks up. Maybe I just deserve nothing. I am a shitty person and I wish I could go kill myself without hurting my parents. Anyways. There is a rant. Fuck everything "I fight the demons as much as I can but no good comes from it. I am in hell"
