I already feel dead and forgottenIâ€™ve reached out on every platform that I possibly can just to get somebody to listen or talk to me and I cannot express to you how discouraged I am to continue my existence. I already have everything planned out, itâ€™s just a matter of time because my set date Is about 2 months from now. Iâ€™ve given plenty of warning and yet itâ€™s overlooked and shrugged off by everyone.
I canâ€™t afford to seek professional help and Iâ€™m really just over trying.

Iâ€™m not seeking conversation at this point. I genuinely believe I have my mind made up on this moment. 
Thanks for reading.
