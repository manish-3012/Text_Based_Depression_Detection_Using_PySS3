My Best Friend of Seven Years Left MeMy grades are going downhill (I go to Community College), and I have a history of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and abandonement from my family members. What's really devastating me at the moment is my ex-best friend ditching me for another "best friend." I've loved him, and still do. In addition to all this, I'm an in-closet gay male. Everyday, I put on a show for everyone, so nobody gets too concerned about me. I have been suicidal for awhile now, but I'm looking for any kind of hope or will to live . . . But it's slowly diminishing as every day goes by. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
