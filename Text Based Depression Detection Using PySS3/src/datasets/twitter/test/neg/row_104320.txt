My Time Will Be ShortI'm a 16-year-old boy from the south of England. The area I grew up in was very rough, even if you don't count all the stabbings and shootings. Where I was, you either had to be part of a very big group of friends that could back you up and look after each other (gang if you will) or be the target that everyone went for. Unfortunately, I was the latter. From the age of 4, I was always the one that was left out. The one no one cared about. The one everyone forgot existed. I never had any people that would give me a chance on being a friend. This grew progressively worse as I grew up and when I was in year 5, all day every day I was bullied. You would think that going into the high school might have been a fresh start, well think again. Within the first hour, people spread rumours around about me. By the time it was December in my first year, I had lashed out at some of these people and had a chance of being done for 2 counts of ABH on 2 different people. This made it worse and like my first 7 years of school, it got worse, very quickly. By the end of high school, I had 1 person that stopped me from cutting myself or just committing.

Life at home was not much easier. My oldest brother, the person that I looked up to, was never part of my life cause my house not liking him. I had better luck with my sister, I see her about 2 a year. Just cause she has kids and wants my father to see them. Talking of him, He is a drunk with no fuse. For years, he used to hit me and my brother just because we said something he didn't like. To this day, he treats me as if I am his personal servant. I'm not a strong person so I cannot defend myself if I say no, so I have to do all the chores he cannot be bothered to do. My brother takes a lot after my father. He feels that I must do what he cannot be bothered to do. He must always be right. If you said the sky was blue he would say it was red just to start an argument. He goes to the gym and plays rugby for his school, so I have no chance at winning with him.

I have nearly had to call the police once a month on these two. Only stopping cause my mom cannot afford to pay my house on her salary. So I just watch. I watch my brother throw a punch and get thrown across the room. The last time this happened, I had to grab the biggest sharpest knife we had to keep them away from me.

For the past 5 years, I have played games with different people cause no-one ever can resist the urge to insult me. Even the people that I have known for years have decided to insult me and move on.

That's the shortened version.

Anyway, I have given up on trying to make my situation work anymore. The only reason I am still here and not done it yet is cause I cannot bring my self to do it... Yet. I know my time will be short and I am not here to try and extend it. I am just trying to explain to the people that might know me (if they ever find this) what I am going through or went through before I went.
