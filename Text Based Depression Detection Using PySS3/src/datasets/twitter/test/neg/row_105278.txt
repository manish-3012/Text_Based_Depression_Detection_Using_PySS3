coming close to killing myself over drunk awfulness i did a few months"I fucked up big time. 3 nights ago, I made a big drunken mistake. Was at a weekend fire with a few friends including "abby" and "jon". jon and abby are pretty much dating but unofficial. I (19) in a long distance relationship with my first girlfriend who means the world to me and she says I mean the world to her. Anyway as that night wound down a bunch of us went into the back of one of our's car to sleep. Jon who was got very very fucked up passed out earlier and was asleep in between abby and i. somehow, i dont know how it happened but my fingers ended up in abbys mouth and i let it happen longer than i should have and even put my fingers back after i took them away. for some reason in my drunkenness, i didnt recognize it as cheating at the time, but i suppose i realized it was wrong. i woke up feeling awful and immediately told my gf but painted myself as innocent in the situation. I've never seen abby as anything more than a friend and i think she thinks the same towards me. I asked her about it the next day and she seemed surprised and said she had no recollection of that. I learned a lesson about drinking and making mistakes, but this is mistake i dont think i can forgive especially considering its something i never think id even be capable of. ive always seen myself as a good guy who always does the best he can for everyone and never would hurt anyone but now ive wronged several of the most important people in my life. but i cant view myself the same anymore. I know i should tell my gf the 100% unbiased truth but i cant. i could not do without her (she helped me out of a tarpit of depression, selfhatred and helped me become a better person) and she couldn't do well without me. Any advice before I do anything to hurt myself?"

Lately I've been thinking about this whole incident and what if the girl was too drunk to know what was happening? what if she was asleep? did i sexually assault her? or am i overanalyzing it? i asked her about it after it happened and she said she didn't remember but everything has been normal around her since. i am freaking out about this. i feel like ive wronged everyone in my life and im such a huge peice of shit that does what he wants. this is not who i am and who i want to be
