I don't really know how to cope and handle these emotionsI have been thinking about suicide for a while now, but have had my ups and downs about it. I just don't know how to get out of this spiral of getting up and falling back down to almost committing to ending it all.

Does someone have advice on how to make my "I'm good" less fragile?
