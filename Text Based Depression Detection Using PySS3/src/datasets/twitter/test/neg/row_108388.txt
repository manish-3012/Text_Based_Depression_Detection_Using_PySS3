Whatâ€™s the point?Iâ€™ve come to the realisation that there is literally no point to my life so whatâ€™s the point in going through all of the hard things when nothing will be ever achieved? i have got psoriasis which means i have red flaky skin from my scalp to my toes i mean i canâ€™t even get a haircut because iâ€™m so embarrassed. i wonâ€™t wear short sleeves or shorts and psoriasis canâ€™t be cured so iâ€™m going to feel insecure and embarrassed every single day of my life. Both of my parents are not bothered about me i have never even lived with them so if my own parents donâ€™t care then why will anybody else? iâ€™m 20 iâ€™ve never even had a girlfriend and i feel like iâ€™m just living a pointless life, my job is on a knife edge and if i lose that i have 0 source of income and i donâ€™t think i have the confidence to even get another job or the energy to apply. i think it would be so much better if i just died i just need a way to do it quickly. i think everyone who reads this will agree i serve no purpose and nobody would care if i was gone
