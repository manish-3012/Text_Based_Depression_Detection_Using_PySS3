I've made a series of poor decisions.I am at a loss for where to start. I broke up with my girlfriend of four years, I devoted the last four years to her. I feel like I am left with nothing, no strong frienships that I can fall back on. Those have all disolved over the last four years. I've tried falling back on them, I'm confronted with nothing but a complete lack of sympathy. That's not where this started. That's where this has ended up.

I'm a student and I feel guilty for being able to be here. I feel like there are countless people that deserve this more than I do. I feel like I am wasting not only my money, but the money of my parents. I can't see myself getting a job in my current major, and can't see me wanting one, either. But I feel obligated to finish what I've started. I hate this. I feel an utter lack of freedom here. And I feel guilty about feeling like that because I know that there are so many people who would give up everything they know to be in my shoes right now, regardless of career choices.

But most of all I am alone in this world. I don't connect with anyone. I suffer from social anxiety so meeting people generally causes me days of stress leading up to the date. I hate not being able to find the courage to talk to people. I I am going to die alone and will be soon forgotten.
