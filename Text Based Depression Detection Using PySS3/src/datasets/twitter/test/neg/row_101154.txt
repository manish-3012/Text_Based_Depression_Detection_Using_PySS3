Honestly suicide is much easier than the struggle to find money bullshitI am currently suicidal and still dont have the guts yet to kill myself but who knows one day i will snap and suicide. I already sick with this struggle to find money at the moment. From my observation, this world sucks and we need to find money to stay alive on this shit world. Even hell is better than this world because at least in hell i dont have to worry about money.
