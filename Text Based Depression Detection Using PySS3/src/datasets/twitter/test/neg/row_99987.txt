Waste of oxygenThat's how I feel. Like a freaking waste of oxygen. My parents love me, but they think I am tough to handle. I am 25, I'm studying and I feel like the whole world would be much better off if I haven't been born. I don't want to kill myself right at the moment, but it's been a prevailing feeling of mine, that I should not exist, that I should escape this world. I feel like people don't even care. Apart from my parents and sister, nobody would miss me. So what is the point in me staying alive?
