I can't keep upI can't keep up with school grades. I'm so overweight and I can't stop eating I know that's a part of depression but it hurts me so much. And I don't have the will to shower everyday and I keep getting given out to about it when nobody realises that I have a metal disorder and I really just can't. And I've told everyone, my teacher, classmates, family everyone but they don't care. They treat me like I should be able to keep up with everything and everyone. I've tried reaching out but nobody listens they just move it to the side a pretend it never happened. Nobody cares. (I know some of you on this subreddit might but nobody near me cares and nobody wants it to be there problem) and my therapist isn't helping me they at all there just pushing me more toward suicide but I still can't bring myself to do it. What do I do?
