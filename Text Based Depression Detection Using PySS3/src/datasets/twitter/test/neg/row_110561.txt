first time I actually wanted to go through with it todayI just got up from sitting in the shower for 45 minutes and the feeling of wanting to take the whole bottle of my husbandâ€™s Xanax has passed. 

I should be fine. I havenâ€™t lost my job because of Covid, I can work from home, my husband can work from home, none of our family or close friends have gotten sick. I know this makes me luckier and more privileged than like 60%+ of people out there and it sickens me that Iâ€™m taking it like such a pussy. I have a PhD, Iâ€™m well-regarded in my field, I have an amazingly generous book deal. Iâ€™ve carved out a niche for myself in my work that I never could have dreamed of years ago. But since moving on from a sort of generically abusive situation in grad school to a highly demanding, nonstandard position in a sort-of adjacent industry, every time I feel like I am making a mistake or donâ€™t live up to the skill set of my colleagues (I have a different, complementary skill set...which is why we collaborate. Sort of like a theoretical scientist and and engineer working together) I have felt like I deserve to die. Went from that job to another abusive research job at a university where every time I felt like I was making a mistake (but really it was my hack of a boss being an asshole) I also felt like I should die. 

Now my industry is dying, people I have collaborated with and built relationships with are closing up shop left and right, or being outed for being abusive assholes to their staff or systemically racist. Which is good, they shouldnâ€™t be able to do that. But itâ€™s all the kind of stuff I just accepted I had to put with for years, so I did. Someone I know got outed &amp; canceled last week, another today and reading about it made my heart pound with fear and nausea. If itâ€™s true, they should not be doing what they do. But if they come back, and I didnâ€™t defend them, will they punish me? And for the first time in 5-6 years, I have no idea what my job will be in a yearâ€™s time, if any of my consulting work will continue, WTF Iâ€™m supposed to do for work and to support myself. 

And my husband (whoâ€™s just very type A and canâ€™t help himself) brought up a time I made a vaguely similar mistake as one of them (NOT abuse/racism; an issue with pest control) that I did fix and thought we had moved on from. But he seemed weirdly quiet and intense about it and so I asked â€œdoes that make you disappointed in me as a person, that I let that happenâ€ and he said a little bit, and then we talked more and he tells me how much he loves me and that he just wants to make sure Iâ€™m not making avoidable mistakes. and here I am after he went to bed, supposed to be working but fantasizing about taking all the Xanax. I know heâ€™s just also stressed about the future of his workplace/industry, and needs to latch on to weird things to feel some sense of, I guess, predictability or safety or certainty (if you hyperfixate on a potential issue, it can never take you by surprise, etc). But this really isnâ€™t actually about him, since I can turn literally anything into a reason to feel bad about myself. 

I just feel like Iâ€™m going to be outed (not for anything specific) as an utter failure and a sham and Iâ€™ll never work again, and the only people who can get stable jobs have secret stashes of family money or rich spouses that Iâ€™ll never have.  And it just, truly, feels like it would be better to be dead. And staying alive and finishing my book and waiting for it to come out is just delaying the inevitable, and Iâ€™m so fortunate and privileged to have the kind of profile I do that I should also just die as punishment for not being more appreciative and not making more out of my opportunities. I get maybe 2-3 hours of work done per day and zone out the rest of the time. 

thanks for listening. Sorry for the essay. I have a therapist I talk to 3x a week so Iâ€™m covered there.
