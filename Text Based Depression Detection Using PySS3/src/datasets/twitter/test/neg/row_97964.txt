Tired of everything being my faultI'm stuck in this shitty house where everything is blamed on me. If my dad doesn't clean something, I get yelled at by my roommates. If I get yelled at by my roommates, my dad yells at me. Ny dad yells at me about everything and I just want it to stop. I can't focus on anything because anytime I hear his voice I'm terrified and his room is right next to mine. He purposely sets me up into situations where he can yell at me. One of my roommates works from home in the kitchen and asks not to be disturbed during her work hours. So, my dad will order me to go in there to disturb her. If I disobey, he yells and threatens me until I do it. If I obey, she yells at me, then he yells at me for being yelled at. I'm stuck in this hell for another 2 years. On top of that, I'm trans and he despises me for that. He refuses to refer to me as his son at all, then is confused that I don't want to be around him.


I'm just so tired. Nothing's stopping me anymore, everything's been taken and everything that hasn't been is constantly threatened. The only thing stopping me is that I don't have a good method. I think I found one, though. I'm allergic to certain types of painkillers and my dad has a whole bottle of them in his drawer. It doesn't sound peaceful but its deadly and I don't have anything else.
