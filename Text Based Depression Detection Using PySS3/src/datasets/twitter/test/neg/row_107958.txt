Most things in my life are going right, and that makes me want to kill myself even more.I have a job I love, and I just got a major promotion. To anyone else's eyes, I'm ecstatic. Inside, I'm already falling apart. 

I've never been able to make a good thing last in my life. I self sabotage. I screw up. And I just want to kill myself before I get the chance to mess up this huge opportunity. 

I start in just under two weeks and, without the courage to actually pull the trigger, I've been hoping that one day I just won't wake up. That I'll get in a major car crash. Anything is better than disappointing myself and everyone else all over again. I'm sinking back into that depression where nothing is fun or exciting anymore, so all I have to focus on is this dread.

I really want to die, because I don't trust or have faith in myself.
