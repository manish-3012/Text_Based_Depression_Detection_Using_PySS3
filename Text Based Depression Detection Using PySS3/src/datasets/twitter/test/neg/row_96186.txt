Whenever I tell my parents Iâ€™m tired of living they threaten to beat me up for thinking that way.I donâ€™t know why they do that. I think itâ€™s their way of trying to snap me out of it but Iâ€™m getting so tired of them threatening to hurt me for being suicidal and not trying to help me find help for it. They think therapists and mental hospitals are for schizophrenics or anyone in that area and I would probably embarrass them and my extended family.
