SpiralingIdk what's wrong with me. I can have an amazing day and manage to fuck it all up. I have support other people can only dream of. When I call my friends they are there and supportive without fail. I have a S/O who loves me more than I deserve. And here I am looking up the best way to kill myself with pills.

I used to think it was all a cry for help. But the more I push my S/O away, pick fights, etc; the more I feel like I don't want to hurt them, but I don't want to be here anymore either. I will never be what they need and certainly not what they deserve. I just want it all to stop.
