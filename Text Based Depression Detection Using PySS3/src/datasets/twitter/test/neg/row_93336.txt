I've been a complete failure since 2010, lost it all once again and I'm too emotionally tired to start againI've just been expelled from university because of failing a course for the third time (fucking thermodynamics, no matter what I did, I couldn't understand it). My parents made a lot of effort helping me pay for uni, but I'm too stupid for it. They don't know it yet, I can't tell them, I won't be able to watch the sadness in their faces. The dissapointment. 

I was supposed to excel at uni, good grades during all my school years. Stayed away from drugs, excessive drinking, overall good habits. Had an above average performance during uni. But that fucking course. I had to fail it. I had to be a complete idiot and not being able to understand it not one, but three times. 

My life is over. I won't be able to achieve anything in life without a degree. I failed to be a role model for my sister. She is more intelligent than me at least, she's doing great at uni, got into an exchange program for Spain. I hope that she continues to do better. I hope that she is able to bring happiness to my parents, the same happiness that I failed to give them when I was here.

I can't start over. I'm too old (at least for my country standards). I'll probably jump off my uni's last floor. There's no hope left for me. At least if I'm dead I won't dissapoint anyone anymore.
