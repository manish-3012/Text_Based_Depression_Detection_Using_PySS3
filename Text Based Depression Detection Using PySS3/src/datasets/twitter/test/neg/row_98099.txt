Whenever I feel sick I get slightly disappointed when itâ€™s not terminal cancerAnd that makes me feel so disgusting. Real people suffer and die everyday of this horrible disease and I couldnâ€™t even begin to imagine what theyâ€™re going through - so it feels so selfish and ignorant to feel this way, but I canâ€™t help it. 

Itâ€™s not that I actively wish for it - I know itâ€™s one of the worst things a person can go through - but a part of me feels like it would be a tiny relief. It would be a passive way of dying - my parents would know itâ€™s not their fault, my friends would know itâ€™s not their fault. It would be seen as just a tragic teen death and not a selfish act of weakness.
