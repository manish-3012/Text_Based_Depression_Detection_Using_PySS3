i have no one to talk to, but peace out world.I'm a 29 years old, so I'm a woman who has actually tried to make things better and improve my life. However, I discovered recently that I am so numb to the world that I don't think I will ever feel anything again. I have nobody in my life to talk to, and spend most of my time by myself. I have no goals, dreams, ambitions...things are so hopeless. it is best if I cut my losses and stop here.
