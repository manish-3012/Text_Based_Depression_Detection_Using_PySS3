I was going to commit suicide but couldn't afford/find a gun. Now I need a goal.32 year old man.  I've never seen this sub before tonight but I was hoping for some help.

Long story short,  I was going to kill myself a while ago but my grandfather no longer keeps his pistol where he had it when I was a kid.  My next idea was to buy a gun but I couldn't even afford something cheap.  This is because the job search has not been going well.  I felt worthless to my family and I didn't know why I would choose to continue living if nothing mattered.  I'm doing much better.

I need help with finding a goal that I care about.  Anyone have any ideas on how I go about finding a goal if I don't feel like I have any interest in anything?  I just feel like I have obligations but no real interests.  Since none of you know me from Adam, I wouldn't want to waste your time asking for specific goals; I'm just looking for some tips on how to find my own.

P.S.:  I have an interview lined up for a good position so hopefully that goes well.
