SuicideSo for days now ive had 1880 mg of a very fatal beta blocker sitting on my counter.. Honestly im young... 19 but 20 in three months.  Uhm my age truly has nothing to do with hormones social problems or whatever the hell you all want to chalk it up to.  LoL.  Ive been dealing with everyday suicidal thoughts since i was 11...but from the time i was 6my mom was away for months at a time being her addict self and me and my "older"  bro who i took care of lived alone in our mobile home my mom owned without food tv or power.  We made it work but we struggled like this until i was 17 and got kicked out.  Now my mom and her new beau pay for my brother to live in a one bedroom apartment and have for almost 3 years now but me?  Hell no.  Been couch surfing my whole life never done any drug. Other than smoked pot and i quit that well over a year ago.. I live in canada too so its not super illegal here by any means to be a teenager and blaze a little.. Ill admit i blazed a lot more than a little but i grew outta that cause even that wasnt helping me anymore.  I dont smoke cigarettes or drink either and for that reason i have lost all my immature friends who dont want to be around me because im no fun anymore.  Im just a depressed motionless numb annoying individual.  I have nothing but negativity to share.. I used to for so long,  despite alk my hurt and pain and what ive went through i was always there for anyone who needed it.. I was so selfless.  And i now realize thats why. No one wanta me anymore is because im hurting so bad i can barely help others with their issues so who would want to help me? Its fucked really.  I dont even know.  On tuesday.. 3 or 4 or whatever the fuck amount of days ago i miscarried my second child at 7.5 weeks.  Me and my boyfriend of over a year luved together and we have been actively trying for a baby for 8 months.  I work full time night shuft at a lumber mill and im literally the only female that worka at that company and ive had the job for 9 months and despite suicidal thoughts depression ocd ptsd and anxiety i somehow havent lost it yet.  My employers are well aware of my mental instability but i would be on the street if i didnt force myself to work... Im off for a few days because im bleeding buckets and just expelled my embryo yesterday.. I saved it for genetic testing but apparently they cant test an embryo until its your third miscarriage LOL so id have to lose a third fucking baby to maybe just possibly.. Find out whats wrong with me and my reproductuve system.  I got a vaginal ultrasound today to make sure everything was expelling normally.. It is..  But she saw masses ans fibroids and my ovaries are a third of a size they should be.  The tech told me my doctor would be calling me right on monday.. As it was friday when i got ultrasound.  I realie its saturday now but its 3 am... Im still awake on my friday.  I was gonna be a virgin till 19 but then i lost it to a rapist at 16. I got alk necessary tests done no stds and what not but it fucked me for life.  He didnt just fuck my reproductive organ.  He fucked my brain and my heart nd my head and my life and those around me.  If that didnt happen im sure i wouldve been okay with the fucked up family shit.  Anyways ive beenssaulted as a child by my uncle as well.  Not sex but i dont even wanna get into it its fucking horrifying.  I also got touched by my step brother just earlier this year and now hes not aloud around me.. Thank god.  Anyway this is just ridiculous.  None of that is even the worst of whats happened to me.  I dont have a fucking dad i dont have a mom i dont have family me and my bro lost contact because now hes happy on his own why would he need to talk to sad lil me? I probably am a terrible reminder of his fucked up childhood but he was all i had when younger plus my gramma but now shes gone and so is he... But hes still here on this esrth which rips me apart cause he knows a lot of what im going through.  Not the rape and miscarriages but he know s the family shit and the neglect and utmost physical and emotional abuse we suffered. Ive had 13 different social workers in my life but thay was over 5 years ago? Can you tell im never gonna move on?  Haha.  I actually went as far as calling the crisis hotline last night for help cauae i actually had my pills on the counter.  Ready to meet my maker.  This lovely woman named rhea convinced me to out the pills back in the bottle and in the cupboard.  I did so and she advised i call an ambulance or friend to drive me to hospital while she stay on other line so i tried to call a friend.  As soon as i did that the held calll got released and that amazing soul who was so understanding and talked me down was gone... I didnt do anything and ive never had a held call released before.  I dont know if she bulshitted about staying on the line then just hung up when i put her on hold to get away from it all.. But i doubt it.  She was so helpful and so worried.  So i was devastated and to top it off the friend i called didnt even fucking answer.  No one is here for me anymore.  Ive struggled with suicdal thoughts so long that recebtly even my bestfriend told me he would care if. I did kill myself.. And he is 25. Real fucking mature right?  He said oh if yiu actualy do do it this time it wont phase me.  Ill live with it.  Thats how far i have evidently pushed EVERYONE away.  Hes not the only one.  So i am awake rackong my brain for a sure fire way to leave this hell.  I cant anymore and if anyone doesnt understand why yall can go fuck yourselves too.  Ive been on 13 different anti psychotic antidepressant and anti anxietys in the past 7 years.  Theyve all ran their proper trials.  I have bipolar type 2. A severe case of ocd and anxiety which very much includes social to the. Point i panic everyday before work.  I used to be so addicted to ativan i tried over dosing on it once ended up in hhospital.  Also tried overdosing on adderrall and ended up getting aactivated charcoal instead of dying.  Ive tried drowning myself in the sink with tape over top of my head and lots of it then turning tap on.  My survival instinct got my the fuck out of there.  I choke myself everyday HARD.  I knkw i have permanant scar tissue damage in my throat/neck.  Therws no way i dont.  And i hit myself in the head very hard almost daily too.. Ive hurt for far too long and on top of ocd anxiety depression with ever changing bipolar 2 i have ptsd from being assaulted and now from losing my second baby it destroyed me.  I have had immense amounts of counsellors too.  Theyve all left me.  So if you suggest i talk to anyone thatll drive me right off the edge.  Theres honestly nothing that ca. Help me.  Not moving.  Not changing a hobby or a job or anything.  Btw did i mention my boyfriend kicked me out cause he cant handle my depression over the lost baby im still expelling the placenta of? Okay sorru buckaroo that i lost our second kid but you really gonna break my heart more and leave me alone? I have no where to go.  Nothing to live for and i dont give a fuck about anyone or anything.  Except for my fucking cats.. Ugh theyre literally the only things that have kept me here so long. Mmwell and my incredible strength to get thru shit most woumdnt survive a day.  Im like a fucking super woman honestly.  Im not gonna ask why im not dead yet.  Its obviously cause i fought to survive.  But honestly.. You guys cant help me.  I dont know why i even made an accunt to post something haha the stupid sympathetic relplies are going to make me throw the fuck up. Sont tell me. What you think will help.  Just fucking dont.  I dont know why. I wrote this.  Seriously.  Dont answer that for me either.  Im done and i dont wanna fucking know why what happens happens or why ppl feel the way they feel or why. Virgins get raped or why crack heads carry babies to full term and someone who doesnt even drink caffiene cant.  It isnt a stress miscarriage either so fuck of f with that.  This last pregnancy was the last option for me.  It gave me ourpose.  I was so excited and so happy to have the love of my life and my second child torn away from me.  I cant stop looking at her or him in the container.. Can see the brain and spinal cord andeye sockets.  Its a beautidul embryo but it fucking tears me apart.  Seriously.  Can you guys not see how hurt i am that i dont even wanna hear what you have to say?  Cause i truly dont.  Nothing helps everything just. Makes everything worse.  So i guess i just wanted to vent and trust me.  You dont even know nearly half of what ive been through and this is. Probably too long to even post.. But yet yall are still gonna try to tell me blshit like you. Know how i feel.  Lol go ahead but i sssure yiu it will just. Make me sicker.  Im fucking sick and it fucking sucks.  I was an alright person.  Just having no childhood and the constant traumas really fucked me i guess.  I stayed strong for so long hut its been years now of trying to go and failing and also pushing through.  Trust me.  I might not take the pills today but i sure as hell will one day.. Hopefully soon cause everyday i wear thinner and this miscarriage was my true like full on complete breaking point i think.. Actuly no.  It was my boyfriend leaving me. Due to the miscarriage. But yeah... I hope i can. Grow the fuck up and snap outta it and get outta here soon.  I wish anyone luck whos feelingw this fucked to also do the same.  Cause personally i KNOWtheres no help.  Heard of trd?treatment resistant depression? Well get familiar.  And dknt try to be a hero or some advice guru.  It will only. Make it worse.  Please pills.. Just take me the fuck away.  I just wwanna swallow the pills but im scared to wake up in an ambulance again. Hospital the first time.. So uhm ueah.  I think im done..
