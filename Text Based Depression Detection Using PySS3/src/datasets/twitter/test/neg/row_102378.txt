I think I understand nowHello
First of all I'm not english, so if anyone out there decides to read this, please forgive me, I'll try to do my best explaining myself out because even tho I don't really have any truth in my life I feel that I need to tell this, and I cannot tell anyone who I love or loves me without burdening him.

I'll start my story where I think I started realizing that I had a problem. Back when I was a kid I would always be suffering bullying and stuff but it didn't really bothered me that much. Well, maybe it did, because truth is that from that very moment I started playing a role instead of developing my personality, I mean that back then, I didn't care about why the other kids harrassed me, I just knew that it was painful and wanted to end it. As I grew up I just tried to make as many friends as I could, and I would just play the person they would like to get it done. As time passed I started making some more sincere friendships and stuff and I think that I was comfortable with me not being myself because I just cared about getting the feel of getting loved by others. I didn't really care about anything, I just wanted to play computer games, have the best time I could going to school (despite how much I've always hated it) and not to make my parents angry. With time different relationships came to my life, and I don't really know why but it's love, or whatever the fuck I understand by "love" has been the trigger to realize what my problem was. Anyway, so this girl just really liked me so she asked me to hang out sometimes, first kiss blah blah blah, and stuff. It was really nice having someone loving you for no apparent reason but I didn't love her back. In that time I just felt guilty for not loving her back so I just played a role once again. Can't understand why, I guess love is too intense to feign, and even I didn't knew what it was like to love a girl in that time I couldn't take it anymore so I just kicked her out of my life. I never, until few days ago, felt guilty about that, I guess I know now what it means to love and to be loved, but it's not the guilt what makes me hate myself.

So, i just forgotten about her and continued. Next year I met a girl that I really fallen in love with. Long story short, it wasn't mutual, and I spended months and months suffering and thinking about it, living on the hope she would love me the same way. I never got over it, I just convinced myself that love was about that and I just was unfortunate that she didn't love me, so I just ended forgetting her. Also, during this second "relationship attempt" I got in so many troubles all on my own, which I never really knew why I got into them, I just blamed love for making me care less about every thing else. I got into fights with my parents that would end up with a bad relation with em, I lost so many friends because I hurted them, and now I know that it was intentional.
So after all of this I guess that if I couldn't fix myself I would just forget about my troubles, and I really convinced myself once again, I had dropped my career but wanted to study for some reason, maybe to make mom and dad happy, wanted to enjoy my life and be happy, so I just forgot about everything else that wasn't the stuff that made me happy. 

And then she walked into my life. Maybe you'll think I'm willing to kill myself because I'm heart-torn after you read how I speak about her but I cannot help it. I understand now that I cannot deny my feelings for her. Anyway, we met months ago, she was from a different city, not really far from me, and she was really nice. We met thanks to a friend of both, and we just played an online game together. I think that I started loving her from that very moment, but I cannot know, I cannot even know if I really love her. With time we started liking each other, and it was she that started talking to me in a friendlier way. Long story short, we forged a beautiful friendship, the most sincere and real that I think I've ever known, and I really thought she loved me as I did, she invited me to her city, she was the girl of my dreams. From nothing, I just passed from an unhappy but troubleless life to only feel really happy when I was talking with her. I met her in person before, but we started to get closer after that. So, we cuddled, we kissed, we had sex, all that nice stuff you would do with your girlfriend, but I couldn't really see or accept the fact that even though she trusted me that much she only saw me as a friend. I've thought for weeks that's what I cannot cope with, the fact of being not corresponded in such a thing like love. But well, after thinking of what I've done to her I really think I finally understand what my problem is. She was the nicest person ever, I trusted her all of my burdens and trouble and so did mine, but I always expected something that wouldn't ever come, I guess. I do think that I loved and still love her but even that I knew she had her own problems and burdens I only thought about myself and without thinking it started telling her about all the feelings that I couldn't comprehend, long story short my behaviour bothered her. Days that I just didn't want to talk to her so I just ignored her, days that I would be a real dick with her and days that I just wanted to make her know how important she was to me and how amazing she was, and is. After all this mayhem inside of me I decided to consider true whatever my feelings made me say, and I ignored the constant rumbling of my mind thinking of all kinds of bad thoughts about her, I didn't understand why but I couldn't trust her, I couldn't love her even tho I really thought I had understood what love means, among all the other stuff she has taught me.

Well, know that you know all of this I can explain myself. My problem is not that I hate not being loved back, I understand perfectly that feelings are not explainable and I don't want to try to understand them, but well, that's my problem in short words.

Most of the people may not find this as his biggest trouble, in fact I don't think there's much people like me out there, but for me all that matters is me and what I think and what I feel. I've been pretending all my life that I'm a nice person, I care about others but the things that have happened have taught me that I'm not. The more I love someone, the more I'm gonna hurt him, and the more that person loves me, the sooner I'll let him/her down. I cannot trust my feelings, this girl, or what she has made me feel has been the trigger, I finally know what bothers me so much. Same with my parents or with some of my truest friends that now I've lost forever, I do know that I love them, and also I know that I love them too much to make them go through my loving. This girl was just so sincere with me that all that was left in the end was me and my truth, and my only truth is that I don't understand anything about what matters to me, I won't ever do and believe it or not this is everything that is important to me. Now I know that my friends are friends with a person which I am not, I've hurted like I never had to the very same person that I love the most and only I've done this 
after firmly deciding that I was just gonna trust my feelings.
I understand now that I'm a bad person. Maybe I'm mistaken and I take hate for love, but know I'm sure that what my heart wants is to hurt all of those who I love or commit the mistake of loving me. I feel that life is nonsense if I'm not ever gonna feel satisfied about the only thing that matters to me, I hate my real me, I've burdened most of those who have ever loved me in any way with my bullshit and I've never been sincere with anyone, even not with me. 

I tried to kill myself once before, when I was at my worse back then, but then my feelings overwhelmed me and I couldn't do it. I understand now, more than ever, that the only thing that I can be ok with is me being myself. This last girl once told me that anyone would ever love me until I learned to love myself. I finally understand her words, I've been fooling myself pretending to be happy with myself so others could feel free to love me back, and everytime that I have opened a little of my secret stuff box for anyone I've burdened that person to the point I cannot accept his being my friend. Perhaps I always knew all of this and just obliged myself not to think too much of it because eventually I would find out who I am and realize that I cannot keep living any longer. What I did to myself, what I did to my loved ones, I can't handle that burden and I know that I won't be forgiven, neither by those who I've hurted nor myself. I understand now who I am and now I'm sure that I don't want anyone to love me ever again. Either my loving is harmful, either I keep trying to convince myself that I'm not like that. 

I've reached a point where I finally know enough about me to understand the reason I cannot be happy with my life. 

If i'm so sure, you may wonder why I am here, telling this to anyone out there. Maybe I trusted her in something after all, she really sounded convincing when she told me I was a good friend. Truth is that after knowing all of her trouble, all the people that had let her down in the past, knowing that I love her still I couldn't help having a conversation with her which I basicly forced her to kick me outta her life. The reason I'm here is that even tho I'm pretty sure that what I've done I've done it because I've been myself, and it makes me feel like the worst I've felt in my life. If I cannot be happy after learning the first real thing about me after 20 years on this planet, and now that I know that all I really care for is me, and I hate myself for it and it will never get better, I'm sure that life ain't worth living for me.

Maybe I keep a tiny slice of hope inside of me that I'm not really the motherfucker I know I am, maybe I just want to tell another human for any reason and I cannot burden any other friend.
