Suicide HelpI dont really know if this is where i go for advice for suicide.  but.  i need to die. which method will be more surefire to work and less painful.  at this point i am way more worried about whether it will work than pain. 

A.  take a crap load of painkillers and sleeping pills and lay face down in a bathtub. 

B.  take a bunch of pills and jump off the roof of my house into cement. 

the roof is about 35ft up.  also i am 14 years old.  male.  weigh about 125 pounds.  and 5' 7".

also, can anybody help me with a suicide note? 

also also, does anybody want a free ferret as long as you take care of him well.  he is the only thing i care about at this point.

thanks everybody
