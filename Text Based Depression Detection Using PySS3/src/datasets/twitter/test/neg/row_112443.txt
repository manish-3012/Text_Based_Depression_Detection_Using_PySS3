I wish I had feelingsI keep seeing these posts on here where people say they feel like they're failures, feel like they deserve death, feel all this hatred of themself and of their lives and other people around them and their situation. And it seems really dickish to say what I'm about to say, so I'm sorry, but I'm going to say it anyway. I wish I had any of those feelings. I wish I hated myself. I wish I felt like a failure. I wish I felt anything. It doesn't even feel like I exist. I have no feelings. I have no thoughts. I just am. And I'd like to stop. It's like I'm watching the world from a little box that I'm alone in, and everybody can see me, but the thing they think is me is just a hologram. Like I don't actually exist in this world.
