I will kill myself because Iâ€™m out of options.I said it, Iâ€™m out of options. I tried to heal. Iâ€™m 20000 kilometers away from home. I have 0 friends. The ones I have back home donâ€™t care. My bf donâ€™t care.

Canâ€™t afford therapy and my health insurance doesnâ€™t cover for it. 

Talked to my student counseling: they told me to get some help. This is what Iâ€™m trying to do everyday without success. 

Life lines and hotlines do not answer, even if you wait 25 minutes. Suicide chat does not answer too. 

Days are passing by and I can feel myself drowning. Days are tougher and tougher and Iâ€™m running out of options. 

And then, the day Iâ€™ll took the sleeping pills I take on my bedside, people will say Â«Â if only she got some helpÂ Â»

Massive screw you. The only persons who genuinely care are on Reddit. 

So screw you all, except reddit users, who are always there and supportive. Love you reddit.
