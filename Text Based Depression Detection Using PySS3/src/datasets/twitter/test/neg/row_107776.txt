Intrusive thoughtsWhy do I hate myself so much? I can think of a hundred reasons why I should and they're all valid. But why do I notice my faults and failures and others don't? What I mean is that there are people worse off than me and yet they still manage to be happy. I can't, I've tried to like myself but I can never think of any reasons why I should.

I just feel absolutely inferior to everybody I come into contact with, it's maddening! All I do is think about how pathetic I am and how much better everyone else is. 
If I'm not thinking about that I'm fantasising about my ideal self. But with that comes the realisation that my ideal self is a physical impossibility (just realised how that sounds... I'm not like a furry or otherkin freak no offence to those people, I mean in terms of height, weight, attractiveness etc.)

Why was I born? It just seems like a cruel joke. I am a joke.

I can't stand it any more, I don't want these thoughts to continue, I just want to be dead.
