How do I explain it?I don't fear death, I'm ok with it being my time.  But I can't seem to rap my head around the note I leave behind.  I have a 10 year old niece, how do I leave her with the thought that her aunt did it, so maybe it is ok for her too?

I know my means, and when I want to do it, but I care so damn much about the ones I'm going to leave behind.
