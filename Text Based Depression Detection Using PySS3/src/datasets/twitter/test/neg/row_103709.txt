Inpatient Hospitalization and RelapseBack in September, I was admitted to a behavioral health hospital for inpatient hospitalization because I was extremely close to hanging myself. After I was discharged, I felt better for a while and then I couldn't continue treatment because I didn't have the money to do so. Obviously, I relapsed, and now I want to hang myself again. I already had the logistics planned out, so all I need to do now is get the supplies. 

Recently, I overdosed on benadryl and I hit myself on the forehead repeatedly after I experienced some relationship issues. I knew that the benadryl was not going to kill me, but I did experience some abdominal pain a few days after ingesting it. When I begin to self-harm again, I know that I'm close to attempting or committing suicide. 

I have a therapy appointment scheduled on Monday, so I suppose that's a start. I've been taking my medication on a regular basis, and I've been trying to read a self-help book. I still want to kill myself. My friend told me that I was beginning to be a negative influence on her. She is right. All I talk about is my depression and now it's progressed to suicide. My mind is in such a dark place that I don't want to reach out to my friends because I will burden them.

I feel like I should go back to inpatient. I feel like I'm getting close to killing myself. I feel isolated, and I feel like the world would be better without me because all I do is hurt people. If I eliminate myself from the world, technically I am making the world a better place.
