I want to end it all after work tomorrow...I'm don't know, I was all good until yesterday when my boyfriend told me he got all giddy over a girl at work. I appreciated him telling me this, but it makes me feel bad and if I told him there would be no point; he's lost interest in me. It's the last straw really, since I've been feeling like we're not in love anymore...

It's been months since we've been happy really, there's no passion left and I don't have the energy to break up with him since I don't believe I could find anybody new. I went out on saturday night with my friend and all the men who did talk to me seemed unattractive to me personality-wise...

I've been working on an art project while working at a measly job I barley make enough money in, and all other jobs are way more than I can take (I tried retail, sales, food industry...).

I just do sometimes wish that life could have at least one little fairy-tale moment for me, but nothing seems to happen, even when I try so hard to make my boyfriend happy or work hard at my job...I just don't see any other way, and I feel like just ranting but having no energy anymore to get help...
