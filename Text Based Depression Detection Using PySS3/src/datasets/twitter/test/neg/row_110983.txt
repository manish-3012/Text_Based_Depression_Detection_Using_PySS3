what the hell is the pointI am 33 years old and have thoughts of not wanting to be here since I was 10 years old. My story.

&amp;#x200B;

growing up as a child I was molested by my brother from the time I was 5 till 11 at lease 3 times a week. I did not have anything friends growing up  so I always stayed to my self. I was put in to special ed classes as so at that point everything was more hard in my life.  Then in my 20s I lost the person that meant the world to me my girl friend at the time.  Then I got married a few lates and divorce. I am  now remarried no kids or anything. I lost my mom she meant the world to me a few years ago. She died one morn at home.  Now I am in my 30s and its getting worse.  I have life  of nothing but regrets. I dont even  know who I am just always been hiding. People make fun of me at work and say what a fuck up I am just like being in school again.  Once my mom left this earth has not been the same at all.
