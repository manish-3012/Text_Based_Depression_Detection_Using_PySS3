how do people deal with having thought about suicide?On April 25, I lost a good friend of mine to suicide. I had considered it twice before, in middle school and 9th grade. A month after my friend's suicide, I considered it myself - this is the most precipitously I have fallen to wanting to die. Of the three times I have considered it, this time was the one in which I most seriously considered it. I was so scared. I reached out to people and I know they will not look at me the same ever again. I am trying to feel better, but am still depressed and caught in this loop of whenever I recall my own past suicidal thoughts, I remember my friend, and whenever I remember my friend (who was like a brother to me), I think "shit, that could have been me."
I have no idea what to tell myself.
My friends have no idea what to tell me
can anyone offer any help?
