I just don't know what to thinkSo I'm a high schooler I occasionally use drugs and I'm seeing a therapist about anxiety that I have. I'm on medication for depression and honestly I am feeling better about my life and I feel better about my social anxiety. But suicide is always in the back of my head I'm always just wondering what would happen if I kill myself and how the world will be better without me and that I'm such a loser that I might as well jus fucking do it. I'm mostly just looking for an answer as to what I can do to suppress these thoughts.

Sorry for my bad grammar and punctuation.
