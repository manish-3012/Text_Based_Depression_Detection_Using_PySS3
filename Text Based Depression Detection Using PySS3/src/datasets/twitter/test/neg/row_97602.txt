Help, please...Hi ( be aware, my grammar suck,oh and....I also hate my life so much. 
I'm a 22 years old virgin with no confidence and no self esteem. 
My sick father is always criticizes me and make me feel like a loser, but I can't really do shit about it..
I'm currently going to the university and  working in a shitty job.
The only good thing my father do is offering me a place to stay ( and ..well its a lot  when I think about it...) But I can't stay in my parent basement for ever...
I..just dont know what to do to feel better. Every day , when I woke up, or when I go to bed, when I take my shower, When I drive to my job, every moment of my life I wonder why Im alive..
Please, I know ..I must be the 100000e person to post this  thread, but im serious, I need your help.. I really dont feel good. Suicidal  or even killing thoughts pass through my mind all the time. I dont have any intention to do those things but I still think a lot about it. Please help.
