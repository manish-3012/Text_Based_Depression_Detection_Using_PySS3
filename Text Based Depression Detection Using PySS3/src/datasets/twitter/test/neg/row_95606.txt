Getting paid tomorrow. Im scared of what I might do.Im 20, i live with my mom, I broke up with my boyfriend of a year and 2 months today, he told me i was ugly, stupid, and selfish. I work a job with only 9 hours a week. I dont see myself ever going anywhere, i have no money, dont really make enough to save up or live off of, can't find another better job. I've been depressed and suicidal for some time now. Mostly been living for my sister and bf, now i only have my sister and she lives states away. Im so lonely. Today ive been looking up suicide strategies and have picked my method. Im so scared because i dont really want to be dead but i dont want to be alive either, ya know? I would go to the hospital but then ill lose my job and be even more depressed.
