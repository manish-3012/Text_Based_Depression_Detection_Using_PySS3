Too scared to go to the hospitalI feel like I need to go to the hospital, but I'm scared. I've never been in inpatient before and I don't know what to expect, I'm scared I'll get fired from my job for just not showing up tomorrow, or that I won't be admitted and look like a complete idiot, I don't even know where to go or what to say when I get there and "Hi, I want to kill myself." Seems too forward.
