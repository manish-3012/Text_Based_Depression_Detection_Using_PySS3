I feel about ready to jump in front of a truckI'm a student at an Ivy league school and I'm just too stupid to be here. I worked my ass off to transfer here and I'm getting so much financial support. I did well at my old school but here the harder I try the worse I do. I just can't keep up with everyone else here and I'm so tired and sick and stressed out all the time. My teachers think I'm lazy. I know I'm not working and studying hard enough but there's just not enough hours in the day. I dont know how to fit in the clubs and events to meet people so I'm either in the library or my dorm alone when I'm not in class. I'm a huge waste of resources and I don't deserve to be here. I don't want to go home for thankgiving and have my friends and family see what a failure I'm becoming. I'm supposed to be the one who does well and gets a degree and takes us out of poverty. But just one semester has almost broken me. I don't know what to do, and if it wasn't going to further inconvenience other people I'd take a bunch of pills or jump off a bulding or in front of a truck. I'm so tired.
