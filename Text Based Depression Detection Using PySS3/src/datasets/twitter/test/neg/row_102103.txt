Broken.You often hear of old married couples dying together, often within weeks or days of each others deaths. They literally die of a 'broken heart.' Well. Can I tell you a story to make myself feel better.

I met my best friend ever back at uni about 12 years ago, we were on the same course. At first she was no different to any of the other friends I made at the start but we quickly bonded. You see, I was 'that guy' at high school, the average guy who was friends with everyone but not anyone's specific best friend, you know what I mean. Well, my new friend was the first time I had actually connected with anyone ever, the first time I could say that I had a 'best friend' without being a liar.

Sometime later my friend decided to tell me how she felt about me. Apparently she is autistic and had lots of trouble even talking to others at school without help. I was her first real friend. She was very anxious about telling me that she loved me, in case I found her weird. Of course I didn't and we kissed for the first time. But over time, I discovered that her parents died in a car crash while she was young and was forced to live a lonely life with her grandparents. No siblings, no friends and her cousins lived on the opposite of the world. I was a very special person to her and I greatly appreciated it. 

After uni we decided to travel the world together. However, we only had the money to travel around Europe for a month while staying at dodgy hostels and what not. We jokingly promised that we can go on a 'world adventure' for our honeymoon, although she wasn't bothered in marriage, or even children in fact. We both just wanted to live our lives to the fullest, while changing lives around us for the better. I could spend forever listing the stuff we did, but that's not the point of my story.

Over time however, we grew apart, at one point she moved to Australia, but came back 2 years later after her boyfriend started threatening her. Meanwhile, I had landed a nice job in the centre of London. We eventually reconnected and started taking marriage and our 'honeymoon' seriously. All seem to be going well...

And then, well to be honest this part of the story is hard to write about. One normal night about 18 months ago, I was woken up at 4am by her grandad urging me to come to the hospital immediately. Apparently, during one of her work night-outs, she was hit by a car running a red light, speeding away at about 60 or 70 miles per hour. If she had hesitated even a second the car would have simply passed in front of her. No, instead fate dictates she would have to die in her late 20s without saying goodbye. What happened after is a blur, but my boss was nice enough to let me have some time off. But no more time for any nice world adventure or anything like that.

Long story short, I had died as well, even if only on the inside. My best friend forever was snatched away from me, just like that. Now I just wanted to die. But I didn't know how to. I returned to work, but I keep treating each day as a day that I 'survived.' But I don't want to 'survive' I want to live with her, even though she was no longer with us. There is no hope. None. At one point I had to restrain myself from jumping in front of Tube trains and forbid myself from using them.

But recently, during one of my 'I wanna die now' periods one of her workmates recognised me from the funeral. After telling her how I felt and how I wanted to kill myself, she told me about how my friend would constantly talked about me. Apparently, years ago during uni she wanted to kill herself, but she didn't want to upset me. Oddly enough I managed regained some strength after hearing about that. Maybe if there really is an afterlife, she is still rooting for me to live a good life.

Nowadays, I am still trying to improve myself, by hitting the gym and rebuilding my social life, although I can never just 'get over it.' This has been really really hard to write about, but I just needed to tell someone, if anyone is still reading. I still miss her really really much, and one day I hope to travel the world just to fulfil our promise. Sometimes, I still think that I just want to disappear forever, but what would be the point of that? I'm here to change lives for the better. And she would be proud of that.
