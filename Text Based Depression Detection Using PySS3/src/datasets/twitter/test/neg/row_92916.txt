i seriously just want to die right nowi've had a really hard year. i switched schools, i did a lot of things i regret, i had a suicide attempt, i started cutting myself again, me and my parents don't get along, my family hates me and everyone thinks im wierd. but now my meds were starting to kick in and everything was becoming ok but then a bunch of my mom's friends saw a post online that i wrote about her that was really violent and made me look like a psycho. it was imagining different ways i could kill her. i wasn't serious but now everyone's seen it and everyone thinks that i'm crazy and my dad told me to go find somewhere else to live and that everyone is scared for their safety around me. my therapist dumped me and im being ostracized by everyone i knew. i really really just want to die. i'm so humiliated. i had no idea anyone could exist with this much humiliation. i just can't face the world anymore. does anyone PLEASE have anything comforting to say? i really feel like dying.
just this morning i finished a play i was writing and i was so happy. now i came down so hard i feel like i'll never come up. can someone put this in perspective for me please? i just really want to get out of my small town
