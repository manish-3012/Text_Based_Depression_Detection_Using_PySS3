Ideation... what's next?English is not good, excuse me please (-:

If you see my post history, you'll see I am at a low point. I've tried improving. Have applied to a good university scholarship, and have a good chance of being accepted. Found a new hobby (cook) and do it as often as I can - it gives me peace for the short while.

But even though all this - I still feel bad inside. I'm thinking more and more of suicide... "Life will get better" - yes, but it's not bad now either. It is like my bad feelings are unexplained, so it doesn't matter how good (or bad) life will get - and I feel like I cannot live with them.

Don't think I will attempt suicide because it would break my friends and family but it is always in my mind. I played the game Portal 2, spent 10 minutes jumping from high platform to the ground (maybe like training? I don't know).

Not sure if I can seek help either, because it would greatly reduce the chances of my getting the scholarship (mental illness = weakness / defect, only best are accepted; lot of deep background checks).

Maybe unrelated, but I never dated.. never felt any attraction until maybe a few months ago. I'm thinking, maybe a girlfriend would make me feel better - but I'm so lost, I have no idea how to "enter the game" at such a late stage (when all the other "players" have much higher "levels" and "XP" than me haha).

Thank you very much for taking your time and read this post,, means a lot. Would be nice to converse, I'll be online here for the next few hours.
