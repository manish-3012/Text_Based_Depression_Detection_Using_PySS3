I really want to dieIt's too stressful to continue living. It feels like the whole world is against me, nothing is going well, arguments with people who are close to me increased drastically, almost everyday I'm fighting with them. I want it to stop ,everything is falling apart and I can't stand being alive, it hurts too much for me to handle. I really can't anymore. So can I die now, am I allowed to? I feel guilty for feeling this way, but if I die, there's one less burden for my family. I want to stop this pain, it's been almost 7 years, it is a miracle I'm still here.
