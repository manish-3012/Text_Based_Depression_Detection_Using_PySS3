I wanna die so badly rn, I donâ€™t want my life taken away from me and I donâ€™t want to disappoint my parents. I rather die and never see their reaction.I skipped the entire quarter of school.  THE ENTIRE QUARTER!  I went the first day, and never went back.  I was so stupid and lazy and Iâ€™m just such an idiot.  I got an F in art and a V (vanish) in English.  Pretty sure my math will be bad too.  I literally canâ€™t believe I did this.  Thought I was gonna get away with it and move on and eventually deal with it later.  But now Iâ€™m having my school loan taken away, and I canâ€™t pay for it myself.  Iâ€™d have to tell my parents that Iâ€™ve been lying to them this whole time.  Itâ€™s high school all over again and Iâ€™m scared this will fuck everything up.  Things were going so well and I fucked it up.  Iâ€™m not ready to give everything up.  I donâ€™t wanna have to tell my parents.  I can get an appeal but I donâ€™t have my SS number and it would be weird to ask.  Iâ€™m fucking done.  Maybe the appeal might work and Iâ€™ll get my loan back but my parents would still be disappointed in me and never trust me again.  I just want to die.
