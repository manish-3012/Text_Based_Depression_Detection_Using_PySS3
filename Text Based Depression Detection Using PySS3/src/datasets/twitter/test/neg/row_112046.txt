Feeling incredibly/depressed/alone/miserableMy fiance and I moved across country just for him. A week later I got cancer, being fighting that. I have terrible genetic disease that caused it (its called NF1 I have tumors all over my body.) Anyways I am 3k miles away from home, I have no friends (except for a few, but that doesnt even matter), I am destryoing my fiance with my neediness and lonliness. i cant work, i lost all my clothes and shoes in the move.

And So for that and many other reasons, i am ready to die. I just want to die. i am going to die at some point anyways, i am serve pain. TERRIBLE PAIN. its just the worst i want to die. i am trying so hard to live but my brain just keeps telling me to die. I want to wake my fiance, and ask him to help me but ive asked enough. 

whats the point in even writing here
my problems are too much to explain
also i see a therpaist *(via phone)
and she cant see me anymore due to insurence reasons

i am just falling apart
i cant hold myself together anymore
i am physically sick, emotional sick
and I HATE HOW I LOOK i am hideous and ugly, fat. i just want to not exist.
