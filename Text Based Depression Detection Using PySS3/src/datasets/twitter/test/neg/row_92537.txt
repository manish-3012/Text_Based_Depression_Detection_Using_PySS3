Back after a period of blissI've had suicide dreams the whole of December and most of January and I was really to fulfilling but then I met a girl with whom I could forget all of that.
Long story short she had a boyfriend, they broke up, we did a lot together, I confessed my feelings, she told she wasn't ready yet but I would deserve her loving me, she falls a longtime friend of hers and they get together.

This wouldn't put me back into not knowing what to do with my live anymore, even though it was a hard hit on me.
I reacted poorly and she once told me that wanted to distance herself from me during her last relationship because she thought I was disrupting her relationship (thinking of me while cuddling with her bf etc.), but i was to important to her. Now she told I should keep myself away from and she doesn't answer my texts anymore.

This put me over the edge and I just don't know what to do and am thinking about suicide all the time again and can't sleep anymore.

I know this isn't something special and probably sounds too ordinary and angsty but I don't know where to go with it.
