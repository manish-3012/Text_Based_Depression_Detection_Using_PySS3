Life is pointlessI just fucking hate all of it and I wish I was never born because this is nothing but hurt and shit and Iâ€™m so tired of it


I canâ€™t see myself ever being happy so why should I stick around, just to struggle longer?


The only reason Iâ€™m still around is because I have pets to look after and I donâ€™t want to fail them. 


I donâ€™t have a single friend. I am totally alone. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible to make close friendships now, and Iâ€™m too anxious to talk to anyone new anyway. Iâ€™m going to spend the rest of my life just as lonely as I am now and I donâ€™t want that I canâ€™t stand that it hurts too much

Iâ€™m not cut out for this Iâ€™m a failure at fucking existing and I canâ€™t fix it and itâ€™s too late for me and I just want out


Iâ€™m not actively suicidal but Iâ€™m really upset right now and itâ€™s more of a â€œas soon as my pets die Iâ€™m fucking o u tâ€ kinda thing. Unfortunately/fortunately my pets are all pretty young so Iâ€™ve got like 10 years minimum unless things go terribly wrong with their health. I kinda resent that at this moment in time because I just really donâ€™t want this anymore

I hate the monotony of life and I hate the expectations and I hate society and I hate that we all have to fucking get a job we probably hate and work until weâ€™re old then fucking die without ever really living itâ€™s so pointless and I hate that I fucked up by letting my anxiety win as a teen so now Iâ€™m stuck struggling to be remotely functional or independent because fucking agoraphobia and I hate that thereâ€™s no fucking options for me to seek good help for it because mental health care in regional Australia is fucking pathetic and I hate that I have nobody who cares about me enough to ask how I am and I hate that Iâ€™ll never be able to be close to anyone because Iâ€™ll always keep them at arms length and I hate that Iâ€™m an emotionally stunted piece of shit who has no idea how to handle strong emotions without THIS 

I just hate it all so much
