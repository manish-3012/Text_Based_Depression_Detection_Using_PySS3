I woke up yesterday with the feeling of having nothing leftIve struggled with the thought of suicide in the past but yesterday it really hit me that it is my only choice. I don't want to do it but it looks like it's my only point of relief. I am a 30 year old male who lives with his mother and step father because I don't make enough money to live on my own due to the $910 a month in child support I pay for one 5 year old little girl. I won't even be able to get her Christmas gifts this year because all of my money goes to buying food and gas to get to work. After bills I have only $200 left over which goes to food and gas. I was told by my step father just a month ago that I have 6 months to move out or he will leave, so my mother supports his decision. She knows how bad my financial situation is but she doesn't want him to leave because she will be screwed financially so in less than 5 months I will be on the streets and will have no relationship with my daughter as I will have no home for her to stay at and no way to take care of her. I can try to go for a modification of childsupport but my daughter's mother lied on her financial affidavit before, which is why I am in this mess with child support and she will do it again... And no I cannot get a lawyer because I cannot afford it. I already owe 6k to the previous lawyer who did almost nothing for me before. The last time I tried to get a second job nobody would hire me because of my scheduling with my daughter. They want someone who can work whenever they want you to and parenting schedules are something that nobody wants to deal with. I applied to over 20 jobs before and received one offer but when I told them that I had to adhere to a parenting schedule they turned me down. If I don't adhere to this schedule my daughter's mother will do everything she can to take her from me. I suffer from mental illness that is still undiagnosed because I cannot afford the doctor appointments and weekly tharapy to get it to a manageable state. I feel like I have no choice but to end all of this as it's only getting worse and I'll either end up on the streets, dead or in jail anyway. I honestly don't know what else I can do but this. I need help because I'm afraid I will actually do this. I don't want to but I see no way out of this. Please someone help me.
