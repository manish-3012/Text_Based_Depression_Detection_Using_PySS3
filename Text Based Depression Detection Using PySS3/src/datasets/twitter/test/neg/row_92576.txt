I don't want to be aloneI'll have absolutely no one once my mother dies and that scares me. If it wasn't for her I'd be dead already. I'm just so unhappy with my life and have been since forever. Nothing ever goes right,even when I try really hard. It always ends in failure and disappointment.

 I have no friends,I hate my job,and the only person I loved I couldn't keep. I couldn't make him happy. He deserved better, so I'm letting him go. I don't want to say goodbye to him though,but I'm not good enough. I see the difference between us,I'd just make him unhappy.

I hate my mother but I stay because I'm afraid of being alone. I lie to everyone saying I stay because she needs me. That's only half true though(she's disabled). My mom can be so nice and, then turn around and be mentally abusive. I wish she'd just hit me instead,I know some of it she can't control(she's on meds). I thought about just ending it before,but I've realized I'm a coward. I don't know what to do,she's sick and could just not wake up one day. Instead of feeling relief,I'll resent her even more for dying and leaving me alone.
