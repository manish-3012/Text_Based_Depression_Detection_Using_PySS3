I can't live anymore. My low self-esteem isn't helping. I'm always filled with depression and anxiety every day. Please help me.hi my name is joe, im 15 and im a guy, I just cant really explain my feelings here. I just dont want to live anymore and i dont want to feel anymore. Im so filled with jealously and i feel worthless and everyday i have depression and anxiety and it NEVER goes away.

I had depression and anxiety when i was 13. 2 years ago, my social anxiety and depression was so bad that i was near being anorexic. I always worried about my weight, i would eat less and i was soo self conscious back then that every chance we got to go to my grandmas house, i would go on a scale immediately to check my weight everytime (we didnt have a scale at home) and i would get depressed because i thought my weight was fat. also, when getting ready for school, i would have a panic attack because i thought people would judge me so much for what i wore. I cant even go to the mall because i think everyone gives me bad looks and that everyone is starring at me like im a freakshow. And plus, i have a hard time buying clothes because i think everything looks bad on me. And guess what? I kept this all inside. My parents started to question why i was being like this, they even asked me if i had depression and i said no....i should of said yes. 

Im 15 now and I still have depression and anxiety but not has bad as before, but its still bad. I cant believe ive been worrying for 2 years about everything. being self-conscious about what others thought of me, starving myself thinking i needed to lose weight, not meeting new people because of my social anxiety, having a hard time at school, being isolated from the world, everything. 

I just really want help. can someone talk to me please? I wish i was drunk so i could feel nothing. its 2am and im so sad right now, i wish i could tell my parents i need help. well, bye guys. :(
