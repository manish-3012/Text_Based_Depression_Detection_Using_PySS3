I go to bed and hope to never wake upFor more than 10 years, every night I think about it. It is in the back of my head. I think about multiple ways to end it quickly, painlessly, multiple scenarios and then I go to bed and hope to never wake up. And the next morning I wake up and I'm still there. One day I will do it, not because I want it, but because it will be too painful to live with myself to keep going and no amount of med or drug or distraction will put a stop on my pain. Now I'm going to bed and maybe tonight something special will happen. Maybe I will die in my sleep or maybe god or something will help me in a dream or guide me? I just feel like life doesn't give a single crap about me and leave me here to rot like a pathetic loser. I can die or live, life won't care at all. It makes no difference.
