I thought that I would be dead by nowLet me start of by saying Iâ€™m embarrassed to be posting here. I donâ€™t have any friends left because of my ex isolating me from all my family and friends. Iâ€™ve been homeless for a few weeks because of him. Tonight we got into a fight and I reconnected with my mother that took me back in. The problem is that Iâ€™ve thought about blowing my brains out ever since I got home. Heâ€™s all I had for weeks, but he made me feel bad about everything he did for me. He hit me in my jaw tonight and itâ€™s swollen and bruised. Itâ€™s so bad I just want to end my life to finally get away from him, and so people wonâ€™t notice how swollen and bruised my jaw is. It embarrasses me. He knows these fights make me suicidal. I gave up everything for him, and I think he would really like it if I ended my life tonight. I have nobody else to vent to. Itâ€™s sad being so lonely I have to post on reddit about what Iâ€™m thinking. Iâ€™ve always been lonely and itâ€™s killed me for a long time. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts since I was young about killing myself. I think tonight finally is the night for me. I thought I would be dead by now. Iâ€™ve attempted 3 times before, but I hope Iâ€™m successful this time. Sorry for the long vent, and thanks to anyone who is reading.
