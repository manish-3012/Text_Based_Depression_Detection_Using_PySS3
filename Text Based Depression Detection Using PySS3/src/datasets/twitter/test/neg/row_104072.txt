I am exhaustedI am mentally drained. I feel like I am trapped inside my own mind everyday with these negative thoughts and theyâ€™re so hard to get rid of. I talked to my counselor about my problems and he only wanted to bring up medications which I am trying to avoid. I canâ€™t stop thinking about the past and the shit Iâ€™ve seen and been through. I am a Marine and my EAS (End of Active Service) is coming up and honestly I am terrified of going back to my life back home. I keep telling myself I am a failure because that is how I feel. Idk just sometimes I  thought of just putting a bullet in my head to end all the thoughts and negativity going through my head.
