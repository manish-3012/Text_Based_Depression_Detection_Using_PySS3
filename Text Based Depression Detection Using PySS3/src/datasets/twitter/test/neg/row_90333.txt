Why do I bother?I try so fucking hard to get out of this fucking rut but something always comes along and knocks me back down. I was making so much progress, but the harder I try the harder it gets. It's like I wasnt meant to be happy. I'd settle for just being less miserable. I'm seeing a new therapist and it's not working out. They know it and I know it. This is somebody that has known about my situation for years and never really gave a fuck. It never really got past the "take these magic happy pills and fuck off" stage. I'm slipping back into old habits and ruining all the work I've done. I'd kill for a drink right now. Why the fuck do I even bother? It's getting harder and harder. I don't know why I'm even posting this
