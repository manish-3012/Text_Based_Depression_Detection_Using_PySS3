I canâ€™t do this anymore.Iâ€™m just a teenager, but Iâ€™ve been clinically depressed for almost 4 years now and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™ve seen doctors and tried medicines, but nothing helps. I really just canâ€™t stand living anymore and have been thinking of in-depth ways I could kill myself often. I really, really want to, but I donâ€™t have access to any of the methods Iâ€™d prefer to use. I just need to disappear from my responsibilities and life and everything, but I feel like thereâ€™s no way I really can.
I get that Iâ€™m selfish, but I really donâ€™t care about what would happen after my death and how my family and friends would react. I donâ€™t care what anyone would think, I just want everything to stop. Thereâ€™s no way I can keep going, and as soon as I find access to a preferred method of suicide, then Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t want people to try to stop me because it wonâ€™t work. My only reason for posting this is because I just needed to vent a little.
