Been suffering depression my whole life. Feel like giving up. No one to talk to.Been having problems with my girlfriend the last few months. Fighting ugly then making up. Today was finally it. She packed her shit and left. I tried so hard in this thing. Not only am I left heartbroken my kids are too. 

On top of all of that I have no money, no job, tons of bills and debt and I'm pretty much unemployable at this point in my life. Do the best I can as a dad but it's hard doing it by myself. Lonely too. Finally found someone to share all that with and it self destructed. Now I'm alone again. 

I feel like giving up. Having my kids go with their mom and just leave or something. They'd have a way better life without me. Everyone seems to be better off without me. My mom kicked my out when I was 11. Dad wasn't around until I was forced to go there. He was never around always at work. Basically grew up by myself. Been divorced and broken hearted over and over. Always being left behind. He'll even my kids would leave to their moms if they could. But supposedly I'm the better parent. 

Had depression my whole life. Taken pills but they seemed to make it worse. Tried some therapy. Went okay but can't afford it. Just wish I could be cured of this shit. 

Just need someone to talk to. Feel heartbroken and hopeless.
