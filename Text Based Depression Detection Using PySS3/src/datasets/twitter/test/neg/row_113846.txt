If I objectively look at it, I have a good life, yet I just want to die.I'm going to be straight up here, I will delete this post later.

I'm 15. 16 in March, depending on if I make it that far. I'm a guy and I live in Belgium.

I guess in general, my problem is processing things. Usually people will be hurt, but then heal. I don't seem to do that. I get hurt as little as possible, always leaving behind a wound as small as possible (mentally.) I try to talk to people. If I can help someone, I will. I don't accept any help and try as much as I can to avoid it. Right now people are looking to get me a psychologist. I guess my main problem is that I've been growing up with people who went through absolute hell all around me. I'm not exaggerating there, from friends and family, I'm used to hearing the worst shit. I've seen the effect it has on people, I've seen it and heard all their stories. I guess it just left a mark each time. I feel like over time I just can't stand this world anymore. At some point it didn't even matter wether I was just being pessimistic or if what I would tell myself even made sense. Not to brag, at all, but I'm an incredibly smart guy, not some Einstein shit, but yeah, I am. I have enough insight to realize what will happen if I die and I have enough insight to see how stupid any of this is, the fact that I'm doing so awful and am refusing all help and hiding it so much, knowing so many go through way worse and are way happier than me. I have enough insight to often even realize that I'm just being pessimistic, I guess I just can't reason with myself. I don't have one true reason for which I wanna die, I guess I just don't value life as much as most people. I guess I always was colder than most people. And yeah, I realize a 15 year old saying "I always was" sounds incredibly stupid. I know. I've got apartment buildings nearby, about 16 stories tall. Feel like I might jump by sunday. Gonna have to check out if I can get on the roof one of these days. I guess the worst thing is gonna be the guilt I have because I have people I don't want to hurt, but I don't want to live either. I hate this. I wish I could be better for them.
