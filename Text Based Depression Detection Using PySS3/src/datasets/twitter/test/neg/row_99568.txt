Genuinely curious what the point of life is when you are lonely all the timeAnyone here have any reasons to keep going? Don't get me wrong there are alot of little things that can keep you busy every now and then (games, TV shows, sports..on tv ofcourse, etc..) but after a while those small things are no longer enough to keep you going. I've reached that point.
