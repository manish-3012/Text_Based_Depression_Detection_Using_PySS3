I'm really tiredI haven't given up on life enough to die yet, but I've given up in being happy. Everything I know that would make me happiest is impossible to do when I lay there for weeks depressed and dysfunctional. I can't afford therapy. I can't meet new people. Everyone I know is happier without me. I wish I could use my creativity to its potential but I can't focus enough to finish anything. I have just given up on trying at this point and am waiting for something to happen that won't.
