Found my trigger for suicidal thoughtsI have been off and on depressed for a while now.

I have been a social recluse for the last few years now too.

I am getting better these last few weeks though.

I am trying to be happy because i know im going to die someday and life is very short.
 
One thing that im going to start doing is to start chatting up people and getting invovled in social activities

I feel good when i talk to people but i found the one thing that makes me feel like death.

Whenever I see celebrities or young sexy models, or super sexy women i feel horrible about myself.
I feel like since i dont have a women like this that i am worthless as a man.

I see other people not really caring about this too much but it makes me feel so sad. I feel like im a loser guy because i cant have a super sexy model.

I dont want to compare myself to others and i want to be happy for other people and focus on myself

I know this is obviously a self esteem issue but i really do try and love myself.

I know that i have to overcome this feeling because these women wont go away.

I just needed to vent.
