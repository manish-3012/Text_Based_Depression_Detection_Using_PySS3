Feel ugly &amp; thereâ€™s no real solution.I always get told not to get plastic surgery &amp; that I donâ€™t â€œneedâ€ it and would probably ruin my face (worse than it naturally is). I researched prolly any surgery I thought might help, mainly rhinoplasty. I photoshop my nose smaller and it looks off/weird (Iâ€™m black). I tried makeup. Contour. Make changes to my eyes and lips to see if itâ€™d help. None of it does. 

Itâ€™s like my face is unfixable. I feel so uncomfortable in public to the point I struggle at uni. I just want to be a normal person &amp; be pretty/effortless. I donâ€™t even have to be a supermodel, just decent enough. I sometimes get confident but best believe I always get knocked down again. Iâ€™m not going to delude myself with â€œpositivityâ€ again.
