Do I really want to?I'm fucking frustrated. I want to die but then I'm looking for someone to help me. So do I really?I've been looking for suicide hotlines for the past 30 mins and no one's answering. I found this group then. BUT WHY. Why the fuck am I looking for someone to "save" me. Isn't that just fucking ridiculous? If I wanted to kms, why don't I just do it? Fuck this cycle is frustrating.
