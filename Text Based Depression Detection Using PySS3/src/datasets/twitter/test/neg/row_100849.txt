I want to dieEver since Covid I have been stuck in the house due to my mothers rules. I am extremely depressed and I havenâ€™t ate in weeks. My Mom thinks Iâ€™m a failure who has nothing going for myself and sheâ€™s right. All my Dad does is agree with her... I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt loved. I had a boyfriend who I absolutely adored. He left me for his ex. He was the only friend I had and now I have no one. I stopped being friends with my best friend because my grandma died and she didnâ€™t care. My other grandma who is alive only makes fun of me for being fat and even my Dad and siblings too... itâ€™s as if no one wants to see me happy so why should I be here? I hate myself and I hate everything about this thing we call life. No one checks up on me, no one says they care or that they even love me... Itâ€™s not worth living anymore. I have reached my breaking point.
