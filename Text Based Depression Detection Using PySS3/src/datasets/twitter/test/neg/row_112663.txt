Suicide ThingThis suicide thing is complete BS.  I have a disability so government pays me this tiny amount that I can live at home where I'd be anyways because i'm done jobs.  Why would you rent on 1100 dollars a month? I'm not going to rent thats just stupid.  So its not that i was like i'm going to kill myself. Fuck life.  I just can't afford rent and food.  I'll stay at home as long as possible.  Pay rent here which is almost nothing and eat.  But my mom dies I have to pretend she doesn't cause any other place I can live i'm going to die pretty fast.  Thats because of others not me.
