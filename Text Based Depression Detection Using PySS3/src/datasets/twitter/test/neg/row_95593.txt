Holding onHey, I don't really know why I'm posting here, maybe it's the only place I feel like I can post this. 
I've been feeling very suicidal recently, in November I was raped. I am a lesbian with a girlfriend of 4 years, I had never had sex with a man before and yeah I can't get over it. 
I've had suicidal feelings in the past but reached out but I feel like this time I can't. I have a date, an idea of how I want to spend my day. The only thing I don't have is how. I know suicide isn't pretty, I don't expect it to be. 
The only thing that is keeping me holding on at the moment is my mum. She's gone through so much in life and I know how much this would hurt her. She's like my best friend. But, I'm in so much pain. 
I can't sleep anymore, I'm so tired, I just want to go to sleep. I just want these feelings to stop, I don't want flashbacks anymore. I want to wake up happy but i can't and when I'm with my family and girlfriend and friends and I have to try and be happy it drains so much energy from me. 
Im also at uni, my mum isn't just downstairs she's a whole train ride away and all I want is a hug from her but I'm alone. I feel so alone. 
I so want there to be a light at the end of the tunnel but I feel like I'm stuck in darkness.
