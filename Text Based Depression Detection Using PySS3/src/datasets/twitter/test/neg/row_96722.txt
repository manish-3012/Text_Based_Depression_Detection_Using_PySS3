Failed AttemptsI was eight when I first tried to kill myself. Thought it would be funny if i made everyone sad. So I began to drown myself. After my first breath of water, I remembered I needed to feed one of the foster cats. Stupid priorities.
 It went on like this, almost drowning myself, then remembering I have to take care of some animal. My young mind didn't quite grasp suicide. In sixth grade, I was extremely happy, even though I had a very abusive friend. I had a strange habit though. I would cut myself when I was super happy, to make sure it wasn't a dream. I stopped after a couple months though, because I found other ways, like pinching myself.
 Seventh grade is a good time, people were strangely nice to me.
 In January this year, it changed. I have always been different. My family all says I love you to me a lot, but I haven't said those words since I was eight. I have lots of different friends, the populers and the freaky outcasts. Good grades. I can find nothing in my life that would make it bad, really. 
But for some reason, I began to try to kill myself again. I am suprised that taking a whole bottle of ibeprofun and migraine meds barely affected me. After I didn't die, I did good things, helped old people, talked to other kids my age and helped them out with their problems.
  But now it is back again. Deep depression, with no reason. I don't want to tell anyone. Tons of people trust me, and I won't let most of those people even touch me. I never have liked contact. I just graduated from eight grade, and now I think about growing older. I fear all the disappointment and loss I will go through once I get older. I fear guys breaking my heart. I have braved through so much, only to fear living past twenty. I fear aging. Which is why I have another bottle of meds, ready to try to end it again.
