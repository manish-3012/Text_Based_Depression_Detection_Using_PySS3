My mental state keeps going up and down like a rollercoaster and I'm so done with myself...Long post. I need to empty my bag where it won't hurt those I love and it might be triggering. I just don't know where to turn to anymore.

I'm a fucking mess and I don't know what to do with myself. I've been swinging from one depressive bout to the next for over three years now and I had a short period of mania/wellness that just evaporated on Christmas day. I've been in the hospital twice for out-of-control panic attacks, I've tried cutting myself, biting myself, strangling myself until my vision got spotty... I pinch myself and rip skin off my fingers compulsively, I bite the inside of my mouth bloody, and I'm so perma-stressed that I have constant back pain since I was sixteen.

I've been diagnosed with non-specific anxiety by one psychologist, and with performance anxiety fueled by OCD by another. I've been in the Canadian healthcare system for three years, because, yes, fuck, I called for help when I needed it. They prescribed me anti-depressants and anti-anxiety pills and told me I was on the wait list to see a psychotherapist.

*And nothing fucking happened since.*

I've changed anti-depressants five times, always towards stronger medication. The latest one helps, but this is my third depressive bout since the start of September. And the sudden resurgence of self-hatred, constant guilt, and suicidal thoughts is making me useless. I can't get the energy to shower most days. I still have morphine from when I broke my leg and I can't convince myself to get rid of it. The only reason I haven't swallowed the bottle is because I still don't know if killing myself would help or not.

Context: I spent Christmas day with my family. At some point, I had to step outside to smoke to get my nerves to settle down and my brother came outside with me to talk. He doesn't approve of me smoking (no one around me does), but he said "If it helps your head, I can tolerate it."

And then my 14-year old brother burst into tears because he's scared I'm going to do something stupid. And I want to, so fucking bad, because I feel like it's the only way I'm gonna catch a break from the fucking trash the inside of my head is. I'm 22, I'm the oldest sibling, and I made my little brother cry because I'm a fucking helpless *mess.*

I hate myself. I feel guilty I exist, because I feel like I'm making the people who love me miserable. I have no reason to be in this state in the first place! I have a loving family, cats, an amazing boyfriend!

And yet I feel like they deserve better. That it would be easier on them if I were to just go away. Remove the hurt. 

My thoughts are swirling constantly, going back and forth between just gritting my teeth and holding on, or just taking the pills and... well, die, I guess.

I have a crisis hotline on speed dial, but I don't want to do yet another in-and-out of the hospital without seeing any fucking light at the end of the tunnel. I'm tired. So tired. I just want a break from being me. I just want a magic solution and I know I'm not going to get any.

I just... needed to write this down somewhere. I'm tired of hurting, but I'm more tired of hurting the people I love.
