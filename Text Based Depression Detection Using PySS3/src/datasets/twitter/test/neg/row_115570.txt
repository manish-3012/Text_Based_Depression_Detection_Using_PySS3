Well alcohol doesn't help anymore, I don't have access to weed at the moment, so I am just going to drink some NyQuil to deal with this nightmare.Losing my mind. Need something to calm down before I do something stupid like drink or think about jumping off my balcony until 5 am. NyQuil is one of my few buddies and I haven't seen him in awhile
