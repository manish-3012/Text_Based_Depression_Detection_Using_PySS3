Suicide is my way outThis is a throwaway but I feel like talking about this and I feel like I can't trust anyone, this is most likely going to be a very long post so if that isn't your thing, feel free to leave now. Just as some background information I'm 17 and male.. if that matters. 

All my life I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and self harm. My oldest memory of this was when I was 4 years old and I jumped out of this tree in my back yard hoping I'd hurt myself, ever since I feel like I've gotten progressively worse. These past 2 years have been very difficult for me and my mental health, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia last year as well as depression which I have been suffering with for many years now (I also have ADD but that's not really relevant). I struggle with school a lot, especially these past couple years but it hasn't become unmanageable until pretty recently, honestly I just feel completely useless. I  can't concentrate or motivate myself, I haven't been to school for more than 3 days at a time this year at all, which has led to me being behind in my classes and losing friendships, relationships with my family etc. Recently my psychosis has been fucking intolerable, I guess because I'm stuck inside all the time now so there's no where for my head to go but it's not just the fact that we're quarantined that's making my brain feel like it's rotting. I fear that I'll never be happy. I think that's one of the main reasons I want to die. Even if I disregard everything going on in my mind there will always be fear. Even if I am happy for 50% of my life I don't feel like the other 50% is worth it. Going in and out of feeling horrible to great and then back to terrible every other month is tiresome and draining. Why deal with that if I can just make it all stop?

I'm going to talk about my schizophrenia a bit here but to be completely honest it isn't really relevant or important so feel free to skip this section, I just want to get everything out. Everyone knows about it, my family, friends, teachers but I don't feel like people understand and I've tried to explain to friends of mine or people that I know but they just don't get it. Everyone I've talked to think it's some sort of joke, people have told me they're jealous of it. I've had one of my old friends tell me they wish they had psychosis, that it's cool. It terrifies me, sure some of the time the voices are neutral, supportive even, they look after me when they want to but in a second they can switch. It's complicated and I feel stupid trying to explain so I'll move on. Recently I was talking with my girlfriend in the midst of an episode of sorts and I was telling her about what was going on in my brain and she immediately just said we should break up which as much as it hurt because I've always been afraid my mental health would ruin my romantic relationships I think it was the right decision. I am a lot to deal with, especially since she has her own problems so there's no reason to put more pressure on her than necessary. However, as much as I'm happy for her it kind or broke me a bit. 

I've recently started self harming again, I was 3 months clean. I used to cut a lot but I got admitted to hospital and went clean but recently I started burning myself and banging my head into bricks, punching myself and contemplating suicide a lot more recently. I have attempted suicide 8 times but 2 of which I don't remember at all and another 2 times with honestly no real attempt to actually die. I'm scared because I've been thinking about it a lot more recently, it's sort of the only way I see my future going.

I guess I just know life is so sporadic and I know my whole life I'm going to deal with mental instability that it doesn't feel worth living. Even if I have a good life I can't control my brain, I feel like my brain has a parasite in it but without it I'll die. We need each other to  survive but if that's the case, why should I survive. Everyone argues that I'm young and that I'll miss out on everything. That's true but at the same time, what will I really miss out on? I'll be dead. I won't know what's going on in the living world, I won't exist. "Things are going to get better" Yeah, they will, until it gets ripped from me again and I'm forced to be in a depression for 3 months at a time. I don't know. I just don't feel like for me personally there's any reason to continue living for much longer, it isn't worth it.
