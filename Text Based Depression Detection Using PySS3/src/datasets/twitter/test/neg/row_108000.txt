Logically, I should do it.I really think it makes sense to die soon. 

I hate my life. I'm in pain every day and want to die every day. I'm lonely and worthless and have no purpose. 

I'm so done with life. I hate it. It's painful. I don't want to live. My entire day I walk around in pain at school. It's so fucking lonely. And then I go back home to be treated like fucking worthless crap by my mom. I can't handle this. I can't do homework 24/7. I need at least a little time to talk to my friends. Home is scary because I don't know what I'll do when I get too lonely. 

I can't even put a considerable effort into my homework. It's not like I'll amount to anything. I'll just take myself out of the fucking pain of being insulted by my mom EVERY FUCKING SECOND OF MY LIFE.
