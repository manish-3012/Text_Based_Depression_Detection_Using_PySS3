Friend wants to kill himself, but he's pretty much my only friend left. How to help him?Sits at home (still lives with his mom) and plays video games all day. He's lost job after job and doesn't want to be a part of society. I've tried nudging him towards occupations that are easy to get into, but he only ever asks "why?" "Why should I join society?" "I'm an idiot." "What's the point of making money to keep saving and saving while we kill the planet?" "I'm just going to keep bumming off my mom until she kicks me out and then I'm going to kill myself."

How the fuck do I help him? I've tried being blunt, I've tried prodding him to be productive, but to no avail. He's not going to call the suicide helpline. He's not going to go to therapy. Hell, he's probably not even going to get another job and sink himself further into debt with his student loans.
