I feel like itâ€™s not worth it anymoreI am 16 years old and I live in India. My parents come from a middle income family and they understand the importance of education. I have tried my hardest but in their eyes I am always second to everyone else. They always say I donâ€™t do enough but I passed at the top of my class. After a day or two it was as if everyone forgot about it. They said that I didnâ€™t need any friends so I had fake friends so I didnâ€™t get bullied by the other kids. But as a kid I didnâ€™t think they were fake. I thought we knew each other very well and we shared interests. After passing from 10th grade they never contacted me. Then I thought about it and realized I was never invited to play with them after school(even if they did my parents wouldnâ€™t let me) and when I shared my thoughts and it was always used against me.
After school I had to pick a subject to study for my 11th and 12th classes( out of engineering, medical, commerce etc). Indian parents have a wanting of their children to be engineers or doctors(Also my brother is also an engineer). They said â€œYou donâ€™t have to be an engineerâ€ instead of saying â€œYou can pick what you wantâ€ which itself implies that they want me to be an engineer. So I picked engineering as they wanted me to. I got at average 75% in my tests at the beginning but it wasnâ€™t enough for her and she would always say â€œYou should pick commerce instead; itâ€™s much easier â€œ. After hearing the same shit for months I told her to stop saying it because it was making me feel the way she did when I was in school: as if nothing I did was enough and that I would never be a child she loved. She never stopped saying it though, she said I was taking things too seriously and that she was doing it for my good. It has been months and every time she says it I ask her to stop but she doesnâ€™t listen. She doesnâ€™t understand how demotivating it is when a person so close to you makes you feel weak and frail. My marks dropped to negative percent because of negative points for wrong answers. Recently I told my parents from the bottom of my heart that I was doing things just for them and that I was feeling suicidal because of her and that I wanted time to think about what I wanted to do with my life. She again said I was taking things out of proportion and that taking a year off would be a waste instead. I asked her if she would want me to hang myself in my room. She says that Iâ€™m taking things way too far and that I was trying to get out of school. 
After having said this I asked if she would like to see me me die I front of her and in her own words she said: â€œI donâ€™t care if you dieâ€. Itâ€™s nighttime here now and I havenâ€™t been able to sleep. Ian thinking about doing it since the person Iâ€™ve done everything for until now canâ€™t trust me. Since I have nothing to care about anymore I am thinking of doing it. It feels worthless to live my life for someone who doesnâ€™t even care about me
