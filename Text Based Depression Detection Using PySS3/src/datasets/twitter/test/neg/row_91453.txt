It's Christmas and this is hard for me to type right nowI've been crazy suicidal in the past, from ages 13 to 18, thought I was going to die at 18, or rather I planned it. Landed myself in a psych ward and that was the lowest point of my life. Thankfully through healing inner wounds and facing my demons every single day I've managed to crawl out of there and truly consider myself happy. And you know what? I still am relatively doing okay. I'm 22 now and it's been 4 years since I've felt that crippling depression but this month has been a hard month for me and right now I can feel those suicidal thoughts creeping up again and it scares me and I dont want to sink there again. I am so fucking lonely and right now I could just use some company or someone to talk to. Maybe its selfish to just blatantly call out for help like this but I just want someone to talk to about everything. I am asking for help because I dont want to be suicidal again. I dont want to sink again.
