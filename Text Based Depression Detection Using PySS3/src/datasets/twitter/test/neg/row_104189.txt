Lost a friend over.Theyâ€™re not dead or anything, though Iâ€™m probably dead to them. We had a big argument. Our ideas head butted a bit too much. 

We were going around in circles and it was hard to ignore the issue. Itâ€™s probably best if we arenâ€™t friends.

But I already miss them. They were there when nobody else was. They saved me from killing myself. And now nobody can stop me.
