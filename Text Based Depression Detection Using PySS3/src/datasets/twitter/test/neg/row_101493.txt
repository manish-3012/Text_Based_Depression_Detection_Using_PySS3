Out of optionsIâ€™ve recently opened up to my parents and told them how Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression pretty much since I was young and they just never listened to me so I never got help. Well that went as badly as you can expect. They ridiculed me and told me that itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m depressed. I donâ€™t have the option to talk to someone on my own and these suicidal thoughts are getting louder and louder. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t think I have many other options. Is there a way to cope? Any advice would be helpful.
