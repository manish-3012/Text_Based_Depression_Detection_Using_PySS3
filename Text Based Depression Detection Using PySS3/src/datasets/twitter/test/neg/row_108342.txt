I wish I wasnâ€™t scaredI live beside a train station. There is a fast train that passes it at around midnight. It is 9pm here in the UK now. There is a bridge overlooking the tracks and thatâ€™s where I plan to jump from when that train goes by. People have done it there before and theyâ€™ve all died. So I donâ€™t doubt Iâ€™ll have the same fate. I have tried everything, therapy, medication. There is really no hope. So Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t have anyone else to tell this to. But I wanted to tell someone. Iâ€™m very scared, but I know it will probably be instant and painless. I wish I wasnâ€™t so scared because I want to do it. I think Iâ€™m going to cut myself and go for a walk before itâ€™s time to go. Bye
