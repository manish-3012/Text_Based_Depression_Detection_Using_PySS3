I feel as though the only thing stopping me is the thought of someone finding my body. And I'm starting to care less and less about that.I feel like I have a clear mind, I'm not in some depressed drunken state. I just feel like I'm done with being alive. I feel lonely all the time and I can't connect with people. Met a girl online who I talked to for a few months and we became super close, and then out of nowhere she started ghosting me with no explanation. I just don't want to try anymore.
