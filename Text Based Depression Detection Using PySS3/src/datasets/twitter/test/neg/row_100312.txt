Last tryIâ€™m sitting in the parking lot of my therapistâ€™s office before my appointment. This is my last attempt at getting help before I decide to end things if Iâ€™m allowed to go home. I feel remorse that I will be leaving the people I love behind but thatâ€™s not enough for me want to be alive anymore. Iâ€™m sorry to my beloved. Iâ€™ve tried so hard.
