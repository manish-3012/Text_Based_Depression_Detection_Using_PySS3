I fucked up.I can't stop thinking about it. The fantasy. Oh, how sweet it would be. I wouldn't feel pain, and I could finally leave. Good game, everyone. Loved ones would be sad, yes, but I would be gone and free. And as ashamed as I am to admit it, the shockwave is part of the appeal.

But it is a lie. It always has been. It solves nothing. There is no catharsis, no resolution. Producing a bloated corpse proved no one wrong, and if anything only affirms my detractors' suspicions that I couldn't handle it.

But now I am married. To someone who perhaps I shouldn't have. She loves me madly, but I cannot find the energy to reciprocate. I am in love with another, but it hardly matters now. I chose my wife, at the detriment of what I really wanted. I was unable to be selfish when selfishness is all that really matters.

So I will live in contempt. For this condition, for myself. And just hope that perhaps the next 30 years won't be as much of a fuck up that the last 30 were.
