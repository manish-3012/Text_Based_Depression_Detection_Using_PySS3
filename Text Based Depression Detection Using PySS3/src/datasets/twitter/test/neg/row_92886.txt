How many years do I have to live with this before I can leave?It's not a temporary feeling, its been too long without anything to live for. I thought I had someone to care for me but they lied. They want me dead, I want to be gone, and beyond one final commitment this summer I'm clear to go. I've had people I hardly know joke about how I should kill myself. I have no friends, I'm a burden on my family and my only real love moved to another country and did everything in their power to isolate me. I can't cope anymore. My doctor isn't helping and I can't keep calling samaritans rather than having real contact. I'm scared I won't keep myself going long enough to keep the final commitments I have.
