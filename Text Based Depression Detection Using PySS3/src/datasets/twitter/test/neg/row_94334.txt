Thinking about killing myselfRight now I'm thinking about attempting suicide again. It just seems like the best option. Im going to a therapist now after my boyfriend convinced me to go but that just brought along more problems. 

On the first appointment my dad didn't turn up. He said there's no point of going. Because apparently everything he said is right. And on Monday we had a massive argument. He tried to force me to tell him what was wrong. He kept shouting we aren't leaving here until you tell me what's wrong. So I tried to tell him something and started shouting "why are you so upset about that stop being stupid". We just sat there for ages arguing. And then he said "to be honest i don't care jen. I don't care about any of this anymore. There's nothing wrong with you at all so cut the shit". He walked off not really caring at all that I was crying. He still hasn't apologised and really I don't think I deserve one. 

Nothing really feels worth living for anymore. I just want it all to be over. Im sick of making other people sad. I need to do what is best and get rid of myself. No one needs me anyway.
