I want to be nothing.My parents are both narcissistic and control my life. They don't care or bother listening to me. I don't know if I can last any longer in this shitty environment. I hate myself so so much that I want to self harm again. People keep bullying me for no reason. I hate this endless cycle of pain,anger,and bitterness. I get stuck in life and then I get hopeful,carefree,distracted, and happy and then it's back to being depressed,jagged, and suicidal. Jesus Christ. When will this ever end?
