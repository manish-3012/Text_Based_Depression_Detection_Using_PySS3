I Don't Want Things to Get BetterI'm 21 years old and I think I've seen all life has to offer me. I had a shitty childhood where I was verbally abused by my peers and emotionally and physically abused by my family. My mom died when I was 13 and even though she treated me like shit sometimes, it still hurts. I don't even remember what her voice sounded like. I'm freakishly tall, obese, I smoke too much pot, eat too much fast food, and I've recently picked up smoking tobacco. I've had 10+ jobs since I turned 18, most of which I quit within a couple of weeks. I'm roughly $6,000 in debt, which isn't a lot but to me it is insurmountable. I don't make enough money delivering pizzas to pay off my debt and pay all my bills and rent. I've never been in a relationship, never had sex, never been told by someone that they love me and actually believed them. Being born was the high point of my life, it's all been downhill since then. Occasionally I'll get a glimpse of happiness, but I know I'll never actually be content with things. At this point, I don't want things to get better. I want life to keep beating down on me so I have the courage to actually kill myself. Nothing in my life is worth living for, absolutely nothing. And no amount of mental gymnastics will ever change that. The only thing I care about nowadays is music. I'll probably kill myself to my favorite album. At least then I can go out on a good note (pun not intended).
