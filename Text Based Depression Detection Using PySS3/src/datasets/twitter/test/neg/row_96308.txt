Running away or taking a break?Here's the deal. I have no job, no money, I'm the scum of society, and now I have a $1000 on my shoulders from my last 6 hour ER visit. I've been in therapy for 5 years and I'm on shitty medication.
I told my grandmother about this, she thinks I should take a trip to Hawaii to see my dad, (I'm in Utah). My dad is an avid Buddhist, who most likely put me to work on his property. She the work will get me out of my head. My therapist says, that's running away; And that my problems will follow me. But it's not like professional help has... Helped.
What do you guys think?
