My life is finally looking up, but I still plan on killing myself before I graduateI finally turned my grades around and am on track to graduate on time. I have friends who care about me and who I spend time with every day since we live together. I'm studying what I love and what I'm passionate about. But none of it is enough. I'm tired of living. I have a plan and a note that will both be put to good use this semester, and the best part is no one around me suspects a thing. The only person who knows is my ex, but luckily she doesn't care enough about me anymore to actually do anything about it. I'm not scared, I'm looking forward to it. Honestly, my biggest fear is being caught and stopped because I don't want to have to deal with people treating me differently because of it. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, have a happy holidays y'all
