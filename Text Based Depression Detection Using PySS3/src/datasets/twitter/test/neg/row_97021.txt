I feel like I am fighting a loosing battle with suicideI(43M) have been suicidal for several years now.  My wife cheated on me when we were engaged.  In the fog of the betrayal I married her.  To my knowledge she has not cheated sense we have been married.  I have trouble forgiving her for it.  The problem is she promised to make things up to me but puts forth no effort.  Shortly after it came out I was hospitalized after an attempt to take my own life.  I have been hospitalized 4 times in 5 years for attempted suicide.  I am now fighting off more thoughts of self harm and suicide.  Is it bad to say my biggest regret in life is that I didn't kill myself while she was with him?  I am starting to think it is only a matter of time.
