Why continue?I just turned 27 and my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me yesterday, the day before my birthday. I feel like I have a dead end job, it's just second tier tech support. That girl pretty much lived with me from the get go and we've spent so much time together. I feel betrayed because my parents didn't like her and said some not nice things. I didn't speak to them for 2 months because of that. Then she tells me one of the reasons that she's breaking up with me is because her parents don't like me. It feels like my life is going nowhere. I went to a boarding school for high school then spent 2 years at a service academy so all the people I know don't live nearby. I don't know what's keeping me together besides my cat.
