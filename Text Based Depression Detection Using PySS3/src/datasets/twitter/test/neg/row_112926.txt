if suicide is painless, i would've done it right awayI've had enough trust on humanity. i have those so called "friends" but we never talked. they never find me to talk anyway, they just live their own lives, and saying that I'm important to their lives. no I'm not. y'all just want to reassure me, but actually doing nothing.


for one person i can say they're passive and having an extremely private life, but what if it's all people you treasure? even my own boyfriend? no they won't find me in the first place. and then they say I'm their close friend, I'm important to them, lies, lies, fucking lies.


I've had enough on humanity. everyone would "care" when something happened. i once attempted suicide and yes a lot of people came to the hospital to visit me but what's next? nothing. yea they would "care" about me, but i just feel used and pathetic.


no one actually cares if i killed myself, right? stop saying the "i care about you" "I'll be your friend" "i won't leave you alone" bullshit. don't you think I've never heard it? I've heard those phrases a trillion, quintillion, centillion times, and not a single person was actually available when I'm sad and suicidal. or they just leave my texts on read saying that "I'm sorry idk how to respond to your texts".


or am i just too available to actually get a life? i reply texts as soon as i receive them and my phone is always with me 24/7, whenever i receive a vibration i take my phone out and reply them right away. and then i waited forever to receive another text. this happened to all people. literally every single person i know.


what a stupid promise to say that I'm staying alive for him when he doesn't even say ily to me in my face because "i just don't feel like saying" and "you know i don't say cheesy stuff".


stupid, stupid, stupid. everything is just lies, lies, fucking lies. people are fucking pathetic, so am i.
