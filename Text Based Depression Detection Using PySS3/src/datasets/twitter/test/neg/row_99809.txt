Looking for PeaceMy wife ended our marriage by cheating on me with someone she works with. Its was going on for months apparently. During this time we had holidays, many family gatherings, Christmas and New Year. She went through all this knowing what she was doing behind my back. She was made redundant 2 years ago, and I foudn out she has spent it all on clothes, shoes and stuff like that. Nothing for the house or for me, most of it went to ebay. We are divorcing now, but I just can't deal with it. I have know her for almost 25 years and she was my entire world. Even just writing this is making my so upset. I don't want to go on without her. I am on medication, seeing a private counsellor, and also a phychiatrist on the NHS. I have really tried to get over this, but I am so tired and I just want to die. I have told my best friend how I feel and he is very supportive, but no one is able to feel my pain. I know how I want to end it, and knowing that I can end it whenever I want actually makes me calmer. I have written letters to my family, done my will, and have left details for my funeral. Everything is ready for me to end it all and to find peace. I have never put anything on a website like this, and I just wanted to get it all off my chest. I wish everybody on here the very best of luck and I want to thank you for taking the time to read this. Thank you.
