Drunk epiphany.Literally all of this is my own fault. Nobody that Iâ€™ve been trying to blame or any social circumstances or things like that. Not bad friends, not the trauma, the way I feel rn is a result of a series of choices. Iâ€™ve fucked everything up slowly over time on my own. Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t think it gets better. Iâ€™ve ruined and let down more than enough people and things. I couldâ€™ve done more/better but I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m just gonna try to figure out how to end this as quickly/painlessly/efficiently as possible.
Sorry if this makes zero sense.
