im killing myself in the way that wont hurt my mother the mostive struggled with eating disorders before, and since the peak of it i havent really been super sick with it. more in the recovery stage if you could say. so often im looking up pro ana inspo for everything. and i can just sit there for for hours looking at it all. im terribly suicidal. but im a huge fucking empath. and one of the strongest people i know in life is my mother amd ive put her thru literal hell and she has dealt with literal hell and honestly i just really love her and she is my best friend. and thinking about how her life would turn upside down if i killed myself abprubtly i know she wouldnt be able to talk or leave her bed. i am her oldest child and we have always had a special connection. but i cant keep living. i have no interest to. so jesus christ im going to sound like megan trainer when she said â€œshe tried anorexiaâ€ but im going to become seriously anorexic to the point where i die from it. it will be a slow and painful death. but it is a way for me to die and i think it will hurt my mother less if she sees it more as an illness that killed me. rather than if i hung myself and her truly feeling a sense of closure. shell have time to know i am dying. so will my sisters and brother.
