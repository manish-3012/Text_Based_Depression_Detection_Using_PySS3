Taking an LEveryone that I had ever cared about in my life left. Christmas just leaves me with this stomach wrenching feeling of loneliness, even though I'm not alone. I feel poor even though I can afford anything I'd fucking want, but money can't fill a hole. It can only cover it.

I miss them, but they chose their own lives. I can't fault them. I can only fault myself for believing people would stick around that long. I poured myself into helping them, into showing them I cared, until they decided I was a thing of the past.

I know I won't kill myself. I'm too much of a coward to tell you the truth. I know I won't do anything. But I'll sit here, in misery and pain (both mental and physical), gritting my teeth prepared for the next fucking "merry Christmas." Yeah, Merry Christmas back..

I've got opportunities, I've got directions in my life. Hell, I've even got a couple of people who care. But I feel so empty internally. I feel so burdened. I feel so tired. Nothing means anything to me anymore, and I wish I could say I felt like a piece of shit from it but I don't even feel that. I just don't feel.

Goodnight. Merry Christmas.
