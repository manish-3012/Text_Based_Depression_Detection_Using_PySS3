VentingI'm new to reddit, just felt so alone and like I needed to vent to someone, anyone. I'm 15, pretty normal life, dad beat the shit out of me when I was little, continues to take my mom to court and force me to be involved. I'll have to start seeing a therapist soon, by the order of the courts, which might help except everything I tell the slimy cunt gets written down and sent to my father, mother, and courts. My girlfriend told me she didn't know if she loves me anymore, might seem silly that I'm this upset over it at 15 but we've been together for a little over a year and she's helped me through so much. She swears she only said it because she was sad and upset but honestly I don't know. I cut myself pretty much daily, I've never worked up the courage to actually do it though. I guess that's it though, I hope I did this right and everything. Thanks for any replies or whatever.
