I Don't Even Know Where to StartFor years things haven't turned out in my favor. As soon as something good gets going, *boom*, your mom dies, *boom*, your brother is sick, *boom*, your family hates you.

Days have been getting longer and longer for as long as I can remember. I haven't even been able to put the effort into crying for about a month. I've gotten used to being sad. I tried listening to a favorite band of mine that would always make me sad (Daughter, if anyone is interested), and I couldn't feel a damn thing.

If I were to kill myself only two people that I know of would care. And if I tried I'm sure I could make them hate me. Nothing in this world seems worth suffering reality. For years I've been on this long track to nowhere, why shouldn't I pull the breaks?

The two people that would care already have each other. It would probably suck for them but they could get over it pretty easily. I know that they are a bigger part of my life than I am of theirs. I can no longer justify my existence.
