Perhaps.The headache medication in my house is so cheap and the recommended dose is 2000 mg per 24 hours. Each pill is 500mg. In theory i just need to take more than four and I'll be on my way. I looked it up further and eight is the absolute maximum. Maybe if i take nine or ten it'll be enough.

It needs to be far from the competition. The competition is in January, 9-12. We're going to train from 6-8. My time frame is after Christmas until January 5. That should be enough time for them to sort things out.

I could do it on my birthday, January 4. But I'll be with family for lunch. I cant do it in the morning.

So it's before my birthday. That works. Yeah.

December 28? 29? 30? Sounds good. Close enough to new years, far enough from Christmas. People will forget about me for the new years. Yeah. Sounds right.

I can down the pills with alcohol. I havent drank in three years. Anything should go. Something cheap. Yeah. That should work.

I'll be okay. There's nothing to lose in death.

Im sorry, love. Its hard to go on.
