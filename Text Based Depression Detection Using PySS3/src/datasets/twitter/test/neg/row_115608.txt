Do I want attention. Yes. Do I want it for shitty internet points. No.I feel like nobody cares. I donâ€™t necessarily want it to be over, but I canâ€™t see â€œthe lightâ€. Maybe people do care. Maybe Iâ€™m just too dumb to see it. I just want somebody to say something genuinely kind and genuinely caring. Not the number for suicide hotline, or donâ€™t be sad. This probably doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense. Iâ€™m straining out my thoughts at 12:00 in bed, being a depressed bitch. Why a depressed bitch? Because thatâ€™s all anyone sees me as. I have had     Enough, and it sucks. Iâ€™m not gonna fight, but im not gonna lose to the sadness either, just stuck in a semi suicidal state. Goodnight. I hope I donâ€™t wake up, but I know I will. Fuck.
