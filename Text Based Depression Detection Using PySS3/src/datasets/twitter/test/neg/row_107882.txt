Former friend messaged me despite not talking to me for months after my attempt &amp; recovery. How do I respond?I survived a suicide attempt late last year and at the time I believe I had a support network I could rely upon, not necessarily to vent deep anguishing issues but to just be there as friends. Immediately, I realised that they were less talkative and even cut contact with me (such as unfriending on fb), not texting or even plans to meet up. Fortunately, I had 2 friends who were constantly checking in on me daily and I felt I could normal with them as if nothing happened. However, losing contact with other friends led to some serious heartache because I shared very close things with them eg being Bi &amp; atheist in a conservative religious culture and pressured to marry ASAP. It was the most isolating and loneliest feeling when friends like that stop talking to you, they continue to hang out themselves and the stress led to another scare with my heart and a hospital visit.

Recently, one person who has not spoken to me in months messaged me, saying that they didn't know why they didn't say anything to me for a long time, they missed talking to me and liked the idea of meeting up. They then mentioned what they were up to and asking what I was up to?

Seeing that name and message brought back so many raw feelings of anger and sadness and being at the hospital again. It's great they are moving on in their life and socialising among themselves but I still feel raw &amp; bitter, I feel they're no longer privy to info about my progress and myself. They even wrote, they didn't know why they didn't message me for months and didn't do so sooner!

I still very angry and want to ignore it but at the same time, I just feel like I need to mature about this. I'm torn up about how to approach this.
