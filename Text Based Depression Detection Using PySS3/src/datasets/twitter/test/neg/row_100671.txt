Just Another Random DudeHey all, I doubt anyone will read this, as it's gonna be wall of text to the max. this is more of a confession/rant than anything else. It's not that important, nor is it anything new. There's some personal information here, but not enough for people who don't know me to find me. Also, not many people I know Reddit, and even fewer browse SW haha.

 I have an amazing life. I have a family who loves me, I was raised as a Christian (not as a religious person, but as a Christian. My family always taught me to basically imitate Christ and not buy into any organized religion bullshit. If I don't agree with the bible, my parents encouraged us to find what makes us happy. My brother's a gay Agnostic, for example.) I'm constantly reading self-improvement books, (picked up Failing Forward Recently, it's really good) and I read and reread them, trying to make me a better person. My parents never put pressure on me to do anything with my life, they've always told me to do what makes me happy.

I've tried to be a good person all my life. I come from an eight person family, and my best friends are my siblings. I have no home problems, I  enjoy a moderate amount of drinking, smoking, video games, exercise, etc. I'm a textbook balanced individual with a good home life.

I have an amazing girlfriend who makes me happy when I'm with her. She's so incredibly in love with me that she would do anything for me, and has proven this fact on occasion.

I went to high school in the Midwest, was popular and well-liked, and somehow I ended up at an Ivy League College. I'm 21, and I have a decent GPA, a solid friend group, and 2 close guy friends who I can tell almost anything. I have a great job for a college kid, I have an amazing internship lined up for the Summer, and my resume is a boss. I've interned in law offices, under senators, and I'm currently running a small non-profit program. My parents can't afford to support me in any way, so I pay my own way through college. I had to take out some loans, but I've been on r/frugal and I've been reading books on how to make sure I'm not to far when I get out.

I've always been told that I'm the happiest, funniest, friendliest guy people know. I've always been told that it's weird how much everyone likes me. Personally, I've always seen myself as a manipulator who can get people to do whatever he wants. 

If you're still reading, then here's the problem. I don't care any more. I don't care about my college, I don't care about my friends, I don't care  about anything. The only time I really care is when I'm with my girlfriend or my two guys. Then, and only then, do I care about them. After I say goodbye, I can't help but thinking about how much better things would be if they didn't know me/ I didn't know them. When I'm with my girlfriend, it is the only time I am truly happy. When I'm not with her, I can't stand the thought of us being stuck together. Before we dated, we were best friends for 3 years. We've been dating for 9 months now, and I can honestly say I want to spend the rest of my life with her. But I can't stand the thought. I can honestly say the only thing I can think of that is wrong with her is that she's not good at board games or many video games. But she is always willing and is always a good sport. We made plans to start playing DnD next weekend as a study break. She's fun, beautiful, smart, willing, cute....she is my dream girl. And I love her.

I've been in a slump for a while. I don't know why. And when I say a while, I mean for the past 2 years or so. I...I always think about suicide. Not in a really serious way, but like whenever I see a knife I think "Man that would end it really quickly." Or I'll just be in bed and think about jumping out the window, or hanging myself. I've been doing this since high school, and I'm only just now realizing how unnatural this is. The only time I've really seriously thought about attempting it was when I had to quit ROTC, I just wanted an excuse not to go for just one day so I cut myself really, really deep along one arm. while I was doing it I thought about just moving the knife over one inch to sever the artery...I wasn't scared or anything, I just couldn't do it to my family. I dropped out of ROTC the next week and cried for the first time in years. not because I almost killed myself, but because I was such a huge colossal failure.

Anyway, two nights ago I was hanging with one of my friends who I knew liked me. Neither  of us had ever acted on it, because I'm in love with my girlfriend and because she's a good person. Plus, there's no physical attraction there for me at all. We've been friends  since freshman year, and we've been good friends at that. But two nights ago we kissed. I don't know why I did it. I told her that it felt right, and it did, to an extent, but not for emotional or physical purposes. It felt right because I finally found a way to feel like I not everything was perfect. That I would have a reason to...I dunno...finally get what I deserved. To hurt people? To hurt myself? To destroy the only good thing I have going for me? I want to say that I was just horny, that I was just doing it because there was a warm body, but there was nothign like that. There was not physical attraction. There was no emotional bond other than friendship. I don't know why I did it, I don't know why I did it and I just keep playing it over and over in my head but there was no reason for it. 

I told my girlfriend what I did immediately after. She took a day to cool off, and then asked me sincerely if I wanted to be with her. I do. I do I do I do. But I don't. I can't make her stay by me when I do this sort of thing. But in this case it was just my baser selfish self saying that yes I do want to be with her. I can't tell her that I'm going to hurt her because I can convince myself when i'm with her that I wont. But when I'm by myself, I know I will, because that's who I am and that's what I do. I'm going to hurt her, I'm going to hurt my family, my friends, and my love. It's who I am. I'm going to fail at life, I'm incredibly fake and I just want to end it. I want to do it in a way that makes it look like an accident so no one blames them self. I'm tired of letting people down and failing in my life. I'm tired of people thinking that I'm a good person when I'm a bad one. My girlfriend told me that it was a mistake. That she's furious, but that she knows that it'll only happen once. and that she is already forgiving me for it because she knows how much it hurt me. 

What the fuck Reddit?! I cheated on her! How can she say that? I always thought that I wouldnt be capable of cheating. And this wasn't for anything tangible that I can think of. it's just because I guess on some level I like things to fall apart. I don't know. But right now, all of a sudden I don't want to die. Not really. I just want to not be born. that would be so much better. I wish that I wasn't here. I might just disappear. It would be better for everyone. The suicide thoughts are gone right now. I'm still gonna post this though, because they'll be back tomorrow. And the next night. And the next. Is it sad I'm more excited than anything else for when I finally get the balls to follow through with it? I mean, I've wasted everyone's time here because I have thoughts I don't have enough willpower and motivation to seriously consider for more than five minutes or so. It's pathetic. Anyway, asides from that, I have no motivation to do anything at all. At all. AT ALL. At all. At all... whatever. Here's hoping I get some motivation/willpower soon right?

TL:DR: I'm a stupid asshole who wasted your time. Sorry.
