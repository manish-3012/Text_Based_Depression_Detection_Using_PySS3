I have chronic pain and although I don't want to kill myself anymore, I have no idea how I'll be able to support myself.I am a few years into an audio engineering degree which should land me a job, but that still means I have to be able to work enough to not starve, which just doesn't seem likely. Add loans and I'm considering just giving up college now before I'm in further debt. My mom often says I should just live out on a beach in california, but what is a more realistic way of setting up this plan b? I'm not opposed to work, I just don't have the ability to get in a car every single day and sit at a desk for a few hours without needing the next few days off to lie motionless and vomit constantly. I'm trying to restart my old computer repair business but I'm finding no success. I write music but I'm not counting on any of that making any money. I am thinking of going back into computer science in some way as it's more friendly to the disabled than audio engineering.
