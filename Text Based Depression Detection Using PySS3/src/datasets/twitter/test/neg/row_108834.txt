I've always had it on my mind but today was the last straw.Im 17, and i know everyone says relationships in high school don't matter but this one meant so much more to me. She was my first girlfriend and within 6 months of being together we talked about planning to move somewhere together for college and to start our family soon after we got financially situated. I know some people are going to say we were too young to be thinking about that but when we talked about our future family it made me so happy and it could tell she genuinely wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. She accidentally got pregnant 1 year and 5 months into our relationship and I told her it was best to abort it since we were young and are families didn't approve of us being together at the time (her family was really abusive). She trusted me and aborted it but it destroyed her. I tried being there for her, sometimes i was really insensitive because i didn't think how you would get attached to something you didn't know anything about, and i didn't consider it to be an actual baby because she aborted it at 7 weeks.

Everything started falling apart right afterwards. 4 months later she cheating on my by sending nudes to numerous men she met online, most of them older. That was almost 3 months ago and I havent been the same since. Ive kept in contact with her somewhat and for the first 2 months she was apologetic and it made me feel better and have a sense of closure. But then she started blaming me, saying it was my fault because i convinced her to abort the baby. She said since she didnt have sex with anyone else she didnt actually cheat on me. It wasnt until just today I was able to get her to apologize for her saying those things to me. 

I get home from talking to her and I want to play games with my friends but theyve been avoiding me for some reason for about 2 weeks. I ask them why they dont play with me, and they just drop a bomb on me. They say they think Im annoying and an asshole and that i enjoy and try to argue with them. And that when i jokily call them stupid or dumb they dont take it as a joke. Ive known these people for almost a year and i only know them online but they have never said this to me before. I tried explaining to them im just joking and i wouldnt actually call my friends stupid and try to be hurtful. They knew about what kinda of a place i was in because of being cheated on but they say they dont care and that they are tired of me. I eventually just block them.

So now Im here sitting alone in my room tryting to distract myself by doing anything i enjoy but i just cant. It fucking pains me so much knowing that my ex girlfriend who i wanted to be my wife cheated on me but she didnt get punished for it at all. She kept all of her friends, even made more online friends. I dont go to public school anymore because of covid. I literally have no one because ive pushed them away. I wasnt able to keep my girlfriend from leaving me. Im just that unattractive to be around. My family doesnt make me happy and they dont understand mental health. I tried pills, therapy, all of the above. None of it makes life worth living. Im searching up ways to overdose and hopefully I can die of a heart attack in my sleep. If not I might just crash my car into a pole or something, i wish i had a gun. Im just so sick and tired of going through this pain and somehow coming out worse than before. I have literally zero people in my life now. Im so tired of being alone.

If you feel anything like i do and youre thinking about ending it, I hope you make it through. Be stronger than me.
