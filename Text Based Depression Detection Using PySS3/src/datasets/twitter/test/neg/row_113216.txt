I'm heading out of the world now.I have decided to do it. It will happen and thinking about it makes me happy. I have built up the courage to do this, which is very ironic bc a lot of people say suicide is for the weak but it's quite hard. Btw this is not my real account as I don't want any of my family to know. It's been real but imma head out. Later y'all.

Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else- TÃ˜P
