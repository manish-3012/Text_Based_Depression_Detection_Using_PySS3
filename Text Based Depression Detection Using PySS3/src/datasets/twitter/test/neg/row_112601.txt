Kinda Just Screaming Into The Darkness HereLife is pointless and repetiitive.

i don't know why i'm keeping myself alive for other peoples sake.

my daily routine consists of waking up, slightly cry, try to go back to sleep because in the back of my mind i don't want to wake up, walk to the shower, turn it on and just sit in the water for like an hour, and then finally get to doing whatever the hell i have to do in my already disorganized life.

fuck me....
