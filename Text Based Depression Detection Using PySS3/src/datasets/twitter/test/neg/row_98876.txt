Life has lost its shine...This has been the worst year of my life... I dont recall ever being this depressed almost constantly... when im at school i want to get home, the only thing i want to do is sit in my bed and cry... Im so lonely, have no future... I long for the past, for those simple times when i was in high school... Along the way something died inside me, something that made me happy, something that made me enjoy life.

It was fun while it lasted, but in all honesty i'm at the point where im just done...

I want out.

I know people will cry, i'm aware of the fact that many care for me, but no amount of love has ever truly helped me.

My train will be here in about 34 minutes.

The urge is strong, stronger than ever before...
