mm iâ€™m ready to kmsso hereâ€™s the thing. i canâ€™t give you my whole background and everything but iâ€™m in so much pain. iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression over a year ago and only very recently started to hurt so, so fucking much. my heart is being dragged down. iâ€™m a teenager boy and iâ€™ve already fucked up. iâ€™m extremely dumb, iâ€™ll never get a good stable job. iâ€™m overweight and fat i canâ€™t even loose the weight bc of a medical condition that prevents my body burning fat for energy so the constant bulimia i have is fucking useless. i donâ€™t have any friends who are there for me or support me. iâ€™m extremely confused with my sexuality to whether iâ€™m bi or gay  and iâ€™ve only liked guys recently and everyone one i like i know doesnâ€™t like me either iâ€™m too ugly and fat or theyâ€™re straight. this hurts a lot i feel like no one will ever like me. idgaf how cliche that sounds. i feel ugly disgusting and worthless. i do lots of drugs and get drunk at things my siblings take me too bc they feel guilty i have no friends. this is the tip of the iceberg and i canâ€™t take this shit anymore. iâ€™m hurting so much so so much and no one will help me. iâ€™m on antidepressants tried at least 4 types nothingâ€™s worked.
