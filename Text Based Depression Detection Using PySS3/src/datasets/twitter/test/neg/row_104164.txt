Iâ€™m doneI just canâ€™t handle it... Being told what to do, how to do it. Yea Iâ€™ve heard about therapy but I donâ€™t want to go, considering a therapist described me with â€˜to many thoughts to sleep.â€™ Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion therapists are a waste of money and time. Almost everyday I think about ways to kill myself, Iâ€™ve heard youâ€™ll cause pain to others and people really love you. It doesnâ€™t feel like it though. Iâ€™m giving up piece by piece, there was a point in time that the only thing keeping me from stabbing myself in the stomach was my pets, I love them and I donâ€™t want to be without them because right now they are helping me through time people could never help me through.. so I think Iâ€™ve finally had it though I think about suicide almost everyday I probably wonâ€™t commit it yet, but I think Iâ€™ve lost hope in being â€˜savedâ€™ so yea thereâ€™s my horrible stupid rant for you. Sorry I probably just wasted your time
