I might not make it to tomorrow.The only person that I have ever loved has been taken away from me to a mental health ward and whats worse is that I might not be able to see her again. I need to see her again without her I have nothing, you might say she isn't everything well she is to me, she is what I live for and without her I have nothing and no one to live for there is nothing else in my life and now that I have found myself in a place where I can actually kill myself I fear that I might not be able to make it to tomorrow. I said that I would wait for her to get out and that I wouldn't but I don't know anymore. It all seems so horrible now and I just can't take it. I guess I want someone to dissuade me from my current state of mind but that's probably not gonna happen. If only she called today then things might be okay or if her mum texted me back saying that I could see her but things didn't go that way so this is probably the way it's going to go.
