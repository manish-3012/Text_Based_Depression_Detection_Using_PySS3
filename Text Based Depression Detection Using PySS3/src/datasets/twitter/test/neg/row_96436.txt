(15F) my sister (14F) threatened suicide and my father (45M) refuses to get her any psychiatric help. Advice?My sister (who I'll call Lola) and mother had a huge fight at a full restaurant which resulted in Lola throwing juice in my mothers face and on my mother's white dress. Lola stormed out of the restaurant and into the car. My mother, my grandmother, my siblings and I all followed Lola to the car. My mom got there first, and spanked Lola a couple times for embarrassing her in front of other people. We live in a small town, so we knew 95% of the people in the restaurant.

Lola then went on to shout at us, saying "I hate myself so much, I want to fucking die, I hate the way everyone treats me." etc. She also said she feels like she's a mistake. When we all arrived home, Lola, my mother, my other siblings and I explained to my father what happened since he didn't go out with us. My mother told him that my sister and I need psychiatric help, not in a mean way, but because my mother has had 2 or 3 mental breakdowns in her lifetime, so she knows what it's like to NOT be okay. My dad said "I've said this before, no way." disregarding the fact that Lola threatened suicide and my on/off self harm for the past 2 years.

When my parents first found out about my self harm, I really wanted to go to a therapist, but because my father refused, I've gotten used to the idea of dealing with my self harm on my own. I am currently fine, so no need for a psychologist. But I feel as if he is taking this too lightly, what if Lola tries to kill herself? I'm sure he'll regret not getting her help when he was aware of the issue. How can I convince him to take Lola's threats of suicide seriously? Even if it's an empty threat, this needs to be dealt with. Lola has been isolating herself a lot more lately, and after tonight, I'm worried for her.

Edit: Money is not an issue!
