All I think about lately is jumping off this one particular parking structureI go through the whole scenario in my head. I get into my car, drive over there. Pull the ticket, the gate arm goes up. I drive up the ramps. I go to the second to last floor, the one just before the roof top. I park my car. From my phone, I log into my Facebook account to re-enable it one last time. I start a live stream video. Probably no one will watch. I've kind of rehearsed what I've said. I stop the live stream. Post a few messages to twitter asking people to update my WikiFur article when they find out and give them my real name so they will know what I am talking about. I leave the phone, exit the vehicle, make my way across to the other side, stare out over the city, and ... well you know

This scene plays over and over in my head. But it's not just that. I've even mentally drafted notes to what I want to say to my dad, my only friend, my spouse, the rest of my family. Most of them apologetic for being such a burden on everyone, especially my dad. I look back on how I was when I was a kid and I was terrible. I probably should have been medicated. I was out of control. I feel so guilty for all the pain I've caused him. I wish I could pay him back for all the financial damage I've caused but I never could. 

I have a hard time explaining why. It's one of those things unless you've felt like this you don't really understand. Doctors say it's depression, anxiety, and psychosis. But how it makes me feel is like I am always on guard, like something bad is always going to happen. I am always hearing whispers or people calling my name. I am always tired. I generally don't enjoy doing things. Most people will sometimes have off or bad days, but those aren't the same. I've come up with a silly analogy though. Think of the worst, most unbearable move you have ever paid to see. You're in the theater. Others are enjoying this movie, but you aren't. You can't stand this movie. It is just an awful mind numbing experience. But you can't walk out because you're here with your friends or family and they're enjoying it. But at least you know it will be over soon. Now take that feeling, multiply that by a million, realize you don't know it will never end, and it causes physical pain, and that's what I feel like all the time. 

My only regret is leaving all this crap that everyone will have to sort through when I am gone. But I am sure a lot of people will like to have it and other stuff can be donated or just discarded. I just have to make sure I dban my computers before I do it. Nothing bad on them, just passwords and account stuff I want to protect.
