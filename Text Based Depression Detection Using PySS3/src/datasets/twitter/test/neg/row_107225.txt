Wondering if I should kill myself or I should run awayI've been wanting to kms ever since I heard I was moving to another high school no matter what I do. My parents tol me that I could stay at my school if my grades are good, but that was just a lie and they thought I would get over moving, but I didn't. I haven't moved yet but we've already bought the house and it's about an hour away from what I call home. The scary thing is that I've accepted it. I'm ok with killing myself except for the fact that I won't be able to experience what life has to offer for me. What I'm asking is: what can I do to run away from home and start a new life. I need like a full plan and everything cause I don't want to get caught running away, I wanna just do it. Pls reddit, if this question is answered, that's one life you've saved.
