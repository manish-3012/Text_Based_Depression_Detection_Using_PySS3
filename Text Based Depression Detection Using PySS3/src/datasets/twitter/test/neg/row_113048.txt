Thank youThe fact that this forum is even a thing has provided so much inspiration for me to be better and happier going into the new year. The fact that nobody involved in this has to be here or is being forced to be on here is wonderful. Being apart and witnessing random people from all over extend a hand of kindness, and compassion is truly moving. Youâ€™re all wonderful people, youâ€™re all capable of happiness. The worlds going through hard times right now, letâ€™s all continue to be here for each other.
