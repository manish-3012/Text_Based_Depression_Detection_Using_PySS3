I'm waiting for the next time I'm by myself.The only thing that's been stopping me form killing myself is the lack of convenient suicide apparatus. I'm from a place where firearms aren't easily available. I can't build a decent hangman's fracture inducing system. I know that the slit wrists method is more than likely to fail. I don't know which pills to take(I'mm looking them up in another tab right now). 

I envy the suicidal people who had access to firearms. I have a constant visual inside my head of me blowing my brains out with a Magnum. Feels so smooth. 

I don't feel anything anymore. I don't care what my parents or siblings would feel about my suicide. They're almost inanimate to me now. Just a congregation of atoms that exist with me. I'm dissociated from the society in general. I'm an outsider *everywhere*. 

This is not to say that I feel disenfranchised from society or anything. By all means, I have an appearance of a normal, attractive 21 years old guy. They might think of me as a shy person, perhaps. I have tried my best to be anti-social a lot of times, to be honest. 

All that being said, I've had multiple rants online about my situation on other forums and frankly, I don't have the energy to carry on this ritual anymore. The next time I'm alone I'm gonna consume a lot of alcohol and slit my throat.
