I have a friend who is currently being abused and she is trying to end her life.Posting from an Alt because I don't want this person to find out I'm posting here.

There is this woman who dated my college roommate a year ago and he transferred right after they broke up, but I believe it was on good terms. She has been a friend of mine for about two years and has mental health issues. She has been getting drunk a lot lately and has been calling me for no reason about once every two-three weeks. Her friend came knocking on my door dragging her along, because she wouldn't stop talking about me, to talk to me about her suicide attempts which shocked me. She had tried to hang herself, slit her wrists, and even try to kill herself in front of her family at one point. She lives in a sorority house and one of the people in it is verbally and physically abusing her. She also apparently just ended an abusive relationship and I feel like she has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way back. For some reason they are not calling the police about her abusers even though everyone, but one person, who lives in her house is trying to protect her and hide her from this person. She also believes that nobody loves her for some reason even though it seems there are friends that are looking after her and protecting her.

What should I do with my friend going forward? I feel trapped because I don't want to be her therapist and she refuses to seek professional help or call the police. I don't know who the people who are hurting her are because she won't tell me. I feel like if I'm not there for her to talk to, she could kill herself and I don't want this to be a thing where I'm up until 4:00 am trying to talk her out of suicide.
