i have given up.my best friend of 10 years decided to join the army and i cant handle anymore of this.

 my parents hate me and frequently tell me i am a waste of time. all i think about is them telling me how much of a waste of time and breath i am.
they dont let me go out or have friends.

i plan on ending it once my best friend leaves because i have no one else except for her.

 i have dropped below 100 lbs again and just cant care enough to eat anything.
all i do is sit around or sleep, i dont have any hobbies anymore, everything is just so boring.
