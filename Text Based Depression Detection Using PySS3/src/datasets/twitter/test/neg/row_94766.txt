School ain't going well, social life ain't going well, knowing my luck I won't even make it into the marines which my whole life has been about. Hell, nothing's going well so I probably will end up killing myself before 30What the title says. Im 16 now so I will most likely end it soon. I havent been happy for a month now. Its all empty inside. Ive always wanted to join the marines and I will try to join it first. If im not accepted, I will end it
