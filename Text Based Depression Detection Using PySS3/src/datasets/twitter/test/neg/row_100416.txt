Feel like im in constant pain  Ever since I was 14 I've been a cycle of depression, I thought by now I would have everything figured out. I'm 20 and things just keep going downhill, a year ago the girl I dated for 2 years dumped me, just recently the father I always wanted connections with, who would only beat me, or chastise me is dying of cancer. Learned the night before I went to MEPs to sign up for the Navy. I'm supposed to ship out in 6 months, I don't know if I'm cut out. I just want out of this city, I want direction. None of my friends talk to me anymore, anytime I say anything in the group chat they ignore me, no one invites me anywhere. Everywhere I got I feel uneasy, and unwanted. Fell off the wagon a week ago and started smoking again, I want out of this night mare, I can't keep going on, one tried 3 times to kill myself and everytime either wasn't enough, or I was too cowardly to follow through. I belong in a psych ward not the military, I live alone and I'm barely making rent. I dropped out of college. I'm only 20, what the hell am I going to do?
