I think this is my last weekIt's been nothing but bad luck after bad luck. I found out I was pregnant a few weeks ago. It hasn't been a joyful experience; I'm in a situation that's not suitable for even thinking about having kids. I've pushed my SO far enough away from being 'a psycho preggo' that now I have to take care of things myself, i.e abortion, etc. 

Morning sickness has been absolute hell on me. I'm unable to show up to work most days, and when I do, I'm only able to work for a few hours. I feel useless because I can't work to support myself, let alone a child. 

I have to work at 5am tomorrow. I don't know if I'm going to show up.
