Feel like it's just about the end.I've been on thus sub before but not for a while. I came to browse and see if I could make myself realize that I'm not alone but it didn't help. I feel like all the pressure in the world is on my shoulders right now. I cut myself a bunch this past year to try and ease that pressure but it just feels like it delays anything that's going to happen. I'm under pressure because I failed one of my classes and i have to twll them and I know how my family will react and theyll be mad at me and bitch me out for not trying hard all the while they pressure me more and more to get a job while I'm home for the summer.  On top of that anotger year has gone by where i have been rejected everytime i ask someone out and it makes me feel more and more unwanted. I know I have great friends but I still feel like they try and avoid me or think that something is wrong with me. sometimes I feel like suicide is just easier, and I'm feeling that way now
