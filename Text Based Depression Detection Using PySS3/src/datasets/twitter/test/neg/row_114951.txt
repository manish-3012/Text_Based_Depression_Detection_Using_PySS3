WhyNo matter how much I try, how much I want to succeed, my life just keeps going down. I am in the &amp;th grade. I don't care that I might be too young for reddit and suicide, but I can't take this anymore. I'm failing in school, and I might have to repeat. I never told my parents that I have been feeling this way, simply for the fact that it might break them down. They think I'm being selfish and entitled when i don't complete my schoolwork, but in reality, I just want to find something to make me happy. I sink myself into video games to hide the fact that I'm hurting. Please, someone help me.
