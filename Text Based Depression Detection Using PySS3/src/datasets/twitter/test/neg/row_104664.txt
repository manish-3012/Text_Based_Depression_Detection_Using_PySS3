I don't want to live anymoreI moved school due to bullying at the beginning of this year, and I'm really struggling. I'm 16 and have had mental health issues for a long time, but felt like I couldn't tell anyone about it. When I moved, my mother made a doctor's appointment just in case. I actually ended confessing about self harm and frequent suicidal thoughts. Although I didn't say it the only reason I'm not dead is my fear of death. 

I ended up being sent to a crisis mental health unit that night, and have been to multiple appointments since but haven't been able to open up since. Then quarantine happened suicidal thoughts happen constantly and I'm actually working out how to kill myself. 

As I've stated before, I have a really difficult time sharing my feelings and I just don't think I can do it to either of my parents. I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. I have a plan to kill myself and I really need help, I just don't know where to get it from. Talking to anyone at home or on the phone is out of the question, and I've been googling suicide methods and have picked on out.
