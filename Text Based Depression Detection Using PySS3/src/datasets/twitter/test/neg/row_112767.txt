What is going on in my life...So basically my relationship with my parents is totally messed up. They don't care about me at all. Being quarantined with people who make you feel like dying is horrible. I'm in my room all day and not once have they asked me how I'm doing. I'm 14 years old and I've lived for 14 too many years. I want out of this life so badly. To be honest I don't even know why I'm posting. I guess I just wanted someone to know what I was going through. Not that anyone cares. If I died tonight no one would care. My death would make so many people happier.

Thanks for reading this! At least some people care enough to read some of the posts on here.
