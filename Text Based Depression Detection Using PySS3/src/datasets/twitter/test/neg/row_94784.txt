Life just fucked me. prison of death?Recently my life have been turned upside down, fucked sideways and then ran over by a train. I have been charged with conspiracy to armed robbery as well as weed charges. I am very young and was in college until recent events. I'm your typical college student just studying and trying to chill and graduate. Because of legal issues i am not going to include specific details that might harm me in my case in this post. So a few month ago i was charged with conspiracy to armed robbery because i was stupid, young, and friends with the wrong people. I DID NOT help commit any robbery or help plan them but some evidence makes it look as i might of? My lawyer is telling me that their is not much evidence against me but i'm still looking at jail time. He previously said 10-15 years MAX but now i'm probably looking at 3-5 years MAX and MAYBE probation.
Recently the thought of going to prison keeps hovering above my head like a cloud and is making me want to not live anymore. I just feel like i have disappointed everyone in my life. I have made many of my friends who were living with me suffer as they were arrested with me(drugs). Especially my parents who have put in so much effort in raising me and making sure i can lead a good life. I feel like i have ruined my whole life and have no future. How can i spend YEARS in prison doing nothing... i be better of dead. There is nothing more horrible then spending my days doing nothing but looking at a cell wall while knowing everyone my friends and family are all going on with their lives. These days i can't concentrate on anything and waves of depression just hits me randomly. As my court date gets closer and closer all i can think about is everything that i am leaving behind because of my stupidity. I don't really want to live knowing my life is ruined. I don't want to spend any time in jail. 
So if anyone have been in my position or has some advice please do not hesitate to comment
