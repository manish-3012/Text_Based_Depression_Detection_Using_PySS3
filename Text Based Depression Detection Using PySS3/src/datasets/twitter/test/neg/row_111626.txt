My girlfriend attempted suicide again todayI (https://old.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8r5dmm/my_girlfriend_is_suicidal_and_im_failing/)[just posted here a few hours ago] and she just messaged me saying she tried killing herself by bathing in alcohol...maybe if she got intoxicated she'd die or some shit. I'm so angry right now. After her "bath", she went to a photography class downtown, says she got a very bad headache and was dizzy during the whole thing. She's heading home right now and she just dropped the bomb 5 minutes ago. I'm fuming. I tell her to get help and she just dismisses it.

I love her so much, but right now I want to tell her to fuck off. I can't be there for her if she tries to kill herself every god damn opportunity. I want to break up, I can't take it anymore. But I fear that if I do, she'll lose all hope (that she hasn't lost already) and will actually do it full attempt no holding back. Before, I used to think our relationship was the only thing making her keep it together, but now I see that our relationship is nothing more than just a distraction for her. She wants to die. I can't do anything about it.

I want to help her. I can't.
