Another sleepless nightThere's always a reason why people don't open up about this. It's because people act like ur a burden or you're too much. Then they'll tell you how to live your life. That's why I prefer to keep everything to myself. Yes it's a lot. But it makes me feel better knowing people don't walk on eggshells around me. Knowing people won't pick what they say just to make me feel better
I'm still waiting for that miracle tbh.
