Im just 16 and i dont know what to do with my lifeFor the last couple of years I've felt that every single thing that i do goes terribly wrong, I tried to apply to a decent school and got rejected, Tried many different sports but im just trash at every single one, tried to be better at school but i just keep on procrastinating,
I feel like im a disgrace to my family.
The one friend that i used to talk to doesn't want to talk because she got a boyfriend and she gets into pretty heated fights with him.
Tried to be positive around my family but they just don't care if im breathing or not

I don't want to be a disappointment, i want to be someone that at least my family is proud of 

I have told my mother sorry a lot of times and i feel like im not important to her anymore.

I want to end it all but i know something will go wrong and fail to kill my self and I'll just end up being disabled or something.

If someone reads this, Thanks a lot , it makes me feel like i was important to someone for a fraction of time. (Sorry for my broken English)
