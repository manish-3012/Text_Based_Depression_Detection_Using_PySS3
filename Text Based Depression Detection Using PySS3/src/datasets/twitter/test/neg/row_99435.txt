I donâ€™t know what to doHad a mutual break up last night. It was needed, I thought that we would stay really close friends and it would be okay. I struggle with PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression. Iâ€™m in therapy and on medication. I am so absolutely terrified of being alone and now I am. Itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a wall now and even though not much has been said I feel like I canâ€™t talk to them anymore. They donâ€™t really seem to care about keeping a friendship. This is devastating to me because Iâ€™ve opened up to them about my trauma and usually turn to them for comfort. I have no other friends. I have no where to go. Because of the thoughts Iâ€™m having I know I should go to the ER (been there before, it was very helpful). But itâ€™s finals week and I want to wait until the semester is all the way over to go. I dont know what will happen if I go to the Er, but I do know that Iâ€™m not mentally safe right now and I have no clue what to do. Iâ€™m so completely alone. And Iâ€™m so scared. I need a boost to get through this next week so I can go to a psych ward after finals.
