"I love you"Lately, I've been texting this to people, almost every day. I usually do it to try to replace a bad thought with a positive. Trying to replace my "I want to die" thoughts with "you love your best friend". none of my friends are particularly, sappy as you would say. "gay" is a common response I get, sometimes he says he loves me back. 

my best friend and the center of my universe for the time being is going through a rough time while I unfortunately am as well, but because I always put him first I am keeping it to myself. its making me resentful, not towards him, just, towards existence. People trying to be kind to me or flirt with me just make me angry. 

I dont talk to really anyone these days, and not just in general but like open your mouth talk to someone. I don't hang out with anyone, all the people I like to be around 1) dont live in this state 2) work opposite schedules to me. The last physical contact i had with someone outside of work was when i broke up with my ex a month ago. 

i long to talk to someone i care about. just for 5 minutes, that's all i want. acknowledgement that we both exist in this moment, and we're existing together. but I feel so alone. no one ever has 5 minutes to just talk. I'm tired of feeling so insignificant. I have conversations with myself. and I've started hallucinating my friends, and I'll have conversations with them but it doesn't feel the same. 

i feel so alone. i dont want to feel like this anymore.

thanks for reading. i know this probably doesnt make sense, but I can't just post this on Facebook with getting involuntarily committed to the hospital, you know?
