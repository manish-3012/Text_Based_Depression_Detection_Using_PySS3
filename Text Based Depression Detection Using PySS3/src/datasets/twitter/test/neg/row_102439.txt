my life is pathetic, so I might off myselfmy post may seem stupid, it may seem.....pathetic in a sense, or in every sense of the word. But my life is pointless and pathetic. I'm a high school drop out that now has to go to adult school to get my diploma, I'm ugly as all hell so no one is ever going to fall in love with me. My life has gone no where since high school, I feel like offing myself might be best for my family and myself, they won't have to deal with a dissappointing accident anymore, and I can finally be put to rest. I dunno, I just want to drown or OD. and if you did find my post pathetic or stupid, I am very sorry for wasting your time
