For something completely the sameI'm a 61 yr old male with a very successful career. I was laid off 5 yrs ago, and I haven't been able to find work (IT). I have great kids, a great wife, so life isn't all bad. But, the money will run out - probably the most I can hope for is a couple of years more.

My mind is still sharp, but no one wants to hire a 61 yr old guy. The options at this point is should I make my death look like an accident, which means I can't leave any final to my kids and wife, or do I leave a note. Which way provides the most closure?
