Done.Iâ€™m just sick of life. Everything I do is wrong. I just cause problems in every aspect in life, not a day goes by where someone isnâ€™t affected by what I do. I get told Iâ€™m just a mean, rotten person. But I try to be nice, I try to include everyone and I have a big heart. But I guess Iâ€™m just a bitch. And I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know how to change the way I am. No one will ever love Me. No one will ever truly like me. I feel like I should just be alone forever. And I canâ€™t live with that. So I need to die. I really donâ€™t think I can Jill myself, Iâ€™m too much a pussy to do that to myself. But I want to. And I wish someone else could have my life. Cause they would be better at it. I tell people these things but everyone in my life just thinks itâ€™s for attention.... I really have no one but myself. And I hate myself more than anything. I donâ€™t know if I will be back or what will happen once I press done. But I love my mom and my dad and my bf and grandparents, brothers, and half sister. but every single one of u has been too affected by me. itâ€™s like I just cause pain and am a waste of space. I still love u all and I will never stop loving u.
