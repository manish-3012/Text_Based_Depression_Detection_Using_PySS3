Over this lifeI think I'm pretty much done. I will be homeless in a month and I'm in an abusive relationship. Lost many friends and really have no place to go. See no point in continuing this everyday battle. My biggest fear is failing at suicide how sad is that! Most fear death and that's what I'm looking forward to!
