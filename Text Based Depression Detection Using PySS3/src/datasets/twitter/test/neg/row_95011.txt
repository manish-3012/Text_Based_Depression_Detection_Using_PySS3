I NEED YOUR HELP RIGHT NOWAllow me to explain, there is man who private messaged me earlier saying he was suicidal, I tried my best to help him, and we said goodbye to each other, however I recently saw that he private messaged me again with some worrying words via a notification. But when I clicked on it, I had been signed out of reddit. I must of forgotten some weird specification in my username cause I canâ€™t even reset the password.
If thereâ€™s anyone reading this in the next few minutes if you seen any posts by the username of something along the lines of Inject liquid sleep, please tell me what the exact username is, so I might be able to help this man in time. This is the last chance I got, thank you if for taking the time to read this, sorry you thought I was the one in immediate danger.
