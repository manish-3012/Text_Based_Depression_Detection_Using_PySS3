I actually had a good dayI donâ€™t know where else I can really post this. Usually my days at school are shit, and I thought it would be the same today.

About 30 minutes before school started, I realized I forgot to do my math homework. I also had a big test in my 6th period, a smaller one in my 7th. (IB school) I also had the mile run.

For my 6th period test, we had around a week to write notes on a single lined piece of paper since it was a big history test. I forgot it at home and thought that I was doomed for that.

Instead of my day being absolute shit, I finished my work early in 1st period and finished my math homework since we had a sub. Math is my second period so I thought I was fucked.

During my mile run, I managed to get an A on it. I felt really proud of myself since it was our last mile as well. 

The test during 6th period had 2 parts. A multiple choice online test and a written part on paper. I got a 62/64 on the multiple choice, missing one question. It was on google forms so we saw our grade instantly. I felt like I also knew the stuff for the written part.

During 7th period I didnâ€™t even need my notes for the test. I knew most of the stuff and I felt really happy for myself which is uncommon.

Also, for the first time in 6 years I got new lego sets. Iâ€™ve always been a fan of lego, so this boosted my mood as well.

Maybe things will change, maybe it wonâ€™t.  Today was a great day for me, though, and I hope it was for someone else that feels like I do.
