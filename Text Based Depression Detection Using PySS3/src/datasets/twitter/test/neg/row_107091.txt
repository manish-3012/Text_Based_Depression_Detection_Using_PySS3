for last time Every day I try to find a reason but I don't succeed. Events and people lose their importance to me. I can't feel sympathy. I can't be sad for anyone or anything. It's been five months since I've talked to anyone for more than 10 minutes, and I've been alone again. I know I can't stand the pressure, a few years of being alone and not being seen is something I can't experience again. I don't know what to think or write. Maybe I'm not strong enough. I don't know why I write these words. Suddenly you come to your senses and see that you can't speak, it's hard to find the words, you can't finish your sentences, and it takes a week to write a few lines. Sometimes it's too late. Maybe these words are the last attempt to help someone. bye.
