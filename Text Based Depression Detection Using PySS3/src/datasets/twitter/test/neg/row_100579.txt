I'm so fucking furious right now.I'll try to keep this short. I've tried cutting (too chicken to try to go very deep), taken pills (with rather comical results I might add), whipped my back with a belt (oddly satisfying since you don't have to worry too much about injury), etc. Honestly, it's not that hard to find efficient ways to kill oneself but I'm such a fucking coward that I won't try anything that takes any level of pain tolerance. I feel like I've calmed myself a .bit although that's probably just the lack of stress as of the last two years. I've never gone a week without thinking of killing myself, sometimes hourly. Usually, it's a very detached idea: "I could. Meh, maybe".

When I do think seriously about killing myself, it's always this burst of violent anger toward myself or others. I'm the most disgusting type of person there is: has every goddamn opportunity and yet doesn't do anything but the bare fucking minimum and only when pushed to do so. 

When I try to talk to others about this, I find myself being an attention whore (hell, that's what this post probably is anyway).

Every time I fuck up, it burns itself in my mind and pops up at the most random of times. Really frustrating.

The only thing I seem to enjoy lately is gaming but it's such a waste of fucking time. At least the occasional adrenaline rush makes me feel alive.

Every inch of my life seems planned out. And I want to blow that plan up because of how disgusted I am with the monotony of it. The same fucking pattern every phase of my life with no ability to try anything new due to my total lack of interest and will.

I wish I could just get my hands on a gun and blow my brains out. Or that some sicko would kidnap me and torture me so I could project this hate onto something else. Or that I could kill and mutilate someone that deserved it. I'm becoming addicted to very base stimuli since it at least makes me feel something interesting. 

I'm throwing up this post since there's a lot that's been invested into me (a bit stupidly but there's no way I'm telling my parents that). I'd really like to get over this so I can go about with a stereotypical happy life. I don't give a fuck how. You know of a lobotomy that'll do it? I'd take it in a heartbeat. Know how to cut out my emotional extremes? I'd do it.
