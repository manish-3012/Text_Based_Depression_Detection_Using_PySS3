I can't take it anymore! Suicidal thoughts are haunting my mind.I wasn't always like that. In fact, I love life and to be alive. I never considered suicide as an option before, and I always find the idea silly.

Let me tell some basic facts about myself. I'm a literature student from Turkey (which is a fact that simply enough to be depressed I think). I dropped out a fine arts school before. I write and draw since my childhood. I wrote and illustrated eight children's books a few years ago. What I really want to do is write and illustrate stories for myself. But I have serious philosophical/theoretical problems (like, since the significance of postmodernist literature has decreased, I have to create a new paradigm, but even postmodernist literature has not yet been completely understood and absorbed by the readers in my country.)

And there is this problem about philosophy: I'm exhausted by the epistemological plurality, doubt, subjectivity and the nonexistence of any kind of metanarrative. These all just bring a state of constant danger. There isn't emancipation in analytic philosophy or in postmodernism or hermeneutics. I want peace, I'm sick of that war inside my head, I want truth and singularity, but I can't find it anywhere, so I just go back to literature and art, just to relieve myself and forget everything. It's like taking drugs, it gives relief only for that moment, temporarily. 

(I think no one will reply to this post. I'm sorry for the confusions and contradictions in my thoughts, and the grammatical mistakes of course. I wish I was a native speaker of this language.)

I live with my boyfriend, and he is working. I'm alone all day. I have to study and go to school. My grades are high, there isn't any problem about that but I'm not sure that I can finish the school and graduate. I can't go outside alone, I have to go to school, but I can't breathe while walking in streets or in the subway. It gives me headache all the time. Only when he gets back from work I feel fine. When he is not with me, I can't stand anything. I think he became a kind of drug, a place to escape. My parents are in another city, and I don't think I can live alone.

Now I'm sitting here, books and notes laying in the table, I can't study, I can't read, I can't write anything, instead, I think of dying, but before that, again I think, "I must write a book." Then I start to write a story in half-awakeness, and I never finish it, and the thoughts of suicide begin again.

What should I do? I'm in pain, I cry, walk in circles there alone all day, from 7:30 AM to 7:00 PM. I can't take this anymore. Should I go to a psychiatrist? Or just die, simply? Or maybe you can tell me about a branch or school of thought for peace (but not existentialism, any kind of theological thing, or mysticism please).
