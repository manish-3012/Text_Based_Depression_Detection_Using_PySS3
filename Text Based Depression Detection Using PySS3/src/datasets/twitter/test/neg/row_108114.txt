Things donâ€™t always get betterIâ€™ve had depression since elementary school and have tried therapy and all different kinds of meds. I have no friends and Iâ€™ve never been in a romantic relationship. I just started college and itâ€™s funny to think that things might be different. I really tried to be social but I feel as if people just donâ€™t wanna hang out with me. Nothing fucking helps so Iâ€™ve resorted to drinking. I hate the taste of the liquor but I do enjoy the feeling of not feeling like shit. I know this isnâ€™t a permanent solution and I can feel the end is near. To all the people who say things get better, Iâ€™m sorry to say thatâ€™s not always true. I wish it was and for some it is. Iâ€™m dropping out of the school after the first week and Iâ€™m going to kill myself when I get home. I have no one to tell cause not even my family cares about me. Goodbye everyone, I hope things get better for others
