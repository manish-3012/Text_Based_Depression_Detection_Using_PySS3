I'm not sureAt first I was going to write a story explaining my persona and life, but then I thought that'd be too much of a thing. 
I want to end my life, it's all I've thought about for months, years if you could count the bogged brain of depression. 
I'm too scared to do it, I want to, but I'm not brave.
