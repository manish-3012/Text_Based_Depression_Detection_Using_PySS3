I can't do this anymoreI'm 22 and I just moved in with my parents to sort things out before I get out on my own but I can't do it. My mom is taking most of my money for "safe keeping" so I can't afford to go. She screams at me constantly and everything I do is a disappointment to her. I have a great job, I'm finishing my last college class and I just have a lot of opportunities coming my way. But I'm not good enough for her. My entire life she's just criticized me and then mocked me when I get upset and she laughs at me whenever I cry. I'm trying to save up to move out but I can't get enough money together because she's taking so much of it. I just feel so trapped and unhappy and I can't see a way out of this situation. I don't know what to do. I can't deal with this anymore.
