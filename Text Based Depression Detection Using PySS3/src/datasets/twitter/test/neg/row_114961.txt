I know how I would do itI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m near the point of actually being suicidal. Iâ€™ve just had pretty heavy recurring thoughts about it. I donâ€™t want to feel pain, I just want release. If it ever comes to it and Iâ€™m absolutely done with everything Iâ€™ll opt for heroin/fentanyl. I feel like thatâ€™s the best way to go. To experience a warmth and happiness like never before and then peaceful death...
