I real want to kill myselfIâ€™m just so tired and I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. All Iâ€™ve ever been is a burden. I really tried but itâ€™s not working. Everyone sees me as someone Iâ€™m not (driven, passionate) but Iâ€™m just tired of everything. I get it, things will get better if you give it time. But Iâ€™m past caring. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I donâ€™t want people to hate me more but I cannot do this anymore.
