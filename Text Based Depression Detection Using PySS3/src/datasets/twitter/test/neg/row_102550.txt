[19M] Feeling really dissociatedMe and my therapist spoke about my suicidal thoughts and feelings. And Ive discovered that I feel really disscosiated with who I really am. Although I could simply vanish and no one would care. That the real me, the me I have hidden for so long that so few know coulddie away and no one would care.
