I wishI really wish I could end it all. I am so so so tired ode fighting for this life.
I'm normally the person that says it doesn't matter and it's ok, move onwards and upwards. 
I just can't anymore, I never would have the balls but I wish that I could go to sleep and never wake up. 
Yesterday made me sad and emotional but today tipped me over the edge.
