I want to kill myself (again)Hello good Samaritan,


I am so bored of my life. I feel like there are too many rules and I am often getting criticized and blamed for things that are frustrating and wrong to them. My boyfriend blamed me for his weight gain and my parents like to blame everything on each other and me like there fighting, drinking, and my poor mental health can apparently be blamed on the fact I took LSD a couple times?Â 


Â I am sad for myself because I don't get enough affection... nothing I do go clean, cook or give him affection will make him give me enough affection in return. All he wants from me is a smiling face and a good fuck.Â 


it's overwhelming.... all the recent trauma I have had from finding out I was molested by my grandpa at an age I was too young to remember...I found out after he tried to hit on me again at my cousin's wedding after being diagnosed bipolar, to bankruptcy, divorce, rejection, eating disorders, and getting punched 7 times in the face amongst other beatings by my last boyfriend. My drunk Dad started touching me, spanking me, kissing me, hugging me telling me I am beautiful when he never did when I was young. He spanked me once for stealing as a kid ...once he grabbed me by the throat and threw me on a couch, making me pee my pants, because I accidentally woke him up.... he told me to shut up a lot back then too.Â 


I understand that everyone makes mistakes, I have made a lot that I feel guilty and ashamed of.Â 


People care about each other.... they mostly care about themselves though.Â 


I scare myself with my thoughts of suicide sometimes. I dream about it very strongly recently and I seriously just want to take my life for the hell of it. I'm tired of suffering and not feeling perfect, I am in pain like most people. I don't feel like my life matters... It's thrilling to think about how people will miss me or not.Â 


I think I am a pretty girl, I became a massage therapist before I found out I was molested.... so that has been a challenge. I like yoga and art and I have been starting to take my trileptol for bipolar again recently. I have been to the hospital twice and to the emergency room countless times within the last 5 years.Â 


I feel sick, broken, unbalanced and hopeful but also apathetic towards my life.Â 


I appreciate that the Samaritans respect the choice to kill yourself if it is so. My mom also gave me that freedom to "do what you got to do"...


I know it's not the only way to get relief, but it is quick. The pain may last seconds for meeting while it lasts my family a lifetime. A lifetime is not that long though either.... it's nearly a flash of light in the grand scheme of things.Â 


Sincerely, Kat
