I have battled suicidal ideation for more than 35 years... and today is a very hard and scary day.My head, heart, and body hurt so deeply. If you're here, maybe yours does too. Or maybe you are here to help. Either way and for reasons unknown to me I just needed to post something here just to say that the last time I was this deep in this mess I was on my way to end it. If it hadn't been for a school field trip at the county nature park where I planned my death, I'd have been dead now for almost two years.

Some of you might know, because you've been there or you've studied it, that suicide is a crisis act, and that often times if we can get through the immediate crisis, we'll stay alive. 

I have, by the looks of it, a fabulous life. I live in safety and material comfort. I have a house, a family, and work I mostly enjoy. Perhaps you, like me, just live in the deepest and most inexplicable pain. Perhaps you, like me, have tried like hell to get to its source and to find some healing. Perhaps you, like me, have found that the wound at your core sometimes scabs over and even scars before it erupts again.

Perhaps you, like me, realized that it wasn't really love you were looking for all these years, but forgiveness. And it is forever just beyond your reach.

Sorry for the rant. I am doing everything I can today not to put the shotgun in the car, and I can feel it pulling on my like a goddamned magnet.
