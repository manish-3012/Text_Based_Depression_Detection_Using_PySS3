Why don't girls like me?I've been looking for someone to share a life with recently but everything I've tried doesn't work, girls just don't like me at all, I don't know why, am I really that ugly that girls won't ever give me a chance? Why would I want to live knowing these facts, these suicidal thoughts get worse and worse, I needed someone to come save me and make me happy, but I guess I'll just be miserable forever, I'll just end up killing myself soon anyway so it doesn't matter
