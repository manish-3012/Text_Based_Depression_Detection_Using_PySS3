shoulda died at 16at 16 i attempted suicide. didnt work, eventually found myself convinced that it'd get better.

im 21 now. my parents abuse me a lot. they dropped me out of college and didnt let me look for work because my mother doesnt want me to work at all and wants me to be dependent on her. i tried moving out but was homeless on the streets and starving and no jobs would take me and my mom asked if i wanted her to die. so i came back afraid she'd kill herself. 

i have a passion to work and be active about things but they're restraining me so much. i spent 12 hours arguing this past week over why i should be able to apply to a pizza job. i tried to type and send a resume and secret but my mother found out and screamed at me a lot and i just kind of laid down and cried. 

when i think over these past 5 years i think of how much of a lie that was. i wasted 3 years due to literally no experience. i can't do anything now. everything is in place to keep me here. ive LITERALLY tried everything. every single fucking resource. but they find out.

some people don't get better. some people don't have the resources to. some people's best option is to die. im only 5 years late.
