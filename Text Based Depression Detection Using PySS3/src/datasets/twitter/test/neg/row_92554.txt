I made my girlfriend Hate me and now I have nothingI had no family she was it. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I feel the wave washing over me like it did last year when I landed myself in the ER, this time I wonâ€™t need a hospital though. 18 years of life. I tried to make people happy, when I stop breathing Iâ€™ll at least take comfort in knowing I made the people I worked with laugh, the customers. The little kids I gave cups of whipped cream to. All the laughs I got from telling customers shitty puns. I hope that I made something positive in my time. Celeste if you read this, I love you, Iâ€™m not mad at you I never have been. Iâ€™m worn away. I wasnâ€™t mad when you got mad at me, I was calm the entire time. I know you have a hard time when you get upset. Everythingâ€™s just finally toppling down okay? Donâ€™t blame the ember for landing in the dry grass. I know the fire that caused your pain wasnâ€™t your fault. I forgive you. Tell hope I love her, I wish could fix things with everyone. I wish I wasnâ€™t weak. I wish I could save you, I wish I could save myself. *Ash is our purest form*. Iâ€™ll love you from here to whateverâ€™s next. Goodbye lover, *be good for me*.
