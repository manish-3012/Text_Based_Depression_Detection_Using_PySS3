What do I doI want to die, I feel like my life has just been fucked up from the beginning. My father abused me as a child, my parents got divorced but I still had to see him overnight every week and he hasn't changed. I thought everything was going up when I found my soul mate and the person I love more than anything in the world,she is my everything and I love her so much but I'm so fucked up I thought I was helping but I really fucked up her life and now I don't know if she even loves me anymore. I feel like I'm a waste of space but I'm a fucking pussy. I want to do it but I don't have the balls. I seriously don't know what to do. I feel like I should have succeeded when I tried to kill myself 4 years ago, maybe then the world would be a better place
