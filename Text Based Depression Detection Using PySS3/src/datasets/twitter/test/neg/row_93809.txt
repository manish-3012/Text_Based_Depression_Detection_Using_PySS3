Iâ€™m lost in life and I am not worthy of being alive. (Long post)Iâ€™m not a perfect person, in fact, Iâ€™m quite flawed in everything. I struggle to see my own success and furthermore I donâ€™t have guidance or a promising future in my own eyes. I struggle as a social person and more than once Iâ€™ve thrown away good people who were close to me. Everyday I feel further and further from my goals, and I fee that my life has become more and more numb to the problems that are toxic to my life. Iâ€™m struggling to be who I want to be, but rather, I am what failure has created me to become. Iâ€™m looking for reassurance or reason but it seems any opportunities that arrive go so quick. 

Itâ€™s almost like I squander every chance I get at redemption of finding truth to my own life, and itâ€™s getting harder and harder each day to value waking up and being a person. Iâ€™m lost in life, and my emotions tell me Iâ€™ll never find the path to stability. Iâ€™m not valuable to anyone or anything, and my own achievement amounts to nothing to myself. 

Sometimes I find myself debating suicidal thoughts and trying to battle them, but it gets harder and harder to support my existence. Such as this morning I looked quite deep into the theoretical aftermath if I really did end my own life, and found it quite hard to see reason to why I shouldnâ€™t. I saw in my head that Iâ€™m only hurting myself living, and that if I killed myself, thereâ€™s nobody close to me that would be hurt. 

Itâ€™s almost like, perhaps my one purpose in life was to die, and that fate has chosen that to be so. Are my thoughts wrong? Is my one solace truly in death itself?
