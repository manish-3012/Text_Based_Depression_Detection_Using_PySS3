I reached out and no one caresYes I know that everyone is having their own problems and goes through their own stuff. 

But the people I thought I could rely on arenâ€™t there for me. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d be sad if I was gone, but I want them to be here for me now! 

I live in a toxic and abusive household that I canâ€™t leave until next year. I was hoping that with lockdown being eased slightly, Iâ€™d be able to get out more and see people in order to cope. But the people I want to see donâ€™t want to see me. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve done wrong, I thought they cared but I guess I was wrong. 

The worst part is that Iâ€™ve been there for them, but now that I need it they donâ€™t care. Theyâ€™re too busy or literally donâ€™t give a fuck about me. I posted here yesterday, and then afterwards I went and tried to reach out to people and was ignored. Itâ€™s only December and I know from experience it gets a lot worse than this over winter because of my family. Iâ€™m really not gonna make it this time, and the sad thing is that this year has been the best year of my life even despite corona.
