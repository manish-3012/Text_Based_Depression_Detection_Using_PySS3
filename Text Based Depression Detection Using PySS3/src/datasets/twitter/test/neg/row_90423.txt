Soccer was my outlet my temporary escape from my lifeOnce I broke my arm and was no longer able to take that field on sundays and enjoy the game I loved and for 90 minutes loose myself amongst the grass, the net, the cleats, the ball and a group of guys that I loved like brothers, once that was no longer something that I could look forward to to release and refresh I knew that meant that the ref had checked his clock and I was nearing my preverbal stoppage time, LMFAO how ironic this injury happened in stoppage.  Maybe my final score is based on an aggregate but truth be told feels more like a golden goal or sd situation, whatever the result this won't be a draw. A small part of me somewhat desires a win but just seems inevitable that this franchise might head the way of the TB Rowdies back in the day
