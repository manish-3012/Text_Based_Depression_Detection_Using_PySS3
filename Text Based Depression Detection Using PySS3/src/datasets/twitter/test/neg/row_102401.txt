Cross from r/depressionI have been out of work for the last 3+ months and it has been like hell. I have attempted to apply to any place around here that is hiring. Out of probably 300+ applications I have gotten a grand total of 5 interviews. At 3 of them I was told they wanted someone with more experience. At 1 I was told that since I was fired from my last job (long story) they wouldn't hire me. And at the last one I was ready to start working but found that the same guy who fired me was gonna start working as their co-manager. I feel completely ignored. I have tried networking but none of the people I know have any real power at their jobs to get me an interview. I have tried staffing agencies but they always say that they still have my info and they never put my name into any sort of pool or whatever it is they do. I've even applied to fast food because I need something, anything, but my application gets passed over.

And all of this hopelessness is playing havoc on my depression and general health. I am not eating anywhere close to how I used to. My appetite is all but gone. I keep missing my medications. I have a hard time sleeping through the night. If I do sleep it will be constantly through the day because I do not have the energy to leave my bed. I cry all the time and I frequently think about starting up my self-harm habits again. Or worse.

I feel I have no hope. I just want this pain to end. And the more I'm out of work the more I want to take the... extreme way out.
