I thought 2019 would be better...... but itâ€™s been worse. 

It has been so, so much worse. 

I canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can convince myself that shit will get better when we all know it definitely will not.

I thought shit would get better this year, but it hasnâ€™t. 

Itâ€™ll never get better.
