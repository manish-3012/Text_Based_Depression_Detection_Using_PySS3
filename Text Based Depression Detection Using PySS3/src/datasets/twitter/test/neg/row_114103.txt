This isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy, it isn't getting better.I'm 23, on the autism spectrum, and I've been planning on killing myself since I was 11. The longer I live the more I learn about how fucked my future is. Doesn't matter how well-connected or successful my family and friend(s) are, nobody wants to hire me for anything that puts a roof over my head. I hate people, I hate social interaction. I know I'm terrible at it and I just want to be left alone. People hold all the keys to happiness and I'm an outcast. My depression is a symptom of all my problems, not a chemical imbalance or skewed way of thinking. I feel like a fucking alien whose human parents grow increasingly worried and unwelcoming. Currently the only place in the world I feel okay is in my bedroom and I'm lucky to have that. Nitrogen asphyxiation sounds peaceful. I'm trying to last the next 3 years for my siblings to graduate college but it's getting difficult. Shrink told me to reach out to people first, probably just to cover his ass.
