13 yr old atheist and want to dieI donâ€™t believe in god, Iâ€™m depressed, I hate school and I donâ€™t care for anything except my 2 friends and my family, I donâ€™t see a reason of going on other than my mom and dad I also canâ€™t find an instant way to die if I could I would probably try but I still have to think about it, but it hurts to live and I hate life, the only things I really enjoy are being with my parents and playing games, I hate having to learn things and I hate everything I just want to die
