29 with no money, no career aspects, no friends, no loved ones. I said I wouldn't live to see another winter last year before Covid came around, and now I really mean it.I left my last job a year and a half ago. I decided I'd live off my savings as long as I could and then end my life.

I have a useless degree and no skills. I can't even get a job at a gas station because I am socially awkward and not good at lying to cover up for the fact that I've had such a long employment gap. 

I used to want to write books, but the one that I finished three years ago was such an painful failure that I cringe thinking about it.

If anyone's sad about my passing, they'll just drink some more beer and get over it soon enough. It's the way it always has been.
