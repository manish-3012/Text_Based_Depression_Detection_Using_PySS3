Spite. Spite is whatâ€™s keeping me alive now.My family are a bunch of dysfunctional assholes. They used to treat me well when things were going amazing in my life, but since my horrific divorce and job loss due to life threatening mental illness, I was treated like garbage. They are a pretty selfish group of people. Thank god I have great friends. So Iâ€™m not around them anymore and donâ€™t plan to be. 

I used to think I was ready to go, but I soon realized that no one in my family would ever value the person I was or the all the achievements Iâ€™ve had because theyâ€™re... well insecure. In a very short amount of time, my death would only amount to an attention yielding anecdote for them. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m still here, bitches.
