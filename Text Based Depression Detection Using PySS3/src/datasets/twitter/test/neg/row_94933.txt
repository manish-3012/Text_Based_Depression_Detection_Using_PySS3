DepressionHi everyone I've never posted here before and thought I should come here because I am really not doing so well right now... 
Yesterday I quit my shitty but good paying job because I could not stop picturing myself dying in various different ways, I've got nothing going for me, i dropped out uni, lost various jobs and friends. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me and I'm just exhausted from feeling so fucking down or empty all the time. I've tried seeking help from doctors and psychiatric  doctors and nothing works. I'm not sure if the meds I'm taking are working anymore and i can't go through another bout of searching for the right meds. I just want out of life.
