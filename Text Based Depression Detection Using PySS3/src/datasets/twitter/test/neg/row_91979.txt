My final goodbye - Have a read please.Hello, my name is Adam. I'm 19 years old and from the UK. I'm ending my life after I post this. 

I hope this reachers someone, because I've been extremely lonely my entire life. I don't know if I'm ugly or not, I guess I must be because I'm constantly avoided by girls, well people in general. I always have this negative outlook on my life. I never got good grades or had any friends throughout my school life. I never had any positivity. 

I constantly talk about money, I'm poor and always had dreams about being rich, I love cars, watches, everything materialistic. I like materialistic things. I imagine it would give me confidence, being in a nice suit, gold watch, lamborghini. I'll never be rich though. I have dreams, like actually dreams when I sleep, of being this handsome, wealthy young man. Oh well.

I wonder what will happen, hopefully I'm at peace or I come back the person I want to be?

Thanks for reading. I'll go now. :(
