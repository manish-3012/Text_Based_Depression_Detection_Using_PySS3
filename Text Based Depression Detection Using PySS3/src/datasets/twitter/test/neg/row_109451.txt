I wanna do it but not at the same timeIm a guy (16)

I cried when i woke up to school.

I cried during school lunch in the toilet.

I also cried at home. All in one day.

I suck at everything i do, which is the reason i wanna kill myself.

I can't talk to my crush and IF SHE SAYS something, MY HEART beats so fast you can see it through my shirt.

At school, i had a hairdresser lesson and i SUCKED at it. My teacher told me to come out to the corridor and she got really mad at me. She said she told me 1000 times but i still cant do it.

And i also have a raised mole above my upper lip that i cant remove as of right now.

I just hate my life seriously.

I will probably never learn my future job anyways.

I'm worthless and i have NO FRIENDS IN A CLASS FULL OF GIRLS.
