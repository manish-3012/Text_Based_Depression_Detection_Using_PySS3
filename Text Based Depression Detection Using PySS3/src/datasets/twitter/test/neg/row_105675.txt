Idk what the title should beI lead a theoretically pretty good life, happily married, great job loving family but Iâ€™ve been unbearably depressed since I was a preteen.  I feel like being depressed is my default state rather than just neutral.  Iâ€™ve had the thoughts hundreds of times but tonight is the first time I can actually see myself doing it and I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it, never have been able to talk about anything real in person
