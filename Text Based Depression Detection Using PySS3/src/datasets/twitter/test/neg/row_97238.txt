It feels inevitable that I'll do it since I have no hope. So shouldn't I just get it over with?I dont think I can last 60 more years. I am so unhappy, hating myself and going no where. I am hopeless and tired. I dont enjoy life, i have no goals anymore. I just want it over. I dont want to hurt myself and suicide is very scary to do. But honestly maybe i need to suck it up and just do it
