I don't want convincing or offering of help. I just want am honest answer to a yes or no question.Should I leave a suicide note for my family and friends before I go? 

I think I'm going to because it leaves them with some closure at least. I think I'd appreciate that if someone else I know made one before killing themselves. 

I plan on apologizing, reassuring them that it was *none* of there faults, that I love them, and that this is what I wanted, and what will make me happiest. 

What do you guys think? 

Thanks in advance for the replies.
