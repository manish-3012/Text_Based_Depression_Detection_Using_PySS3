I don't know what to do anymore.1) I'm posting here because I don't want people I know finding out

2) I lost my best friend (suicide) this year, July. 

3) my life has hit rock bottom

4) I am in $10,600 debt

5) my work gives me 2/3 shifts/ fortnight

6) job searching has gone to shit. I've been looking since February. 


I'm honestly unsure anymore

I miss my best friend and often I am convinced I'm no longer needed on this planet. :/
