I want to check into a hospital...I want to check into a hospital, I have the weekend off and I want to go tomorrow but i'm afraid that if i do then I will lose my job because i work with young children in a field that requires a dotors note stating that I am healthy enough to work there.
How long are normal hospital stays? and do they contact your employer? would my doctor contact my employer?.
I know that I need help, but I don't want to risk loosing my job and making my situation even worse.
