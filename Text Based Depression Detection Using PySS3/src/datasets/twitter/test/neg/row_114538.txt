I think I'm fucking losing it guysMy depression is coming back with a veagance, I'm not enjoying anything anymore, on top of this, the stress of exams which I'm performing poorly in, coupled with woman issues, I honestly don't know how much more I can take. I'm starting to feel like the only reason I'm not acting on this urge is because I'm a fucking coward, not sure how long that'll last though.
