An unhealthy coping mechanism?Whenever I feel like I just want to die I just stop eating or drinking anything. I know that in about 3 days my goal would be achieved but every time whatever triggered me to feel like I wanted to die just doesnâ€™t seem so important anymore. 

Having 3 days to think about what I want to do is enough time for me to value myself again .... until the next time I feel this way - then the cycle starts over again. 

Iâ€™m sure this canâ€™t be healthy not just mentally, but physically too. It seems effective though, cause well, Iâ€™m not dead yet.
