I am lonely as hellIâ€™m a 16 year old male. I wish I could cry, but I canâ€™t and I donâ€™t know why. My friends are just ignoring me now and they havenâ€™t talked to me for a few weeks. I tried telling my mom Iâ€™m starting to feel depressed, but she keeps denying it. My biological dad died a few years ago and I have a mentally abusive step dad. No girl ever tries to talk to me. Sometimes I feel like I want to shoot someone out of anger, I forgot to mention that I get angry for no reason. I canâ€™t decide between hanging myself or cutting my wrists. I donâ€™t know what anyone could say to change my mind.
