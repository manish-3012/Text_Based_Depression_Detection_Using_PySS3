I am attending the army and i am getting suicidalAlright, we have mandatory enlisting and attendance at the army when we turn 18. The duration of my attendance is 14 months.

Problem is, i cant handle it anymore, its been over a month, i get treated like shit. Even if i follow my orders to the t  i get dissed (by different people). I have asked for medical care or a doctor to check my feet because walking hurts a lot, it had been 3 days and nothing.I am back home now for 2 days.

My tendons and ankles have gotten swollen. I can barely walk. I am getting suicidal and desperate. I dont know how long i can keep it together.

My parents wont allow me because *quitting* here is a social stigma. I however, will leave *here* . Mandatory army the way it is applied here is unconstitutional and against regulations of UN and EU. 

I have the right, under UN and EU, as well as my country to object due to personal beliefs.

Also, my battalion/company/whatever , is way tougher than the rest in the country, we come second to special forces only. No matter how hard we try we get shitted on by the people above us. 

I object attending because i do not want to kill a person, do not wish to hold a gun that *can* kill a person, can not live without humility, can not let go of who i am and become part of the machine that has and will keep killing people, because i can not just lose touch with my friends, my family, my girlfriend, because i am a person and i deserve to get treated as such, because i do not with to become ~~a man~~ the man they want me to be. Because no matter how much hatred people have towards other races, i do not have such. Because i have nothing to pay to this country that has made me feel like an unwanted person. Because i cant keep my sanity anymore.  

None understands it. The complications of not attending are these:

* Not allowed to work on public sector
* Not allowed to get a driver's license in the country
* Not allowed to vote
* Social stigma

All i want to do is get my degree from university and leave this country. I dont plan on coming here again. Ever.

**tl;dr**: My parents are unwilling to sign so i can stop attending the mandatory army. I am getting suicidal and desperate.
