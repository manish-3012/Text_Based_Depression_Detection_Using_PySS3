I just want to be goneI'm tired of this day-to-day endless battle. I don't enjoy a single fucking thing anymore and the amount of times that I've smiled and actually fucking meant it can be counted on one hand. Living just feels like a chore more than anything, it's like no matter what I do, it's never enough. Is there no end to this?
