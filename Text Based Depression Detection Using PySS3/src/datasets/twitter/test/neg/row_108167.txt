GOD DAMMIT!In 30 minutes, it will be the one-year anniversary of my brothers suicide. Since him, I've experienced 12 in 9 years. I've had 3 that hit me the hardest. My uncle killed himself shorlty before I was married to my ex in 2007. My best guy friend did it while I was deployed. And I got the call on 02/11/016 about my brother.  My brother I had only met a few years ago. I have survivors guilt because I helped but him his gun (he was in the Army). If I said no, would things have been different?? I miss him so much! I'm gonna go cry now. Sorry for the sad message.
