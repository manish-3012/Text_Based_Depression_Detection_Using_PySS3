Family failureSo Iâ€™m currently out of college (Took a year off being hospitalized and being severely depressed and suicidal ). Now my motherâ€™s side of the family are all highly educated -all doctors and my mother also expects me to be highly educated 

Iâ€™ve always told her to not bring them up because it makes me feel worse about myself especially since the fact that Iâ€™m not in school and feel like the black sheep of the family 

Anyways so today (I was already feeling depressed ) she goes on and on about her cousin that graduated from one of the top medical schools - basically comparing me to him and how great he is- and I flip. I get upset and go on and on how Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m such a failure and a waste of space and will always be stupid compared to her family 

Now I canâ€™t stop thinking of how bad it must be for her to have a fuck up of a daughter like me - everyone of her family have kids they can brag about out- and what can she brag about me ? A fuck up whoâ€™s all cut up, in and out of hospitals , out of school? Iâ€™ve been crying just wishing I could be Iike them - something to be proud of
