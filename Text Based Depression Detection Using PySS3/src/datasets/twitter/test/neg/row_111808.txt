Tried to end it all tonight but I suck at it.I tried to go commit die tonight but I can't. My method was just cutting. I can't do it though because I'm a pussy and can only get like half a centimeter deep. That is not enough to cut my Femoral Artery or my coratid artery. So I just bled all over my bed but the wounds sealed and nothing much happened. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess im just mad at myself and I want to know how to actually succeed in dying by cutting. 

I live in the North of the US and I'm considering going to a lake tomorrow and going for a swim until I die. I know that will be a good way to go because I've swam in freezing cold water before, until I got numb. Being numb in water actually felt good. It was very peaceful and nice. I warmed up in a hot tub after the time I did that though. When I did that, I went in a hot tub and I was shaking for like 15 minutes before I warmed up and felt okay again. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Just putting my thoughts to words I guess. 

What I really want to say Is how do people kill themselves by cutting? To have that amount of will power to be able to cut 2 centimeters or more deep, to where you cut an artery it seriously impressive. I have gained a newfound respect for  people that have managed to end their lives that way. It's really amazing what some people can do.
