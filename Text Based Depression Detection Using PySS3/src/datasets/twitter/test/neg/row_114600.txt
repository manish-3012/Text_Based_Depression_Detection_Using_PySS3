I've done a terrible thing and I can't stop freaking outLong story short, I spied on my roommate after her shower. It was horrible, she knew, her live-in boyfriend knew. My living situation is over. I'm moving in with my parents, I'm going to therapy as soon as possible. 

For now though, I can't stop freaking out. I've dealt with the situation, I've apologized, it's as over as much I can make it. But I'm still losing my mind. I hate myself, the only people i have left are my parents basically, and my life seems over. But i know I'm going to be okay. I'll get my mind better, I'm fixing the situation here. Life is not over. But my head is spinning, my heart is pounding, I'm shaking. I need help now. What do i do? Please help
