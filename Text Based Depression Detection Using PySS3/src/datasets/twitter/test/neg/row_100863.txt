I play video games constantly to escape life, when I'm not playing them everything comes back and I feel like shit.Ever since a child I've loved games, so it's not unnatural for me to play them in highschool. The thing is, I play them too much, to the point where I used to be a straight A student, now holding a couple D's and a C.

I have a girlfriend who I've broken up with but gotten back together because she said she missed me and didn't realize how much I meant to her. Now all the feelings of jealously when her guys friends post on her Facebook wall or just chat is coming back. Some of these people are good friends, and I'm getting these horrible feelings.

I think my friends are distancing themselves from me, my parents, though still loving, and bitching about video games and forcing me into to more work to make up for my terrible grades. The only way I can enjoy life is to forget it all and go into my own world playing a game. I know they're distracting me, but I don't want to stop.

I broke up with my girlfriend in one of my anger spurts and then begged for forgiveness, she said no and broke it off. I managed to get out of my emotional rut only for a day or two until she wanted me back. Now all these feelings are coming back to haunt me. I love her, but now I'm not trusting of anybody. I vowed not to suffocate her from her friends and having fun, but this is eating away at me.

I want to die, perhaps to set myself ablaze and run down the street screaming "I'm free!" before I collapse dead. I need tough love right now, I don't need somebody telling me it's going to get better.
