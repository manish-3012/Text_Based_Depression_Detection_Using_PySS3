I think I'll enjoy this year out and then I'm gonna do itI think I have about one more year in me before I off myself tbh. It's all too overwhelming at this point, and I've come to the conclusion that I'll never stop being depressed, my marriage is suffering greatly because of it, I feel empty, I feel nothing but numbness. I want to die not in a sad way I guess, but I want this perpetual feeling of anxiety and emptiness with no attachments to even the people I love. It's been building up, my life is and was a mistake. I don't know why I thought someone like me who grew up in terrible unstable situations to the point where my anger issues make me injure myself-- or not showering because I'm hoping something will kill me in my sleep-- or drinking to the point where I'm black out drunk so I could feel something-- I don't know why I thought I'd be okay. Sometimes some people aren't cut out for this shit ya know? Sometimes you just have a shit life and you die. I think that's fair I guess. I genuinely think 2019 might be it for me, and idk I guess I'm content with it for the time being. I'll try to make my husband as happy as possible but I know he'll find someone else who is a better partner, my family can look up for 2 seconds and go back to what they were doing. I know my sister would be upset, but I can't let her watch me lose it anymore. I'm at peace with this. I never pictured myself living a long life, could never picture me actually having kids, I think I always knew if I did die I'd be the one to end it. I think it's realistic. Not everyone can be happy.
