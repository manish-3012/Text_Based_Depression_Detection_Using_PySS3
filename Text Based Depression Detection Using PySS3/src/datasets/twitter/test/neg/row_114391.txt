I am getting kicked out on the street unless I come up with an unobtainable sum of money by June 15th... Ending my life seems like the only way out.I am at the end of my rope, I owe my landlord via court order $4000 by Monday June 15th, or they will enforce the court order and put myself, my wife who has M.S. and my two elementary school aged children on the street.  I am unable to borrow it from my family, I have no friends here, and I feel so alone and scared.  My employer would not lend it to me, and now I am starting to have suicidal thoughts.  I need help, not even just monetary help, just help in general on how to deal with this, I cannot be homeless ... my family will be torn apart.
