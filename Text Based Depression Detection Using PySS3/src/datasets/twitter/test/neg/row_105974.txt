The end is near.I am very tempted to take all the pills I have. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow and I am going to tell her I have been having suicidal thoughts. The only thing that is keeping me from doing  anything is that my college is having therapy dogs on campus Tuesday for finals week. So I plan to pet some good old boys and take my last two finals. Then  go to a mental hospital so I don't end my life due to me failing both exams.
