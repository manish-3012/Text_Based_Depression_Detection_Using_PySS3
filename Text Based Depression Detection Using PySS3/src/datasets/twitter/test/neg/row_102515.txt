Iâ€™m not okI think a lot about the time my sister and i talked about suicide when i wasnâ€™t feeling as bad as i do now. â€œitâ€™s so selfish towards the others around you...â€ she had said with a hard tone. little did she know that her words would keep repeating themselves in my head over and over again and haunt me. constantly pushing me closer to death every time. no one understands, I feel so lost. this is my eternal damnation. if only I had the strength to let go for good. I know the how, where, iâ€™m just waiting for the when.
