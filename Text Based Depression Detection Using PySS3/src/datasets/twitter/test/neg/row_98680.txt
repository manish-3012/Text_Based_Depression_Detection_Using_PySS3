Next week. I think I have come to terms with it.I have chosen a week! Not the day yet... Next week will be the week I leave this Earth and its shit glory and move on to whatever is next (probably nothing). 

I've been dealt a shit hand with loss in my life. Im sick of feeling the depression pain. Sick of living with heartache that I dont know how to get rid of. 

Im sorry to those who love me and those who will miss me. But Ive got to do this. Its the only way to be at peace. I've lived long enough. Time to go fly high. 

People say sucide is a selfish act, I say it isn't. Its taking the pain away from everyone, so nobody has to deal with my depression any longer. 

Ive come to peace with it. I hope my loved ones find peace too and know im not suffering any longer.
