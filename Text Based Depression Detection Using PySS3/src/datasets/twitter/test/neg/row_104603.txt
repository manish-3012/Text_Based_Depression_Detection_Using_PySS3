Just looking for helpI've read a bit online about pill O.D and the general consensus that I've seen is that many people say overdosing on pills is extremely painful and may not even cause fatality. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me if: I have an "all-nighter" so that I'm extremely tired, then the next day I force myself to keep awake throughout the day, then in the evening I down some alcohol to make me even more tired/lethargic followed by swallowing a box of 30 "10mg Eglonyl" pills and 10 "10mg Urbonol" pills with 10 "30mg lilyfluoxetine" pills. Would this be enough to kill me and with the least amount of pain? Or will I wake up feeling sorely disgruntled I woke up only to be followed by an extreme sense of pain and discomfort with nausea?
