I'm a fuck up. I just need to disappear and save everyone the trouble of dealing with me.I'm named after my dad, but I think my little brother should've had that honor. I've failed my family. I left college on a whim, I've turned down offers for a better life to be an actor, and that's never gonna happen. My mother won't say it but she's worried, my father is just plain disappointed. Everything is fucked. I've never wanted to be alive in the first place. I want to die but I can't bring myself to do so. I want to get murdered, but that's not gonna happen because I live in too good an area(suicide by cop is NEVER gonna be an option). I can't get into a car accident because I don't want to ruin my mom's car. And I can't let anyone find my body, at least not my family. I just don't know. I've been alive too long. I know my family will be torn apart, but honestly I think it hurts me more to be alive than for them to see me dead. It's not like I'm close to anyone anyway.
