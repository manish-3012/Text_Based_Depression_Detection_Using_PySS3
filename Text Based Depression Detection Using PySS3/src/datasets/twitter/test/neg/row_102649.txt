I want to dieI want to die so bad, everything hurts. I can't trust my feelings with anyone except strangers on the internet, because when I tell people that i feel bad, they go away. My ex was really sad and she had to leave me because I would make her even more sad, my friend left me too. I had a great christmas but its making it harder to end it and im so caught up and hopeless and i just want to kill myself
