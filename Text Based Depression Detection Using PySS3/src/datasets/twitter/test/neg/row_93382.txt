Only 17 and already an alcoholic. Need some advice.I started by trying some at parties, some off brand shit. I immediately threw up, but soon it just went down easier and easier. Went to more parties, got drunk at all of them, had a blast. Then I drank with friends, out in the woods or in his basement. Then my friends decided they hate me, booked it and ran. Now I drink alone. It's not fun, it just helps me forget. 

I'm feeling like such shit right now. I don't know gow much longer I wanna live like this. Need some advice
