I think I tried to kill myself last night.I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible. But first, let me give you some background on my life. 

I want to first start off by saying I had a very rough childhood. My parents separated when I was very young and this caused some chain reactions that I think have made life difficult for me now. My father wasn't really the compassionate type. I would go to his house on weekends and just sit there while he watched porn on his laptop. He is a sex addict and me being at the age of 5, I knew a lot more about sex than a 5 year old should know.

 Growing up I went to 5 different elementary schools, so you can imagine I had a hard time keeping friends. I was also very chubby, so this made it easy for kids to pick on me. I never really fit in and I got into trouble a lot, especially at one the schools I was attending. So at one point my mother decided to move me back to my original elementary school. This made some things better, but I had lost a lot of fitting in time with my classmates. 

When I was in high school I was involved in a pretty serious wreck. I hit a man on a motorcycle head on, which left him lifeless. This was probably y one of the hardest things I've been through. 

Fast forward to college. I moved to a college town with a girlfriend of 4 years. About a year after starting, she cheats on me. Also one of the hardest times in my life. As a result, I lost a ton of weight and started smoking weed. This fucked with my school work and I had to drop a whole semester because of it. 

That brings me to last night. Now I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately, but I've never actually tried to do anything. But last night I laid in bed and starred at my closet for about 45 mins. Just thinking it over and over again. This time I felt nothing. No sadness, no remorse, no regrets. I just calmly got out of bed, grabbed a belt, tied it to the doorknob on my closet and then around my neck. I sat there suspended on the air, almost reaching the point of blacking out. Then I stopped. I don't know why. I just did. 

So I sit in my floor for another 45 mins or so just trying to feel something. And thinking to myself "why am I so calm". So I tried again and got even closer to blacking out but stopped again. I still felt nothing. So I decided to stop and proceeded to get so high I couldn't move. 

Now, this is where I need advice. See I'm to a point in my life where I just feel blank. I feel like actions like this should scare the hell out of me. But it didn't. If anything, I was more calm during that moment than I have been in a long time. And frankly, I'm not sure I even know what being scarred feels like anymore. So why didn't I go through with it? I don't know. I don't know if I knew I wasn't going to do it. Or if I'm just preparing and inching myself closer to it. Almost every time I get high, I tell myself that I'm going to kill myself. And I think I'm starting to believe it. I think that everything in my life has made me completely numb. So this is why I'm posting. I need to know if I'm making this bigger than what it actually is. I'm not looking for a pity party. I need sound/solid advice. Anything would be appreciated.
