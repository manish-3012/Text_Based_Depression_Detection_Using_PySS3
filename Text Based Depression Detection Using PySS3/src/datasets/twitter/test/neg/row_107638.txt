when will the suffering end?i really just want someone to care. i feel like the only way to get people to care to even realize that iâ€™m not alright is to kill myself... i donâ€™t think i want to die, i just want the suffering to end. i have been dealing with for 5+ years every single day. i told my parents that i cut myself while i was in 6th grade and they reacted with anger and i never was given help. i asked multiple times over the years for help, and they have constantly brushed it off. i have no one. no one to love me, no one to truly see me, no one to care. i just want help so bad, but i just iâ€™ll never receive it. iâ€™m in my teen years so i have no way of really going out and getting help myself, i canâ€™t even drive yet. iâ€™m so sick of wanting everything to end. iâ€™m so sick and tired of it all. i just want to be happy, but i havenâ€™t truly felt that since i was in like 3rd grade maybe. iâ€™m not physically abused at home, but i have a very hard time with all of my siblings and my parents. the only sibling that i truly liked and that treated me consistently well has abandoned me. also, i know that if i ever came out about not being straight, i wouldnâ€™t be accepted. i have no idea what to do in life. i have felt so depressed and helpless for years, i just want it to all end, but, again, i donâ€™t want to have to kill myself for it to end. iâ€™m so lost, i have been for a long time, and i donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll ever get out of this hole.
