What's the pointI'm chronically ill &amp; tired of needing help. Im tired of being 20 and knowing I'll never have a "normal" life like other young people. I want friends, I want a future, I want to drive, I want to work, I want an education. I'm tired of appointments I don't have energy for, I'm tired of my teeth rotting out of my head because disability assistance barely keeps me off the streets, not being able to meet basic human needs makes me feel so worthless. Foodbank food is always spoiled, my apartment is constantly broken and in a dangerous area. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of being treated like a useless child just because I'm also autistic. My "counselor'' can't help cause no one understands. Im tired of my "support worker" who forgets when we have appointments or cancels on me last minute. I'm tired of my mom asking when I'm coming back home, my family is SO abusive but I'm not self sufficient and she isn't shy about reminding me. The main reason I'm still alive is because I owe my ex $7k I will never be able to pay him back, he paid my rent when I was homeless and now I'm forever in his debt. He cares more about charging me interest than all the abundance of money he already has. If I'm dead it would just cause fights. I know if I end my life it will hurt others, so I promise myself I'll stick it out a little longer... I just suffer in silence, wondering why I exist at all. My whole existence has been trauma, pain, confusion, I'm just tired of hurting. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep &amp; hoping I'll magically pass away in my sleep. Why does life have to hurt SO much?
