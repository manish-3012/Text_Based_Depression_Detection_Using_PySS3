Does it really get betterI've been depressed longer than I can remember now but it's been so much worse the past few months... 

I never thought about suicide. I used to have the thinking of I just wish I was never born, or could dissappear and have everyone's memory erased. I know my family love me I do but somehow it doesnt matter.

I know killing myself will hurt my family but now I'm starting to think it might be worth it.. they'll suffer, be sad, it will hurt for a month really bad, but then they'll get better - go on to leave a better life without me around. Really it would be a favour, a few months of grief for a better life overall..

I don't know what to do anymore I'm so sick I can't remember the last time I was truly happy

It's so dumb my problems aren't worse than others - I hate my job in overweight blah blah blah.. so what? Lots.of people hate their job, lots of people struggle with the same struggles I do

Yet why do the same struggles make me want to not exist.. to kill myself?? Because I am weak? I mean I don't even know

I haven't even tried medication using drugs yet so maybe I should just go down that route first... make sure I suffer some more before I leave?

Or maybe I shouldn't leave and live with suffer for the rest of my.life because that's what I deserve?

I'm so confused. I hate my life I hate other people because I'm jealous I hate that the one person I've told about my depression is so good about it when I've told them to leave so many times... to the point where I'm considering just blocking her on Facebook because I don't deserve that..

I just want to close my eyes and cry and not wake up tomorrow
