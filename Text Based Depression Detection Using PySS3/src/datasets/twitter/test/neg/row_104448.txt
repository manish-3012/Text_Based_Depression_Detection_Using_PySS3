Iâ€™m 16- and Suicidal.Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression for four years now. Long story short Iâ€™ve been bullied, picked on, and was called names by females numerous times. While the hot guys were picking on me females were standing by laughing with them. I recall one time they compared me and a mentally retarded kid on whoâ€™d they rather date.

Iâ€™ve never gotten along with female, and hardly ever had conversations with one. The amount of hatred I have for them is worsening every day to the point I had to move to California away from my parents all because I canâ€™t have a female friend.

Iâ€™m that shy introverted kid in real life and my mindset is starting to shatter. All hope is slowly dying. The only solution to this is get plastic surgery or win the lottery and buy a house in Beverly Hills, as I envy the kids who party all day and live luxurious lifestyles. 

Females under 25 have everything against me, and I donâ€™t know why they hate me. Iâ€™m being forced into going to school this year and I donâ€™t think I can do it. Especially seeing all the jocks with females flicking to their existence. It comes to show the jocks have it right as theyâ€™re rich and already lost their virginity and superiorly genetically attractive in every aspect, even if they beat a woman, itâ€™d be considered alpha. 

Iâ€™m debating suicide, but I donâ€™t want to die. If one female befriended me this whole thing would be over. Iâ€™d be happy and everything would go back to normal. All these years of craving a female friend will finally have a conclusion. And all of what humanity denied me will have a happy solution, without me dying.
