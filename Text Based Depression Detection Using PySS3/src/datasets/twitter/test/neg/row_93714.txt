I've been having some thoughts and I keep coming back to wanting to hurt or try to kill myself out of spite.I'm in therapy and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I'm on an anti-anxiety med and it seems to working; it's not an end all, be all, fix all but it's helping. 


I feel hopeless and useless a lot of the time. Some people around (I'm being vague on purpose) me aren't necessarily encouraging and have made me feel like shit almost my whole life. I get this thought in my mind that if I killed or hurt myself and blamed them, then maybe they would finally understand they can't treat me anyway they want just because they feel it's okay. That I do matter and I need to be respected. I need to be spoken to as a person who is intelligent. If I killed myself it would be the final "Well, are you happy now!?!" 

I realize that this post may seem silly and I might come off as a whiny child but it's how I feel and my thoughts. 

I feel broken.
