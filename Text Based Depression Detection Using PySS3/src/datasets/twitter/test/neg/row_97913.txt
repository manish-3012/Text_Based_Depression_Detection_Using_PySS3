I feel like im in hellPrior to this year ,  i was just burning all my problems under optimism , motivation and hope . Then when the quarantine started back in march , my mental started to deteriorate. 

When your stuck inside the four walls of your bedroom for the first month or 2 its kinda fun to relax and chill , watch tv , play games etc but when you get bored of all of that , your brain starts to unearth all the pain and trauma u have put into the deepest depths of your subconscious... 

I realised that i am alone , i realised nobody loves me , i realised that all the relationships ive had with my exs were out of lust n not love , i realised all my friendships were never authentic , i realised if i died today the only person who would keep me connected to this world is my mother n she isnt doing too well.

I suffer from hidradenitis suppurativa , my body is in constant pain all over , theres no cure so everyday for the rest of my life i will have to put up with a burning sensation and has been this way since 2013 . sitting is painfull sometimes i cant even get out of bed , i wonder whats the point living this way . i cant even take off my shirt when i swim and when i wear certain clothes it stings. 

I dont have any emotions left , i want to cry to try and cope but my heart is cold and wont let me. I feel like i hit a brick wall every time i try , the thought of death has went from something that used to scare me into something that gives me inner peace , i dont know why but its something i look forward to.

i try to tell people how i feel but its always the same response ... it will get better im sure but i just turnt 18 and my pain has been there from aslong as i can remember.

i used to hold onto hope thinking the people that go through the most pain will find the most joy later on in life . I used to be optimistic thinking by doing good deeds my karma will be good but thats not how life works ... 

I dont really know why i typed this but i feel like in this life im like a red rose that has wilted , i feel like everyday on this earth is hell so death doesnt phase me. I dont want to live but i only keep going because of my mother . im not sure what to do
