I just don't have anything in me anymore.I have 30 years of life in me that has amounted to nothing. I have a boring dead end job, friends who have moved on with their lives and I never see them anymore, and I'm comically obsessed with a girl who doesn't live near me and barely wants anything to do with me.


I have no passion, absolutely zero drive to try something new, and I've been sitting around in my house for basically 7 years because I just can't be fucked to force something to happen.


I keep waiting for something to happen on its own, despite being aware it's a total pipe dream. Nothing is going to happen with me sitting at home all day. But I have no mental power to do anything else.


I have been trying to do the online dating thing to see if that would help motivate me to get me out of the house, and have gotten 0 responses in 48 attempted contacts. Clearly there's nothing about me worth being interested in.


I'm done. Any mental ability I may have had at one point is no longer existent. The depression has its grip firmly on me and it seems like all I ever do these days is consider ending it all. I break down sobbing randomly and theres nothing keeping me interested in living.


All of my willpower now days is being devoted to getting the courage to finally call it quits. I'm not sure why I'm posting this, its not going to change anything.
