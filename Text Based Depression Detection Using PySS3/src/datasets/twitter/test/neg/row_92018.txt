Can I just have one good reason not to commit suicide?Today my father asked me: "If you're never going to do anything with your life, why not just kill yourself?" Not in an emotional knee-jerk or angered sort of way. Very calm. Very matter-of-fact. This was something he had obviously given much advance thought before saying.

And it's true. I'm 22 years old and there is no future for me. I still live with my father, and I don't plan on going back to college because there are literally no fields that interest me. I fully expect to work in retail for the reset of my life. On my days off I just get drunk and browse Reddit or play video games, never anything more. I've never had a relationship and the only friends I have anymore are people I play video games with over Skype and have never and will never meet in real life.

I've been medicating for depression for almost five years now and I still haven't found a single drug that does anything positive. I've gone through a handful of therapists but they've all been really shitty experiences. I've never gotten the impression that they were doing anything more than trying to kill an hour of time so that I could leave and they could take my money.

I look at my life and I just don't see a single glimmer of hope in any of it. If ever there were an epitome of a worthless human being, it would be me. I have almost nothing to show for 22 years of life. That's so incredibly pathetic. Why continue with this sad excuse of an existence?
