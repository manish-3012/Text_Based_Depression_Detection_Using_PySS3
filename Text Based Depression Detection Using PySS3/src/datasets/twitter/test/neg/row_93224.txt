Wanting to be popular but also being afraid of apps like twitter, also wanting to *** my selfI am not trying to be edgy, but express my feelings, I see reddit as a journal of sorts, even though I encounter childish people on here who do not help me at all.

Twitter is hell and everyone is canceling everyone for many reasons, you are also open to attacks but like you can't be successful blogger and freelancer if you do not have at least a few social medias, If I ever write books fans would most likely get to know me and follow me and some youtubers say that in this age you can't write and not have a profile of some sort

I do not know if this want for fame is cause I was unpopular and uncool for being real and hating shallow things? I can't be sure, but I also hate fights, drama and conflicts, I just want to post what is in my mind and the fact that there would be always trolls and offended people annoys me, it is not like i won't start, i am just afraid it would ruin my future career. I won't post anything political or controvertial most likely but I have seen people get angry at people who just post cute animals on their profile, I know I can't please everyone but do not like to deal with people in general, this is why i want to become a hermit but can't be socially successful without connections and talking to people (which I hate since they reject me even though I am kind and loyal and honest and if they reject me then I will reject everyone and just iolate my self and maybe even k\*\* my self)

OOF

I know I am too much of a coward to do it but maybe it would grant me peace since most days I am mostly crying and even if i watch comedy, buy my self face masks, spend time with a pet I do not feel happier and just wallow more into self pity. What is keeping me sane is my books since the bullies and the popular people took out my only safe heaven (Anime, japanese language) and now i no longer feel happy and good watching, I used to feel proud when I met other anime fans but now it became so mainstream that even bad people watch it. I still love it, my accounts have anime avatar or a meme one, but do not like it when the most shallow people with no morals I know talk about roleplaying and anime when they have social lives and friends unlike and have resources that I can't have cause I was bullied and no one wants to be associtated with the bullied child and it is easier for me to be a victim and suffer as long as it is not someone else. I hate people. I want to \*\*\*
