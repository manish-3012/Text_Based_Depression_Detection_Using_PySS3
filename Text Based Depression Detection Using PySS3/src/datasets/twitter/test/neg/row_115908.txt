Not close to ending it right now. But I've been close, and for good reasons, at least the way I see it.17M, 18 next month.

I am usually tired most of the time, doesn't matter how much I sleep. I am also frequently ill, and regularly become very hot temperature-wise and feel very sick which I believe is connected to my diabetes. (type 1, hereditary)

My life feels so... long? not sure how to describe it. I am currently repeating year 12 (uk) as last year got fucked due to various illnesses and my diabetes deeply affecting my life, which led to me finding out that I had it (diagnosed march).

I have a few friends. Only two I can spend a lot of time with, all the others irritate me in some way after a certain amount of time. I am introverted, sure I'm going to get annoyed after some time socialising, but it can be near instant with some friends. for example one cheated on his gf last year and had no regrets or anything and treats all women as objects. I can't help but be jealous of how easily he can talk to and get with girls however. i like to think in his position i would be nicer to them but i can't really say as i'm not in his position.

most other people im just not on the same wavelength as, bare two people. one is a girl that i have had feelings for and has had feelings for me, she is with someone currently. we have fantastic chemistry, no joke, we almost were fwb but i pussied out. turned out we both had feelings for each other during that. as we found out later. we shared nudes. i wish i was the guy i am now back then (bare the suicidal thoughts).

the other person i get along well with is a guy, known him for almost 6 years now (wow, just realised that). we fought occasionally but that was long ago. he's a pretty cool guy so long as he isnt around this other friend of mine who makes him arrogant for some reason

family wise, i have no complaints beyond ym dad who really irritates me the way he eats and coughs and sniffs which sounds really weird. idk why but whenever he makes such noises it really pisses me off, like sets something off in my head. not sure what the deal is with that. but yeah no divorces or deaths except for my grandma and that was not sudden.

people tell me i am funny, i am nice, etc. mainly family or guy friends. i am shit at talking to girls. i go out of my way to avoid them. i hate myself for it but when it happens i am not the person who wants to talk to them.

sorry my grammar has fallen apart as this goes on. i type faster this way.

schoolwork has been good this year as i know most of what i am doing :)
however i have a complete lack of motivation. right now i should be doing product design. i was home ill and i have done almost nothing all day. similarly to socially avoiding girls i regret it after but am a different person during.

anyway, I don't have much going for me. if I manage to pull off good grades then maybe i go to uni. then i get crippling debt. I dont even know if id like computer science (degree i am currently looking at). even then i have no guarantee of a job. heck i wouldnt mind just working office hours and getting a decent paycheck, maybe accounting would be better.

anyway, eternal sleep sounds better than the everlasting boredom that is my everyday life. im not looking to escape anything in particular, just a shortcut past this period. before you say it gets better, i have been like this for 2 years. (began shortly after relationship with a different girl ended). no sign of ending yet, except for the occasional burst of happiness. it would not be difficult for me to end it too; a simple insulin overdose puts me to a coma then to sleep, apparently.

ah well. let me know what you think SW, im all ears. respect to those who listen here, i have been talking to a depressed friend with suicidal thoughts and it isnt easy.

thank you for reading.
