Iâ€™m trying againIâ€™m trying not to think about ending my life, it went away when I met my wife but it seems like at the age of 23 I donâ€™t live up to my parents eyes or to my own.

I want to be a police officer and I want to get my AA to get a better chance but I havenâ€™t done the test for the police before I could sent out my resume. Iâ€™m afraid that I wonâ€™t be good enough either, I fail few classes in college already, some could had easily pass but Iâ€™m tired. I just want to end it.

I seem to be a failure in my family eyes, my wife is the only reason I want to keep living but I know she can be better off without me holding her down. Iâ€™m trying, Iâ€™m really am.

I want to be a person that I know Iâ€™m happy to be but Iâ€™m tired. Maybe ending it can solve all of this, just maybe. Iâ€™m almost there to get my AA but Iâ€™m afraid of failing again, Iâ€™m afraid of failing the test for police and afraid of not getting accepted into any of the police departments.

I wish I was a better person but now Iâ€™m just wasting space on earth and everyone else around me. Maybe I should do end my life soon. Should I? Or keep trying?
