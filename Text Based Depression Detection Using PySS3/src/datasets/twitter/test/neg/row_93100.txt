Lost my best friend to suicide 2 days ago.He wasn't just my best friend. He was my brother. The guy who understood me and I understood him! He was like my soulmate. He was in a depression, but never really talked about it just in the last few weeks. He could never be truly himself. All his life he pretended to be something he is not just to fit in with everyone's expectations. He was homosexual. I was the only person who he told it to and from the beginning to end I accepted this and had no problems with it, but he was afraid of other's reaction and how it would affect his life. I don't know the exact reason why he did it. I think he had other problems going on too. I miss him so much and at the same time, I'm angry at him for such an action. Leaving me here in this horrible world of pain. 

The loss of him made me rethink everything. I feel lost. I feel suicidal. I may actually feel what he felt before he left. He was a good guy. The best I ever knew. He was good hearted. He was everything a decent man should be. Rest in peace to him. He lived 20 years.
