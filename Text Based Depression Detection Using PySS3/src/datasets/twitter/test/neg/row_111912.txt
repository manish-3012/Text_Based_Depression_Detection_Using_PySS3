Failure vs DeadWhy people consider a failed person who is in this shit because of his own shitty decisions and mental issues than a dead person? Death is clearly a simpler and more practical option atleast for me. Why shouldn't I just do it and save myself from the shitstorm of a life I have created for myself because I refused to play because of this injury I feel I should have played. The only thing I loved my game suddenly I didn't care about it. 

I'm a failure I don't see any hope in starting over again why being dead is not better?
