My family is messed up enough that I want to kill myself to just be done with them, but I'm afraid what will happen to my younger sibling if that happensThe pure fuckton of gaslighting, abuse and unpredictability is just too damn much for me to handle, every day I have to guess weather or not they are gonna threaten each other, or pretend like it never happened and call me toxic, they both constantly feel the need to victimize themselves and I just want to leave and cut them out, ending it would just be such a simple easy solution, I've tried contacting other family members for support and they just try to pretend my parents don't exist while offering meaningless encouragement, I'm afraid to confide in my friends since I don't want them to worry about me when they all have so much stuff going on in their own lives

Above all else I'm scared what would happen to my sibling if I ended it all, they are young, they wouldn't be able to handle that, he deserves better than those two, he's afraid/in denial of everything related to our family and I'm horrified my suicide would ruin his life

I'm sorry for how rambly this was, I just want to write down my thoughts, I've already tried to kill myself twice in the past and I just need somewhere to write this to try and calm myself down

PS thank you for listening/reading/existing
