I know what I think about isn't normalAs long as I can remember iv had...thoughts. Thoughts of killing myself and others. I had thoughts of like how id do it and get away with it. Or if i didn't how i would kill myself also. I know this isn't normal at all. But its not something I can just talk to my parents about I mean really, who wants their kid to say "mom/dad im a suicidal person who thinks about killing others."

To be honest, I don't know if I would ever actually act on the thoughts. But still its more then mere fading ideas, I think about it. Sometimes for quite a while before I stop thinking about it.
