Acted Happy TodayActed happy in front of everyone today so I can finally do it tomorrow. I don't necessarily want to die, but I don't feel like I have an other option at this point. I haven't been able to access any of my meds for the past few weeks and I just feel like this is it for me. I have schizophrenia, ptsd, and ocd and the agony will never stop unless I finally do this. I am writing one letter and that is to the love of my life. I don't want to hurt him too badly :/
