I'm thinking of taking myself to an abandoned forest and burning myself alive so my family/the police can't ever find my remainsThe title. Obligatory alt. I fucking hate myself. I'm not diagnosed with any mental illness but I sure as hell know I'm a high functioning sociopath. I'm also under 18. I fucking hate my family, me and my brother got into an argument and I was so close to killing him with a long sharp knife. And if that had happened, I would've stabbed myself. Nobody understands because nobody is like me. Please don't give me the usual "don't do it, we love you and we're here for you" because I've seen it enough and explained myself enough times to people - different types, and they can't comprehend what I feel. I guess I deserve it. But what I did not deserve is to be born into such a toxic, dysfunctional family and be treated like a piece of shit. That's probably why my 13 (now 14) year old sister tried to run away. We're tired of it. I don't know anymore because everyday suicidal and homicidal thoughts come into my brain and it doesn't scare me anymore. I hope I'm being irrational like I always am, but I'm just tired of it all. I deserve better than this and this is not better.
