I am lost...I feel so lonely, I still live at my parents and they are separated. Thing is they are never home and if they are all they do is scream at me for not cleaning up, even if it's not my mess.

I just don't have the energy to clean, work, go to college or do anything for that matter. I play games all day because I can actually talk to people and be somewhat heard. Even this is starting to wear me out though.

I don't have any real life friends, all of them left me behind when they went to uni. So now I sit in my room, mom/dad walks in to scream at me. I feel like shit and lash out to my gamerfriends and they don't want to talk to me anymore either.

I dont know what to do. My parents want me to go to college or find a job, but my depression is just dragging me down and killing me on the inside. I want to end it all. But I know I will hurt the one person on the opposite end of the world that still talks to me. But the more I get screamed at by the people I used to love, the more I want to end it all.

-Also I'm 21 years old, and not from an English speaking country so if I made any grammar/wording mistakes I blame my phone...
