There was this girl I saved from suicide onceI need to get this off my chest because lately I've been thinking of her a lot.

So two years ago I was on a social app \(I honestly don't remember what it was called\) and there was a post in one of the feeds about depression from a person who wanted to talk. I was depressed and really bad off and so I dm'd them and it was this girl named Becca, who had tried to kill herself the night before and was sitting in the hospital.

Long story short, our lives were and for me at least still is shit. 

She went home and we talked for a few days until she tried to kill herself again but I convinced her to call 911 and I ended up saving her life. The hospital nurses even took a selfie with her and thanked me via the messages for saving her. 

Eventually we stopped talking because, you know, life and stuff.

I've been thinking about whether or not she's doing okay for a few weeks because now I'm in a very dark place again and I'm trying to light a candle to see but it's so hard while I'm stuck down here in the dumps.

I want to kill myself and there's nothing stopping me anymore because all of the doors keep closing.

I now know fully what she felt like when she tried to do it herself, too.

All I want is peace and to take the pain away from myself and the world around me.
