I wish i could cut so i could have scars so that people would understand what a mess i am.I keep going into the E.R. with anxiety attacks and twice for suicide watch. I'm in constant depression. i have no running water, nothing to drink, bedroom window is broken, barely any food, roaches everwhere, piles of trash i cant clean because i just dont have the energy, and i want to go back into the psych ward soon so my birthday will have clean place to sleep good food and delicious snacks but im afraid because every time ambulances come out here they treat me like it's a whambulance and im a whiner. So unless i can bring myself to leave wounds they'll just treat me like i'm a fuckin joke. but i'm afraid of pain.
