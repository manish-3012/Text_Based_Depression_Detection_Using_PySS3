Running out of steamI first tried to kill myself in 2012.  Got a bipolar diagnosis and some intensive treatment to stabilize and move on.  We're three years later and I had enough.  I mutilated myself in a safe way that implied an incompetent suicide attempt and got myself hospitalized.  

I'm lucky, I have a good team and had every option I could hope for.  I've been in tons of therapy, I have the doctor's notes to support the fact that I share, I contribute, and I can say the right things.  I've been in a few psychiatrists' care for three years, I take my meds as prescribed and I'm honest about my fears and concerns.  I was self-medicating with alcohol for a long time but I've had long periods of sobriety in the past and I'm currently 38 days sober.  

I hate myself and I hate the world.  If I talk openly with my family it hurts them, especially my mother who has now started taking xanax in response to the pressures my situation has put on them.  Bottling stuff up isn't hard but I'm trying everything.  If I don't share with my family, I get worse, if I do, we all get worse.

What's my next step?  Surely three years is enough waiting and complying for me to expect (deserve) results.  I'm responsible, I own a house, I have a career, I have a social life, and none of it matters to me.  I did all this shit because I was assured that it was part of the solution. 

So, what's the last piece?  What am I missing?  All I feel when the distractions fall away is hate and anger.  I've been so mad for so long, I have little emotional triggers that I've been able to setup to make it productive.  Is it a spiritual thing?
