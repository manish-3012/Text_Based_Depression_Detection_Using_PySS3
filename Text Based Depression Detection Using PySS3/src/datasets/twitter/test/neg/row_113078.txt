I was forced to do it...I'm in bathroom right now, I just slit my wrist but I don't think it'll kill me. I have a knife just incase.

My grandma didn't even care she never asked if I was okay. She comes into my room and tells me she is putting me in a psyc ward i didn't want that. I wanted someone to show that they cared for me. But no one does. Now she forced me to kill myself. It's only a matter of time now....

Edit: I am okay, I fucked my wrists up pretty bad. They promised not to send me to a psych ward as long as I see a therapist and take anti-depressents.
