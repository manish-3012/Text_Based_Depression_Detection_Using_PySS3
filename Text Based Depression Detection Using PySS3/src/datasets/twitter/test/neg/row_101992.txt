It's so fucking easy to tell people that things will get better and that their dark thoughts will eventually pass until you find yourself feeling a similar way.I've been extremely depressed and suicidal before and it did eventually get better thankfully. But now im back to my suicidal ideations again. I want to kill myself but I dont want to die. I just want things to be easier for me but everyone will just say life isn't easy and that I should just suck it up. So much fucking suffering in the world. Some worse than others but it still fucking sucks. I hate disappointing my parents. Knowing they suffered and sacrificed so much to bring me into this world and into a better country only for me to want to take myself out. I cant deal with the thought of disappointing them. Knowing that I'm stupid and an utter failure. That I'm not perfect even though I try my best to exceed their expectations. I won awards and got into a great college. Please can it always be that way? I just really really want to pass my driving test. I dont want my dad to yell at me again. I dont want to be called stupid and hopeless. Im sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. I can deal with failure but I cant deal with your judgment of me as a result of my failures. Im so so sorry so please stop berating me.
