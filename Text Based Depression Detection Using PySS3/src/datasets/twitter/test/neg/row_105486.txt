What keeps you going?I've lived with the thought of wanting to die for the last 10 years of my life, and yet I'm still here. My circumstances haven't changed, in fact, I think they've become worse. I wonder to myself how long I will continue before I reach that tipping point. Something that will give me the courage to end it all. I almost feel like I'm setting myself up for it. I've cut everyone out of my life. I'm working a dead-end job and waste every day online, trying to distract myself.

It's ironically perplexing, to tell the truth. I've wanted to die for so long but never carried through with it. Fuck my survival instincts.

Has anyone else here lived with suicidal thoughts most of their life, and why are you still holding on?
