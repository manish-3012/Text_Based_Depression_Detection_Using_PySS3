I cant believe I have gotten to this point. But now that I'm here I don't want to go backIts going to happen. Soon. If not this week defiantly by the end of the month. I even know how I am going to do it. I've thought it through for the past few weeks if not months. It will be clean and simple and my family will have an easy way of finding out. 
It's honestly crazy to see the words as I'm typing them. Like living a dream that you know you have had before. I've been here for a while now. Stuck in this place of square wheels and uphill climbs. The mind is amazingly complicated for something that you have known your entire life.
I suppose the worst part is that I don't have a sad story. I come from a perfectly normal loving family. Nothing about my childhood would indicate that I would take my life a few months short of my 24th birthday. My parents love me. My sisters love me. I know my friends love me. But I don't love me. Believe me I've tried. But at some point you hit a wall and its okay to not want to climb that wall. Fuck that wall. I have a way out.
This weekend was great. My sister had her engagement party and my nephew got baptized. I'm not religious in any way but its nice to get the family together one last time I suppose. I don't have a problem with it. But the whole weekend I just felt like a fish out of water. I have not felt comfortable in my own skin in years and I'm tired of it. All I hear is "your brother is so smart!" and "Your brother is so handsome he has really grown up!" "What a great guy!" 
Fuck that and fuck you. You have no what I'm going through. All you care about is is he minding his p's and q's and does he look acceptable. You don't care about the real me. If you did you would see that I've been screaming in a glass box for the past few years only to have the echos scream right back. 
I've been on this subreddit before. I'll readily admit many of you are way stronger that I am or ever will be. I admire you for that. I admire you for living though a shit storm and making YOUR choice about YOUR life. I'm about to do the same for me.
There is a road in the back roads by my house that I know. A buddy of mine and me would always go back there to smoke a bowl. One of the places that's hiding in plain sight. I'm going to go there one night, wrap my head in a blanket, and shoot myself in the head. 
I want and open casket funeral because my mom would like that. Keep it simple though. No frills. Bury me someplace with a view that's quite. I'd like that.
I suppose what I will miss the most is threefold 
1. Not seeing my sister walk down the isle
2. Not seeing my nephews anymore
3. Not graduating college. I wish I finished earlier
My heart is pounding as I'm writing this because I know it is real. These are real thoughts, real emotions, real attitudes that I cant fake anymore. 
There are over 7 billion people on this planet. Sure some will miss me but for how long? A few months? Years? Decades? Even in that case I'm going to get forgotten anyway so why not go out on my own terms. I want to be deleted so I'm going to delete myself. Its my right and my option. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. This will get buried in a pile and no one will ever be the wiser to poor old me. And that's fine. A lot of deeds go unnoticed. If you have gotten this far than thank you. You have a rare look into a suicidal persons last thoughts. You now know that it could be anyone. Even the guy you thought would never be so rash and bold. But its real.
