sorry for writing here im just so tiredi had a plan to kill myself for years now but each time i try it i wuss out. technically its probably good but im just so tired.  im 23 and i still live under my familys roof, i have no future and i never attempt anything good, and everyone just throws all the household tasks and taking care of family members on me. i just got dropped news that my parents are planning to go somewhere over christmas and planning to leave me to take care of my grandmother and im so ungrateful but god im just so tired. i wish i had even a sliver of sympathy from these people, but i cant even say that cause im jobless and continue to sit on my ass living here for free!!! even when i do ask for help i get acknowledged and then completed forgotten about. i wish i wasnt even born right now i honestly wish i was gone i cant see anything happening for me in the future. im so so sorry for writing in here i dont know where to go talk anymore cause i dont want to bother anyone
