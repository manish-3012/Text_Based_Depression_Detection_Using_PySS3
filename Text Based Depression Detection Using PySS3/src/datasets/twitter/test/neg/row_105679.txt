Final daysLong story short, my life isnâ€™t the same, I canâ€™t have a normal social life, canâ€™t trust anyone, rarely feel emotions. I donâ€™t really know how or when, but it seems like I canâ€™t be normal again.
Iâ€™m living in the woods, all by myself and my dogs. Donâ€™t have much contact with friends and family for a feel years, life doesnâ€™t seem to offer me much. Just wanted to chat for a little before itâ€™s all over.
