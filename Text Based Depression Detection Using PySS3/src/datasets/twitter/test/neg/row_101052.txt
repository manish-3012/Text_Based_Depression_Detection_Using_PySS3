ventingi dont expect anyone to care to read this but i kinda just need to vent right now. i went through a really bad night last week and idk if it got a little better after that, or if im just so busy with studying for finals, but like midday through today i just got hit with a bunch of thoughts about how my life doesnt matter at all and once again, im not excited about anything in my life. i dont have a purpose and im a failure. i just dont see a point in continuing life when its going to keep hurting this bad. i just cant do it anymore but i also dont have a means to carry out killing myself. not until next year anyways but it just hurts to think about having to endure another half a year of being forced to continue living. this probably didnt make sense but i just needed to write it out. i just dont want anything to do with life anymore
