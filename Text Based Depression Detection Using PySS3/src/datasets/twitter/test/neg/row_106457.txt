I seem to have 3 options: suicide, misery, heartbreak.Suicide to end it all?  Misery is for living in the Louisiana vicinity (near my parents whom I love dearly - but the entire area of the Country here is a boring shithole) and heartbreak (living in WA state where I LOVE the land - but SO far from family)

I'd imagine a counselor would tell me to move to WA state where I love it - to live MY life.  Any help? âœŒï¸ï¸
