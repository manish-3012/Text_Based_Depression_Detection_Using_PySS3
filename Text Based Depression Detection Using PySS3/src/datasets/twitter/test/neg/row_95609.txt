I want to die but Iâ€™m scared of the thoughtHey. I absolutely despise myself, I canâ€™t think of one thing I like myself. I hate my lopsided smile I hate how fat I look I hate how Iâ€™m not good enough for anyone. I just had a fight with my parents 5 minutes ago and I was called an embarrassment and a disappointment and that the dreams they had for me are completely shattered. I hate that I let them down and that Iâ€™m not a good enough kid for them, but the thing that I hate the most is that I donâ€™t really care. I guess what really started this was how unmotivated I am in everything. Iâ€™m failing all my classes and I just lay in bed all day eating and sleeping. I dont even talk to my friends anymore, not even my best friend of 7 years. I just want everyone to leave me alone, I want to be by myself and not think about anything at all. Iâ€™m really scared about how my future is going to be, or if Iâ€™m even going to have a future but at the same time I donâ€™t care what happens. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before when I was 10 by hanging myself in the basement, but I stopped myself because I was scared of what was going to become of me. Right now Iâ€™m laying in bed just thinking about all the ways I could die right now, but Iâ€™m too scared to act on it. Thereâ€™s still some things I want to do but I know I wonâ€™t get to them at the the pace Iâ€™m going at right now. So many people have tried to help me but I just donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care about anything. I donâ€™t care about myself. I just want to die.
