I'm progressingI was at the stage where I began to wonder if I'd just rather have never existed, then I moved to the stage where I began to wonder if stoping it all is a wonderful move, but now I'm at the plan making stage. I've decided who gets what amongst my things, how it is to be devised. Now I'm at the point where I'd like to write it down but if it gets found id be caught before I finish. I have no privacy and my computer is 'mostly' monitored. I don't know how to move forward but I'm getting there.
