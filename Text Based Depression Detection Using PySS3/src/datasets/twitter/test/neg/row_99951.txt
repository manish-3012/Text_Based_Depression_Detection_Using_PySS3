I guess Iâ€™m in a rough patch lately. Whatâ€™s one good reason you like to hold onto so that you donâ€™t end it all?Iâ€™m tired of thinking to myself how much my friends and family would miss me and mourn if I died. It feels weirdly superficial, and, yeahâ€”any reason not to die is probably a good one (since it keeps you alive, but I think I need something freshâ€”something else.
