A Week to Decide.So, in a week, I'm making the decision. To live, or to die. I feel left out, or excluded from pretty much anything I do, be it online, or off. I would have called a suicide hotline by now, but to be honest, I'm scared of doing that. Pretty much my only escape from this personal hell is Team Fortress 2. If it wasn't for that, I most likely wouldn't be typing this. Anyways thanks for reading. I'll let you know my decision in due time.
