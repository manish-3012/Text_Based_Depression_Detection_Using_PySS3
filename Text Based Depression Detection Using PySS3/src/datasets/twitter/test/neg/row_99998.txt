Is it normalIs it normally that I've stopped taking my antidepressants just to make myself suffer till I kill myself? The urge to kill myself gets stronger every day and I don't know any other way to make it painless aside from overdosing... I want it to work for once and not have to make it the 17th attempt... Its not that far from being that many attempts
