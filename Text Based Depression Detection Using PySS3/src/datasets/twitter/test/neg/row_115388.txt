i feel like my lifeâ€™s falling apartthings arenâ€™t good. thereâ€™s a good chance i have bipolar disorder, if i do, iâ€™ll be pumped with meds. i was going to off myself on monday afternoon, but couldnâ€™t because my parents were home. i was also going to off myself wednesday but ended up self harming instead. i feel so alone although my s/o is constantly around. i feel bad for them though. they donâ€™t deserve to deal with this. i think the only thing keeping me from doing it at this point is my s/o and my gecko. newly purchased, btw. super cute. four months old. anyways, iâ€™m not sure what i can do. iâ€™m going to therapy soon. but soon may not be soon enough.
