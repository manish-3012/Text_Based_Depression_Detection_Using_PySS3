Feeling so hopeless and lostI'm so tired of being completely hopeless and nothing to look forward to. I have no friends at all, never been in a real relationship and just have absolutely nothing to look forward to. I honestly have days when I'm off from work that I literally don't speak a word to another human. Getting up everyday is getting harder and just have no motivation to push forward. I have a very good paying job, nice house and car which only makes me feel more like shit because I know I could have it so much worse financially. And when coworkers tell me it must be nice to be me I want to fucking scream. I always feel like something must be really wrong with me. I've tried changing myself and my life never improves. Even tried online dating to meet people and no one showed any interest in me. I just struggle with what the point of life is and why I should keep getting up.
