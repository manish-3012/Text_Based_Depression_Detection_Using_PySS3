I am going to kill myself in a shooting range.A friend of mine is a gun enthusiast and had invited me to go to a shooting range. He noticed I am sad but thinks that I just need something fun to lift me up.
They're quite wary of lunatics and to be accept at this shooting range I have to show I am mentally able to do so. If I can pull this off I am gonna try to enjoy myself and just be entertained, but if this, just like anything else is just dull and boring af I am going to blow my brains out.
I am sorry mom, but I am the one who has to live as me.
