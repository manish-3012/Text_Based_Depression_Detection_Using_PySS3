I can't forgive myself for what I did, even though I was drunk and don't remember itthis last weekend some friends and I went to a square to talk and have some drinks. i took my dad's car and i picked everyone up.

i met new people there, they were friends of my friends

so i started drinking, and i got to a point that i don't remember what happened

the next day i went to my friends to ask what happened

turns out i let an unlicensed minor (friend of my friends) drive my dad's car, and he completely destroyed the car's tire

and in this time i don't remember what happened, i kept hitting on my friend, asking to kiss him and stuff like that, and he didn't like that because he has some traumas related to stuff like that (and he only told me about those traumas because he really trusted me as a friend), but now i ruined my friendship and he threatened to file a police report if i tried to talk to him again

ever since it happened i can't stop thinking about it, how irresponsible i was by drinking and taking a car, and i lost my friend, whom i had lots of plans with (we had a band and we were rehearsing a lot) and now i have destroyed it all.

if i was sober i would never do any of that

i'm gonna pay for the repairs on my dad's car (it got really expensive for me) and i swore an oath to never drink ever again.

my anxiety and depression appear to have increased and i don't know what to do to fix my situation

i never thought so much of suicide like i did in these past few days, actually on monday i almost did it, but i thought about my family and they would suffer a lot
