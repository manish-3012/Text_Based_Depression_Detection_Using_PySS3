30/male. Contemplating suicide a lot recently. All I have done all my life is work. And I feel incredibly alone. I have grown to have a lot of social anxiety. I donâ€™t know how to get out of it.I have stopped taking care of myself and I am starting to think about ending my life.  Iâ€™m sure other people have had it rough. But I feel like a 30 y.o. Loser. There isnâ€™t actually anything wrong with me. But I have 0 social life. 

No relationships. No friendships. Just pure isolation.
