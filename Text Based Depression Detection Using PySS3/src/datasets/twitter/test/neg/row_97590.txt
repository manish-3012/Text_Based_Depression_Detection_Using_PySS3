I am a selfish person who deserves to die.I was molested at a young age.  I don't remember the right details, I just remember it happening.  I have always remembered some of it, and been scared in specific ways, I was too young to know who it was.  It was in a car, at least once.  Another time I remember the carpet.

When I was in 5th grade I felt like I wanted help but I couldn't tell anyone I was so deeply ashamed of it.  I was cutting myself and wouldn't shower or sleep when possible (so I was dirty and would fall asleep in clas because I couldn't sleep at night because I was afraid of someone coming into my room and doing stuff to me) and other stuff, and I had a panic attack and they took me to the hospital, and I felt like they wanted me to tell them something, so I said my grandma was yelling at me and that she bit me, and that she hit me.  It was a lie.

I was too ashamed to see her or tell the truth and so I avoided her, and didn't see her for 6 years.  In 6th grade I had the opportunity to tell the truth and I tried to fill a form out and say I got sexually abused but not verbally or physically abused to like.  Tell the truth, and then my mom saw it so I said I got confused and lied again because I couldn't say it, to her, just how she looked at me and she was so sad.  I lied again I knew it was wrong.

This is the worst thing I ever did.  My grandma was always there for me and kind and I lied about her.  6 years later we started talking again and I started seeing her, and we hang out a lot.  I was telling her I no longer wanted to talk to my dad for some reasons and she said that she still doesn't understand why they (my parents) didn't let her see me for 6 years, and why she couldn't come to my high school graduation when she was so proud of me.  I got out of the car and came up to my apartment and just broke down crying.

It is the worst thing I ever did.  I can't tell her.  She doesn't know I got molested, I can't say it to her.  I am too afraid to apologize because she will know it was me who lied, and I am so sure she will not forgive me.  It keeps playing through my head that she will tell me to get out of her car, and drive off, and never speak to me again.  And I would deserve it, completely I would, but she is so important to me.

I feel so unspeakably guilty.  I am not even a good enough person to tell her what I did and accept however she feels about it.  She did so much for me growing up and that is how I repaid her.  I am disgusting.

I don't deserve to be alive.
