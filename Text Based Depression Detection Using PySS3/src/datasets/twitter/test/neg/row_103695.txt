I don't know what to doI'm agoraphobic. I am reliant on my father for financial support. He is a narcissist. He was actually diagnosed as such by a psychiatrist during divorce proceedings. He tried to spn it as "You can't love someone else until you love yourself." But any sane person knows that's not what narcissism is. 

Anytime I get tired of being his whipping bitch we fight. And I always have plenty of ammo since he treats me like some trophy to be trotted out and lied about anytime he wants sympathy. Because just having an agoraphobic child isn't enough sympathy points for him. I have to be made out to be violent and abusing prescription drugs (even though I despise drugs). 

I'm tired of it. I can't take it anymore. I can't take being lied about all the time. I can't take being bullied into things I don't want to do (he guilted me into selling drugs, because I'm a burden without a job), bullied out of doing things I want to do (I can't clean right; I seriously don't know how to vacuum according to him!), being scared away from things that could make me more self-reliant (I can't drive, because if he 'teaches' me he intentionally overreacts until I almost crash). 

I don't have anywhere to go though. I don't want to burden anyone else so I'm too scared to ask the few people I know who have room for me. I just want it all to end.
