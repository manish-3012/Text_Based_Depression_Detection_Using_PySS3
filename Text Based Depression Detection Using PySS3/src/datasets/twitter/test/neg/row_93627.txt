Why do I even bother livingI see no reason to stay alive, really. I have mental illnesses (depression and anxiety) that my boyfriend and family struggle to understand and cope with, Iâ€™m having a terrible time trying to find some way I can contribute to society, I have no drivers license, I have acne in my 20s, and I just canâ€™t seem to do anything the right way. I constantly am reminded that I am failing my family, friends, professors, etc. I wish I could just kill myself already, but I know that would hurt people close to me so now I just carry around this guilt of wishing for the sweet release of death.
