Need helpHey SW, let me tell you why i want to blow my brains out.
My name is Joseph, i have 2 sisters, a mother and a father.
My 2 sisters are doctors, i'm 18 years old.
Momma didn't raise no fool, she just raised a perfectionist child who's incapable of conversating with other people, has no girlfriend, no friends, zero confidence and self esteem, was bullied, has social anxiety, depression and a huge failure and under achiever. 
I also look terrible because i'm fat and i'm fat because nothing really matters to me. 
My parents have never supported me in any way and neither were my sisters, they never gave me any value whatsoever, i'm insecure and anxious all the time, my social anxiety makes everything hard for me and everyday i wonder why i get up at all. 
Nothing really has any value to me anymore, my parents only gave me love when i got good grades, so i did my best to get excellent grades, no one ever understood me, i have a test that's boring me to shits that's coming up and i can't be less motivated to study for it
I may end up getting something like a 70 but fuck me if i know if it's good or bad, my parents say everything below 100% is bad and so do my sisters, i have lost all frames of reference on any subject matter.
I don't know if anything is true or not unless i observe it.
I have never been loved, i've been bullied, picked on and beat down as a kid for being too nice, then was screamed at at home for getting beaten up.
I had this absolute goddess of a girl accept to be my girlfriend and for 2 years she stayed with me until the last 3 months of our relationship i got some good depression and couldn't live properly.
I dumped her because i felt like i was wasting her time
She was always too busy with her academic and school work.
I hate everything in life, i have never seen good in my life, no one has ever loved me, and my parents won't let me buy a puppy or a new guitar which is my one true talent
They want me to waste my life studying and "achieving" academically when we all die at the end
I don't want to work hard, i don't want to waste my youth under a fluorescent light studying.
All of my family hate me because i'm different than all of them, my uncles aunts and grandparents despise me, my parents are dicks to me and so are my sisters, i have no friends either, i don't have any pets or even a plant.
None of my acquaintances talk to me because i'm always gloomy and down, everyone else in highschool has a better life than me,
And no it doesn't get better, social anxiety, depression and an unsupportive family who will never ever love you or give you respect unless you waste your life away DON'T GET BETTER.
I don't want to live.
I had to get all of that out, and yes i know the solution of "well instead of committing suicide just do whatever you want and it'll all be well"
 That's massively oversimplifying it because my mental disorders/traits make everything so fucking hard and no i haven't tried to smoke weed because i get 2 years in jail for it here.
Basically i'm a smart lonely underachieving depressed nihlistic social anxiety having sad person who was never really appreciated for who they were and was bullied all the time
I guess this was just venting but i've never really opened up to someone like that, i guess oscar wilde was right.
Comment why i shouldn't blow my brains out .
Also sorry for my lack of punctuation, it's 1AM and i'm tired.
