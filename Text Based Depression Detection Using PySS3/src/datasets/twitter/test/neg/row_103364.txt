Thinking about dying againHaha whaddup I have no friends, no family, nobody to talk to at all in my life about anything. Completely alone

I just dropped out of a program in school and I don't even fucking know where my life is going after this. I'm going to community college cuz I'm a huge loser and my grades were shit in high-school and they probably will be again in cc and I'll never be successful or be what I want to be. I mean shit I'm even in bed right now putting off my work and responsibilities. 

I'm so alone and hopeless and I felt really great this last week but that high is long gone today and I just wanna die again

I hate myself :)
