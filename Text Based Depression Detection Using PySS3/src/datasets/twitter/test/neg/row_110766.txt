I need helpI'm 15 and thinking about suicide, as you can probably tell. As of right now I live with my mother in South Texas and I go to visit my father and stepmother in Washington in the summers. I have no friends at my school, and not a day goes by without people bullying me because of my interests, shyness, or appearance. Because of this I have lost all motivation, and thus my grades started to drop, which made my parents angry, specifically my dad. He can't seem to understand that I'm depressed and lost any and all motivation, and hates the fact that I spend so much time on my computer. He doesn't understand that's how I cope with all of it, when I'm focused on gaming or YouTube, or whatever, I'm not thinking about suicide. But the problem is, I'm losing interest. My mom sends me to therapy but I'm so fucking shy and I don't want anyone to know how bad it is because I don't want people pitying me so I put on a mask and tell everyone 'It's fine', 'I'm fine.'. I know I should be afraid of killing myself, but I'm not, and that's what I'm afraid of.
