had 3rd suicide attempt and after that had been angry for no reasonhello, i'm new on this subreddit. i don't know if it's a good idea to post here about my problems but i'll try
so, i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder abouuut i guess two weeks ago. since then the thought that my whole existence, the way i act, and simply myself is a disease terrorized me. got into abusing all kinds of drugs for 6 days straight (weed, alcohol, dxm, valium, gabapentin)
after all that mess a girl that understood me and was always by my side and very close to me got into some trouble with her parents. her father pushed me extremely hard out of her house and he pushed her back in the house. and in that moment i thought that i was going to lose her, i cried for like a hour straight went home and cut myself so deep i almost hit a vein. i lost a lot of blood, after that incident i always seem to be angry and irritable for no fucking aparent reason and it's extremely frustrating it makes me scream at my parents and act rude with my friends i seriously dont know what to do and i don't know if it has any corelation with the fact that i tried to killed myself ugh please help
