I wont make it through 2016.Iâ€™ve reached a point now where suicide is my last and final option. But I fear death, so I've fallen into an almost psychotic loop where I convince myself that "Iâ€™ll be fineâ€, â€œI feel betterâ€, and â€œitâ€™s all in my headâ€; until some small aspect of my reality jerks me back into these cold final moments of my life. Thinking back, I realize that I was destined to die this way. Days became years of depression and isolation, effectively deepening my psychosis; I was never supposed to survive this long. If not for a compassionate group of friends who tried everything they could, despite themselves, to show me a happier day, I would be in absolute misery. Because of them I am reaching some sort of peace with my fate. Iâ€™m terrified still, of the pain and suffering that could come from a botched suicide attempt. I fear the unknown and donâ€™t want to die alone in some room. I wish someone could be there with me. 

Iâ€™m 24 years old and its my time to die. I was born to suffer internally, imperceptibly, until the day that my brain literally kills itself. Today.

"Would you experience a moment of pain to reach an eternal bliss?"
