I should kill myself tonight I have too many issues and I can't take it anymoreI feel that im hideous as a ogre, because im constantly getting bullied about my flaws such as my flat butt, braces, glasses, my skin conditions all over my body, my hefty weight,my huge stomach, my ugly nose, acne scars, etc.. As a result, I have Body Dismorphic Disorder I suffer over every flaw because I can't fix them for example I have a pancake butt I've tried to exercise but it doesn't work and I dont have the money to fix it. Another of the many issues I have is my parents are too overprotective and say ridiculous things such as "Saying your is an offense to God", "Your being ridiculous", "Killing yourself is an instant ticket to hell", "If your gay I won't let you live in this apartment", and the overprotective things they do is they don't let me go out by myself, or let me take the bus (The one with the MetroCard), or let me walk home afterschool, they even put restrictions on my iPhone (The only reason I got here is by using Incognito Mode on my computer). They also always check the few texts that I get, they don't let me wear a bikini because of "Perverts" and question me about every single person I call, I get frustrated how they always are on top of everything I do, even drinking water in the morning, and putting way laundry which is absurd, and when I try to talk to them about my anger problems they get mad, and say "I need therapy but they have to be there with me." In addition, I'm constantly annoyed by my mom saying stupid crap to me, such as "You can't watch that without me" "You can't buy that it's too short", and so many other things, and I can't shut that out because since we aren't in the best financial situation with live in a studio apartment, and can't afford summer vacations. Furthermore, moving on to the next issue is school, it's too difficult for me to keep up especially math I try hard to study it but I just don't get it it's too hard and complicated, and my school gives tremendous homeworks and tests on a daily basis, which means im always stressed out (Which my parents can't seem to understand), and it's hard making friends because everyone has cliques so im always a third wheeler since im not popular. In addition, since I have too many issues im just going to talk about one more which is talent, I feel that im not talented at all I can't sing well, act well,  do makeup well, dance well, draw/paint well, and I can't play sports at all (Which im also bullied for) etc... Many people I know have natural talents which makes me jealous because I actually try hard to be good at something and it fails. Im just tired of all my issues I have to deal on a daily basis if I mentioned all of them it would legit take 2 hours to read them all, and I have support from nobody, therefore im planning to kill myself tonight to end of all this and to rest in peace, since I never find peace living.
