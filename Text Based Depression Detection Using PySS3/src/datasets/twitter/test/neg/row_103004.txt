Me and himHey guys, I need help, my boyfriend (yes, we're gay) is having some  trouble, he sometimes gets randomly sad and sometimes he thinks about suicide. Today he wasn't feeling well and he wanted a bit of private time so I gave him it, and I also checked on him after hour but he didn't respond, now (after 2 more hours) he responded that he don't want to talk to anyone, I asked what happened and he said we will tell me the other time, I asked him to text me in the morning so I'll be sure that he is ok, I also reminded him that I love him and I'll be available for next hour, and I also mentioned that if you will feel really bad or had "those thought"/ will to do it call 911, can you guys help us, I'm really open for talking with people who could help, btw he is aware that he has a depression but he doesn't want to talk with his parents about it, just because he can't get this topic though his mouth. Finally is there any way I could inform 911 in Canada if things get really bad while being in Europe ??
