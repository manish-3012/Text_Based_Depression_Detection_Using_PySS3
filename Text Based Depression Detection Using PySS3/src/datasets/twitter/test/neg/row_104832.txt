people who don't understand mental illness shouldn't try to give advice.and other people can't really. seem. to. understand. how mental illness works at all. they give others the most plain and unwanted advice, instead of helping them they just say whatever the hell they think is helpful. like
 "it gETs bEttER" 
how about you tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do and help me? you are supposed to help me not give a 4th grade style motivational speech. sometimes it's very rude and unnecessary. my fucking "friend" did that, i insulted her and blocked her. no one deserves to be treated the way i was. she said 
"the way you are acting during these times is ridiculous" 
like your fucking excuses are ridiculous you expired, cum-filled mayonnaise jar. i hope i never meet her again anytime.
 I'm not. depressed. because. of covid. eat. a dick.
