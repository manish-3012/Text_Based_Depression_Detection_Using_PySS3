suicide bereavement resources i can leave behind for those who i will hurt?itâ€™s no longer an â€œifâ€, itâ€™s a â€œwhen?â€ and it has been for a while. itâ€™s soon. 

the fact that iâ€™ll hurt many people is really bothering me. but itâ€™s not enough to stop me, nothing is or will be. what can i do to help those around me heal after this? 

please donâ€™t say â€œby not doing itâ€, etc etc.
