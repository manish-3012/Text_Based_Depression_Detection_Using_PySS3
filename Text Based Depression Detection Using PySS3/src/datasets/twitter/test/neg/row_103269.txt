I am a failureAI got denied into the program I chose in college. 


2 years.


 For nothing. 


All the years of studying. 


All those hours of procastinating and cramming. All those times of getting coffee to help me though it. For nothing. To be a failure. To be a nobody. 


I asked out 10 girls throughout my life. 


They all either don't feel the same way or have a boy friend. One girl I went for, pushed me away for my first attempted kiss, Never had a girlfriend. Am a failure. A college dropout. 


Someone who is nothing. Someone without a valentine's date in a few days. Someone with no relationship experience. 


Now with no experience in dating since EVERY FUCKING GIRL I WENT FOR REJECTED ME AND SAID THEY DONT FEEL THE SAME WAY OR HAS A BOYFRIEND. 


Fuck all the girls. 


Fuck all the women. I am sad. I should just kill myself. I have no career. No job. No girlfriend. No nothing. 


Somedays I fantasize killing myself to make an impact to the girls who reject me. So I can at least make an influence in the world. A somebody. Sometimes I fantasize killing myself so those girls that rejected me and all the people I feel close to have reactions. So I can feel somebody. Someone to give a fuck on. Someone to care about. Someone who wants to experience love and not feel like a fucking failure all the time. I am sick of this. I am done. I wish I was in the United States of America to buy a gun and kill myself.


I've been in college since 2015. No girl asked me out. No girl expressed interest in me. They all rejected me. I feel like crying. I am done. I am 9 shots in. And I am done. Lord have mercy on my soul. And fuck all the girls. They never felt the same way. I am a failure. 


Fuck everyone. Fuck Valentine's Day. Fuck college. Fuck everyone. If I could kill myself and see the reactions of everyone that gave a fuck about me, I would.


Fuck the world. I am done.
