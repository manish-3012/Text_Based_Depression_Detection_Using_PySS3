I want to dieI want to die, kill myself, end my pain. I'm a survivor of 3 major suicide attempts, not counting the ones that weren't close to actually making it. Rushed to hospitals, just to keep me here, when I just wished they woulda left me there. I could be at peace. I've lost 2 friends to suicide, one just last year, and yesterday, a man who was always there, and said that he would protect me and keep me safe from my family and stuff I was going through, committed suicide. I want to join him so bad, my cuttings getting worse, especially yesterday, after i heard the news, cut so bad, my clothes just drenched in blood. I'm going to take all my antidepressants and sleeping pills, and slit my wrists at a park i always go to. This isn't a call for help, this is goodbye to all you amazing people of reedit.
