I fall for people way fast and easily and I fucking hate myselfAnytime I find someone I even remotely like or find attractive, if they show the slightest interest, I fall for them within hours. I can't help myself, I guess I just want to be in a relationship that bad, I'm not really sure. I have terrible social anxiety so my social skills are sub-par and I always end up scaring them off or making them lose interest. It doesn't help that I'm ugly and have anxiety so as soon as they stop replying I just want to send them 100 messages apologizing and explaining myself but I think when and if I do it only makes it worse. I think my extremely low level of self-confidence has a lot to do with it and my last break up probably didn't help but I wish I could just skip to the relationship part, I'm incredibly sweet and caring but I let it out way to fast. I just want to end myself I just push everyone away that I care about.
