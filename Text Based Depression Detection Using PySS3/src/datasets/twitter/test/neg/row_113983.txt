Im fucking done god dammitI was so fucking happy... i was feeling so much better... I truly was... I thought i had found myself again... then today i find out the girl I loved to death was cheating on me... now i feel suicidal... it hurts all over again...i want nothing but death... I want to die.. I hate it... i cant even blame the guy because he never knew i even existed... but she made the mistake of adding us to a group chat and saw the previous messages... 

tl;dr... i want to fucking die... I want nothing but death...
