I've finally realized somethingFirst of all, I'll apologize for any errors in this post, as I am submitting from mobile. I doubt many people will read this anyway, so I'm not sure why I'm apologizing, nor why I'm even bothering to put this on my throwaway. Nevertheless. 

I've been battling severe depression and anxiety for the past eight years now. I self-harm and self-hate like it's my job. Only recently did I admit that I needed help, and finally decided to medicate myself. Those only intensify the feelings, and I've had increasingly paralyzing panic attacks and have been self mutilating almost every day since. I hate feeling like this. It's honestly like I don't remember what it's like to be genuinely happy. 

And that's when I realized it -- I really don't want to be on this earth anymore. Yes, I have an amazing support system. They're the only thing keeping me here. I'm 22 years old. I'll be graduating college soon. I've had my heart broken and truly don't believe that I'm worth being loved. I hate what I see every single day when I look in the mirror. I'm not unpopular, or even lonely. I'm just tired of being sad all of the time. I've missed more classes than I can count because I just don't want to get up and go on with my life. 

The only thing holding me from ending it all is knowing how badly I would hurt others. I guess I'll continue to hurt if it means not hurting them in the end. 

I'm just at a loss. And I guess I'm really not looking for an answer of any sort. I just needed to let it all out.
