Im scared of not killing myself because I'm afraid that I've been permanently damaged by this.I dont really know how to write this post my head is too cluttered and I'm full of so much anger that I literally have no way to let out. I'm afraid of going insane or giving myself brain damage or something. I dont know how to write this post but it would be a lot easier if someone could just ask questions and I could answer. I'm also afraid that therapy won't work at all. And just for a bit of help, it isn't one thing that's hurting me. Its everyone, and everyone keeps dismissing me. There's just too much in my head that makes it so i can't write clearly. Please ask me questions, that might help me get my thoughts out clearer.
