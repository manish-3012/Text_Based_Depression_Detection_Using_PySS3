suicidal after reading an article about suicide?hello reddit,

I wasn't really sure where to post this - r/offmychest wasn't quite right because I do want advice. I'm not actively suicidal, like I don't have a plan or method or anything. It's just a vague feeling/urge that's been nagging at me, like things would be so much easier if I could just off myself.

I read this article yesterday: http://fox43.com/2015/10/06/student-wants-school-administrators-and-police-to-be-held-responsible-for-classmates-suicide/

I guess you could say I had a really intense emotional reaction to reading that. This kid killed himself because he felt trapped, he felt like there was some injustice in his world and there was no other way to fix it. I feel that way too. Every day I read about injustices in the world, and it doesn't usually affect me that much but today it makes me feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. I'm mad at the administrators of that school, I'm mad at every adult in a position of power who's ever ruined a kid's life. I feel trapped and powerless, I feel like death is the only way to solve it or even have any effect on the situation at all, if only by making a statement.

Why do I feel this way? Is this normal? And how do I stop it...
