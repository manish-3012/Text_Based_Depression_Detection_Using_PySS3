Tired of this cool thing called paradox.Hello reddit.

I'm not quite sure about what I'm doing here and how do I explain my worries. I am getting tired of struggling, being tough and hiding. I have been trough a lot, mentally and physically. Working hard, but still not making it.
How could people say that money is worthless? Why are people greedy and unequal to eachother? I have always done my best to help others, but all I get in return is a bunch of 'beep'.

For the last few years, I've been living in a closed circle. Paycheck to paycheck, loans, worries, family problems etc. I have been using sleeping pills and xanax for a year now. I can't get out of this and it looks like a never ending circle. I'm tired.

I don't know if I should describe anything specific in here or not. I am not very professional in sharing. I do have quite a lot of friends, but only few know some bits of how I feel. I don't usually talk about my problems out loud.

How do people reach their goals? Why can't I be a successful and happy guy?

I'm a 20 year old male.
