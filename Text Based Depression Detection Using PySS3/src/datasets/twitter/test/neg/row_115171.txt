I can't manage life and it's too difficult. I can't help myself.Hi. This is my first time admitting anything like this to anyone. Some suicidal thoughts were recently triggered from running into some trouble. 

Basically, I can never take care of myself.

I never do well in school and procrastinate like hell on homework and studying.

I have a severe addiction to daydreaming that I can't stop. I spend hours and hours on daydreaming.

I can't keep up with house chores.

I even procrastinate on my hobbies by daydreaming or going on the internet. 

I'm extremely worried about my financial security in the future. 

I've had several wallets stolen from me. I have no skills so I'm pretty sure I won't get employed.

I realize that I will never, ever have a normal social life. I was CONSTANTLY rejected by family and everyone I meet in general. Right now I have friends but it's pretty clear that we can't connect to each other anymore because I broke their trust. I feel so guilty for my mom because I'm living off of white lies to please her. I always made major fuck-ups when it came to romance.

Oh and by the way, today I pissed off a teacher really badly and I have to get my journal signed, but I literally forgot my journal at school. I'm so fucked. I can't deal with this.

I want to kill myself because I'm too tired to keep up with responsibilities. I have goals and ambitions but I know that I can't fulfill them. I'm sick of being rejected and abandoned. I'm sick of disappointing myself.
