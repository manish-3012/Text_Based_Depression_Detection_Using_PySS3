Need to find the courageI need to find the courage to go through with ending my life. I have the idea if I take a few of the steps slowly just so far each time, I can desensitize myself to not notice. 

I don't understand why I am depressed and sad. I know people who have been through worse than me and are happy, aren't afraid of life, and live it. I am withdrawn and afraid and unhappy and can't change it. 

I wish I could curl up and die, just fall asleep tonight and never wake up. But I want to do it right, I don't want to be seen as just an attempt or a cry for help, I want to actually succeed. I was going to use some of mu Christmas money to help buy what I need, but instead I got gift cards to a restaurant. Like that's going to help. 

Need to get to work on some stuff, figure out where to get some things... The world will be better off without me dragging everyone down.
