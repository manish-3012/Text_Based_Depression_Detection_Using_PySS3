im gonna do it tomorrow afternoonthere's an abandoned silo with a tall ladder on the inside. In the middle there's some sharp metal things. I'll jump and stab myself. everyone who befriends me abandons me. no one enjoys being my friend, they just put up with my existence. all i have ever known is pain and suffering, ive had pretty much no happy moments in my entire life (im 20). there's no point to my existence. my friends will flake on me again. they said they'd come over to my house for Halloween. i highly doubt they'll follow through. they abandoned me on my birthday (last year), said they were busy even though i asked them ahead of time if they were able to come over on my birthday and they agreed. if i don't die tomorrow, I'll prob just watch horror movies and eat candy on Halloween. Thinking of visiting a local cemetery, talking to the spirits there. I have no one else to talk to. I think (and hope) I'll die tomorrow. ive struggled with friendships my entire life, there's no point in getting my hopes up and thinking i might get other friends in the future. my life is pointless and isnt worth living. sorry for being so annoying and stupid, this post prob sucks. sorry.
