How am I supposed to figure out if they're okay?I've tried speaking to some people who are feeling suicidal and just support them, etc. Several have still decided to go through with it anyways from what I can guess. How do I figure out what occured, as in, did they try it and fail? Did they just change their mind and ghost me? Did they succeed? I don't want to know for any other reason than because I care. I hope every single one of them change their mind and recover but at the end of the day I cannot control anybody. Is there anyway of finding out? If not, it's alright, I tried.
