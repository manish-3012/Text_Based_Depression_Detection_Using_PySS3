I'm 19, male, 5'4, considering my options at the moment.I don't want to live the rest of my life like this.



It's really hard to keep a good attitude about my height when people treat me like a child because of it, and women give me a look of disgust when they see me. I start the day off telling myself to keep a good attitude, but by the end of the day I can't help but feel like chit. I'd give personal stories, but it's pointless to do that.



No matter what I do in my life, I will always be seen as low value and there's no way to change that. Even then, I just want to live a normal life, where people are not judging my worth just because of my height.



It feels hopeless and I want to it end soon.
