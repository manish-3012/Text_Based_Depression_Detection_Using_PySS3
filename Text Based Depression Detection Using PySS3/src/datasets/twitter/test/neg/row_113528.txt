i'm doneI can't really do much anymore. I went through a rough relationship and break-up a few months ago. That put me in a psyche hospital on two separate occasions. Drugs made me feel horrible and therapy made me feel awkward. I can't go ten minutes without my mind screaming at me to top myself. Things haven't been right in a long, long time and they show no sign of getting better. I've attempted before and I'm lower than I was then. I just don't know. no money, shit job, failing school, family can't tolerate me, and I'm still bent out of shape over a girl who never really cared about me. time to go
