My significant other's friend may have just killed themselves and I don't know what to doOne of my girlfriend's friends might have just killed himself. Our mutual boyfriend just texted me and told me this. I have no fucking idea what to do. We're not sure yet if the person in question has actually done it or not, but there is evidence to suggest that they have. What do I do?
