My sister is disgusting and unhygienicFor the past year I havenâ€™t been able to comfortably go in my bathroom because of my sister but recently I found out that 
My sister has left her pad on my face wash, mouth wash and face rag, twice this week. Sheâ€™s very unhygienic. She REFUSES to put on deodorant. She stinks. I tell her about it all the time and she either gets mad or just straight up doesnâ€™t care. 
I avoid brushing my teeth and washing my face because I donâ€™t want to touch something disgusting. When sheâ€™s on her cycle she leaves the bathroom looking and smelling disgusting. Me and my sister have to share a bathroom. My mom doesnâ€™t seem to care. 

This is all making me very mad, anxious and uncomfortable. Itâ€™s been making it even harder for me to take care of my own hygiene. And it actually makes me want to Kms. 

What do I do?
