how did I get here?a wrong mindset can truly fuck up your life, moving to America I was so excited given how many opportunities were here. But my mindset fucked me , I was drilled that school was the only way to success from a young age so when I came here I got a job couple weeks after I moved , everyone wondered why I was in such a rush.  I began working 50 hr weeks during my gap year and after living like a mad man on limited living expenses in my mother's living room for my gap year , I saved up around 8k and decided I would take out another 5k in Loans to go to a private college . Dumb, dumb , dumb decision. same education as a free public school but over ambition and fucked mindset got me to where I am which is in depression and suffering.
