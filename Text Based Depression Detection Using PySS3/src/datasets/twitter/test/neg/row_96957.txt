No prospects, bleak future. Dead End. 21 years old. Male. Considering giving up the whole venture of being. Not very intelligent, always wanted to be a Chemist or Chemical Engineer. Always thought it was a beautiful thing, still do. It's hard to reconcile the two, being an idiot and wanting to be a Chemist. Work menial job as a baggage handler, foresee only menial work in the future. No love. Never even held a woman's hand. A goddamn Man and I havent even done that. Never looked into someone's eyes and seen affection. Never felt the softness of someone's lips. Spend nights alone. The total Nothing of death sounds better than more of this. 

Don't know why I bothered writing this. Reality is a hard thing to bear.
