â€œYou never even tried to help yourselfâ€Sorry if it seems I havenâ€™t tried to be better. Iâ€™ve gone to a therapist a lot of times already. I have taken meds, Iâ€™ve strived to do better and improve at work, Iâ€™ve made new friends, I even have a gf at this point.

Iâ€™m still on the verge of killing myself. I still feel miserable. You guys have told me itâ€™s all in the mindâ€”-how can I even twist my mind into something better in an instant? Life is fucking harsh and Iâ€™m not meant for this world and Iâ€™d rather be fucking dead because Iâ€™m a burden and I look like I have still been miserable to everyone anyway.

I need fucking help. Iâ€™ve made a lot of efforts to save my own life. Please...
