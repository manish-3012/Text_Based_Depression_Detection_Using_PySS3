I can't control myself.I am slowly becoming an overconfident douche, I hate myself, I hate my girlfriend but she's too nice for me to break it too her, my friends are assholes who are ignoring me because I'm being clingy, I hate my parents and I wish my mother was dead even though she cares about me, I have nothing else to do but play video games and even that is getting boring and it is making me fat, I hate myself. I am often having fits where I can't really control what I'm doing I just run around and scream. I want it to end.
