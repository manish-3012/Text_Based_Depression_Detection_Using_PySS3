Iâ€™m turning 23 and I just want to die.Iâ€™m just so sad. All the time. And I canâ€™t seem to get better. My birthday kind of just reminds me of how useless I am. I just feel so unfulfilled, unaccomplished and empty. 

May and November are especially hard, November being the halfway point of a year. Each year or half year is just a reminder of how lonely I am. How Iâ€™m nothing.

A few years back in November I tried to kill myself and a nurse told me â€œIf you really wanted to die, you would have finished yourself off completelyâ€ Why this person was in the healthcare profession? Iâ€™m unsure, but itâ€™s stuck with me. After that incident I started going to therapy and was on various medications... And to be frank, I felt more sad than before. 

With everything thatâ€™s going on, in addition to my other life struggles and worries, I feel like itâ€™s been going downhill. Iâ€™m worried that if I live another few years, Iâ€™d still feel the same. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth it.
