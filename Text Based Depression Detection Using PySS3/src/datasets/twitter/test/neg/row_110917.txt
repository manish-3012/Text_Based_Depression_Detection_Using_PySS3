A peom(?) about how isolated I feelThe day the sky grew pitch black, 
Was a normal everyday Tuesday.
Those around milled happily along in their lives, eyes closed to those around. 
Except their eyes weren't closed, 
They just never cared enough to look 

The day the sky grew misty blue,
Was a normal, everyday Wednesday. 
It was the day she started to feel her isolation.
She looked up and saw those around,
Except she never felt them 

The day the sky grew dove grey 
Was a normal, everyday Thursday.
It was the day she ventured out to find a friend. 
She traveled across maps filled with rivers, mountains, and state lines,
Except she found no one who cared enough to chat

The day the sky grew foggy grey,
Was a normal, everyday Friday. 
It was the day she found hope.
She finally found a small sharp of joy,
Except the shard was also too sharp to hold and only wounded her heart further.

The day the sky grew clear and Grey,
Was a normal, everyday Saturday.
It was the first time she realized she was trapped in a glass snow globe. 
She banged and screamed for anyone to see or hear her,
Except she was invisible and the world decided it would be deaf.  

The day the sky grew thunderstorm grey,
Was a normal, everyday Sunday. 
It was rhe day she sat in her snow globe. 
She tried to find solice in the lifeless quiet,
Except now she knew her snow globe was a prison void of breath. 

The day the sky grew midnight black,
Was a normal, everyday Monday.
It was the day she knew she'd never be free. 
She tried to protect herself by pretending she wasn't left in her snow globe- she chose it. 
She tried to convince herself this clear prison was solid- and no one could see her. 
She tried to pretend she felt nothing but the numbness- 
Except she knew they just didn't have enough love for her. 

The day the sky grew pitch black,
Was a normal, everyday Tuesday. 
It was the day she stopped praying for light. 
It was the day she knew these days werent normal.
It was the day she begged to be heard the loudest.
She tried to find the light one more time.  
She tried to tell those around her. 
She tried to get someone- anyone to notice her abandoned in her prison. 

Expect no one attempted to share the light. 
Except no one chose to break the glass.
Except no one noticed her desperation to be free. 

The day the sky grew pitch black,
Was a normal, everyday day Tuesday. 
It was sunny blue for everyone but her. 
She stopped trying. 
Except- there were none left, because they never looked up.
