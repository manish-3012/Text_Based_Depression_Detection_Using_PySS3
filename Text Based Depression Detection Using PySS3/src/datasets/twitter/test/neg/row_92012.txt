I feel like I'm the only one looking out for me.On the year anniversary of my mother's funeral, my husband got put on administrative leave in preparation for most likely being fired. And because of a really, really, REALLY stupid thing he did. He is our main breadwinner and insurance holder. My job doesn't even come close to our mortgage each month, let alone our bills.

I just went out to a festival event where I had a really bad time, in part due to the bad news, in part due to assholes flaunting the rules and festival staff doing nothing about it. I mentioned this on a Facebook group and ended up getting into it with an acquaintance that is my best friend's tennant. Now I no longer feel safe going over to her house because of that person being there. Well, we're even because she doesn't want to come to my house because she doesn't like my husband. So now we're best friends who refuse to visit the other's house. Great.

I've come home to a shitshow. My husband is spiraling in and out of suicidality. I'm going from despair to rage and back. I'm ready to fucking delete Facebook, but that's the only way my family will bother to contact me anymore, is by liking a post. Or posting on my wall for my birthday, not even calling.

I feel like I'm the only one who is here to look out for me. My husband and I are sitting here watching for the blade to fall with his job. We're both so emotionally fucked right now we can't even talk. We are both suicidal, but there is nothing to be done.

Oh and I've relapsed into drinking, because my life isn't fucked enough.
