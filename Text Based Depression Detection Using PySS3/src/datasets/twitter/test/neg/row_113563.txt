a pathetic loser.i've been feeling like this for more than 3 years now, and it's getting worse every goddamn day... I'm the most parhetic, weak, WORTHLESS human being that ever walked this earth. Iiterally have no potential to be a good person. No advantages or qualities. I can't even feel anything anymore, i don't even care about anyone anymore, i systematically lost hope over the past years as i sit and watch as everyone is giving me weird looks and talking behind my back. Not to mention that i look like a fucking corpse ffs. I'm not exactly ugly or anything but i look like a pathetic forever alone weirdo with no hope in life, i have all the physical features of a destroyed, weak man, skinny as fuck bloodshot eyes, a retarded face, it's just disgusting. I only have 2-3 friends that i rarely talk to, and the worst fucking part of my life, i NEVER talked to a girl. Apart from the ocassional "hellos" and "how are you doing", i never had the guts to pursue a woman and make her happy, thats how much of a pussy i am. Everyone avoids me and for good reason, i'm a shitty, lazy, apathetic and weak person. i'm 19 btw.
 
This is my first post on reddit so sorry if i said anything retarded. Just wanted to talk to someone and see if anyone can relate to this...
