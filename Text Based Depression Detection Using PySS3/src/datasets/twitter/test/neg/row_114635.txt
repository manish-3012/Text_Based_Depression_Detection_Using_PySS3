32/mSo I'm a 32 year old guy. 

 I've been married for 5 years but now I am getting divorced.

I have severe liver disease which is very tiring and can be painful.  I have had many trips to the hospital for this but am not on any transplant waiting lists yet.  

I work 6 days a week at a completely dead end job.  I make just enough money to get by.  

I am going to college and will graduate in the spring with a 2 year degree which is probably completely useless.

I have been the only father my step daughter has known for 7 years, but I will have no rights to her after the divorce.

I also have osteoporosis from all the steroids I have to take, they leech the calcium from my bones.

6 Months ago during one of my many cat scans or MRIs I was found to have a mass on one of my kidneys.  My Dr. did not tell me this he just told me to get another MRI in the next few months which I didn't because I can't afford to get them very often.  At my 6 month appointment he pressed for the MRI more firmly so I happened to look at the script for it and it said I had the mass on my kidney.  I got the MRI and now I'm waiting for the results...  

I don't know that I'm really considering suicide it's more like I feel like my life is just coming to an end no matter what...
