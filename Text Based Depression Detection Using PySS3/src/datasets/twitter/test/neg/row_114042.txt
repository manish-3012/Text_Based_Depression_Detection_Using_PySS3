School is depressingHi, I'm pretty new here. I have had some depressive episodes in the past, I thought those days were over during my last day of school a few months ago... But now those thoughts are back now that the thought of going back to school has sunken in.

I'm not really the type to take pity on myself, but last year, I did something terribly wrong, and most of my friends started avoiding me. Others  who I wouldn't consider close started disrespecting me, treating me like a retard. I've had depression even before this started happen, but it only deepened my anxiety. I even got around cutting myself once. A friend saw these cuts, she said she would always be there for me, but she left me a long time ago. Remembering her promise to me made me sad, it made me think of all the things we did together, and all the thing we could have been doing this year. I fear that by next year I would be spending social night in the corner crying, or worse, in the bathroom cutting. Sometimes I lie awake at night thinking of how it would feel to jump of the roof of my house, or the school, or something even worse. I'm too scared to do it, but every night I stay up burning my youth away, it just keeps coming to me...

I've tried looking for hobbies that can help me stimulate my anxiety, I've tried writing, but I could never get myself to finish something, I tried photography, but every photo is just another blur, I've tried photoediting, videoediting, but they all seemed half-baked, I even tried dancing but I was born with two left feet.

I just don't know what to do anymore, everyday I wake up and drag on, pretending to be happy for those who love me, but when I leave them for school I just feel like a every step I take would eventually end up in disaster.

Thank you for reading if anyone is, I just want to be heard for once.
