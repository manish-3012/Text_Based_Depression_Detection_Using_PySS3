Looks like I might be doing it after allSo at the beginning of 2017 I was going to kill myself. I had just found out that my then pregnant fiance had cheated on me with my best friend and that it was his child, not mine. I was in Dick's Sporting Goods holding a shotgun and as I was looking at it I remembered those stories of people jumping off the Golden Gate bridge and immediately feeling regret. I decided I didn't want to regret it so I told myself that I would do everything I possibly could to be happy and successful and only if something happened to make me lose everything again could I kill myself.

I stuck with it, I lost 50 lbs and got back into school and got great grades. Last tuesday however I ended up getting into a fight on campus. They swung first, I took the guy down and his friend ran in and started sucker punching me in the side of the head while I was on top of the guy. Despite this the police are doing an investigation and they said that I might be getting some charges, I have to meet with the CRL of my school this week and find out what the consequences are for this. 

In 2012 I got in legal trouble at this same school and ended up leaving. I lost everything, my previous fiance left me (she just married another guy last weekend btw,) I had to leave school, I became homeless, I started abusing drugs, and I made a suicide attempt that caused some brain damage. Eventually I got my stuff expunged, got clean, and worked my ass off to get back to where I could function. I worked my ass off to get back here. I always swore if this happened again I would kill myself. It's happening again.
