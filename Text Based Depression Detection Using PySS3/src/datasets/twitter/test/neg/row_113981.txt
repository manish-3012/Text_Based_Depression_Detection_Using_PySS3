I've always known it would be how it endedMy whole life I've known it would be suicide that finished me,  even when I was incredibly happy,  I knew I didn't have the mental strength to go through tough times. I'm now going through that and think it's time. Drink and drugs doesn't help,  being alone doesn't,  being with people doesn't. Im literally on my phone every waking minute because I need constant distraction from my brain or I'll do it. I just want it to stop
