I've settled on a general timeframe for my suicideI have been supporting a girlfriend, now fiancÃ©e, with mental issues and getting her life on track  for the past few years now. She's finally stable and on track to finish an apprenticeship which will lead her to a job. I think I will do it when she's settled in and have the job established.  


I was debating whether to do it after we get married (so that she could inherit me) but before we have any kids, but I've decided that it would just be too cruel. Maybe I'll just sell all my investments and send them to her just before I do it or something.  


My life has led to a dead end and never ever really began, and not even finding true love helped. I really am lost and always have been. She will live on and be beautiful, and in a way I will always be with her.
