Help pleaseI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My whole life thereâ€™s been this voice in my head telling me Iâ€™m worthless and that I should kill myself. When I was 14 I attempted to hang myself but never went through with it. As I got older the voice remained but some days it would be quiet and some days it would be really loud. When I went to college the voice remained the same but I was happier and able to manage it better. 
Once I graduated this year it felt like that voice had dwindled to a point where I was able to hear my own voice again. I was finally in control. Itâ€™s from that point that Iâ€™ve been searching for an answer in why I feel so unhappy. In the recent months I finally feel as though I mightâ€™ve been getting somewhere, then this guy I was seeing told me that he didnâ€™t want a relationship. Not that he didnâ€™t want to stop seeing me but he didnâ€™t want to be with me like that and that just felt like it sent me back to that bad place again. It made me feel worthless and now all these voices are back and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to kill my self but the voice in my head is telling me that I have to. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me. I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m at work rn and the only thing I can think of doing is going home and killing myself. I know that I wonâ€™t but Iâ€™m scared that I will. Someone please tell me what to do. Should I goto the hospital,should I tell my parents(if I tell them theyâ€™ll worry about me too much). I just want these voices to stop so I can go back to normal. Please help.
