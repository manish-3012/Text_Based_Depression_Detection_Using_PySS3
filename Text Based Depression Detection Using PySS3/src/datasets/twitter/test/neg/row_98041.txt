Literally do or dieLately I've been telling myself not to give up on suicide. I've had attempts, and I've been afraid of failing, like most of us. 



I'm an alcoholic, and I can't stay sober. I need to try harder, but it still might not be enough. I took out student loans when I was drinking. When I was sober, I knew I was too much of a shithead to be able to deal with loans responsibly, so I paid for school by working two jobs. Now no jobs, no school, interest creeping up daily. 



Even if I manage to quit drinking for more than a week and actually get involved in AA, then what? I've always been poor, and now I'm poor with debt, probably terrible credit, an extra 50lbs on my short frame, and no one that thinks I'm a bright teenager who needs a break. I'm scum. I'm the reason employers don't like to see a gap in work experience on resumes. I have no one I can talk to because I was awful to them. I had the most amazing relationship of my life, and then the worst break up. I can't even begin to get over it. If I knew this would happen, I would have killed myself when I was a teenager. 



Similar things happened to my mom. Three husbands kept her from becoming homeless, but she's miserable. Drinks secretly, made herself disabled, abuses whatever pills they'll still prescribe her, does nothing for months until she gets bored and does something horrible and insane. She's always been like that. 



So I can't give up on suicide. I can try to make my life better, but I know how often I've failed, and better might not be good enough. I think my mom knows she's done living and has for decades. She's just kind of waiting until her luck runs out. I am too, but I can't anymore. I'm afraid of hurting more people. I need to remember that suicide is not just an option, but a necessity after a certain point. Maybe I'm already at that point.
