Why is my mind like this?I've made a few posts before, but my partner knows what my main account is an they get really worried every time I post, and I don't want to put them through that.

Most of the time I like myself, but a part of my mind utterly despises me. It says that I'm worthless. It says that I'll never amount to anything. It says that I'm a waste of space. It says that all that I ever do is hurt people. It says that I'm a disgusting tranny which should just fucking kill itself already. It says that I should have just gone through with my past suicide attempt, and that the world would be better it I had.

I don't understand what causes this part of my mind to come out. Sometimes everything can be going to shit and I'm fine. Right now, my life should be great; I just got my name and gender marker changed, which has been a big dream of mine for a while, and I'm definitely happy that its done. And yet, right now that side of my mind is out in full force because I said something stupid.
