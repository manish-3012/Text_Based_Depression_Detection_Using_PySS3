Best place to jump in New EnglandAnyone know the best, highest place to jump from in New England? Ive consider flying out to the Golden Gate Bridge but they've got the suicide nets up, same with the famous bridge in Toronto. I'm willing to travel, and I've got a couple bucks for a plane ticket. But it seems all the places I've researched have installed suicide nets in recent years. I live in New England, Connecticut to be exact. Anyone have any ideas?

 I've looked into the exit bag, but it seems like a pain in the ass to assemble. I'd also have to wait several days/ maybe a week to get all the required materials. Even that is iffy, since many manufactures of helium tanks have diluted the concentration. I don't own a gun, and would have an even harder time trying to obtain one. I just want an easy way out. A nice high jump would do the trick. My mind is made up. There's no way I'm not going through with this. I've never wanted something more in my life and I'm ready. I just need to develop a fool proof plan. All of my finances are in order, I've said my final goodbyes, my letter is written on my computer desktop titled "my note". I just want to be sure I'm not going to be found out, or somehow survive the jump  I'm ready. Help me out, friends.
