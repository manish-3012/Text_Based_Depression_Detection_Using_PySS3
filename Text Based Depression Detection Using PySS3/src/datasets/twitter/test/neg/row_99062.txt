I have no reason to suffer anymore.I'm 24 and I honestly just want to give up. Everything I want in life no longer seems possible. In highschool I stopped doing well and became depressed. When I graduated high school I didn't have the grades so I went community college at 19 and stayed there for longer than I thought I would not knowing what to do but eventually I picked something and stuck with it transferring to a school that isn't so well known due to limited transfer options. Terrible anxiety about my future in those years. I suffered all alone because the few friends I had were doing other things and also no comfort from my family who were also hard on me. I have severe social anxiety so I have trouble forming relationships with others. As of right now, I am finishing up my last year of school but am afraid of not being able to pay back my loans and not being able to find a decent starting job. I have had internships which I did not do well at because I could never get motivated also making some really stupid mistakes. Meanwhile everyone I graduated high school with even those that hurt me are doing well in real jobs and going on tropical vacations with their beautiful girlfriends while I sit here in my parents house contemplating suicide.

In my entire life, there has never been anything I wanted more than love and to be able to feel and express it to the fullest with a woman I love. With my current situation being unemployed I am not too attractive to many women and my lack of effort and lack of care about everything certainly doesn't make me attractive either. My social anxiety is at its peak around attractive girls because they have treated badly in the past. Certainly not attractive to the girl of my dreams who has already graduated, is likely dating guys who are better off than me, and doesn't appear interested in me. Then again she doesn't know me all so well. I've never felt anything so intense as the passion I feel for this girl. Been that way for about 7 years. I could never get her out of my head and she is the most beautiful woman (inside and out) in the world to me. I've had nothing at all to hold on to these terrible years after high school so I suppose I held on to that amazing feeling I felt whenever I thought of her. That isn't going to happen now. That is perhaps the worst pain of all.

With nothing you want in life feeling remotely possible what on earth would you want to go on for? It isn't worth it in the least. There is just no joy in life at all anymore. Not since I was a child. I've suffered long and hard enough. I just want everything to stop completely now. I don't want to exist. I don't want to think or feel anymore. I haven't worked out a way to do it just yet. Its kind of difficult to hide the means from my parents.
