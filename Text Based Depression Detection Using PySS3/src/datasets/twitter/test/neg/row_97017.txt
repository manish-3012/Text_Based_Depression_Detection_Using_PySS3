So angry I want to just stopI'm not sure what to say. I dropped out of high school. I work at a dead end job. I have no money to indulge in myself or anything. My parents kicked me out and won't let me back no matter how much I tell them I need to move back. I'm 18 years old and I'm forced to be an adult. In August I went to the hospital for a suicide attempt. I went 2 more times after that for suicidal ideation. I'm angry all the time. I've tried therapy but it doesn't do shit. I've tried so hard to be happy and tried so hard to just be a normal functioning part of society but at the same time, why am I fighting for a life I don't want to live? What is the point of struggling anymore? I don't want to be angry anymore. I don't want to be sad. Nothing works. I'm not sure what to do
