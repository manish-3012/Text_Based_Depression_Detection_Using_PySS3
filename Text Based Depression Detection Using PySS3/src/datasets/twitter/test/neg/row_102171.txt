I don't feel well.I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm sitting at work right now and whenever something comes up that I have to deal with I just go into this mindless routine to get it over with. Then I resume my position at my computer and try to figure out what I'm feeling and where it came from. This isn't ok. I know I'm not ok. I don't know what I'm going to do about that or where I can go from here. My thoughts are so damn jumbled and everything is so overwhelming that it's making me feel ridiculously stupid. I'm tired of feeling this way. I wish I could stop existing. Pushing through all this nonsense isn't worth the hassle and strain it puts on myself and the people in my life. Even my therapist told me that if something is too hard, it's best to quit. How the fuck did I get to this point? This is hopeless.
