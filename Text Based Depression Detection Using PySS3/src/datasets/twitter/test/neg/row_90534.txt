I feel so aloneOver the past 3 years, I felt like I have achieved nothing in my life. I feel like a failure. Add on a family that doesnâ€™t care just weighs me down so much. I feel so alone. I hesitate to open up to my own friends about how I feel out of fear theyâ€™ll leave me. 

But what hurts the most is that my own mother doesnâ€™t care. She doesnâ€™t give a fuck that Iâ€™m suicidal The woman that is supposed to comfort and love you. Tell you everything is going to be alright. The first time I told my mom about how I felt she just told me to â€œman upâ€ 

This past summer, we had a stupid disagreement and what was her solution to make amends? Pull out a knife on me. She told me with such anger â€œif you want to die so badly, Iâ€™ll do you and Iâ€™ll do myself afterwards, so we can both go to hell!â€ How can a mother do that to her own child? 

From the point on, I do not love, care or trust my mother. I will never forgive nor forget what she did. Apart of me wants to die but the other part wants to get back at my mother. Live to spite her. I feel I donâ€™t owe her shit. Nobody asks to be born after all.
