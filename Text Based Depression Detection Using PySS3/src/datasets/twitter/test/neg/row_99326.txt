I saw this therapist, did EMDR...Did the whole intake for a few sessions. Due to fact my life seems aimless/pointless right now (out of work, seizure condition). He suggested EMDR, which he tried on 4th visit. Watching light bounce back n forth, buzzers in hand, headphones/beeps. He told me to think about the bullying in midle school, relax/deep breaths. It did not work at all. He then aborted that method. I met with him one more time, then at the end of session, he said nothing he could do.
