Feeling deeply hopelessDon't know exactly how it has started, but the thing is that I feel completely angry and bored all the time, I have thought about suicide for several times, but I won't do that since I know a few people love me and still believe in me. I'm not being able to deal with job, college and relationships. I don't feel like doing anything in my life, I don't expect myself to getting a good job in the future, becoming rich or traveling around the world. It seems there isn't any driving force that makes me go on.
Recently I started drinking a lot, I'm getting low grades on my University and I'm wasting a lot of money due to the alcohol addiction. I get drunk almost every night and I throw up all the mornings. I'm just feeling completely lost, don't know what to do about anything of my life.
