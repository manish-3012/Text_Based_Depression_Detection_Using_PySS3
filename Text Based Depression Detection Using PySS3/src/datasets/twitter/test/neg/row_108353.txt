I just feel so lonely and shitIm constantly alone and isolated. I just always feel so shit, although talking to people is just so fucking hard for me its unreal. The only way I can cope with this is cutting and I'm pretty sure people are gonna find out sooner or later.

How do stop myself from cutting, I think about it all the time its awful. I don't want people to worry about me, and talking about this will be just too hard.
