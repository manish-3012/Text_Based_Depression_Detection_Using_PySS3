Life is pointlessI've had enough, I had enough of school, enough being afraid of what everyone around me thinks, enough of living and knowing that perhaps someday I'll find a future despite having to go through so much shit before it. I'm by no means bad in school, but I've found that I really don't want this life. I have my joys but ultimately it's a mundane cycle of anxiety and small amounts of joy. Maybe I don't want anything life has to offer. So then what do I do?
