Any straight edgers here dealing with lifelong depression/anxiety?Since it is an uncommon term; straight edge is living without imbibing alcohol or doing drugs. I see many people here using these things as an escape, I'm wondering if there's people like me who don't and what their personal coping methods are. 

I used to play videogames, but I've mostly cast that aside and started meditating, using Sam Harris' app to help me. It's still early days yet, but I'm not so reliant on sleeping the day away to escape.

I've got good reasons not to partake in drugs and alcohol, my family has a pattern of addiction and I'm deathly afraid of losing what little cognitive ability I have. Anyone want to share their straight edge story?
