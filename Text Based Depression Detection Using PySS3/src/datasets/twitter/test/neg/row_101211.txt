the one thing i was looking forward to (sodium nitrite) didnt show upSo i ordered it online because on the suicide forum/website im on they said it works and its cheaper then other methods. So it was supposed to arrive TODAY and it says it was delivered already but i couldnt find the package anywhere. I am so fucking tired of waiting around for nothing to happen. Im tired of being tired ALL THE TIME. I am barely able to get out of bed and do the bare minimum to stay alive and it really just seems like everyone is out to get me at this point.
