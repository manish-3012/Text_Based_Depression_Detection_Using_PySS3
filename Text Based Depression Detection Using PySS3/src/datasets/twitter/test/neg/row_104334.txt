To those posting "what's the least painful way to die?"I'm seeing a lot of these posts lately. 

Why are you asking here, a pro-life sub? I'm not trying to be snarky or anything. 

If you do want to know, you can google it. There are whole websites, books, and forums that are pro-choice where you can find the answers. 

Maybe you don't actually want to die, but want help and don't know how to ask? This subreddit isn't going to reject your call for help because it doesn't feel "serious" enough. So don't feel like you have to outright ask for methods in order to get help.
