Not sure if right place - just found out my best friend tried to kill himself last night. We're both 45. He's diagnosed bipolar, and an alcoholic who'd been sober for over 10 years.Tried posting this in AskReddit but it got buried. Sorry if this isn't the usual post. His soon-to-be-ex-I-think-wife emailed me tonight. I'd known he was an alcoholic who'd been sober for over 10 years but the rest was a complete shock.

She sent me the hospital phone number and I called him. He sounded sleepy and said he'd call me tomorrow. I said I'd call him if I didn't hear from him.

The hell do I do now?
