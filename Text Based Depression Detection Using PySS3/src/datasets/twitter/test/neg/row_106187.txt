I feel like I'm breaking down.Recently I got suspended from my first job. I didn't do anything to get in trouble, it's actually due to a bed bug infestation at my apartment complex. My employer is worried I'm bringing them to work. They said once I clear an inspection i'm good to come back. I've hired an exterminator and they've done many treatments, and I should be cleared this coming Tuesday, but the fact that I have to wait so long to go back to work is killing me inside. I've struggled with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts all my life and finally getting a job and making friends has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I keep being told by my employer that I'm not fired, that I will get to come back but I can't help but worry that they wont let me. I've been the best employee I can be. I've never missed a day, never been late (in fact I go to work 30 min early every day), I've been the top agent on my team multiple times, and I got hired for a promotion and was waiting to start my training on it. My life seemed to be turning around and I wasn't feeling as depressed. Now after the suspension I can't sleep, I can't eat, all I can think about is work. I'm afraid I'll lose all the friends I finally made, that I wont have the money to pay bills. I just feel like my job is all I have in life right now and it feels like it's about to be taken away from me. I hadn't had suicidal thoughts in such a long time but now at night when I'm trying to sleep I think about how I might break if I lose my job, especially after something like this, and after trying so hard to prove I'm a good worker. 

I don't expect to get a lot of, or any comments on this, I just needed to get it off my chest.
