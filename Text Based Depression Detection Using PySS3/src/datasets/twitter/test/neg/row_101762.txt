I'm not strong enoughHi guys, I'm not English so forgive me for my errors. I'm 18, grown up in a common family, my parents always gave me what I needed so I actually feels bad for those here with real problems. At school my parents always had high expectations from me, but this year has been the worst in my entire career and they don't fail to make me sad about that. My only friend recently got injured so I can see him very rarely and in 18 years I've never experienced love. My parents often arguing and I've heard my mother cry in bathroom today. I often cry under the shower or before going to bed. The only reason why I'm still alive is my 15 y/o brother, as older brother I should protect him and being stronger than him, but I can't, I'm very emotive and I often cry when I think about my life. I don't want to kill myself because I always think that things will go better in future but I really need moral support.
