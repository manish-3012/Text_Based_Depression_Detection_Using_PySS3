A cry for helpHi, my names Jim. I'm 19 years old and I suffer from Aspergers, depression and extreme anxiety. Later tonight I plan on killing myself. I'm posting here with hopes that one of you might be able to help me change my mind. Its weird, because I always told myself, no matter how bad it got that I would never resort to something like this. I always figured that once I hit rock bottom it would be easy to pick myself up again, after all, there's not much lower you can go than rock bottom. I just didn't realize that when I would start to climb back up, I'd slip and wind up back at the bottom again. It has been this way for me for the past year now, and I'd like to end it already. My mental issues have caused me a lot of pain in my life. At the age of 13, I would have severe panic attacks, so bad that my parents had to pull me out of public school and home school me. At the age of 17, I dropped out of high school. I was a procrastinator in my teens and by the time I actually cared about my education there was too much work to do. I've been meaning to get a GED at very least, but over the years, my anxiety has worsened. It eventually came to the point where I was barely able to leave my home. Due to not being able to leave my home, I lost all my friends. I lost the only person who I had ever really cared for, and I lost my independence and ability to live a happy life. I've wanted to become a linguist for a long time. Languages fascinate me, and I've spent my time in recent years teaching myself to speak French. It's come to the point though that I will never be able to become a linguist, because I can't go to college, because I have no money, and I'm unable to function enough get a job. There are so many dreams that I have that will never come true for the same reason. I'm a broken person, someone who can't function, and this shames me and pains me. I would do anything to be able to live with out feeling this way constantly. I also have to mooch off my parents, as I can't support myself, and it makes me feel like a shitty person. I'm stupid, I'm ugly, I'm useless and I'm incapable. I really don't know what to do. I really don't see how this life is redeemable. It's almost as if it's greedy of me to continue living. Every time I do something to try to improve myself, I make myself look like a foolish asshole. I can't drive, have no qualifications or education, nothing to do most days aside from sit around and read or play games, I'm a burden on the people around me, I'm a burden on society, and I live with people who don't even give enough of a shit to help me get a therapist or even try to help me. What can I even do at this point? I'm useless. I don't want to live like this any longer.
