I am 15 and whenever I talk about this no one takes it seriously and sees it as an attempt to be edgy&gt; I have  a relatively easy life - parents are economically good, I get good grades mostly without studying and I have ok genetics too.This is why whenever I complain I feel really shitty because I feel like the problems I have aren't real problems and I just feel like a spoilt brat but still I need to talk about shit.  Recently, I had been put in a better batch with smarter kids in it.I just see these people around me and some unknown emotion overcomes me.I am not sure whether its jealousy, grief, self-hate. I just see them having a nice time, playing sports, having great social lives, pursuing and excelling in their hobbies and simultaneously outperforming me in tests and exams too. I immediately start feeling shit as I have no hobbies and also my good grades have been a result of good genetics and no hard work.(edited)

&gt;In the social aspect, I am not a total 4 chan degenerate. I can hold up a good conversation with anyone for a few minutes. A lot of people think I am funny. I have been told I am very convincing but the thing is I don't enjoy socializing but at the same time I wish to be social. I see these people getting invited to parties, going to places together and I immediately feel like I want this but at the same time I almost hate talking to anyone irl,While people tell me I am funny I almost hate everything that comes out of my mouth and I hate any of the jokes I make.People want me to be their friend, a few girls have told me that I look cute but I still prefer sitting alone and not joining in the group and I simultaneously keep on hating myself for doing this.  I have no hobbies and I have only myself to blame. I have always had a very fast metabolism so I never had any incentive to do sports and I hated the social aspect anyway. I would love to sing or play an instrument but simply can't see myself practicing for hours and hours.The thing though I would like to bring up is that I don't pursue anything If I don't feel like I am naturally better at this than others. I sucked the first when I played drums and I tried many times and still sucked compared to others, so I lost any zeal to learn it. I was shit at painting so I gave it up. I have only myself to blame for my lack of hobbies and now when I see these people doing academics, sports and hobbies simultaneously so much self-hate is generated I immediately stop working and can't get myself to work the whole day(edited)

Stuff that I used to enjoy I stopped enjoying it too. I used to get real joy from playing video games now I hate them. I used to enjoy well.... nothing else but still these days I am just stuck in some deep languor. I watch tv shows or yt videos all day while getting no real enjoyment from it. I have a lot of stuff and work to do but still I waste my time doing this. I guess I don't like confronting the issue so I just beat around the bush

I haven't found real joy doing anything or I haven't liked doing anything since a year or two

This is what I posted on a venting-support discord server but I didn't post the part I am writing below. I didn't wish to write about suicide there.

My relationship with my parent's isn't the same anymore. We always had a very guarded relationship where I did not try sharing anything negative with them because it would always end up making myself feel shittier about myself. I have been thinking of killing myself everyday for at least a month and I. I looked online and people said I should open to my parents about it. It completely back-fired. They started saying I am good for nothing and won't be capable of doing anything. My parents basically echoed the thoughts I had been having in my head. My dad told me why can't I be normal like other kids. Why can't I go to school enjoy it, talk to other kids, get good grades, pursue hobbies, play sports. Now I am really serious about killing myself because now I have no one to talk to or fall back to. I have friends but I know none of them are real and good friends. I try to talk to them about this and they just say "why can't I be happy and normal". I live in India so any awareness about mental-health is non-existent. My dad refuses to take me to a therapist and I don't know what to do anymore. I haven't done any work in 3 days and I just sleep to numb these feelings.
