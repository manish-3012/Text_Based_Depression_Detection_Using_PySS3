DeadHi

Im 24 and Im broke financially, mentally and physically. I have nothing going for me. I have nothing but my childhood room in my parents house. I was already recluse, but some how quarantine has hyperactivated the banality of life. Its just constantly back and forth between reddit, youtube, checking for food, porn, reddit, youtube, reddit, youtube, porn, food. I seriously have no hope left lol. Ive totally failed at trying to become successful in life. Im studying less and less because it feels like its leading nowhere and 99.9% of my focus and energy is already being allocated to finding a new comfortable position, a new funny video, a cool rabbit hole to get lost in, or absolutely any type of micro/short term instant escape from the constant pain and despair. Its so hard to think about the future when the right now itself is so bleak and draining. A lot of small things that add up big time like staying focused on reading with no real silence, or physical comfort. 

Ive justified my situation in every way from 'this is all my responsibility/karma etc' to 'i never asked to be here and fuck these people' and seemingly everywhere in between only to end up right back again. 

Every week passes exponentially faster, and seems so close yet so far in memory. Like how has it only been 7 days, but 7 years, but 7 minutes. Nothing makes sense anymore its like its all blobbing up into one big grey goo. 

Im already on my bed almost 24/7, might as well rest in peace.

But still, even typing that its like ok then do it then? What am I waiting for? Im such a failure.
