Everything I think I am is a lie to myself. I am worthless.I lied to everyone I loved. I used to tell tall tales to make my boring life seem more interesting and it escalated to a point where it was slanderous towards certain people. I eventually built such a horrible web of lies that I lost myself in it. I fabricated an attractive but hurt person and I enjoyed my little persona. But now I am realizing I am nothing that I said I was. Some things were delusions and others were flat out lies. I eventually cut off all my relationships. This worked well for the pain until I fell for an exchange student, but now she is gone. She was everything to me, and like everything good in my life, she is gone. And today I snapped. After walking down the city street being called ugly by multiple girls on multiple occasions, I lost my mind. How am I supposed to love others if there is nobody who will love me? I am going to die alone. Why not expedite the process?
