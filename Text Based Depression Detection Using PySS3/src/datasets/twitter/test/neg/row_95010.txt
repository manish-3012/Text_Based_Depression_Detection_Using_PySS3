In a super dark place right nowJust sat here wishing I was dead. The only real reason I haven't  is because I don't want to hurt family/gf. I know they'll be better off without me in the long run but it'll just cause too much pain. 

Tried to make the thoughts go away. Tried meds (and almost convinced myself they were working) and now I don't know what to do, so I'm bearing all to you, strangers of reddit.
