HelpWell I went to a university and I had bad semesters so I was dismissed , I couldnâ€™t cut it I was lazy and stupid. Now I have to tell my parents and Iâ€™m so scared for their reaction my dad will probably hit me and my mom will see me as a failure and disown me like my family, I had high expectations.  I most likely will get kicked to the streets. I honestly think suicide is the way out . Any suggestions. Please
