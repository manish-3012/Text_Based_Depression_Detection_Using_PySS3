Can't go on with out herSo today I snaped a little more then normal, sent my ex about 12 crying facebook voice messages and a crying phone call. She was mad and said why are you doing this to me and why can't you leave me be.

It's been 5months since she cheated on my and left me for him almost right away. Haven't been in much contact since I try now and then at first alot but most the time she is unresponsive.

I can't eat and can barely work or function as she is all I think about 100% of the time.

I don't have any family or friends she was my everything and can't go on with out her.
