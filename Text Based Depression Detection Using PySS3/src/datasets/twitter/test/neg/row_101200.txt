Iâ€™m not ok, I havenâ€™t been for a whileI keep masquerading through my days pretending like everything is fine and peachy, but I donâ€™t feel that way. I hate being alone or by myself because Iâ€™m alone with my horrible thoughts. I am filled with regret for certain life decisions and I donâ€™t know how to cope. I donâ€™t really have a support system. The folks who say they care donâ€™t know how to help and they donâ€™t really try to help. I used to be medicated for depression, but with my insurance, itâ€™s like why even bother. Suicide has more or less been a constant prevailing thought in my brain. I donâ€™t have a plan or anything, I just want to be gone.
