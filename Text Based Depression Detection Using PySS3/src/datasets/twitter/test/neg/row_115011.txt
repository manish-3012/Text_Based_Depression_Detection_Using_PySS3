A lot of people tell me they hate me and that I make their lives difficult and miserable.I feel so miserable and painful, and I feel like I'm hurting everyone else. I just want the pain to go away.

O happy dagger. This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die.

EDIT: Also I forgot to mention that it's my parents who say they hate me (and a few other people). Everyone else just says they're annoyed by me or I make their life difficult or something like that.
