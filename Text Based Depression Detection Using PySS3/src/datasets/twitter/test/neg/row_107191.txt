SuicideWhat if eternal nothing is better than suffering. Why does everyone want to â€˜save meâ€™. Iâ€™m not happy here Iâ€™m suffering. And if u say thereâ€™s ppl who care there isnâ€™t. Iâ€™m here in America by myself. My mom hates me cuz Iâ€™m my dads son and she hates him. My family back home doesnâ€™t care cuz they hate my mom. Itâ€™s all bad here and I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m holding on anymore. Iâ€™m only happy when Iâ€™m asleep and when I wake up I feel like I get punched in the stomach with reality
