I want to end it. I was once happy. But I haven't felt that in over 2 months. I was degraded in front of the people I thought cared, then exiled away from everything. I tried my hardest to fight through this feeling, but I just can't anymore. I cared so much about them but I was just another piece of trash for them to piss on.

It's been 6 weeks now, they continue to take everything and everyone I thought I had and continue to blame me for everything. Nobody is perfect and in our group we messed about quite a lot. Some more than others, and if we had a problem we'd talk to each other about it. But not this time, I was literally kicked. And now I sit in this classroom surrounded by them and all I can think about is going home and ending my life. I need help. I feel so empty but so full with thought of death. Help.
