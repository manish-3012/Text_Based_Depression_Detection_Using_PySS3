Talking with all of you has helped a tiny bitMost of my talking has been responses to people and I don't even know if they are seeing it, but I am still getting out some part of me and it's good. I haven't felt anything this whole day and that hasn't been changed by talking to people, but I want to die even just a little bit less. I honestly don't know though.
