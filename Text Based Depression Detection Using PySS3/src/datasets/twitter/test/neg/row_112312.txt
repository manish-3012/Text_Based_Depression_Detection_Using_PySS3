I donâ€™t know.Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about it lately. Honestly, the main thing holding me back from doing it is my mom. More specifically, the pain she will endure if I did go through with it. I canâ€™t help myself but to think this is the only way, regardless of how much I would love to believe otherwise. I am a very secretive person, I do not speak about my problems to anyone at all. I hate feeling like a charity case, and especially to feel like someone is â€œfeeling sorryâ€ for me. I know that everybody goes through shit, I understand that we all have problems. I donâ€™t want to mention what my problems are, but trust me it has been taking a toll on me for a very long time. Iâ€™ve been trying to justify committing suicide to myself, but even in death I donâ€™t want to hurt my mom. Sometimes when I drive late at night I close my eyes hoping that I crash into something and just end it all. I make stupid judgement calls that could end up in me dying, and all on purpose. It feels like Iâ€™ve been in pain for as long as I can remember
