I push people away so that I won't hurt anyoneFor almost the whole time I've been actively suicidal, the only thing keeping me here were my friends, the ones that I'd never want to hurt. Every time I try to kill myself, I get overwhelmed with guilt because of the sorrow I'd leave in my wake. So over time my depression has just pushed everyone I loved away. Some times it happens on its own, like my girlfriend becoming ever more distant. However, other times I can tell that I'm intentionally pissing people off, being cold, and ignoring those that I loved the most. I've literally made no new friends since it's started and I've reached out to nobody because I don't want to hurt any more people than I'm already going to. On 'good' days, I fear that I'll push my last friend away, because the next attempt that I make will have nothing holding me back. But deep down, I'm glad that I going to have nobody, because then I can finally lay myself to rest.
