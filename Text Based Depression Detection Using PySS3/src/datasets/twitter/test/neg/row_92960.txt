I hope i can share thisOver the past few months my life has all but fallen apart. The job I was working towards fired me, and it wasn't even my fault. The boss at the job I'm at now hates me. And my girlfriend doesn't love me like she used to. She always wants attention but when I ask it she never gives it. And I love her so I can't break up with her just yet...my family is entirely disappointed in me and I'm in debt that I can barely pay off from this job. I want to just die if I'm being honest...and I don't know what to do to stop it...
