I see everyone despising quarantine for couple of weeks imagine living that lifeNobody wants to be my friends. Those who do eventually ghost I donâ€™t know what have I done to deserve that. Maybe Iâ€™m not good enough for the world. I just want to die when no one cares for me because that way it really wouldnâ€™t matter when I go.
