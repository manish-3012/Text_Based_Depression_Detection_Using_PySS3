[NOVEL] I don't know what I'm doing or where I'm going or how to be a person.I only feel like I'm breathing. Yeah, I'm so muddled in the mind that THAT was the best I can come up with to explain.


I'm sixteen, my favorite person in the world killed themselves two months and three days ago and I can't handle it. I can't breathe. I'm too goddamn aware of the oxygen in my body and it feels nice but I also hate it? Shit I literally don't know. She was my english teacher. She helped me with everything. I told her EVERY DARK SECRET I HAD AND SHE DIED WITH THEM. She hung herself. I'm seeing a shrink now and I've only gone twice but I kind of think it's a waste of time. I can't get down to the important things. I'm too afraid to. I don't want to be put in a crazy place or taken away from my mom. I love my mom, she's just really crazy sometimes. And only sometimes. All I do with my shrink is talk about my day. She already knew about my teacher because my school made me come to her and whatnot. I don't know. I just actually do not know.


I hate being at school. Less than 300 kids total, everyone knows your name and face and damn social security number. Bible belt bullshit. That's actually part of what I think caused her to kill herself but that's a really long story. On the 2 month anniversary I had a panic attack within the first hour of being at school and had to go home. I kept seeing her everywhere in everything. I talked to my guidance counselor who is THE ONLY PERSON to ever make me feel better about it and she's leaving to go to a different school tomorrow which is really damn fantastic.


I've been depressed for three years at least. It was horrible last year. My teacher helped me. Got on meds. Things were kind of okay. Then she died. I stopped taking them because they made me have nightmares to begin with, but when she died I just saw her in one and couldn't do it. And also because of a discussion I had with her about me getting on meds, long story short I knew she had been on them for depression and had stopped taking them... So, in a messed up way a part of me wanted to be where she was at that time because I needed t understand. I've been off them since august.


Shrink is getting me new meds soon but that's not the issue. Long story fucking short, i feel like time is a really thick, strong ass rubber band that is floating a direction and i am a solid object in its path. The damn rubber band doesn't stop moving, but it suffocates the object, strangling it, creating more and more and more and more tension.. Horrible example but that's all I can think of. Everything needs to STOP.


I don't want to kill myself, exactly? I don't want to be in pain. I don't want to know anything is coming. I don't want to hurt my so-called friends and my family. I don't want anyone to suffer as much as I am. really I'm just rambling here like there s nothing I could say to make you grasp this pain unless you just know. ...I just want to cease to me. More than anything. God, dear fucking god I would give anything in this world to never have been born, or to be shot in the head at a random time that I'd never know, or carbon monoxide, or a really quick and painless accident... I'd give anything. But I don't want to hurt people. I'm kind of afraid if something sets me off the brink I won't care about hurting anyone and I'll do it anyway. I don't know. The whole carbon monoxide thing looks really nice. I don't know.
