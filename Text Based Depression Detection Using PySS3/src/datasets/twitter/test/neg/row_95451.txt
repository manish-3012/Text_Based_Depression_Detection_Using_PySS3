FianceSo I have been dating/talking/in a very awesome relationship with a girl from highschool.  I love her so much.  We've been in a relationship for well over a year.  She's amazing. Or she was.  Recently she decided that she couldn't handle any relationships beyond her kids and her parents (Her step dad may be dying. He's in his 90s).  I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I'm very depressed.  I love her so much but I don' know what to do.  I want to do the right thing, give her space, etc, I hope her stepdad doesn't die. He's amazing.  But. I'm stuck. I am at a loss. I want to help but she hasn't talked to me for like 2 months. I'm not sure what to do. I'm stuck.   Please help. I don't know what to do. :/
