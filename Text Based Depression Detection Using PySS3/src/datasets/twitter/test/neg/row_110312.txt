Ten Years LaterIt has been ten years since I first tried to kill myself. I was just a fucking kid, but I'm only alive now because people interfered when I didn't want them to.

That moment plays in my mind so many times every day. The waking up. The oxygen mask. The blurred vision. The anger that i'm alive. 

And now i'm here. Ten years later. Crying my eyes out because I am so fucking tired of being alive, so fucking tired of everyone leaving or killing themselves. 

I'm ready to kill myself. I did have a note but I deleted it. I constantly hear the dead people talk to me in my mind, I figured it would hurt anyone who read that note, if they had to hear the dead version of myself talk. 

I'm going to kill myself, because the isolation is killing me. I haven't "hung out" with a "friend" in over three years. Nobody has hugged me, told me things will be okay, shown the slightest interest in who I am or my life; so I'm confident I won't be missed.

I don't want you to talk me out of it. I want someone to talk to me; just for a while. So I can leave with a good day in my head. Please.
