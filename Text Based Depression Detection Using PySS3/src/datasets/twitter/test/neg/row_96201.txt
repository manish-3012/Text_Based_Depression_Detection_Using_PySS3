Should I just kill myself?I've been bullied and abused my whole life by everyone I've ever known or just met. No one has ever or will ever like me. The only time people act interested in me is to bully or abuse me. I've learned in this world that deep down everyone's crazy, selfish, no one likes or loves anyone, and nothing matters but money. There's really no reason for me or anyone to live. We're all just wasting time until we die. In a hundred years, we'll all be dead and no one will care or remember us. It'll be like we never existed.
