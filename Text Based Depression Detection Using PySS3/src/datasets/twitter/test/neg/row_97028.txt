I want to die, but can'tFucked up my one chance at freedom from this hell, now I'm fucking stuck and miserable. Wanna know the best part? For a time, I actually believed it would get better, found someone I thought loved me, thought I wouldn't be alone anymore, haha, what a fucking fool I am. I have nothing now, God, I want to fucking die so badly.
