Vent and AppreciationHi everyone - first of all, Iâ€™d like to thank everyone who is active in this thread; from those who post and show others they are not alone to those who comment on posts and try to positively support ops. Props and respect to everyone for the support; this isnâ€™t an easy thing to cope with, and Iâ€™m grateful for this thread. 

Iâ€™m at a spot in life where I donâ€™t really have anywhere to vent, and didnâ€™t want to bring up anything possibly triggering in the bipolar thread I usually post in. Thank you guys for giving me somewhere to vent. I dropped out of high school due to mental health struggles and pushed forward to get my GED, followed by getting into college. Iâ€™ve been holding a 4.0 GPA, but itâ€™s taking a lot out of me to do so. My bipolar has gotten considerably worse lately - Iâ€™m either having a manic episode or unable to complete any tasks/unable to organise my thoughts as Iâ€™m so depressed. My relationship of 2 years has been rocky lately; I want to fix that, but have very little energy leftover after coping with mental health to do so. Iâ€™ve been (TW) constantly thinking about trying to overdose on my medication - for the sake of any mods who may read this, I can keep myself safe, I just needed somewhere to get these thoughts out. I am in regular contact with my psychiatrist and have alerted those close to me about my concerns. Again, just needed somewhere to vent without those who know me seeing it, as theyâ€™ve already been alerted and donâ€™t want to make them stress more. 

Thank you again to anyone who may read this and thank you to anyone who takes their time to respond to posts like these - I hope the world sends some good karma your way for your kindness.
