Don't want to wake upI should be happy. I have great parents, friends and an education. Yet I hate my life and I feel stuck, like I will never be able to lead a life that makes me happy. I have a double mastersdegree in a field I really dislike. I'm now looking for a job but I know I will never find one that I like because of my stupid choice in studies, which means that for the rest of my life I will spend 5 days a week, 8 hours a day doing something I don't like and feeling miserable. On top of that I have chronic fatigue, which means that I already don't have a lot of energy and I will be spending the little bit I have on working, not leaving anything for fun things. I know there are people in the world who have it way worse, but I still feel so bad. I don't want to die, but when I go to bed at night I hope I don't wake up in the morning. And when I do wake up I cry because I don't know how to get through another day.

I have been feeling like this for years (before it was for different reasons) and I've been battling this darkness for years. I have never admitted to myself that I have a problem, but now I hit a wall and I have no choice but to realise I have to do something. Getting this off my chest anonymously was a first step. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.
