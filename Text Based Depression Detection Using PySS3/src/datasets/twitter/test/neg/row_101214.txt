What is the point of living when I am so unhappy?Its a serious question.  Why do I have to put myself through day after day of barely living.  I'm an anxious mess.  I have a panic attack if I need to leave the house.  I'm home with my kids all day and I really think I'm screwing them up.  I cry all the time, I can't get basic things done, and I can only drive locally.  I have two very young kids.  They are why I am still here.  I know it would be messed up for them to have to grow up knowing mommy committed suicide.   I don't want to mess them up.  I don't want my baby walking around asking where mommy is.  But I really don't think its healthy for them to be around me all day the way I am.  I'm sorry if this is all over the place.  I don't know why I'm even posting.   I'm in the midst of an anxiety attack.  I'm just tired of doing this.  I'm not really sure it will ever get better.  I want out, but I feel stuck and weighed down.  I've never felt so trapped.
