Suicidal thoughts come and go but yesterday I made a planHey guys,
Probably about a year ago or so I posted here for the first time, and the majority of people told me to speak to a doctor. (Since then I deleted the post)
Recently I did hat and got a diagnosis and was prescribed medication. It seems like my friends abandoned me as soon as this happened.
Now the thing is the medicine seems to make me giddy at random times of the day, and other than those weird spikes I don't feel any different.
When this was happening, my doctor said it was pepie who already know how hey would kill themselves that worry her, which I had never made an actual plan before.
But yesterday, after a friend broke plans for the millionth time I was in my truck and I visualized how I could kill myself. I visualized mixing every bit of medicine I have and I figured downing all of it would definitely do the trick. 
Obviously I didn't do that because I am still here today, but I think my mental instability is getting worse. What do I do? Someone help me because I don't want to die.
If this post has a bunch of typos that's because I'm shit faved at a Chinese restaurant. If not, we can praise the iPhone for its autocorrect capabilities. If I don't kill myself soon I'll probably delete this again when I'm sober. Thanks a bunchhhhhh.
