Message to somewhereI feel love struck tonight, memories of an old dream are flooding my mind and because of that thought it pulled the right heart strings. Which is funny to me because I am not someone who believes in love. I am sure that is not what you want to hear. Long ago I wrote some words here on this site. I believed that somehow the universe would do its thing and would meet two people who were meant for each other. I had an idealistic sense, but something about it is making me feel tonight what I felt then. It's the possibility, not the guarantee why I find myself writing these words. A sort of wager on my part. That somehow for some reason this message would reach out to someone, and that the unexpected could happen. Before reality hits again, and I realize that this is a mistake, I would like to try and dream again. And if we are lucky enough, the impossible will lighten us.
