Existing is painfulI just can't bear my own existence. I have been barely holding on just for the sake of not hurting my friend by leaving them alone in this world but I can't anymore. All I do is suffer and distract myself from suffering. My future is hopeless. I just want this pain to end. I want to disassemble my razor and slit my wrists but I'm too scared to actually do it. Not scared to die but scared to fail and end up with permanent damage that makes my life even worse. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. Or just push a button and stop existing. This was supposed be a suicide note but I'm realizing it's not gonna happen today. I'm tired. I'm just going to sleep I guess. Here's hoping I don't wake up.
