Wife Pregnant, family a little too supportive.I've been recovering from a head injury for over two years that has caused emotional disregulation to the point of 3 ER trips due to Suicidal idelation. My wife and I decided I was not in a good place to raise a child and we're putting it up for adoption.

My dad offered to drive me to work today while my car was out and while I was trapped in the car with him he offered me $50'000 to keep the baby. He claims to be "supportive of [me]" but really he just wants a grandchild. 

I don't think he takes how severe my mental state in and it just makes me want to kill myself to prove him wrong. I'm living with them now because we can't afford rent (medical bills plus not working) but honestly I'd rather be back out on the street.
