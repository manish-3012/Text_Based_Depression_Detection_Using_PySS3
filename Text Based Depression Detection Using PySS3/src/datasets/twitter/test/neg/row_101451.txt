Iâ€™m so tired of this(throwaway for obvious reasons). 

School starts next week. Itâ€™s my last full semester of college and Iâ€™m excited to be done but as day 1 approaches, Iâ€™m overwhelmed with the cost of textbooks, the impending state of constant stress, the workload, the pressure to balance work and classes. 

Iâ€™m trying to get licensed to sell insurance part-time so I can leave my shitty retail job, but I barely have time to study for the exam right now. Iâ€™m already anticipating receiving a failing grade for the exam and having to tell my boyfriend and parents that I didnâ€™t get the job, already feeling like a failure. I still have my shitty retail job but I know that Iâ€™m going to explode if I have to work there much longer. 

And then thereâ€™s the anxiety about my future career. What if Iâ€™m not a good teacher? What if my students donâ€™t succeed? What if Iâ€™m having a bad mental health day and it affects my students? What if a student comes to me for help with their own mental health problems and I canâ€™t help them because Iâ€™m already overwhelmed with my own? 

Just everything is too much, too exhausting. Iâ€™m fucking tired. I donâ€™t want to dump this on my boyfriend because he already has so much of his own shit going on in his own life and I donâ€™t want to add to it. Plus it can be hard explaining/rationalizing my feelings and anxieties and stresses to someone else. Iâ€™m scared that no oneâ€™s going to understand how I feel, no oneâ€™s going to listen to me, no oneâ€™s going to say anything other than â€œyou got this! just donâ€™t give up!â€ or some bullshit like that. Iâ€™ve been trying not to give up for over a decade now. Iâ€™m tired and I want to be done. 

Sorry for ranting, thank you for reading.
