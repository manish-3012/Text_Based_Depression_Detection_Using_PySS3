I feel like I'm never going to get better.I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and issues from bullying for as long as I can remember, and now as a young adult, I can't get my life together because of it. I'm never going to get better. I can barely function. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've been hospitalized three times over the past 4 years, tried to kill myself twice as many times. No medications work. I've spent god knows how many hours in counseling. I barely made it through college. I applied and got accepted into the Peace Corps after I graduated, which is a dream I've had since I was a teenager and that really kept me going. They took my invitation back because of my suicide attempts and hospitalizations. I got accepted into WorldTeach, but also can't go cause of my shit brain. Everything that I've ever wanted has slipped through my fingers. The regular job that I had stressed me out to the point I attempted and wound up in the hospital again. I don;t know what to do. I live at home, I'm broke, and I'm incredibly isolated. I feel so worthless. Everyone in my life would be better without me. All I do is piss off my dad and worry my mom. My best friend deserves a better person than me in her life. But I'm really, really trying, ya know?
