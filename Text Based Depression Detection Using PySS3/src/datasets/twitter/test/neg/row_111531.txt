I can't decide if I want to keep going or just quit now while I'm ahead. (Crosspost from /r/depression)I've been trying to find a job, and I actually got hired about 2 months ago now at Arby's but they have yet to put me on schedule or anything so I haven't worked or earned any money yet. And probably won't according to the manager now until sometime next week. I've already used the 100$ that was given to me at [1] /r/assistance that was supposed to be for gas because I was supposed to have started working last week but they keep pushing me around. So now I'm broke with a job that I don't even work at 20 miles away.

I may be failing my interpersonal communications class, I hate it, the teacher there doesn't even speak English properly. If I fail I lose my Pell Grant but I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I'm thinking about taking a short term course for web development.

I still miss my ex girlfriend, I'm in pain every day and think about her constantly even though it's been almost a year and we only dated for 9 months, but it was the only real relationship I've ever been in, and 4 months after we started dating I moved into her new apartment with her and lived with her there until she broke up with me.

Between not working even though I have a job, being 21 and living with my mom again, not knowing what to make out of my life, and being still madly and hopelessly in love and constantly reminded of someone who doesn't even talk to me anymore and is dating someone else. I'm thinking maybe it would be easier if I just killed myself. Cause I don't know what else to do.
