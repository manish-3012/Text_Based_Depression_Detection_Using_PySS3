I dont want to feel anymoreFuck. I have the greatest family, the most amazing friends, and i dont want to be with them anymore. Im tired of living. Maybe its the covid depression. I dont know but so much shit is happening in the world. Why are we like this? Why is there so much fucking hate in thsi world. Why is everythjng fucking about money? I know there are obvious answers but fuck this. I hate thinking i hate watching all the things going on in the world and letting it rip each other up. I hate everything. I wish after death there was nothing. No soul left behind. I wanna just not wake up. I am drowning myself in weed
