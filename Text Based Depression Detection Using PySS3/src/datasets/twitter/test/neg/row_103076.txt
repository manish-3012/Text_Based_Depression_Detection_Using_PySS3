I donâ€™t knowIâ€™ve always had one problem in my life that always stops me from doing anything in life. It was just me being ugly. I wouldâ€™ve got so many things in life but from the looks Iâ€™ve got from people they instantly doubted me. Iâ€™m 16 and I went to a military camp for 6 months to â€œrehabilitateâ€ myself. I hated myself so I would smoke and drink to feel something since I know Iâ€™ll never be with a female to feel love or anything like that. I really thought me losing weight would make me feel more confident and thatâ€™s all I needed but no as soon as I get back I try to mix in with some people and I still get called ugly and get pushed away. Before you tell me I have so much of my life to live and I havenâ€™t seen nothing I donâ€™t believe it. My face isnâ€™t gonna change and neither is this damn way I feel. Iâ€™m thinking whatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m not gonna be able to enjoy life and just be alone. Iâ€™m so tired of being alone and being called ugly and pushed away. Mabye one of these days it might push my mind too far. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of not fitting in anywhere.
