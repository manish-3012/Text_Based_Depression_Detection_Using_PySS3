Please ignore.The universe has no meaning. No "magic" as I like to call it. It's all just, for lack of a better term, boring. I feel once I subscribed to nihilism, I saw the universe for what it really was. Void of any real excitement. Love is chemical, making any feeling of it seem fake and easily explainable. Passions can by explained as something you simply like doing. (firing off those feel good chemicals!!) And my friends are only my friends because our ape brain thinks it needs companionship for survival still.


One of the biggest examples of my worldview are the great wonders of the world. Some old pyramids, a huge hole, and other mundane structures. I don't think I'll ever feel wonderment. I feel like once you see it in a picture/video then you've experienced it. Because of this, I feel as if I've experienced everything life has to offer. I'm bored. I wish to find something in the damn universe that's beyond our imagination. Something we can't explain. And not things like dreams, which can be explained as memory aids, or whatever else....

I'm just venting I guess. I feel I'm going down a dangerous path honestly. A path that'll lead to self destruction because I can't find anything worth truly living for. It's all bullshit, and I seriously think suicide is a way way way better alternative than being ripped from the void and forced to be apart of this shit life.
