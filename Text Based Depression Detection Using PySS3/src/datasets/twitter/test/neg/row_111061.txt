Killing myself in my dreams?I've been deeply suicidal for about 5 months now and I've started killing myself in my dreams, and it actually makes me feel very happy. I pray that I'll be killed in a car accident or murdered in a back alleyway or something. I just want to die, but don't want to commit suicide.
