Don't like feeling like thisSo I'm in my last year of college and I lost a close relative. Now it feels like I don't want to work on my course work anymore, let alone think about all the hardships after college. Like getting a job and find a place to stay again, idk I guess I'm just really tired of forging ahead and wish I didn't have to take care of things I should anymore. I won't commit suicide because I don't want my siblings or little cousins to say they wish they could've known what I was like. So I guess what my question to all of you would be, how do you get the motivation to go out and get what you need to get done done? Thank you any and all input is greatly appreciated.
