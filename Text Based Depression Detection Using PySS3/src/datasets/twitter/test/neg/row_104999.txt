TitleI'm a junior in high school and it has gotten to the point where I feel like life really isn't worth living anymore. I think I must have some kind of bad seasonal depression because every year around this time I start to get anxiety attacks and cut myself. It's been particularly bad this year and I would reach out for help, but I'm not really sure where to go. When my mom found out I cut myself last year she told me to leave, eventually apologizing days later and I went to a therapist afterwards who I found to be particularly unhelpful. I'm not close to my family and I don't talk about emotional stuff with my friends much. I've also lost complete interest in my hobbies and my motivation to work hard at school is gone. Although I don't think I'll ever end up killing myself (since it'd be pretty hard to do without someone finding me) I find it painful to really do anything. This whole time I've had a voice in my head telling me that everything I do is an overreaction and that I'm fine but I think its time I say I need help. Everything was fine a month ago but now I don't think I can keep going.
