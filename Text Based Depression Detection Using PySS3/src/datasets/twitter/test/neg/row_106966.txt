I'm scaredI just saw myself standing on the edge of a bridge. Ready to jump. I've been suffering from severe depression for 3 months. I had a few thoughts about suicide. But this really scares me. I don't know how to deal with something like this. Did anybody else experience anything like this and how did you deal with it?
