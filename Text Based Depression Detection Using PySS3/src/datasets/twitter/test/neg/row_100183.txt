How do parents commit suicide?Not physically but mentally? Like how do they get past the feeling of what will happen to their children? 
I have a 15 year old daughter and while Iâ€™m in a relationship I am still her sole parent and have been her whole life. We have been living with my partner for 5 years, been together for 3, we were flat mates first. 
Last night my partner and I had an arguement it was a miscommunication issue which was soon resolved. My daughter walked out saying she doesnâ€™t want to be around us fighting, understand but we rarely have disagreements and I feel like it was something more underlying.

Well I woke up this morning and I seriously feel like I actually just want to kill my self, I hate everything about myself, I feel like a bad parent, a bad partner, Iâ€™m broke I have no job I have no one to talk to, no one at home will talk to me! Iâ€™m fat Iâ€™m ugly and no matter how hard I try to change it all I just canâ€™t get happy!!!

The only thing that keeps me alive is knowing my daughter wonâ€™t cope, Iâ€™m all she has! How can I leave her? But how can I live?
I hate my life I hate everything about my life I honestly just want to die
