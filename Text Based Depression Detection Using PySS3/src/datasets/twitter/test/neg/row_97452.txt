Going to see a doctor today  

Hey guys,

This is my first post here. I have come to realise that my marriage is falling apart last week. I have asked r/relationship_advice a short while ago asking for advice on how to deal with the Mother in Law. ([link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bo1w1u/i_feel_like_i_am_married_to_the_mil_as_well/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))

&amp;#x200B;

Following the advice I received I tried on multiple occasions to talk to the wife but she wonâ€™t have any of it and wonâ€™t talk about it. She said that Iâ€™m the one with the problem and that I need to get over myself and accept her being a part of our life.

&amp;#x200B;

The past two/three weeks I have been feeling empty. Nothing. I just plough on, on auto-pilot. When my wife asks me why Iâ€™m grumpy, I tell her that she knows why. She just rolls her eyes.

Thing is we have a kid. There is no situation in which I end up happy. If I leave my wife, I lose everything and donâ€™t get to see my kid much.

I drive 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes back every day. I enjoy the drive. IT helps me relax and listen to my music. Today, however, â€œlâ€™appel du videâ€ called to me. I started thinking about how life would be simpler for everyone if I just slipped. The mortgage would be paid off. My wife would get a hefty payoff. The mother in law will be happy to continue. I am at work so I didn't do anything stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that keeps me happy right now is my kid. One year old. Light in the darkness that is my life.

I called my General Practice surgery and I have an appointment at 11:50 today. They will probably feed me pills and tell me things will get better. We will see.

Sorry for the long drawn out post. Just trying to express how I feel. I guess I just feel like sharing.
