Is it wrong to kill myself for being ugly?I just hate my appearance so fucking much, women, for instance, think I'm just completely disgusting, I'm always rejected, always ignored, and always discarded, when girls see me on the train, I can see their stomachs turn. And, I hate my appearance too, I feel sick whenever I look in the mirror, I see my reflection and want to tear it apart, I want to put a bullet in my head because I'm an ugly fucking bastard
