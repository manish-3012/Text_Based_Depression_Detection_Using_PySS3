How to stop thinking about death? I can't do it anymore.Probably not the best place to ask because if we did know the answer, most of us wouldn't be on this sub. But I can't stop thinking about how death is better than life. Life is cruel and random. Filled with diseases that I'm deathly afraid of (For example, Alzeihmer's. I won't even be able to kill myself then), crime, poverty and all that. 

Plus I'm really afraid of losing my loved ones. I've lost many already, and I don't think I can take it anymore.
