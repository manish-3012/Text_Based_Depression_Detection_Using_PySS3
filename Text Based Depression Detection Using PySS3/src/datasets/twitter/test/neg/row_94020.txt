No reasonI literally have by now no reason anymore to stay alive i swear i tried everything i hoped for everything, i did my best so well. Nothing worked out nothing will work out. Suffering does hurt more than actually dying i guess. U die and its over, everything stops, nobody will hurt you again, nobody will judge you ever. Nobody will say i love u too without even meaning it. Nobody will make u out for a liar anymore, meanwhile u was always real and ur intentions pure. I will find my peace when everything stops. But why why is it so hard to end my life? Why can i harm myself but cant kill? Why am i so scared to do it.
