Love everyone but hate myselfI love life and people but the way I interact with both is not appropriate. I can't connect to anyone or anything anymore, not for the last five years. Medication does not help with being alone all the time. I miss having friends and feeling like anything I did mattered.

I've been in the hospital enough times to know they can't do anything for me there other than sink me into bankruptcy. I have no hope and no reason to live. I'm just barely existing as it is. I feel pathetic and I know I come across that way to other people.

I wish everyone the best and just think they're better off without me. I want to connect to others but would not wish me on anyone else.

I've been stuck in this same room staring at these walls since last December. I'm pretty much ready to be done with this shit. I've started over so many times and failed again and again. There is just something wrong with me or my soul or something. . . I don't want to say cursed, but I think I'm just bad luck or something.
