I can't do it anymoreI have no friends in my school, my friends outside of school are slowly leaving me, my family hates me and is abusive, I've been rejected by whom I considered the closest person to me for years, I'm falling a lot of subjects at school, I suck at my hobbies, I see no future anymore

I don't want anything but to die anymore I don't feel happy anymore I've been constantly depressed for months I just want to die already and I attempted multiple times but it never worked I just hope it finally will
