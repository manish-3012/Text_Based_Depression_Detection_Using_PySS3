I might kill myself APR. 8I'm going to be buying a decoy gun box, so my parents don't notice one of my guns is missing. 

Everyday is just a little bit darker guys. 

I'm not sure if you guys know this, but some of you are a lot stronger than you know. A lot stronger than I will ever be. I know that some of you have been fighting depression, anxiety and any other mental illness for a lot longer than I have. And i just wanted to let you guys know that I'm impressed that some of you made it out till the end.
