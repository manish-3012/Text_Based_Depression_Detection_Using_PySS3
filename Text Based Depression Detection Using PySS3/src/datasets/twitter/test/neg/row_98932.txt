Made the worst decision of my life. Cannot see myself living with it.Hey Reddit,
I just wanted to start off by saying how I was always insecure and never found that much value in myself as a person. But I always just had that one gorgeous friend in high school who was always there for me, saw through my ugliness and was always there to talk to me. Fast forward a year in our second year of college she decided to date me. Seemed like a dream come true. I was the happiest man alive during the honeymoon phase. Then two years passed, we both had ups and downs, but mostly ups. I was happiest during these two years. However, I was clingy, I was emotional and was constantly nagging her and doubted her faithfulness for NO reason. 

She had enough. She was done. The brightest light in life had left. I had threw away my only opportunity of obtaining such a wonderful women both inside and out. She is definitely gone.

 How will I live through this regret? How will I live through knowing that the only time I was able to attract a girl out of my league I fucked up? Now I am left with no ambition, no goals and no interests. I cannot see anyone in the future who could be everything she was. Even if I did, they would never give me the chance like she did for we were best friends for years beforehand. This deep sense of tremendous loss infinitely compounds my feeling of regret of shame that I just cannot take it anymore. Someone talk to me!
