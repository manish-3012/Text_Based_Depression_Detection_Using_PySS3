I don't understand why I feel suicidal again.I've been struggling with a couple of mental illnesses (I was professionally diagnosed, no self-diagnosing on this post) and suicidal thoughts since I was a pre-teen (I'm 18 now). At one point, when I was 12-14, it was the worst it has ever been. I was being bullied pretty severely and even though I was young, I felt like my life had no purpose. I have never tried to commit suicide before, but I did self-harm for about 4 years.

Since I started high school, I started to get better. I'm not bullied anymore, but I still have trouble making friends, feeling positive about myself, etc. If anything, from the outside, my life is getting better everyday. I just got accepted into one of the best nursing programs in my entire state and I'm finally graduating in a couple months. But for some reason, I feel like I'm being really depressed again. I can't really pinpoint why. I've also caught myself having thoughts of suicide and self-harm, which is scary. I haven't had thoughts this bad in a couple years.

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just needed to get it off of my chest somehow.
