Should I be concerned...This weekend was pretty bad and earlier today I was Googling some stuff about suicide and spent a good chunk of time on this site that goes over the effectiveness of various suicide methods. I guess the good thing is that I found out the way I might have tried to kill myself years ago was the least effective method. But then I discovered a method I'd never really thought about. The more I thought about it, I was like... interesting.

It's kinda sorta filed away in the back of my mind now. I was going to text someone about it. Tell them I was thinking about suicide, but I ultimately didn't because I didn't want to freak them out or make them panic. I feel a little better now. But I wonder if I should have. That information's in my head now. It's a Plan Z if I ever need a plan. I think I should be more disturbed than I actually am. Maybe I am subconsciously? Idk
