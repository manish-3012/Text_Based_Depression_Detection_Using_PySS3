left on read by therapisthey guys I'm Very new here but I've exhausted all of my options/my dwindling support group and I'd really appreciate someone to talk through these things with. I have tried reaching out to my therapist because all of my scales are at 10 today and I can't afford another inpatient visit this year, but have heard nothing back. I hate to burden my friends with this because I feel like I'm always the problematic one. I've been trying the lifeline chat but I don't necessarily trust it. My next therapy appointment isn't until January. I just need to stop feeling this way. I hate feeling unsafe with myself. I don't want to subsequently hurt my friends or family.
