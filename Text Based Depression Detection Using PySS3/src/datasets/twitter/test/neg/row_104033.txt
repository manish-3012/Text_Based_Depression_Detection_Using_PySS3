Herpes and suicideIs there anyone here thinking about suicide because they have herpes?  I feel as though by not committing suicide I am being a coward.  If I were to die, then I wouldn't pass it on to anyone and the chain would stop with me.  I am afraid I was a coward for too long though, because now I have kids and I know how much it would hurt them if I was dead.  So I guess I have to keep suffering.  Feel like I screwed up being a coward and not taking my life when it was just me.
