messagei wanted to leave something behind that could maybe create more good than i did in my short shitty life. listen if your ears are open.

first, do no harm.
second, love yourself.
thirdly, show love toward living things: kindness + understanding
fourth. the show of love is internal and external simultaneously because it is true.
be kinder to everyone than anyone deserves.
fifth. listen.
sixth. stay frosty. live for now. exist now. if you understand anything, understand now.
seventh. forgive everything. forget nothing.
eighth. be strong to be useful.

these are the things i have found. they worked for a little while. i hope they ultimately help you more than they helped me.
