I can't kill myself because I'm too scared of punishment in the afterlife, but I hope my childhood cancer comes back. Then I can die with the luxury of saying goodbye, my loved ones understanding, and knowing I can't be punished for it.I want to die young so badly, and if I could back 7 years to when I was 13 I would've taken my opportunity then.
