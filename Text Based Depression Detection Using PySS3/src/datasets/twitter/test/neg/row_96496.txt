Asking for help is putting a burden on my best friend?Hi people of reddit. I'm in a really bad place lately, I don't really want to talk about it but basically I've been depressed and trying to deal with suicidal thoughts... My best friend knows that, and she's always patient and good with me if i'm telling her that I feel bad, but she also know most of the time I don't say anything because i'm like that it's just not in me to reach out easily. However, last tuesday I did, I called her and cried over the phone, she was listening and comforting me as best as she could. It was really great and I felt better afterwards but ofc it's not that easy to get rid of such thoughts and problems I know that it's a long way to go and I know that I need therapy ect but I'm on a waiting list for now... So in the meantime i'm just trying to survive.

Last night, I made a suicide attempt.. It was my first one,I already self harm ect but I never really wanted to leave, however this time I really tried by hanging myself but the rope wasn't tied correctly and I fell on the floor after 30 seconds... I feel pathetic,I stayed in bed for 18 hours and I only reached out this afternoon to my best friend and usually I send her a message every morning so she was very worried. I told her everything was ok and she didn't insist and now she's barely talking to me and left me on seen since 5 hours... Do you think I should tell her I need her? Because it's just really make me feel down. I've got a lot of affection issues and I know that I can be too clingy... I feel a little bit down that she never really send me messages to comfort me unless I admit to her I'm having a bad day but I don't know if it's only normal and if it's just me wanting too much from her... She knows almost everything about me and these past months have been really shit... I'm kind of just going crazy over this because she's just so important for me, I don't have a lot of contact with my family because of years of physical and mental abuse, I now leave abroad and alone because of that and she's the only person I really let in so she's like the sister I never had...I'll be glad to hear your thoughts good or bad and I just needed to vent I guess.

Thanks everyone that read so far, I'm sending you all good vibes &lt;3
