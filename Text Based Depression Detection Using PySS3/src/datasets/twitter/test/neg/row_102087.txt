I'm 54, why do I still feel like an angsty teenager?No disrespect to teenagers or younger people.  I'm not saying your pain isn't real or feels any different.

But I kind of feel like I should be over this now.   I should know where I'm going.  Actually all I want is to die.  To no longer have to deal with this confusing world and it's people.   I should be able to make sense of it by now.

Please if you have a gun and spare bullet shoot me.
