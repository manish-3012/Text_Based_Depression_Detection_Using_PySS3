A friend of mine is suicidal.Sheâ€™s a Freshmen. I met her through a school club, and sheâ€™s been suicidal. Sheâ€™s cut herself in the past, although not recently. However, with her boyfriend, things have not been going well. Heâ€™s been distant, refuses to communicate, and just doesnâ€™t seem to care.

The day they got together was the day that she planned to kill herself. But she stopped... he stopped her. And now, their relationship is falling apart. Whatâ€™s more, is she only sees her boyfriend face to face twice in a week, and even then they arenâ€™t alone.

Sheâ€™s dug herself into a ditch, and itâ€™s not going well for her. Sheâ€™s tethered herself to a person who canâ€™t even return the love and affection any relationship calls for.

How do I convince her to keep going?
