I need urgent motivationI have two important exams tomorrow, If I fail them I will lose the year and there's nothing I can do about it.

One part of me wants to study all night and excel but the other one knows that honestly I don't have nothing to do with my life even if pass them, and if I do fail that would be 40k to trash and from there all would go worse until I inevitably kill myself.

Please help me.
