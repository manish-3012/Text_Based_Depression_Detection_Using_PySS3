Existence is agonyFirst of all,sorry for my poor english,the long vent,and my horrible style of writing and incoherence.

I've been diagnosed with psoriasis over 14 years ago.Getting close to my 19th birthday at the moment.This took its toll on me,basically molding me into being a super anxious,akward,fearful and unskilled human that I am today.All people tell me is ignore it and the people bringing this disease up,but already plenty of strangers started conversations with me in the public transport asking questions about whether I've been to the doctor or not and other details about it.
I hold it all to myself,like sweeping garbage under a rug and pretending it isn't there,but each and every interaction with these people is getting more and more unbearable and I want to die more and more after every single one of them.
The reason why I'm posting this now it's because I went to watch a movie with some of my school colleagues.It went pretty well until they stopped at a store to check on some bracelets and stuff.Then,this man who was selling wares in front of the store heard my colleagues telling me I'm going home by myself,for they will have a parent come and take them,and engaged in the conversation telling me that what I have is contagious (false,obviously)  and that it's good I don't have a  girlfriend cause I look like a nerd who is closed in himself and that I should have more self-esteem.I played it nicely.I have no guts whatsoever and he didn't really had that much of a hateful atitude.
It hurt inside so fucking bad that I really wanted to jump in front of the metro in order to just end it all,but I am so pitiful that I don't even have the courage to end my pathetic life.He was right.Every single day of my life I feel as I am somewhere I don't belong at all.I want just a normal life without the constant social pressure and without looking almost like a fallout ghoul.
It doesn't work by going out more,doing exercises,engaging in interactions.It never does.All people can say are over repeated sentences that supposedly help ("It will get better","Don't take it in your heart").I feel like everyone knows their place in this world while I am the only one who gets left out.Having the sensation of inferiority in relation with every single person you meet and knowing there is absolutely no way you will live a normal life and that you are trapped in your own damn body,never having a good memory without someone or something ruining it is the real agony.
I very well know problems are subjective to every person.But I would take debts,cancer or every other disease that does not give the first impression to everyone that I am a mutant in a heartbeat.
I don't know what I want with this post,and I feel a lump in my throat writing this.I am emotionally immature wich perhaps is understandable after constant  years of harassment and jumping from doctors to doctors with my mom cring after every fucking treatment that ends only with cash spent,but I hope that at least by providing the example of a miserable life,with no way out,no way to improve,someone will see it and their perception over their own problems will change,even if slightly.
Thank you for reading,wish you the best whoever you may be.
