Ending it right nowWhen I was 18, I knew that I would be switching careers. I wanted to be in a different field from what I graduated from at university and even said to myself that I'll kill myself at 22 if nothing works out but I have to do my very best in the field I want to switch to. But I'm already 22 and nothing's working out while I did my best to make it work. Every day, I feel more and more inadequate of myself. I just don't think I should be in this place anymore. I only got a few months before I turn 23, I can leave by then.
