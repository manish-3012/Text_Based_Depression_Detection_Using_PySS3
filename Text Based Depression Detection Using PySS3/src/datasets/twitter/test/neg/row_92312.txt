Lonely and SuicidalI'm a 67 year old male. When i was 21 years old I got engaged to a 18 year old girl. I was in love with her fully. She was everything to me, she was my world, my best friend. We did everything together. One night we were out driving around and out of the blue she started to cry. I asked her many times what was wrong and she wouldn't answer me. I asked her if she wanted to go home and she shook her head yes. So I dropped her off at her house and I went home. About two weeks went by and I didn't even go out after work that entire time. One night she came to my house took the engagement ring off her finger and said "I think this belongs to you" and walked away. No explanation, no nothing, she just walked away.I was in shock. I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. It was like a dream in slow motion. A few days passed and I went to the place I hung around with my friends. She was there with a new boyfriend. I stopped my car and asked her to come with me so we could talk. At first she didn't want to but she did. We went for a ride and I pulled over to the side of the road. I couldn't control myself I just lost it and started to cry my eyes out. I got physically sick. She just didn't want to hear anything I had to say, she wouldn't take me back no matter how much I pleaded with her. The next night I went to her house and her mother and farther were there along with one of her brothers. Her mother said that my fiance was pretty upset too. So I thought things might be able to be worked out. Her mother sent her son to go get my fiance. So I waited and waited. When he got back he said she didn't want to come home and see me. Her father looked at me and said if it wasn't meant to be it wasn't meant to be. I will never forget those words. My heart sank. I went home and balled my eyes out. I couldn't eat, sleep, or do anything. I lost all my friends. I could barely do my job at work. I ended up in the hospital with a nervous breakdown. I haven't been the same since. She ended up getting engaged to the guy she was seeing and then broke it off with him too. But she did meet a guy that was 11 years older than her. He bought her a new Corvette they got engaged and got married. They have been married for over 43 years. I have tried to get in touch with her. I have sent letters and Christmas / birthday cards and never got a response, until this March, she sent me a very short note along with most of the cards I sent her back to me. The note said in a nutshell to not try and contact her anymore or she would call the police on me. Well anyway while this was going on I had just recently retired and I ended up very depressed and wrote a suicide note and everything. My world was collapsing around me. I lost pretty much all my friends, I have no interest in doing anything. I called my doctor and when I told him that I wrote the suicide note I was off to the hospital and ended up in a Mental hospital for 9 days. I then went to group therapy for 2 weeks. they put me on Zoloft. I took it for a week or so and then stopped. Now I feel all alone and depressed again. I have thoughts of killing myself over and over. I was with my friend and his wife this weekend and I was feeling so alone I just got up and left. I can't go on like this. Nobody understands the pain I am in. Being alone and unwanted is the worst feeling in the world.  I still miss my ex fiance to this day. I think of her constantly and cry myself to sleep every night thinking of her.
