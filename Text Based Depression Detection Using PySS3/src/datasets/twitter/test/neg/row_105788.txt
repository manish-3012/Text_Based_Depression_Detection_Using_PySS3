Would it be wrong or manipulative to send my mother the /r/offmychest thread that the mother posted about her son killing himself?Warning: the thread is extremely sad. It's about a mother who found her sons reddit account a year after he killed himself and she posted from the same account in great detail how it's absolutely destroyed her.

I only want her to see it so she can understand my pain. It's just so relatable. I don't want to kill myself. I don't EVER want her to go through the shit this mother is going through. But I don't know if sending this to her will make it worse or better. I just want her to "get it" because she keeps saying things like "other people have it so much worse in Africa! How can you be depressed?" which shows that despite my best efforts I simply can't get her to understand my mind state.
