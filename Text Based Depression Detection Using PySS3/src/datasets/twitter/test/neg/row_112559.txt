After my gf leaves me ill kill myselfShe is the only one holding me back from doing it.
I feel so empty I hate everything and everyone and I just don't wanna spend all my life working just to wait for the weekend.
All I would want is a purpose but I can't find it i try so hard I try to tell myself but I can't find a good one.
Idk when she will leave me honestly I wouldn't want it but at the same time I want it to happen she is amazing and I dont think I deserve her. After she will do it ill just kill myself very ez Ill just get drunk like I usually do get a ton of sleeping pills and just hope that I won't wake up anymore In the morning.
Life sucks so much like I'm 16 and feeling like this and there is even kids that's feel the same and no one is helping them yall people crazy I dont understand this shit...
