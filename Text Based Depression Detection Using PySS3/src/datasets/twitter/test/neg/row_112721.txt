No motivationI don't want to grow up or get a job or go to college. There's so much pointless stress in life, yet if you want to enjoy any part of life you have to go through twice to struggle to get there. I've gone through therapy and taken medication. I pretended to be better so I didn't stress my parents and so I didn't have to go to my therapist again. I don't understand why I haven't taken my life. Maybe it's fear, idk. I don't care to better myself because whatever the future holds for me doesn't seem worth it in the end.
