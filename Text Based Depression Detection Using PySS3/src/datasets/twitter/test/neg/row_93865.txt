Pills and counseling wonâ€™t workIâ€™ve tried antidepressants and counseling 

Iâ€™m just a shit person

Iâ€™m not meant to get what I want, only what I need

Iâ€™m supposed to live to work, eat, sleep, and over and over again 

Iâ€™ve tried to make things happen but I fail 

Iâ€™m unattractive, Iâ€™ve lost the people I loved, Iâ€™ve tried so hard

These people wanna tell me thereâ€™s always someone there

But thatâ€™s not the case, they care but they just donâ€™t want your death on their hands 

I get it, they have their troubles too

But why do I have to keep getting new issues everyday?

Why canâ€™t I just say â€œitâ€™ll be okâ€? Instead of â€œwhatâ€™s next?â€

Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m fucking sick of it all
