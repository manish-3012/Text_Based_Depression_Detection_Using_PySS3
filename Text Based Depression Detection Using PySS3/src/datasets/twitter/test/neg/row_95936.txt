this is goodbye 

I've been on a hiatus from reddit for a bit. EDIT: I feel like I'm ready to give up on life. Not due to this but just so much shit built up overtime. If I go to sleep and I wake up the same I think it's time for me to leave earth.

This summer has been a learning experience for me and pretty much changed my life. (Just backstory I am 16M and the girl in question is 18F, I am a junior she is a senior.) I guess 3 weeks ago I met a girl through my best friend's girlfriend, (Let's call her Jen) as she was trying to set me up with someone since I was still hooked up on a girl I met a year and a half ago. Said girl and I were best friends but long story short she played me and told me she loved me when she just used me and it took me until I met this girl to really forget about her. So when she first introduced me to her with a couple pictures over text I was skeptical and not really that interested. I was given the opportunity to meet her in real life and by hanging at Jen's house. I was a bit nervous and she was more beautiful than the photos I saw, so we started talking and immediately hit it off. She is into art with a little bit of fashion and I'm into fashion with a little bit of art. We bonded over our love of Frank Ocean and had the same favorite song from him. At this point I was starting to see something and was a bit infatuated with her.

I and my friend were invited to a party at her friend's grandparents house, or should I say mansion. During the day I could not eat at all because I was so nervous. I've never felt like that around a girl. At the party all is going well and I decide to finally ball up and ask to kiss her, she say yes we kiss. Dude that shit felt magical. We were in a pool and she's 5' and im 6' so she was like wrapping her legs around me and I just felt so happy for the first time in a long time. I had been dealing with depression and domestic issues, so this just made me feel so free. (Also I was intoxicated) We kept talking and having fun and eventually she had to leave, I made the mistake of grabbing her butt, although I asked she seemed hesitant in saying yes and I later found out from Jen that she wants to take things slow as her Ex really messed with her feelings. Ok, I get that.

She left the US for 2 weeks after that and that entire time I could not take my mind off of her I would just replay any memories I had of her and I started going to the gym and really working out hard so I could bulk up and (hopefully) impress her. Jen told me she wanted a relationship with me but wanted to take it slow, I was overjoyed and just felt euphoric. I overthought so much to the point of she'd start showing up in my dreams and it would fuck me up and leave me feeling empty and confused when I woke up. 2 days ago I went to that same place for another party with her and my buds. She seemed nervous and avoided me during the party and once I got a couple drinks in me I started to just feel sad and like I'm scaring her. We chatted a little bit but it was just small talk. A bunch of her friends start to show up, I was hitting it off them when one approached me and told me that she "didn't want anything with anyone." At this point I was a little bit past the point of tipsy and those words just broke me I guess. When I am intoxicated I feel a stronger range of emotions, I never cry regularly. The last time I can remember crying due to emotional pain is 2 years ago. I simply walked away and just broke down in a chair sobbing one of my best friends came to comfort me and blabbered about how this was the only thing keeping me going and honestly I can't take anymore. I just asked them to leave. Five minutes later. She came up and sat down infront of me and we just started talking she explained her past relationship and so did I and how it messed with her. I understood but she said she still wanted to try? I asked to kiss her like 5 minutes later after making her laugh with some jokes and she was hesistant and said maybe later. Ok fair enough. As the party was wrapping up people started getting sick and I had to focus and sober up to take care of them and as I'm running around I finally call an uber to get my buds home. I say goodbye to everyone and she kisses me. Nice.

I go home and still slightly intoxicated I text Jen how I think I'm falling in love with her. She see's this and says he doesn't know what love is and is put off by it, rightfully so. I think I'm too attached and just feel bad again like I blew it. I decide to chain party, something very out of the usual for me, as I've gone to 8 in my whole lifetime. So the next night I drink my sorrows away becoming the most drunk I've ever been and start telling whoever comes up to me about her and how incredible she is. I decide to text her and apologize for the 'love' thing, and she says its ok she's awkward or atleast that's what I can remember. Yet she always takes over 12 hours to respond to what I say but shows mixed emotions towards me. Currently she has not responded to what I said 8pm of yesterday.

As I reach the end of this fuckfest of a train-of-thought wall of text I begin to realize what I wrote is stupid; makes no sense and probably paints me as an attached fucker to a girl who barely knows me and I barely know her. Yet I can't stop thinking about her. I don't know what to do. School starts tomorrow and I believe this is the last time I will ever see or hear from her. I am on anti-depressants and I currently feel like myself before I was put on them. Honestly at a loss for words and I doubt I will get a response on this post.
