I just don't know what to do anymore tbh.Everyday feels like it is a chore to get up.

I'm a high school student in my junior year and lately I just don't really feel a need to move on.  Everyone pisses me off since it has been nothing but drama last year, namely between me and a few people of the LGBT community which has turned me into a "homophobe."  But other then that it feels like I'm the only person in my school who isn't a babbling fuckwit, even my friends feel like the same crowd of the people I despise.  It gets to the point that I feel the need to stomp the shit out of a pillow everytime I get back because everyone just pisses me off.  I do have a few friends and some people that i'd probably consider friends, and I do have carring parrents.  But lately, it just seems everything. EVERYTHING, just has no point in it since I know i'll get shit for it later.
