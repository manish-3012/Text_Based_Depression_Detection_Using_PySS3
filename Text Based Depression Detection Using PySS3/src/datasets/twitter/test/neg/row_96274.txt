Found the right place where I can kill myselfI have nowhere to hang off of, so I have a belt around the leg of my table. When the time is right Iâ€™ll off myself. I had a break down the other day and called an estranged close friend, as soon as I heard her voice say â€œhelloâ€ I hung and was kicking myself for being so stupid. I donâ€™t know who to turn to, Iâ€™ve never not been sad all the time so Iâ€™ve become something of a burden. I just bottle shit up now, my mom thinks Iâ€™m better now, she just hears what she wants to. I feel so empty, this isnâ€™t as emotional as my usual posts, I just feel so numb. Iâ€™m just gonna leave a note telling a few people Iâ€™m sorry, including my mom. She was in tears when I was locked in a ward for attempting suicide. Anyways, thatâ€™s all, I found my suicide spot. I find it genuinely relaxing that itâ€™s always an option
