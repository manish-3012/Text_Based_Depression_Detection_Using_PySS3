My first, and probably last post to redditI was going to make a post this morning, but allowed myself the day to mull it over.

The depression has reached a zenith of sorts. I drove around a couple of weeks ago looking for an adequate tree to hang myself from after a disastrous appointment with a new psychiatrist. After 15-20 minutes of chit chat he threatened to have me involuntarily admitted. Way to go doc, triggered one of the worst panic attacks I'd ever had. He threatened to call the sheriff and I just up and walked out. I drove around the entire day on backroads in the Pacific Northwest woods and found not a single tree with adequate lateral branches (all conifers). Where's a good elm or sycamore when you need one?

My HIV case worker is coming to pick me up tomorrow because I can't seem to make it in to see a therapist on my own. What I can't tell her is that it's pointless to go to the therapist because I'll have passed away by the end of the weekend. Talking to a therapist is also fruitless since I've learned my lesson after my experience with the psychiatrist - I can trust no one with my inner thoughts because people freak the f*ck out.

Suicide prevention efforts boil my blood as it denies the dignity of death. Not a second thought is given to euthanize a pet, yet when it comes to humans we will force life upon them without any consideration of the quality of that inflicted life. I have HIV, I have childhood trauma induced PTSD, and I have Major Depressive Disorder. At this point I may even have AIDS since I stopped taking my HIV meds a couple months ago. I stopped my meds because people with HIV/AIDS have a higher chance of cancer because of compromised immunity, so at least if I were dying of cancer, people would resign themselves to the idea of impending death and I could have meaningful heartfelt good-byes with my friends and family. Instead, I'm denied dignity in death and have to keep my intentions secret lest friends and family stage some sort of suicide prevention intervention.

Not far from where I am there is a seldom used logging road where I'll be able to rest in my car and painlessly poison myself with carbon monoxide. I have a VW Golf that I'll be able to place a small hibachi barbeque in the hatchback area, with natural real charcoal (not briquettes) to provide the source of CO. I have 2 bottles of wine (though I rarely drink so one will certainly be adequate), and several types of anti-anxiety medications to facilitate a calm and relaxed state of mind.

My only regret is that I can't be open and honest with my friends and family; that I'm denied the opportunity to thank them for their support and generosity throughout the years of my struggles. It deeply disappoints me that there is societally imposed shame of suicide, and that there is somehow disgrace in death.
