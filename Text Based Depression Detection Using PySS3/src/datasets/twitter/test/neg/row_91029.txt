I'm tired.I'm tired of trying anymore. 

I'm tired of being ugly.

I'm tired of having people confirm to me on a daily basis that I'm ugly.

I'm tired of being rejected. Every. single. time. 

I'm tired of being strung along by emotionless robots.

I'm tired of being alone.

I'm tired of the fact that I'm 20 and have never had a real meaningful relationship or sex, let alone my first kiss. 

I'm tired of seeing couples everywhere. It has come to the point where it triggers me and I start cutting. 

I'm tired of knowing that I will always be alone, with nobody to tell me "I love you". 

I'm tired of going to bed every night alone, with nobody to cuddle with. 

I'm tired of waking up every morning alone. 

I'm tired of always failing to find a truly meaningful long term relationship, whereas other men my age find it easily and readily with absolutely no problems.

I'm tired of being the useless, worthless fuck that I am. 

I'm tired of living. Cutting doesn't do it anymore. 

I just want to die. I have no reason to keep going. I don't want to wake up one day, when I'm fifty, and not have a significant other or a family. But the way things are going, I am never going to find true love. Everything has always worked against my favor. I've been flat out rejected before even getting a chance to ask someone out on a date. I've been told I'm "ugly" and "unattractive". I've been told that my emotions can be "too overwhelming". One person even flat out told me they were looking for a "man" and not a "boy". People have told me I'm a "catch", but conveniently not "their" catch. I've had people tell me they are always the ones getting "friendzoned", and then completely shoot me down when I ask them out. I've tried to find someone using r/r4r and r/foreveralonedating, only to have my threads hijacked by people who felt the need to criticize the fact that I simply wanted to find *one* person to share my life with. I have everything I could ever want out of life. I'm intelligent. I go to a great school. I'm ambitious. The only way I feel I can be truly happy is if I had a like minded individual to share that with. Fuck me, right?

I need to cut again. The blades are calling once more. I don't know if I'll ever have to courage to truly off myself.
