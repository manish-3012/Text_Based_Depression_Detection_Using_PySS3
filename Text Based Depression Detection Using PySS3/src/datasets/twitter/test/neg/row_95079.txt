[T-136] Smoky FridayHey everyone, hope your morning is going well. Mine is alright I guess. Having a lot of bad self-image thoughts today, but that's okay, because the body is a prison anyway.

All this smoke is getting pretty irritating. I've had a headache for the last few days. I'm hoping these fires get under control soon.

Lately I've been struggling a lot with grasping the cognitive dissonance of acceptance. We're always told "Follow your dreams! Never settle for anything!" But isn't that what life is supposed to be about? Settling? Accepting? Making the best of what you have, and even if it's not everything you want, learning to want it anyway? So what if you look like twelve pounds of smashed asshole in a ten pound paper bag, you're doing your best, right? People tell you to be the best, to do the best, to accept nothing less than the best, and if what you end up with instead isn't good enough, well that sucks for you I guess, do what you can and try to fall short as little as possible.

Nah. When you get a bad hand in poker, you fold. It's just what you do. Life isn't any different. After all, it's just a game, right?
