I'm killing myself as soon as I graduate high school.I'm done. I'm just done. I'm 16 and I do not know what to do after high school anyway. I don't think I will have the mental stability to get a job or do anything anyway. I'll never be happy. I've always felt left out or different in everything. I'm mixed race so my family has always hated me and seen me as a disgrace, whenever I go to my mother's country people give me strange looks as if something went wrong because I look nothing like my family. I was homeschooled, so I'm socially inept and it has destroyed me, but as soon as my mom placed me back in a real high school it has been frustrating. I'm an early bloomer too and I went through changes differently than most other boys, so I stopped growing at an abnormally young age and I'm short, while most boys my age are still growing. I'm literally below average in every way possible. I'm fucking sick and tired of being made fun of for everything, girls look down on me and I'm just hearing people say that this is just the beginning, it is going to get ten times worse in college. Yeah I'm not having that. Without a doubt I would blow my head off before going off to college or getting a job, I don't care about the past (since I have none and it's just full of shitty memories of being made fun of if anything) and my family would probably be indifferent about it since I'm a genetic failure to them. I don't know why I got so unlucky with fucking everything. I just want to feel like other people. I feel so alone in society.
