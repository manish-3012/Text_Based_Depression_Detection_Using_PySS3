Got the key to the gun safe in hand.I've had it for a few days. 
Its my fiance's hand gun he has for CC. It's a sig 38 I think he said. It's normally on him all day and in the safe at night. Idk why the fuck I'm typing this. Been wasting time researching best place to aim it. I was going to grab it tonight and thought about leaving a note. I don't want anyone to think he did this just because it's his gun. I also have two small kids, 5 and 2. 
I don't want the three of them to think It's their fault or that I didn't love them. I don't know what to write. I can't even write a fucking note. Do I really need to research how to write a fucking suicide note?! Do I have to leave a note?! I'm so fucking pathetic. I don't want to sit and waste fucking time explaining why I'm a worthless piece of shit. NOBODY. GIVES. A. FUCK. I just want them to be able to move on and be happy.
