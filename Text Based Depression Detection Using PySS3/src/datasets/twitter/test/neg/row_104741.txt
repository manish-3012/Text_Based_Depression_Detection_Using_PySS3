Lost and trapped. Donâ€™t know where to go from here.18 year old male. Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Single, high school student. In the midst of a severe depressive episode. 

I was about to head out to the story bridge this morning, but my plan was foiled when I googled it and learned that there are 3 meter high barriers enclosing the walkway. And I started thinking, and Iâ€™ve realised that I canâ€™t do this, itâ€™s not fair to my family, friends or my school or anyone to go like this. I donâ€™t really want to keep living, but I canâ€™t die and cause people pain. Their pain would be misplaced, because seriously, what good have I become lately? Iâ€™m lethargic, dumb and boring. The only thing stopping me is that itâ€™s not fair for me to impose that suffering on others. But life is just too difficult and painful.  Sorry if this is incoherent or shittily formatted, I just needed to get it out.
