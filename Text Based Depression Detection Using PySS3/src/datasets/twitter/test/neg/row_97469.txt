Nothing can be fixed, and you can only run so far.For the past two years, I've been trying so hard to make up for everything I've fucked up... I've hurt so many people emotionally, and done so much stupid shit... I tried so hard, and nothing ever works. Nothing ever fixes. Nobody is happy, and every time I try to help someone be happy, I only make them feel worse or dig my hole deeper.

Long story short, I've fucked up and ruined more than enough. Every day I'm getting closer and closer to the end. 

And it's just much deeper than that. Horribly dysfunctional family, no friends, everyone thinking I'm crazy... 

It's time to make a call... What should it be? End this misery now...?
