Barely Keeping It TogetherI don't know how much longer I can keep it all together. My family doesn't know what I am going through because I never talk about it and avoid conversations where it could come up. The most my friends know about it is that I use it at a joke but it really isn't I just want someone to notice. Every night I wish I didn't exist. The only future I see is where I end up alone like always because I have no value. I am 17 and I don't see my life passing 18 years old. I just want to sleep and never wake up again and leave all problems behind. No one would miss me. I am just a fat ugly dude that will die alone probably within the next year.

What's the point?
