Iâ€™ve chosen to be alone.Iâ€™ve severed ties with just about everyone in my life that means something to me save for the person I work for and the occasional client that calls me. Someone else is taking care of my pets right now. My family has reached out to me in hopes of helping me feel better. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve their help or the help of the people who I once associated myself with. I know itâ€™s beneficial to get help but thereâ€™s a part of me that doesnâ€™t want it. Itâ€™s like I want to just disappear but Iâ€™m supposed to have a â€œgreater purposeâ€ or something. I feel guilty for existing.
