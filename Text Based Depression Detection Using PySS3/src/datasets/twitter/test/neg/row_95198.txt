Just two days ago, I was done.  With everything.  I hit my breaking point.  I posted here with a throwaway.  It was over.  I literally tried to find my dad's gun.  I was done.  And I apologize to anyone that responded.  

My circumstances haven't changed.  But I feel better.  I realized that I would never leave my kids with their father.   And everyone else in my family can fuck off.
