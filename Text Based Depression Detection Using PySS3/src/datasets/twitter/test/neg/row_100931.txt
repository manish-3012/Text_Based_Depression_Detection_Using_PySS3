Someone please help me help my wifeMy wife is in a terribly dark place right now. She has a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, but never this bad. Recently she has had a lot of family problems which has resulted in her not speaking to most of them and them not speaking to her. She says that she frequently thinks about dying and how to do it so the kids and I don't have to find her. She says she's past the point of help. She refuses to call the suicide help line, she won't go to a doctor or anything. She's even gone as far as threatening divorce just to push me away so I wouldn't have to see her go thru this. I want to help her so bad, but I don't know how. Nothing I say right now helps her, and I see her getting darker by the day. I'm afraid to leave her alone, but I can't be with her constantly. Please any help with resources or a way to approach her would be appreciated. I need her and so do our kids and I can't just let her go.

Thank you.
