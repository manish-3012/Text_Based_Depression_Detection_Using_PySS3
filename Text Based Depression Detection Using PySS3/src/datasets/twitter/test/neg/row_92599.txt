I have thoughts of killing other peopleAnd they appear often.

 I want to murder people who make fun of me and people who are happy and in happy relationships. 

My througts include slicing their skin and eyes, beating them to death, setting them on fire, torturing them... 

Obviously I won't and can't act on these thoughts, even if I really wanted to.

Should I see a mental health professional about this?
