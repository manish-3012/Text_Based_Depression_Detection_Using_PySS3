I hate my lifeEvery time I think shit is getting better it gets even worse in a second.
I attempted suicide but did not have the balls to do it.
There is no solution .
Talking to people about it is cringy. 
I have no friends, I dont want my family to know
I am afraid of telling my crush I like her.
Ending it all in two days . I just have to sort shit up with some people.
I was feeling suicidal a month ago for a while. Everyone noticed exept my parents because i hid it .
Only one girl reached out. She didnt help alot and i denied being suicidal


Ps   about to be the youngest teen in my town to commit suicide (I am 15)
