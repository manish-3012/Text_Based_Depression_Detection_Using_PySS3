Getting evicted for the third time in three years. Not much hope left.To make a long story short, my family was a dysfunctional but financially-stable middle class family. In 2010, we had a major falling out with a relative who was kindly providing us with a place to stay, so since then, every single year we've had to move from a good house to a crap house, to a REALLY crappy house. Along the way, we've had our already-small family fall apart. My aunt died a terrible death from lung cancer, and my older brother is on the streets.

It's currently me, my aging, somewhat-ill mother, and my controlling, verbally-abusive other brother. I've been unemployed for a year, and my brother's been guilt-tripping me, saying that we wouldn't be in this situation if I got a job and paid the rent...something he doesn't do with a full-time job. So, now we're probably going to have to move to an even worse place...in an even worse neighborhood...and my depression will get even worse.

I've heard the "new house, new beginning!" line so many times, it's almost an insult. Things have got progressively worse, my family is nonexistent, my friends have all left me, and I'm psychologically, emotionally, and physically a mess.

How the hell can I make it through **this** one?
