I ant to commit suicide because of my grades.Hi. My first year of high school has been alright so far. Met a couple of cool people who liked doing the same shit I like doing, playing video games, listening to music, etc. It has been fun. Now my grades went to shit. I did alright the first 3 quarters but I've lost all hope now. My only responsibility is to get good grades and I fucked it up. I feel like I can't do anything, and if I bring home 2 E's my parents will not let me do anything over the summer. I just feel hopeless. Some days I just don't go to class and sit in the bathrooms wishing I wasn't here. The things happening to me outside of school don't help either.
