I tried to agree to live but I just canâ€™t...I canâ€™t take life.. I really canâ€™t.. Itâ€™s unfair, exhausting, loud, painful, and unrewarding...

My chest hurts, sounds are louder than normal, Iâ€™ve been holding back tears all day at work... itâ€™s too hard to live...

I feel like Iâ€™m getting to a point where I canâ€™t even work at all...
