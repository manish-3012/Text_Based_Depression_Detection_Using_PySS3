So i just woke upLast night I put a belt around my neck and tied it to the door and laid down till i was unconscious. I literally just woke up with the belt still around my neck and saw it came off of the door knob. Im just sitting here wondering how the FUCK did i not die

Im literally speechless, i dont know what im supposed to do now
