World events and friend's negative views have depressed me to suicidal levels daily for many months. How do I get over it without closing my accounts?See topic. I'm a severe cynic to apocalyptic and suicidal levels solely because of world events (My own life and accomplishments have gotten a lot better recently, but that no longer means anything to me). Been this way since 9/11, and the election and its fallout have affected me worse than anything in my life.  I'm long convinced that progress in humanity is dead and there's no hope for everyone fighting for change, and we're on a painful slide into dystopia or extinction.  Every single day since mid-September (And most days before that TBH), I experience hours of anxiety, depression, and the worst negative feelings imaginable. I've attempted suicide twice and plan to do so again at the end of January if I don't see any signs of stability. I'm in weekly therapy, have tried many meds, and been hospitalized three times. Nothing works.

I've long taken the advice of avoiding/ignoring news networks, publications, and websites to heart, but social media is destroying me. All my friends and family constantly post about how terrible our world is ("RAPE CULTURE IN EFFECT!") and how depressed they are ("Should anyone still be having babies when global warming is about to kill future generations?"), and knowing that everyone I care about seems to be just as miserable as me makes me want to give up all hope.

I would just close all my accounts, but the career I'm interested in developing basically requires a prominent online presence of that kind, so I'm stuck. I've tried unfollowing most people, adding browser plugins that filter out posts with any word or phrase I specify, and only checking the sites every 2-3 days, but nothing helps. I'm scared and miserable every day and ready to end it.

Anybody have any thoughts on things I haven't tried?
