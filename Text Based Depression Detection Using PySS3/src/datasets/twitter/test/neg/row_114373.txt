Please be careful when opening up to peopleI recently reconnected with two of my best friends. Understandably, they were shocked to hear I quit my job and dropped out of college for the second time. I opened up to them about everything and well... I got blamed for causing pain to my parents, being selfish,  living off of them, and basically for not doing better and coming up with excuses. If you read my last post you can learn why I can't do any better atm. 

My point is, these can be people who love you and care about you yet understand so little about you. Each of us here is going through similar yet unique experiences. Not every person is good at listening or understanding. To be honest, 90% of the people I know aren't willing to understand. If you really think about it, YOU are the only person who understands you 100%. Most people I've talked to on this subreddit are genuinely understanding and don't try to fix everything. Because not everything can be fixed, and sometimes all we need is somebody to share that pain with us. Someone to listen to and understand. 

Anyhow, I went from feeling depressed and anxious to feeling suicidal afterward. But I fought back the urge by telling myself "it's not your fault, they don't understand." I didn't think I had it in me but I fought back. 

My message is, sometimes opening up to the wrong people can literally kill you. It absolutely sucks. Especially to be judged like that by the people who matter to you, and especially when your self-esteem is at an all-time low from all the breakdowns. They will dismiss your feelings. Belittle your experiences. Make you feel like absolute shit. 

If you have had experiences like that and you fought back for yourself, congratulate yourself! If anything, it makes you stronger. I highly doubt the people who "advice" us to get our shit together, have as much courage as us if they were in our position. 

So yes, that's it. I'm proud of, not falling down after that blow. I'm not going to be defined by their words and perceptions of me, because they are NOT me.
