Shouldn't I feel guilty?I've vowed to kill myself by my 22nd birthday. I'm nearing 18 now, and I feel determined to do this. I thoroughly don't enjoy being alive, but I know I should. I've got a supportive family, a couple reliable friends, a loving boyfriend. And yet here I am. I know everything wrong is my fault because it's all in my head. I'm overly sensitive to everything dealing with people. I swear I have social anxiety. No one would ever suspect it though. It makes no sense. I'm such a huge contradiction on so many fronts.

I don't feel like I'm living for myself. I've always been one to sacrifice my comfort for others (not in a doormat way). Anything less feels selfish and against who I am. Hell, I'm planning on going into a profession that would let me help and counsel people. So why do I not feel guilty about leaving? Maybe because this is the one thing I want? The only person I do feel bad about leaving is my boyfriend because he actively hopes for a future with me. But it's different for literally everyone else. It feels like I'd be freeing myself from everyone and from all of the small things that piss me off or discourage me daily. Thinking about my death is such a steady comfort...
