Back and Forth with Suicidal ThoughtsHi,

&amp;#x200B;

Every year I feel like I go through such an intensive phase where I want to die. It's exhausting, no one ever checks up on me and the one person who made me feel okay (my childhood best friend) rarely texts me. The one person who would make me feel valid and worth living is the same person that promises to stay and leaves me to fight for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that he is under no obligation to babysit me and I don't want that, I just want to feel like people take in what I say, not some comedic relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I have never went to a psychologist, I attempted to go to a GP Doctor and he started smiling when I told him about how I feel and I felt stupid after that, I would talk to counsellors as well and they spewed the same "painting helps" bullshit, the same tired faces with a forced smile.

&amp;#x200B;

I know no one **has** to do things I want them to do but it'd be a nice change to hear someone genuinely say "How are you?"

I honestly don't know what I'm going to get out of this but I just felt like I needed to let this out.
