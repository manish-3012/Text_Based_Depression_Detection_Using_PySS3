Some people arenâ€™t meant to be alive.I remember asking my psychologist if she ever believed that some people are simply incompatible with life. If some people are physically healthy and are present in day-to-day life, but are not equipped mentally to survive long-term. She disagreed, of course. It is her job to try and instill some hope, I suppose. 

But I genuinely feel as though some people are just not cut out to exist. Maybe itâ€™s a case of natural selection or something. For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been really ambivalent about living. I donâ€™t want to be alive, but donâ€™t want to go through with the act of suicide. Iâ€™m just floating in this limbo, feeling like Iâ€™m only continuing to be alive as to not upset anyone, or because Iâ€™m afraid of badly hurting myself in an attempt and being vegetableised forever. Iâ€™m uninterested in most aspects of life. I have no motivation to exist, because I simply donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to be alive and I donâ€™t have this longing to be cured, or to get better, because I donâ€™t want to be on this earth at all. Whether Iâ€™m mentally well or not. I just donâ€™t want to live. 

I can acknowledge when lots of really great things happen, and I appreciate when they do. I feel happy when Iâ€™m with my pets, or when I get to spend the day with my boyfriend, or when the sky looks pretty or when I make art that Iâ€™m proud of, or when I discover new music or new places to visit. But none of it feels worth living for. Iâ€™m glad that those things happen but it doesnâ€™t make me want to stay alive. 

Iâ€™m not going to try and kill myself right now. But if someone somehow presented me with a button that I could press that would allow me to stop existing, I would press it without a second thought.
