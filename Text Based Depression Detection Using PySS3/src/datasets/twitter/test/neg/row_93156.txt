I don't know what I'm doing...I have been dealing with this for years, from the age of 6 I was diagnosed depressed, and suicidal thoughts always sneak into my day.  I've managed to get most of it away and do normal actions. But, lately I've been having a very tough time.

A few days ago was the second aniversary of my best friend's suicide. I keep losing sleep, and feeling like I failed her. I went to therapy for a while after the "event"(for lack of a better word in my vocabulary), but it didn't help at all. I keep thinking about at all the messages and voice mails she left me. 

I don't know what I'm doing anymore or what I'm hoping for here. I just need something, but I don't know what it is.
