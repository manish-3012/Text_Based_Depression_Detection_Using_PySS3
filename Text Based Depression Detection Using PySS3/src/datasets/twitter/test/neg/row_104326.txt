What's the point?I honesty can't find one. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. I've been trying for years to try and get the right med cocktail, every time I get something to work for a little while it eventually stops being effective. I'm so tired of fighting. Nothing makes me happy. I have no dreams for the future. I don't want to live.
