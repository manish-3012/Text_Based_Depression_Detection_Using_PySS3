Scared of the Acceptance of Pedophilia**Note: I do not hate all pedos, I just hate the ones that think marrying kids is alright. It isn't, it's fucked up. If any pedos consider fantasizing about kids, go to a therapy, no matter what that isn't alright**

Now let me start, a few days ago. I saw a post on r/unpopularopinion on how if you accept the LGBT+C that means you must accept pedophiles for who they are. Now, I disagreed with disgust. In the post, he says this:

"If the child consents to being married with an adult and has no problem being married, there's no chance rape should be okay of course. But both the adult and the child are happy, would that be okay?"

That's scary, that's fucked up. Who in the world thinks this is okay? I'm actually worried that this argument will be used for pedo acceptance. Please tell me this won't happen, I'm paranoid. I'm scared. I fear such thing could happen in the future.

The reason why the LGBT+C is hated was due to fear of acceptance of pedos, that's it. Pedos are the only dominant atheistic reason why the LGBT+C is hated.
