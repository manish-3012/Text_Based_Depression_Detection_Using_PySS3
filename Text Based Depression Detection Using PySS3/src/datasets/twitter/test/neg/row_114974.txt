I'm fucking pathetic.It's 4am when I'm writing this, have school on 8 am, I'm 16 and I feel like the worst thing to ever walk the earth. 

First semester in the new school was fucking miserable for me. The winter break has just finished for me and I already can feel the stress and fear of going out, meeting people, classmates, and being stressed as fuck on Math lessons. I think I'm just too fucking dumb for my school, even for fucking life. I got a few friends, I'm going to the cinema next Friday I still feel like the 5th fucking wheel even though they reached out to me about it. I feel like a fat, lazy and pathetic loser who spends all his time sitting behind a computer. Math for me is fucking unlearnable even though my friend from childhood is still in a class with me and he's a fucking math god. I'm even too fucking scared to ask him to help me with it, I don't even know how to study, my grades are on the edge, all my math grades are only 1's (F's), I even tried to correct some of them, but when I saw the test I just left the class and skipped the day of school (the corrections of grades are mostly early in the morning).
My parents really don't support me, they think my anxiety is some kind of construct that I just create for excuses. They can't seem to understand that I don't want to be a fucking Christian, when I skip school and tell them that i feel like a complete shit they punish me for it and say things like - stop whining, I'll throw your computer out of the window etc. I cry myself to sleep almost everyday thinking of ways to end my life and I hope I won't wake up. Music is one of the things that keep me alive I think, new album of my favourite artist is about to drop 14th February.

I could go on and on about how fucking miserable and dead mentally I'm but I think this will do for now. I may sound positive sometimes but I still think the "happy mask" latches onto me and even fucking merges with me. But inside I still feel like a fucking clown. Even now when I look around my room I feel fucking disgusting about myself. Of course I could clean up here but I'm that fucking lazy and always can't get myself to do something productive. I just want to erase myself.
