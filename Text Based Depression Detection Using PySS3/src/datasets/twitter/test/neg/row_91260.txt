I just feel like Iâ€™m suffocatingIâ€™ve completely lost myself and the past two years Iâ€™ve had this gut wrenching feeling of depression and after trying anti depression medication and counselling I still feel the exact same if not more hopeless.

I try to communicate with my husband but heâ€™s dismissive- he tries but I donâ€™t think he has the capacity to deal with someoneâ€™s problems other than his own. 

I have no one where we live, weâ€™ve moved twice and Iâ€™ve hated every place, but I donâ€™t feel like I could go home as I have nothing there anymore.

I donâ€™t really have any family I can turn to- Iâ€™m not close with my dad as he left when I was three and whenever I try to open up to my mum she turns it around on her and how hard her life is. Sheâ€™s an alcoholic so I always have that constant worry that sheâ€™s died of alcohol poisoning or something, constantly anxious that sheâ€™s not okay.

I feel like I carry everyoneâ€™s burdens and when I try to open up to people close to me they do t want to know. I have no motivation to do anything but stay in bed. I donâ€™t want to eat or drink and I canâ€™t sleep. I know none of this is counter productive but I just donâ€™t know what to do. When I last weekend help from my dr I felt like an idiot. One of them told me to stop crying so I didnâ€™t waste the appointment and that was my lowest. I have tried to overdose but couldnâ€™t bring myself to it as I know deep down I donâ€™t really want to die I just want to stop this pain I have all the time and I donâ€™t know where to start
