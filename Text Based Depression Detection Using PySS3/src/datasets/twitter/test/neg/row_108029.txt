Daydreams of Suicide.Does anyone else relate to these? 

&gt; They don't even happen intentionally anymore. I've had them for years but I just slip into them unintentionally even more now. Its these almost vivid daydreams of just how I would kill myself, who would be there, who would see it, everyone's reactions, a detailed plan of how and sometimes when. These don't bother me, they never did. I'm not really scared to kill myself so fear isn't really the cause.
