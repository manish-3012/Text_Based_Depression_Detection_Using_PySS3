I want to die but don't fully know if it's a good idea right now. Any thoughts?I've been thinking about you ending my life for quite some time and have come to the conclusion that if I do ill hang myself but the reason I haven't done it is because as of right now life could go in so many ways
Idk if I should wait and see what will happen or if I should spare me the pain
