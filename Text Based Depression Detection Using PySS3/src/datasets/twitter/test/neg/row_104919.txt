Emotions and anxietyI was raised by my parents, one of which is emotionally abusive. He's led me to attempt and think about suicide too many times to count. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks due to living in this situation for years. Tomorrow, I'm leaving home and my parents don't know this yet because they'd make me stay. If I stay, I'm afraid I'll kill myself for good this time but I'm having so much anxiety about leaving. I know it's what I need to do if I'm too get any better and live a good life but because of how long I've been in the situation, I find myself questioning it over and over.
