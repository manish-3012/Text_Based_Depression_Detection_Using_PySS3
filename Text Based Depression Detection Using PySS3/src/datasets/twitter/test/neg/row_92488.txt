Hello, guys. By the time, you're finished reading this, I'm probably already dead.So basically my life has gone pretty downhill lately. My parents, siblings, best friend, and pets are dead. My parents died a few months ago. My younger brother died two weeks ago. My older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer. My best friend committed suicide because his girlfriend left him. And two of my dogs were hit by a truck. For these past few months, my life has gone to shit. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to kill myself. I've been having suicidal thoughts and I just want to end it all. I don't think that anything will get better. My girlfriend just broke up with me for a much more intelligent, handsome, and muscular guy. She left me for someone much better, so I pretty much don't have anyone anymore. I might just kill myself tonight.
