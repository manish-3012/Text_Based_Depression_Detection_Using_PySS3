Bored from life.Hi all. 


I don't feel depressed. I don't feel good or bad. I don't feel empty neither. 

I just feel like I fulfilled all my dreams, and at this point of my life, there is not much to live. I work in a good company, earn enough but everything become so monotone in my life. I know this is normal and don't expect it more. However I feel stuck in this life, and have to work for my entire life. 

So, because of boredom, I want to finish it all. Because I already know what is going to happen next in my life.. I would probably have to work until I become 65 and wait for death after that age. So why live in this life for selling my hours like prostitute and come home tired and not able to do anything. 

I feel nothing in this life (bad or good).After I finish my last quests in this "life" game, I want to uninstall the game.  

By the way graphics were nice however story line really sucked.
