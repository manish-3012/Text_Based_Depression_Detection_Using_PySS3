Can't come up with a title.I have a roof over me. Never had to go hungry my entire life. I even got though uni; albeit I had to go though an extra year because I failed a few subjects, barely scraping though at the end too. I have a decent job for my age. I have enough money to spend on tech which should be keeping me entertained. Basically, I'm not crazy rich, but I can afford to live an above average lifestyle.

I should be happy or at least contented with my life, but I'm neither. I sure that many people wish that they could be in my shoes. But I think of suicide almost every night before I go to bed, wishing I would not wake up the next morning.

I think can do most things decently, but I have never really exceled in anything. Never really put effort into anything; never had the motivation to. I just coasted through life all this while, which is the reason why I flunked those few subjects in uni and had to retake them. Which is also one of the reason why I think I suck at this job right now.

This job I have right now, I don't think I'm qualified for it. Any task I'm given, I either take a bloody long time to complete it, or I'm just unable to complete it. I'm surprised I'm still not laid off yet; although I won't be surprised if they did once my probation is over. The only reason I got this job is because I went through my mom's connections. Wouldn't have gotten this job without her. And I have my reasons to think so.

A little back story before I got this job. I held another job before this for about two years. I felt miserable after the first month onwards. Decided to ghost everyone I knew, hoping that it would encourage me to off myself quicker. One day, I just quit my job. No warning. Pretty sure my employer hated me for that. Since then, I was jobless for two years, being a useless fuck at home. Relied on my parents and my savings after I quit. My current employer is aware about the two year hiatus. See why I think I don't deserve this job?

I'm an irresponsible person who should not be alive under normal circumstances. How nice would it be if I could just walk into a hospital, get euthanized and donate my organs to someone who actually deserves it more.

Now, since I have a job, I have the money to spend on liquor again. Been drinking myself to sleep every night. Going through a bottle of whiskey or gin every week; and showing no signs of slowing down.

I don't know where I'm going with this post. Just looking for somewhere to vent I guess. Noticed that my writing isn't really well constructed here. Hopefully, my paragraphing would help make the reading less annoying. And if you have read this far, thanks for reading and sorry for wasting your time.
