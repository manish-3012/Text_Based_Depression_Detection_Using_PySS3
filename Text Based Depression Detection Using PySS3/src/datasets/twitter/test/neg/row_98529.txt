Feeling lost, scared, slightly insane26 years old. I went through, I don't even know, this past year, but it caused me to develop some delusional thinking where half the time I am assuming some very paranoid delusion that continues building, or half the time I am feeling ashamed about telling others about the delusion. 

I am having trouble having any ability to not let myself starve to death, or basically care for myself at all. I try to talk to people online and in therapy and friends, but I'm always repressing how I actually feel. I have an eating disorder and I am just wasting away and I hate it but I just, I did this to myself and I sort of feel like I deserve it. 

I would never hurt anyone else, I feel like I've been treated like I would, but I seem to be anyway because I have people that care about me and I just don't care enough anymore to keep my obligation to live.
