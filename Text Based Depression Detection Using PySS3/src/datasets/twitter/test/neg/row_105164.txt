Unsure what to doI've been dealing with a lot of depression lately. I've been through counseling for it before with kind of mixed results. I've always had a lot of thoughts about death, but I've never really had suicidal thoughts I don't think. Lately, however I have been having them - to the point where I have a plan now. Actually 2 plans, but regardless I have plan. I don't have a time frame or anything. I just know how I would do it if I decided I wanted or needed to. A few weeks ago I finally got an appointment scheduled with a counselor again. I'm suppose to meet with her next Monday. I had decided that I was going to tell her when I met her, but now that it's getting closer I really don't know. I'm really scared about what will happen. I'm scared that she'll want to hospitalize me. I don't know if I can take that. I don't know if I would be able to look at my family and friends again if I go to the hospital. I honestly am fairly good at hiding my depression, so I think it would really catch everyone off guard. I think it would really hurt a lot of people if I ended up in the hospital. I just don't know if I should be honest from the go, or just ease into things. I don't have any immediate plans to kill myself. I'm wondering if it would be ok to try to get some other coping skills out of counseling before I tell her I'm having suicidal thoughts. I'm honestly just scared of what will happen if I do tell her, and I'm scared of  what will happen if I don't.
