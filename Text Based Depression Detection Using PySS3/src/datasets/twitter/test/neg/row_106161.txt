I feel like I deserve to dieI was in a rough spot with my relationship when we were living with another couple. They also were having relationship issues, so me and the other girl would talk them out. 
We were both into trying new things and our partners not very much, so we decided to try molly while they were gone one day. I would like to blame the molly, but I won't.  
We had sex and admitted love to each other, but how we were both caught in our positions we had both decided not to continue or pursue anything. 
Months later I'm still with my girl and we've moved out, but every day I just want to die from my guilt.
I try to let myself know that the guilt shows I'm a different person, but I dont know. 
The feelings for the other girl were gone within a month but my suffering for what I've done feels endless, and nobody can fucking know.

I know how I look, but if anyone is willing to give me any reason at all to forgive myself please help me.
