I want to kill myself and I need helpMy parents don't care about me and make me feel completely invisible while I'm constantly crying my eyes out and instead of apologising, they twist it and make me sound like the horrid person. My friends don't care and think I'm making it up. I don't know who to contact to help me before I end my life.
