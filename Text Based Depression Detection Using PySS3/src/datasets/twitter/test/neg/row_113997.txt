I want to tell someone about my suicidal thoughtsI am a girl, 15 years old, having suicidal thoughts every day. 
I want to get help with my thoughts, but my parents don't understand how suicidal I am. Since they don't understand it, they won't let me go to a psychologist or doctor. I have been to the school nurse, but haven't told her about the suicidal thoughts, because I know that she will tell it to my parents if I tell her anything about suicidal thoughts. If my parents finds out that I want to kill myself, they will probably freak out and not let me be home alone or let me out of their sight anymore.
What should I do?
