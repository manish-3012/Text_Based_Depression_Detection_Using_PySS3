I want to relieve others.The debt collectors. The landlord. The bills. Those things destroy me. I can't work anymore. I can't make ends meet. I work for where I live. If I lose my job, I'm homeless, and they don't pay me enough to make rent.

I'm sick, I'm dying. It's honestly over. I can't do it anymore.

There's this certain part of the rooftop of the apartment I work at that I obsess over now because I imagine it being the perfect place to jump from. Every night I walk past it, and every day I walk past the sidewalk where they'd eventually find me.

I don't care. I don't. Why? I owe money. College debt for the dead pursuit known as art. Being paid less than what I can afford. Dealing with malnutrition. My parents don't even care despite my requests for help. Maybe everyone is worse off.

My final conclusion is that to make their lives better, I must stop being a parasite. I must let those needy tendrils of humanity clawing at my worth find other sources of energy.

I must remove myself from the equation.

I'm not afraid of it, because the world is unafraid of my departure. Just another little 3x7 inch obituary written by those who didn't know me.

"He just wants attention." they say.

I ask if that's so fucking hard to give these days.
