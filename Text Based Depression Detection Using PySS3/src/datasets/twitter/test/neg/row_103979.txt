slowly going back to square oneI thought I was getting better, talking to my therapist and psychiatrist. I've been told I was making improvements as I told them I wasn't having suicidal thoughts for a good 3 months, that was on wednesday. But here I am, wanting to die. I'm not getting the support I need from the people I love.
