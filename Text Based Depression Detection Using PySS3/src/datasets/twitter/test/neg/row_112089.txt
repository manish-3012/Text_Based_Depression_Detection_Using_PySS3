Wish I had a terminal illnessBecause the choice of wanting to die would then be taken out of my hands. 

48M, had depression for many years but itâ€™s worsened over the last 4. Divorce, huge debts, periods of unemployment (currently have a job but itâ€™s low pay), no family support or understanding, a narcissistic father who refuses to help, a money hungry ex wife...you get the idea. 

I have 2 sons, and they are the sole reason I am still here. But even that reason is lately not strong enough to overcome the sheer bleakness of my life. I have thought about OD on oxycodone. 

I am increasingly struggling to find reasons to keep going.
