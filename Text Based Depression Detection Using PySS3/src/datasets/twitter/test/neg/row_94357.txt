Self Hatred ventingI hate myself. I'm ugly. I feel fat. I'm stupid as fuck. I will never be successful. When I see my name or my face, I feel so much rage. I want to beat myself up. I want to fuck myself up. I hate myself. I can't even work properly. I am so tired. I want to smash my head on a glass table. I hate myself.
