The holy grail suicide is also the most cruel...(TW: description of death by gun)I've been seriously contemplating suicide, but none of the methods are good. They all lack lethality, painlessness, and short time...except for a gun shot to the head. I looked at images online of shotgun suicides (the most effective) and I don't think I can inflict that horror on my SO. In those photos, the face is gone. Literally gone. I can't let my SO discover that, it's too cruel. But then what choice do I have to die? The best idea I have is to find an isolated forested area, leave a note for my SO to send the police out there so he doesn't think I've been kidnapped, and hope that he doesn't drive out there to discover me for himself. That's the best plan I have...I want to do this but I don't want to hurt others in the process.
