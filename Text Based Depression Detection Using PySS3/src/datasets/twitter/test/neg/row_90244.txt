I really need a friendI have BPD. in the course of 7 months I've gotten my heart broken lost both jobs dropped 2 (3) credit classes in and out of the hospital and got cut off by my mother and sister. I've thought about giving up but i never follow through because of my dream of having a family, a child specifically. right now i'm debating just abandoning my car and walking off into natural selection. if you think you can help then help me please
