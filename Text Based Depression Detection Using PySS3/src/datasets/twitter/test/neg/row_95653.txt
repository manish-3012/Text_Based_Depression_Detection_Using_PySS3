nobody careswhatâ€™s the point of a life when nobody cares? Somehow I was cursed with a heart to do everything for the people I love. My ex took that so literally and eventually raped me. My current partner doesnâ€™t give a fuck. He would rather see friends and party with them than deal with someone whoâ€™s having an anxiety attack. Iâ€™m a burden when I become difficult. Iâ€™m there for the people I love. I thought thatâ€™s what love was. None of this is worth it anymore. My own parents have hated me since I was a kid. I should have never been born. None of the pain is worth it, and itâ€™s comforting to know that I have the power to end all this pain. I donâ€™t want this life anymore. No feeling is better than pain. At least I wonâ€™t be a burden to others then and I donâ€™t care about myself anyway to want to try.
