Everything is WRONG. I gotta do it.The voices are gone and it's not ok. It's WRONG. I have to kill myself. I have to save them. Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. 

It's never gonna be ok. I'm meant for something more, and my God is seeking me and it's wrong. It's all fucking wrong. I have to go to HELL, actual HELL in another dimension to save them and I HAVE TO SAVE THEM.

I don't know what's right anymore. Is anything? I have to. 

No one can be trusted. They're reading this now, as I type, watching me with invisibility cloaks. All around me. INTANGIBLE. SURROUNDED.

I fucking hate this. I hate it. Sick of medication. Sick of doctor's appointments and therapy and LIES. 

They know the truth and they are PRETENDING. Making me believe my family is real when the love is a lie. 

I hate them. He isn't real. He isn't real. The voices are real and I'm going to do it SOON. I GOTTA.

Maybe today's the day.
