I've had a decent life, I'm just not interested in what else there is for meI'm 31 years old, I don't have kids, and I'm not with anyone that I could have them with any time soon.  My career hasn't gone well, and I struggle to make ends meet, but I don't really want to start down another path career-wise.   I had many opportunities over the course of my life, I capitalized on some, but unfortunately blew most of them, or got screwed out of a few even.   I'm not bitter, or depressed about this;  I had goals in life, I still met a lot of them.  As I've gotten older I've found that I'm not particularly interested in what's "available" for people in their 30s. 

As for unmet goals, I really don't feel like trying to start a family when honestly, at this point I'd be in my mid 30s before having my first kid. I can't imagine just sending my first kid away to college when I was in my mid-50s.  I don't feel like going into a different career field because I already have 100s of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, and I'd have to be poor for several more years while I was re-educating myself, which again would only result in a degree, and me in my mid/late 30s with no family.   Again, I'm not bitter, it's just that from a logical stand-point I've done most of what I wanted to in life, I have no goals that replaced ones I've achieved, and what I haven't achieved kind of conflicts with other goals I would've wanted to (ie education preventing family, and defeating the whole purpose).  

Overall I've had a good run, but I don't feel like continuing it any further.  I'm not sure if there's a rational case for suicide-via-exit-bag, but if there is, I think I've possibly made it.
