Pls help me :(I havenâ€™t felt this unsafe since the last time I actually attempted. 

My boyfriend has guns. Iâ€™m having a really hard time trying to find a single reason why I shouldnâ€™t go out to the alley in the middle of the night and end it all. It would be so easy. 

I donâ€™t have shit to live for. Iâ€™m ugly and fat and dumb. I have no career path. Iâ€™ve failed at everything Iâ€™ve tried. I havenâ€™t slept well in weeks. I have very little family and zero friends. I feel hopeless and defeated and exhausted. 

I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. Iâ€™m really struggling and I have nobody to turn to. Any words of encouragement would be so much appreciated.
