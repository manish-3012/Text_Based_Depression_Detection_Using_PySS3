I don't know what to do anymoreI am at the end of my rope and the pain is so great. I am having a hard time focusing in school and at work, because of it. I went to a counselor, but its not enough. I want to end my life.

To tell the whole story, I have anxiety and depression. I have been fighting both for a while, most of  my life actually. I was emotionally and mentally abused when I was a child. When I finally broke free of that, I found a nice guy who made me feel wonderful about myself. Fast forward, almost 3 years, he broke up with me, because of my unresolved issues. We had been engaged for 2 years. I went to a counselor because of it. After that, I felt pretty alright. Life was going alright. I finally had stop talking to my ex and finding out who I was in the world. 2 weeks after we stopped talking he told me he wanted me back. He loved me and never would leave me again. He promised never to hurt me again. I did some stupid shit in our relationship, because of fear and after another 2 months of dating he broke it off with me again. He promised he wouldn't this time. Worst of all I am isolated from the world. I am in my last semester of college and I have no friends. My family won't talk to me, because I went back to him. Its been a week almost 2 since the break up and he's already dating someone new. I loved him with everything. He was my best friend. I just can't take it anymore. I am 22 years old and suffered so much. I am tired of hurting. I am tired of breaking down. I am tired for this pain. I am so tired and it effecting everything. I want to die.
