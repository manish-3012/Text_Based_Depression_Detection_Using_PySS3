Should have done it when it wouldn't have mattered....I'm 22. I've struggled with severe clinical depression for as long as I can remember. I don't remember any time in my childhood or life where I wasn't at least a little sad until recently. I had attempted suicide often as a teenager. I've never had any friends except for one but that friendship only lasted 4 years. I was bullied all through school, never bothered with college because I'd planned to be dead long before now. Every year my New Years resolution is to be buried before Christmas comes along. Things started to change when I had my daughter. She's almost 2 now. Her father and I had been together for 7 years until recently. He's abusive, mentally, emotionally, sexually, and physically but I'm fairly certain that he was the first person to truly care about me even with the abuse. Now, the relationship seems unsalvageable. He thinks I'm abusive and worthless. I just very well may be but you can only deal with just taking it for so long until you become an abuser yourself. I had a great job too, I loved the place, I loved and cared about the people there, I was nice to everyone, and even made a few friends. Then there was an incident and I was blamed even though my coworkers assured me it was okay. Next thing I know everyone there starts making things up and I am labeled a thief when I've only ever stolen one thing in my life, a lighter, when I was 13 and felt so bad about it that I went back to the store the next day to pay for it. So now I'm pretty sure my boss will have me blacklisted and I have no clue how I'll be able to work again. Things were bad for me before this work stuff happened, like really bad. I already felt like a worthless, garbage person incapable of receiving genuine care and love. The only people that have "cared" about me besides my daughters father and my mother (I sometimes question my mothers caring though, she only sees me if she has a date in town) are men that wanted to fuck me. If I had actually had the courage to do it 7 years ago things would have been much better for anyone involved in my life. But now I feel as that's not even an option, main reason being my daughter. She's getting older to the point where I fear she may remember me and resent me for doing it as she grows up. Another reason is my family. I have a few family members that aren't far away from dying of old age or terminal illness and I don't want to add more death to the equation for surviving family. I'm just sick of everything. Being nice and caring about people gets me nowhere because nobody will ever do the same for me. All I want is for someone to care. That's all I've ever wanted and I've never gotten that without a price to pay and I don't expect I ever will. I feel selfish and that just makes me feel worse in general. I didn't know anywhere else to go besides here. Reading others posts has made me feel not as alone. I can see hope for other people here though. I wish I could see it for me but every last shred of hope I might have had is long gone.
