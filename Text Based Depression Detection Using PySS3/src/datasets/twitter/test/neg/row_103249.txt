My sister attempted suicide last nightI hope this is the right place for this. My sister attempted suicide last night. She lives in another state and Iâ€™m flying to her in a few hours. Our mom is with her now. I donâ€™t know what to do when I see her or how to support her over the next few days. Googling has mostly returned resources for people who attempt - any advice here?  Sheâ€™ll be in the hospital for the next few days. Iâ€™m thinking of bringing some games with me in case she wants to do something, she likes games. Is that okay? Otherwise I just plan on telling her Iâ€™m glad sheâ€™s okay and offering my support. My family hasnâ€™t ever been great with communication so Iâ€™m not sure what else to do, or how to support her from across the country when I come back home.
