Might Be Stupid But I'm StuckI want to be a software engineer, but it just seems like I'm stupid (I'll need calculus but I can't do that) and an AAS (another degree program) is available but doesn't seem prestigious (I am VERY much concerned with what others think of me) so I don't know.

The only reason why I think suicide is the best option is it's kind of like proving to myself that I can do something that others can't since not a lot of people are willing to kill themselves. I've also seen a lot of people back in the day my age (and even in the modern day) go to war, have families, and have a lot of responsibility and are mature. I'm 18 btw.

What do you think?
