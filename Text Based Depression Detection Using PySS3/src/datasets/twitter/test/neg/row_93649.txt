I'm a horrible personI'm a horrible person I can't take it back I can't no matter how sorry n horrible I feel I can't be forgiven. I deserve to suffer with that fact I let my friend out like that. I'm dumb and gullible he trusted me and I just threw him off like that. I can act like I'm not fake I'm not selfish but I am. I should've waited longer I hate myself at this point nothing can make me feel like a better person cus I'm not I don't want to face him again. How can I? I'm such a idiot and more offensive degrading titles. I can't ugh I truly am not a good person no matter what redeemable quality i have I done enough harm to people. At this point it's just a must I have to remove myself no matter what good I can do or change the action I done is enough to throw that away. I'm sorry
