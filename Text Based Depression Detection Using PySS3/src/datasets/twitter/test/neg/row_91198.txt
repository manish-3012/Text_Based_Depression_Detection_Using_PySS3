I don't expect anyone to see this, but I just have to vent to someone, somewhere.Things have gone drastically worse for me. Everything seems horrendously empty and meaningless. Obviously in the grand scheme of the universe it means absolutely nothing but even on an individual level it has started to feel really unnecessary for me to continue living at all. I don't think I could tell anyone this because they'd relate it to something stupid to me being online too much. I have a lot of "friends" but no one I would ever even come close to tell about this. I started to use this substance a few months prior. I had no subscription for it and was absolutely not supposed to be using it. I think one of the side effects were a mood boost because I can remember it as one of the few times I ever felt happy. Not having a subscription, when it ran out, I can no longer get more. I don't feel like I'm anything. Or like I really matter to anyone. Life's just not worth living when you're in my skin. People say life is worth living for those few moments of happiness. For me they seem to be getting further and further apart and I don't think they'll ever come back. i want to talk to someone. I really just want to talk to someone. Therapy has never worked as they also seem to just ask me to not feel this way than trying to understand why I feel this way. Nothing brings me joy anymore. I slowly am getting detached from everyone I know, putting myself in a corner, trying to make sure no one approaches me, everyone's fading away. I'm not consciously doing. If you're reading this, please try to talk to me. Even 5 minutes of yours would help more than you could ever imagine.
