Need Advice on How To Get HelpHey, you wonderful people on R/Suicidewatch:

For the last two years I've wanted to kill myself. That desire has pretty much dominated every day. Wake up, think about killing myself, try and do schoolwork or job, think about killing myself, eat, think about killing myself, go to bed. Repeat. I've managed to keep it to myself except for a couple of fairly visible and noticeable breakdowns. However it's manifested itself in my life as a kind of social paralysis that gives me about an hour or two a day to talk to other people, the rest I spend trying to cope with myself and these thoughts. It's ruined schoolwork, jobs and friendships and I'm running out of ways to play the "just another day" game with myself. I spend most everyday now just mainlining whatever kinds of media I can get my hands on, drinking, or shoving things in my face to try and stimulate myself away from any further suicidal ideations as they call it in psych class.

Unfortunately that's a poor solution when you're trying to finish your last semester of college and move on so you can take your worthless 2.8 degree and start paying down your student loans. 

A year into this current episode I went to the Doctor and asked to be put on anti-depressants. I haven't managed to take them regularly so I've been going on and off them for the past year, taking them whenever I remember and refilling them whenever I notice I'm out and have the energy to leave my apartment. 

So I come to you, good internet samaritans that you are, wondering what I can do. I don't really think this is a sustainable model for living the rest of my life and I'm worried because the extra "oh-shit you've fucked off for the last four years now go live" tension has already worn me down and I'm only two months in. Do you have any ideas for a plan that I can try to get myself out of this? I'm personally fairly poor and I'm really loathe to ask anyone else for help as no one reacts very well to this kind of thing.

thanks
