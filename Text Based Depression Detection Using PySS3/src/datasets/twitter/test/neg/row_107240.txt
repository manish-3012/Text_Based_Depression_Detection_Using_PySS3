I want to fucking die.My baby hasn't gone to sleep for hours, it's 12.35am where I am, the father does fuck all, has bathed baby once and gone for a family walk with us once in baby's 4.5 month life, and sleeps in right up till he goes to work of an afternoon, stays up gaming for 5 or so hours after work so goes to sleep about 5am. He is literally zero support, baby was 100% planned. Has "bonded" about 5 times since the birth, was asleep when baby was born, barely visited me in hospital. He had 2 whole months off work when baby was born yet slept in till 1pm everyday and barely did anything, just fucking gamed the whole fucking time. He's either massively depressed or there's something else wrong with him. I fucking want to die, I've already planned it. Now I'm just going to decide when.
