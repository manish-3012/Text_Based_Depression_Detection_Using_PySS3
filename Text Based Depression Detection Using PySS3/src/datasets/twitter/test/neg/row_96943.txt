Thought I wouldnâ€™t have to post here again.Tomorrow night Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Things were going good for me but i fucked it up again. And I have no means to fix it. Iâ€™ve been able to force a situation in my favor out of my past traumas but thereâ€™s no solutions for me this time. Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™m unwanted. Iâ€™m no good. Even if internet strangers will obligatorily say I am. I wonâ€™t really read these comments. This isnâ€™t a reach out for help. I just want my words out there before I go. Iâ€™m freaked out yeah but Iâ€™m trying to remember to stay calm. I can really do it this time.
