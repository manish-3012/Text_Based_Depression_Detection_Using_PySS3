Falling hard and fast.I can't find a job. My ex-wife is trying to take away my son and put me in a cell. My current SO has cancer. We are living with her parents. We have no money. My family is not helpful. I'm 33 years old...have no prospects, no family, no friends, and i'm close to losing the only two people that matter to me not to mention my freedom. My son and girlfriend are the only reason i still cling to life, but thoughts about ending my own life are multiplying. I want to spend as much time as i can with my son and my girlfriend. I love them dearly, but I'm about to my limit of how much stress and pain i can take. I want to live happily but don't know how.
