Tonight is the sameHi. Thank you for reading this. I am not going to die tonight but I want to. Oh how I want to. I just need to get my thought out to someone so thank you for taking a piece of your life to read mine.

I'm 27. I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Haven't tried since. Haha 10 years clean.

Shit sucks. You keep telling yourself things get better but you know every day that it's a lie.

For the past 6 years I have been living to take care of my grandfather and mother. I have no job because it's a full time job taking care of them. In my spare time I do home repairs on both houses, I'm pretty good at it and basically done everything from flooring to whole bathroom remodels. I also built my own house with my bare hands, only 1200 sq ft but it's my dream home.

My mother is suicidal and my grandfather is about to die. Every morning I wake up and go check on him and you have no idea how it makes me smile to see him.

My father got arrested for child pornography a couple months ago so I'm the only thing my mother has now.

I'm not dumb. I have two college degrees but I feel like a failure. I try.

I sit here and think "what's next?". I have everything I want in life but I'm terrified of losing everything. I'm not sad, I'm not wanting more, I'm perfectly content. It is what scares me.

I've been looking for a girlfriend for 8 years, haven't found one yet because I never go out and even though I don't think I'm ugly I can't find anyone using Tinder. I've tried other dating apps but nothing.

I have no money to my name and any money I do have goes to my mother and grandfather. I do odd jobs for people like fixing home plumbing or remodels. Guess you can call that a job but I don't make that much to require to send in a Tax return.

The only thing I think I'm missing is someone to give my love to. It's all I've ever wanted. There was this girl that I have liked for 10+ years but I think tonight is the night I finally lay that to rest, long story. My whole love life is a long story. My other last crush, that I knew just as long, got raped and wanted to stop talking to me. That was over a year ago. She's with someone now and I'm actually happy for her.

Life doesn't get better. Sorry this is such a poorly written post. So much to say but I don't care to write.

Everyone is special. You are special :)
