Why? Just why?I am 17 years old. The past 3 years I have been dealing with depression. I got horrible acne 2 years ago where I then took strong medication to get rid of it. Now I have started to bald for the past year, and not recession, plain out balding. I have no confidence in myself and im tortured by thoughts of suicide daily. Everything is just falling apart. I hate everything. Everything is cold. Why should I choose to live when living is the hardest part of life? Man I have no idea what the fuck to do. My parents dismiss me as obsessive and that I need resistance or whatever the fuck that is. They want me to go to a psychologist, how is talking to someone going to solve anything...Im sorry for rambiling i just dont know what to do anymore. Everything hurts and breathing is hard. Sorry
