Let Me DieGod, I am a melodramatic, fucking piece of shit. I have a life most people on this planet would kill for. And all I want to do tonight is walk out into traffic, cry, and hope that there is some, small love left in this world that will let me die.

I can't do this anymore. I can't keep on moving through this dreamy haze, listening as my father cheers with Fox News about how people are â€œteaming upâ€ to fight the big, bad trans agenda. The man, my fucking dad, has won. He gloats every day, every night. To him I am nothing but his son. That daughter I told him and my mother of? The person I really am? The person who hides in her room day after day, writing and crying and fearing?

She doesn't exist. Not to him, not to anyone.

He won't let me be trans. He's told me this. God made him my father, and no child of his will be one of those disgusting freaks he mocks on the TV. Not now, not ever. I can't escape. I am too afraid to run away. And I don't have any money anyways. He has all the accounts. He has everything. He won, damn it. He won, I lost.

I will never hear someone say they love me as a daughter. I will never hear a child call me mother or maâ€™am. My shoulders are already too wide, my face is too deformed, my hips too inverted. I am just a side-show, a freak. And when people say â€œsheâ€ or â€œher,â€ it will be with sideways laughter and bemused grins. And, in the end, just as my mom says: I will have no friends, no family, and no happiness. When I eventually slit my wrists I will become part of that statistic people point at and tsk their tongues with, saying: â€œsee, look at mentally unstable individuals. Those treatments don't help them; they all just blow their brains out anyways! Why do I have to pay for some meds for those whores and hookers who just make everything all about them?â€

They do not even let me die in peace! My final words. My *only* real words, and are they listened to? No. No matter what I say, they will be painted red with people smearing them with TRANY, and TRAP. On my misgendered grave stone, some kids will come in a few years and snicker as cross out my name and scratch â€œattack helicopterâ€ in its place. Oh, how hilarious they find it. I am one of those funny things you tag at the end of a joke, or in fetishistic porn. I am less than scat to them. I am just a Fe-male, no womb in wombyn, the pathetic loser that can't take a good, funny joke. "Why is it not funny?" They say. "See, this the problem with you â€œtransgenderedsâ€ no humor! Maybe if you had humor you would have your equal rights. Look at the gays? I have allot of gay friends, and they love those faggot jokes!"

"See!"

"See!"

"See!"

Just let me die. Please let me die. Please let me die. Please let me die.
