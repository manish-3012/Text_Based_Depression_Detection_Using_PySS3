I love me, but I don't belong here with these people around meI've been doing so good for a while, I haven't wanted to die since this time last year. Now I'm thinking I've probably just been walking around with no emotions, not feeling anything. I don't have any reason to live, really. It's not just something I'm saying: I don't have any family members I feel close to (all ties are severed), no close friends and the distant friends I have are shit, I've never been in a relationship or even dated anyone for longer than two weeks before they "dump" me. Some recent, smaller events have triggered me and sent me into a bad spiral again.

I love who I am, I think I'm pretty great, people think I look good, I just don't think I'll ever find someone who appreciates who I am or even cares about getting to know who I am. No one ever has. Even when I was 6-7 years old I wish I'd disappear, because of how my parents neglected me emotionally.

I've met so many people I've been hopeful about, I've really tried these two years in therapy and just recently I felt so hopeful and happy about a person. I felt like things could actually work out for me. But everything still keeps failing and it just makes me think that it'll never change. It's like there's something about who I am as a person that makes me unloveable. Guys will always leave, my dad will never call, the rest of my family and my friends just take what they need from me and I get -NOTHING- back.

I really don't see any reason to stay, you guys. I'm soon 25 and my whole life has been like this, full of disappointments and hurt constantly. At this point, the only reason I'm alive is because I want to be confident that I actually die when I try, and so I have more research and preparations to do. I would be sad to see a person like me leave this world, but I'm the only one who would think that.
