I wish I can say goodbyeI can't just go up to people be like, "Hey I'm killing myself tonight i'll miss ya". 

But I wish i could just say goodbye to the people that means most to me and tell them sorry and it's not your fault. I would hate to be lying there dead only for my mum and sister to think that they weren't good enough relatives. :(
