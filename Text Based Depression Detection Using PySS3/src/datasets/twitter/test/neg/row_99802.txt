Everyone I tell gets mad at meEven my therapist is frustrated his words don't work and my friends are done with me.

"But you'll never know what you could have had."
"Its not really solving anything."
"Keep trying to improve yourself. "
"Things get better. "

How long do I have to listen to the same stuff before they realize I might actually have good reasons for wanting to be dead. I tried to fox my life but every time I turn around I get thrown another curve ball. I'm tired and it's been too long.
