Maybe?Hi, um, I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. When you hear stories about depression and over coming mental illness, you only hear about the beginning and the end. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™m going to get better, and most everyone says itâ€™s going to get better. But will it? Iâ€™m a senior in high school right now, and Iâ€™m starting to realize that maybe my future itâ€™s as bright as it should be. Because of childhood trauma, I never got the education I should have gotten. To better explain, growing up I was emotionally and physically abused. I was afraid to ask for anything, because questions meant pain in my household. So in school when I was having trouble, I never asked for help. It might seem like a stupid thing to feel bad about, but I feel like I really screwed up my chances. I could have been so smart. But when I came to this realization years ago that Iâ€™ll never be where I can be, I just gave up. But enough about that. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m so tired. I just never want to get up again. Itâ€™s so difficult to go about each day. I know to other people I may seem fine, but Iâ€™m hurting so much. I just want it all to end. 
Is there a point to keep going? Iâ€™ve tried so hard. I just want it to be better already or I want it all to end.
