I wish I was normalI keep repeating it to myself. "I'm going to kill myself."

Something goes wrong, I say it in my head. For some reason it makes me feel better. For a second.

I keep thinking my friends secretly hate me. Or are annoyed. Or put up with me because they feel sorry for me. They probably don't, but that doesn't stop me from thinking it. I wish it would stop.

I keep asking them to just. Hang out for a minute. But they ghost me. Understandable, I'm fucking boring. I just wish that I could tell them what I'm going through.

If I could even put it into words.

I'm absolutely good for nothing. My life is dead already, I hardly ever leave to do anything. I'm a waste of space and energy.

I wish I would die in my sleep. I wish I still had my prescription so I could down them all. I hate this. No, not hate. I can't even feel that anymore. All I do is wake up, eat, excrete, repeat. I don't see the point to anything anymore.

I wish life would let me be done.
