Altruistic suicide?This probably sounds absolutely ridiculous, but I'd really like to find a way to successfully commit suicide in some fashion that allows someone to find me quickly enough after "clinical death" so that the medical community can harvest whatever organs they could use to better other people's lives (and so the pups are found before they start chewing off my face - kind of glad I don't have any cats at this point in my life.). Death seems the only viable option at this point (will spare you from the reasoning behind this choice , just suffice to say that I've been fighting that battle since the age of 16. Perhaps I'll muster the motivation to write a post in the future outlining the reasoning for the decision someday). I'm tired. So very, very tired. The battle doesn't seem worth it after over two decades of war. 

Curious if anyone has heard of someone managing to accomplish this.
