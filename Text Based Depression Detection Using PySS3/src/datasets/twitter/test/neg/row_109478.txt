TrappedCanâ€™t get over that the therapist now thinks I donâ€™t want to get better.

Why the fuck did I go to therapy.  I knew it wouldnâ€™t change whatâ€™s happened to me.  Itâ€™s no replacement for abandonment.

Waste my time on drugs that make me a zombie.  Psychiatrist hasnâ€™t even listened for 5 fucking weeks.  The drugs make me a fucking zombie.  I sleep all day, I donâ€™t get my work done.  Why pay these people.

Itâ€™s all stupid.  This life is a hell.  This life is a hell.

There is no way out.  Itâ€™s all stupid.
