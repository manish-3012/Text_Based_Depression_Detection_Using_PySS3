Just A Bad DayI am absolutely **not** going to act on this, but for some reason I need to type it out. Please delete if inappropriate. I will understand.

Car, more than half a tank of gasoline, a garage. I kind of wish I had the balls to do this, but I don't.

There is no particular reason for this. Nobody has done anything or **not** done anything to me or for me. It just **is**. ::shrug::

I hope everyone else is having a better day.
