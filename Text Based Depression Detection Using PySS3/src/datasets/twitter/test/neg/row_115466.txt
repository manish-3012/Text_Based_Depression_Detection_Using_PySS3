My brother killed himself yesterday - looking for help, resourcesI really wish this were a post asking for help to bring someone back from looking over the edge but unfortunately I'm too late.

My brother had been battling crippling depression for years and just turned 30 right before Xmas. He left home yesterday morning, said he was just "Going out for awhile, probably gonna see some friends." he did that very often, almost every weekend so we didn't think much of it.

Around dinnertime a police chaplain showed up at our door and informed us that my brother had committed suicide about an hour and a half north of the city yesterday afternoon. Due to jurisdiction, his body was taken to their central hub, which is about 3 hours north of here. 

I'm taking time off from work to grieve and help my dad get things squared away and support him. To be honest while the suicide was shocking, it wasn't terribly surprising, as horrible as that sounds. We tried to reach out to him but he would never accept or seek help. 

My dad doesn't really want to just throw away all of his belongings. I think he wants to donate them to somewhere that could use them. He has a lot of clothes obviously that could go to a Goodwill though I'm wondering if there's some other resource that could put them to better use, or even possibly donate them to OWS.

He also was very big into model airplanes. His room is stacked to the ceiling in a corner with boxes of model kits. He's won numerous awards for his craftsmanship and I'm sure that the unused kits could see some use at a children's home or something. We plan on holding onto a few keepsake-esque items but we just want to know where to take the rest. 

Thanks for your support guys. My brother and our family are atheists so please be respectful of that.
