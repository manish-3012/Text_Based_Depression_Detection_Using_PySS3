I just donâ€™t want my dad to find meheâ€™s gone tonight overnight and I wanted to be gone before he gets back. He and everyone else would be better off without me. I could go into such detail over why it would be better, why things wonâ€™t get better for me here but I donâ€™t want to annoy anyone and I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this. Iâ€™m so tired and I donâ€™t see any hope. My dad can still have a good and happy life but not with me weighing him down.
