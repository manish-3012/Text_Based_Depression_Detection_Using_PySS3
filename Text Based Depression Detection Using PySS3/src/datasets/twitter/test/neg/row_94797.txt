Sad (self-harm trigger warning)I lost my closest friend in my life. He was actually online, but my mom made me delete the social contact I had with him. I don't know what to do. My mom has recently been lying to me and being rude, same with my therapist. My therapist won't give me a break, she forces me to say things I don't want to. I feel so alone, and so depressed. Everything's been downhill lately. I hurt myself. Everyone calls me an attention seeker. My parents, family, and my therapist all think it's a stage/phase and I'll get over it, that I'm too scared to cut myself or to commit suicide. But that isn't true. I just want a damn break forever. Every day I wish I was dead.
