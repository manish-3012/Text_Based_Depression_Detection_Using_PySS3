How do you keep going?What keeps you from giving up? I've reached a point in my life where I just don't have it in me. I don't even feel like the same person I was a year ago. I've tried taking online courses to get back into school, to feel like I'm learning something that will truly benefit my life but I can't retain any of the information. It just passes right through me. I can't hold down a job and at the moment I can't even manage to get one. My girlfriend and I just broke up. She told me she didn't want to be with a "depressed person" and that she was worried about passing these things onto her future children. It makes me feel like a disease. I've lost all creativity and usually when I get into these hyper depressive states it's when I feel the most creative. 

I want to make my family proud, my sister just passed her CPA exam and has been doing great and I'm 25 just moved back home with my parents with no college behind me, no skillsets. I feel absolutely fucking worthless. I have bills I have to pay and I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and apply for jobs. I've been a consistently depressed person ever since I was young but this feeling just takes the cake. It's never been this bad, never this hopeless.  I'm lost and I'm scared.

How the fuck do I keep this up?
