End of my ropeIâ€™m 38.  No kids, a financial failure and a burden on my brother and parents.  I canâ€™t make a good decision.  Any time I try to get my life straight I end up screwing up again.  Iâ€™m off work on leave because of surgery, havenâ€™t been paid in a month and wonâ€™t get paid until the middle of January.  I fail any attempt at relationships.  Basically Iâ€™m unlovable and useless.  And Iâ€™m a coward.  Iâ€™ve had plan after plan but canâ€™t find the courage to do it.   My family would be better off without me.  Iâ€™m just too chicken shit to follow through.
