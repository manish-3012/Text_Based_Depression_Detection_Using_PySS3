One of my friends has just overdosed on tylenol.Title is Tl;Dr but I really urge you to read the whole thing  


I have just had to call an ambulance to my friendâ€™s house because she has taken 8 tylenol tablets. Sheâ€™s told me she will do it for a long time and I kept trying to make her not to and kept talking to her constantly about it and didnâ€™t get her help then and now this happened. I couldnâ€™t stop her, and if you also have a friend or a relative going through the same thing please get them help as soon as you can because you wonâ€™t be able to change someoneâ€™s mind if theyâ€™re determined to carry out an action.    **Even if you are going through anything and have these kind of thoughts, please donâ€™t do it, you have so many people that do care about you, I know you most likely donâ€™t care but just think what it would be like for you to lose someone close to you, please get help as soon as you can, online, suicide hotlines, anything please just donâ€™t suffer in silence, itâ€™s not fair for you or anyone else**
