No reason not to anymore. I've thought it out.I have really thought about this for a long time now. My life is at an all time low and I don't see it getting better because I've tried just about everything I could. A few people will be sad but they'll get over it, everyone does. I don't care about having no more happiness, just anything to end this is better than now. The cons definitely outweigh the pros.  I'm going to give it a bit longer but I don't see my mind changing.
