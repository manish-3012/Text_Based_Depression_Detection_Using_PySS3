Iâ€™d rather be dead than depressed again.Iâ€™m bipolar and I can feel my mania going away. I only had it for a week, and itâ€™s already slipping!

I want to live like Iâ€™m dying, because Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ll end up dead by the end of this next episode. I donâ€™t want to be depressed again. I just donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been crying all day, and I feel so close to death. I keep thinking about killing my self just to stop the pain.

Iâ€™m scared.
