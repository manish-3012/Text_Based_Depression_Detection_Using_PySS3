Reading these when suicidal vs. notHonestly reading these posts when you are not suicidal, in my opinpm, makes everyone look like they come off as attention seeking.  Like I see these posts when Iâ€™m not suicidal as people needing to grow up.

But when I am suicidal itâ€™s like the last cry for help. I get satisfaction in researching ways to kill myself. Iâ€™m really looking for someone to listen because Iâ€™m so low.

The fucked up part is a lot of people turn their back when you are this low, which is why I think we post here.

I have had a great 6 months and this thread was in my rear view.  Iâ€™ve had a hard few weeks and Iâ€™m remembering why I joined.  Just happy to be here for yâ€™all.

Tldr:when Iâ€™m not suicidal or depressed these posts look like weak attention seekers.  When I am depressed or suicidal this is a lifesaving thread for people who will listen.
