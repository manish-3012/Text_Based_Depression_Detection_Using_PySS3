I cant stop thinking about dyingIt's been a hard couple of weeks. Before this last couple of weeks I would think about killing myself every once and a while but now IT'S ALL I think about. It consumes me everyday. I just dont know what to do anymore I'm thinking about committing myself but I dont want to lose my freedom.
