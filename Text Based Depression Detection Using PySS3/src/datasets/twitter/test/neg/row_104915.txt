If this world doesn't work the way you wish it to, it's over, period. Nothing will ever be good unless you change, and not a lot of people have it in them to change, but for sure you don't.Principles suck and so do wishes. If you dream about money and a hednoist lifestyle but you don't exploit every single thing in life to your advantage, it's over. If you want friends/bf/gf but you are a sore loser, dumb, full of anxiety and STILL don't change, it's over. This world sucks so much I'm sick of it. Like if you have impossible goals it's just over, simply because it's so hard to give away that goal, and easier to kill yourself. Sounds idiotic but it's true. I curse the day I was born as a materialistic fuck. Also as a fucking coward. Atleast let me be happy with a piece of bread, not make me wish for a fucking castle.

It's so fucking hard to change and give up on goals you know can't happen and if we don't change, there will be more fucking hanging bodies near the park and corpses laying in the bloddy bath or blown out brains on the kitchen floor.
