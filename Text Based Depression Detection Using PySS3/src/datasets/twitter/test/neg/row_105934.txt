My past makes any future seem impossibleI donâ€™t know how to connect, or love, or be intimate with anyone. I never learned how from my family, and after a certain age you become stuck in how you are.

Because of my past I feel my future is set in a stone of loneliness, emptiness, and invisibility. What makes it worse for me is as a woman, I feel like one of the things that would make me valuable in a relationship is my ability to love and be affectionate, whether to my partner or future children. Iâ€™m also not attractive at all. So I feel completely useless, because the only thing I could ever want is to have someone to spend my time with, since I didnâ€™t have that as a kid.

I donâ€™t want to look forward to the future, there is nothing to look forward to but disappointment and rejection.
