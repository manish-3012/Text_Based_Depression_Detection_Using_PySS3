I feel like suicide is too pervasive a thought on my mind...Hi, I'm 21/female. I'm constantly thinking about how much easier dying would be than life. In life you have so many expectations and pressures. I work 2 hospo jobs and am in my final semester of uni. But I feel as though I have no direction. Sure, I have some average reading, writing and analytical skills but they are just average. When I look at jobs online there's always a skill I'm missing or am not good enough at. I feel like I'm average at everything. My other "skills" are music, as I sing and write songs. But they aren't even good. They're just average. I'm meant to be achieving something. But I feel so stupid all the time. Even when I'm slightly good at something it's never good enough. 

When I'm friends with someone it never lasts very long because I fuck it up or they start rumours about me or ignore me or like me more than a friend and I don't feel the same so they stop being my friend. This makes me feel like they don't even like me as a person... just my looks. I let them get close to me (in the sense that we spend a lot of time together) because I'm so lonely, but then they end up leaving anyway. This recently happened with a guy I was close to for 4 months and I was straight with him I didn't want a relationship from the start. He tried, he gave up. And my friendship wasn't worth it so he kept ignoring me. I don't have a proper boyfriend either. I'm just seeing the same guy I've seen for 3.5 years because I still love him but I know we won't end up together because he told me that. Friends become people that I have to actively avoid else I'll feel even more shit about myself. My family is distant. I really feel like no one cares and I've just stopped feeling like I can have friends or a boyfriend or any kind of future.

I also have a really short attention span which hinders my academic abilities a great deal. I want to be working on stuff I care about but I'm losing interest in things I used to love. Every day feels exhausting.

I don't really know what this post has become... I have attempted suicide three times in the past few years but each time didn't take enough pills to kill myself. I just want to sleep and not wake up because I'm tired of thinking and feeling and being me. 

Can someone please offer me some advice? Is life worth living or not?
