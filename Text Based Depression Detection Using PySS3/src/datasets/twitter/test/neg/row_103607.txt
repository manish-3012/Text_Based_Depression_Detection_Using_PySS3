Why Dont More Prople Commit Suicide With Alcohol?I just realized this.

 I've never been blackout drunk, but I imagine that drinking a shitton if alcohol and blacking out is a pretty peaceful way to die, considering people do it by accident all the time and don't even realize it.

Seems like a fantastic idea
