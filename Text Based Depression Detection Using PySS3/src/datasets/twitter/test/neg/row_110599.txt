Walking CorpseI just turned 16 and I feel myself getting closer to death. I realize nothing I do matters and one day my life will end anyway. I keep fucking up my life and I think it's too late for me to be saved. The only way I get through the day is if I'm either passed out from xans or fucked up on other pills or THC. I'm always trying to get harder drugs because they numb the pain. I feel so happy when I'm high and I stop being self conscience. I hate who I am when I'm sober, I'm so introverted and shy I can't stop critiquing myself. I always regret my past decisions and deeply hate who I am. I realize that I should get clean but honestly if I have to be sober any longer that will be the day I break. I feel like I'm trapped and there is no way out, I've convinced myself that no matter what happens I'll end it one day. I feel like I'm not even a person.
