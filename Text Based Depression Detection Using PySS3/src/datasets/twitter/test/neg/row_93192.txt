Why keep on goingHi , i dont know how to start..
im 33, and depressed my whole life.
my dad comitted suicide 4 years ago.
and since than i feel like im not me anymore  if that makes any sense..
im living now with my mom  she was never used to be alone.so we thought living rogetjer was a good idea.
aftee like 6 months of my dads suicide i had a bad car accident where i almost died and llst for a year my driver license so my mom had to drive my again...since than i feel like ive lost my independance and also my job.... and feel like 12 again ever since...
i also have no friends  , never was in a relationship...after my dads death i became so self destructive  to the point i got raped and im not into men. which i think broke me completely.... im just not me anymore and dlnt care anymore...and i wonder.if i die...no one would even care...... like i try to find a point that my life makes any sense if i would go on. cause it goes nowhere now...... i never was in love,never had a relarionship..and never will....no work anymore...no friends...no other family....literally no one would care if i die tomorrow........ i also tried suicide after my dads death...but even than i was kknda better than i am now...i just dont care anymore.not about myslef or anybody else... im only tired.and i see no future for myself..... i dont see any sense why im still here or why should keep on going anymore
