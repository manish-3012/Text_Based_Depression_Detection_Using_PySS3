I know this may not be the best place to talk about it but I have now where else to go. My boyfriend is in the hospital right now because one of his friends found him blacked out very recently. It turned out he had overdosed on propanolol. I donâ€™t really want to talk about what has been going on his life recently, but I really hope that heâ€™s going to be okay. I talked to the family member that found him unconscious and apparently it was more than 3 grams. I just need some reassurance, is he going to be okay? Do you guys have any knowledge about this type of medicine?
