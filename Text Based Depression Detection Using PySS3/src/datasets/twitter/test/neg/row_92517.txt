Cutting Becoming Dangerous, Wanting Death All The Time NowI have been self harming since I was around 8 years old. At around fourteen it became a more serious matter, with cuts being deep enough to need stitches yet not super dangerous. Recently within the last month I have been cutting incredibly deep, the two times that I was forced to go to the hospital on requiring several internal and external stitches. I have also recently started to have auditory hallucinations due to a Traumatic Brain Injury after a horrible car accident. I have no support and now when cutting that deep I have been avoiding medical care and hoping to get them infected. Not sure what to do or why I am posting this, but I have no support and was hoping to find some here somehow. Thanks for reading and here is a cookie if you read all of this!
