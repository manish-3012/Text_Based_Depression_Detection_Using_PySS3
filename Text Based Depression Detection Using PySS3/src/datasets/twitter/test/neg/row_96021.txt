Can Someone Please Just Listen To Me for a WhileI don't feel safe right now, it's easier to talk to a stranger. It's heavy shit I need to get off my chest. I live my entire life on the edge of suicide, and I've recently lost a lot of friends. I just...need someone to listen to me bitch.

if you're uncomfortable talking about CSA Abuse and LGBTA+ issues don't message me please.

I have a bottle of painkillers that are really tempting right now , and I was in the ward not that long ago so please some just talk to me.
