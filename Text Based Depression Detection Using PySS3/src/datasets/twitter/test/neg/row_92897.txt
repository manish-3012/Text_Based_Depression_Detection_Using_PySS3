Not sure what to do now after doing everything i had toI don't really know where to begin and I don't really know why I'm writing here maybe I want some encouragement or just to let it all out idk at this point

I'll try to keep it short 
Since I was 11 I wanted to kill myself I don't know why I have this thought I can't say I am depressed or miserable I just feel like this is the thing I have to do 
It's like my job and purpose in life is to kill myself 

The thing is until now I had way to many things to do 
And people to take care of. So I couldn't do it.
But now everything I had to do has been taken care of I did everything and now I feel free 
For the first time in my life I feel free to finally end it all and get some rest 

And this thought I'm having has been stronger than ever so strong that it's tormenting at this point 
It's like nails scratching at the side of your head and some one whispering it's time

Some days ago I was at the beach and I don't know why I just started going deeper and deeper until I started drowning and I felt such relief at that point 
I thought ah it's finally over I can finally rest but a friend of mine intervened 

Since that day I can't forget the feeling of relief and piece and the voice whispering it's time has gotten louder

I've done everything
I've taken care of friends family personal afairs 
There is nothing left for me to do but do the thing I feel like I'm meant to do 

I'm sorry for my scrabbled thoughts but everything in my head is just a mess 

Thank you and sorry to the people reading this
