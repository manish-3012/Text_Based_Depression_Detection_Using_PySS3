Worried about people leaching off my deathI'm worried that some people will leech off of my death. I'm 18, and well it's a very long story. I'm just ready to go now. 

My question is, how do I deal with people who may potentially try to claim my possessions or leach off 9f my death to get time off school by saying they were my friend? I've got about 3 close friends who I'd say are close enough to me that they'll be affected by it. 

What are your guy's opinions? I don't want some random dickhead to just leach off of my death by acting like they were my friend.
