I don't want to kill myself but I cannot imagine a future where it's no inevitableShort story is I am 24 years old and have spent my whole life alone. I've always wanted to find someone who saw me as worth it but no one ever did. I always though maybe next year but the older I get the more pathetic and a waste I feel like. Who wants a 24 year old male who hasn't even been on a date or even kissed as girl. I've been working on self improvement but whenever I look at the forever alone subreddit there is guys there who have had similar stories and are in their 40s and I cannot make it that lol. I don't want to kill myself and it scares the shit out of me that I'm going to have to.
