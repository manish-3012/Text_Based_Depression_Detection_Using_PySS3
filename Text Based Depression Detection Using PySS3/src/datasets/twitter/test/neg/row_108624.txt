Thanks Reddit, for just being there for meI know I have a problem, I'm in college now but I've been dealing with it since Middle school years. I started writing down my thoughts last year and I am so frustrated with myself. I think I need help? But I don't think help can "fix" me.

I have a great life, everything is going for me in school and work and other activities. I'm social but it is limited, never been in a relationship. I am usually ok, then I have these moments of despair and I am just worried about myself. 

Drinking makes it worse (you can tell the drunk ones base on spelling/time), but I also have a lot of fun some nights. It's probably 1/5 times that I have a bad night that causes these types of writings, most nights I just have a good time.

I just need to share these ever consuming thoughts.

Sometimes I feel like there a rules to life that everyone knows but no one will  tell me. Other times I remind myself that someone has to be the loser then how  else can someone be deemed "better"? When I imagine myself I am totally opposite  of how I am, when I imagine how others view me I think they are only aware of  the negative. When I'm actually pretty certain I am as average as everyone else.  I don't like living in this messed up world. I'd rather be forever alone rather  this occasional inclusion with the minority of the time feeling like an outcast.  I bury my emotions and then when I feel them well up over me then I realize how  bad it is to hide emotions but also why I don't want to acknowledge them.  

 I want to run away from everyone and everything. But that is simply cowardice,  but why do I have to brave in the face of my fears? Why can I want to be and do  something but I don't? Why do I hide behind a happy smile and cheerful attitude?  I am lonely but wont let myself feel bad about it because it's my own fault so I  deserve it. Then I realize how self centered I am and thus don't really deserve  anything...  

 I won't speak to anyone about these issues, I know they can't help but it will  change their opinion about me. I am not willing to put my burdens on other  people. I also know that if I don't tell anyone then it's my own fault that I  feel alone.  

I feel hyper aware of my place in this world that most days I wish I could shut  it all down and run simply on instinct, if I could be as happy and carefree as  my dog it would be such a relief. I feel so heavily weighed down by thoughts and  emotions that it scares me that I am being buried alive.   

Now I just feel whiny, ungrateful for all the things that do go right in my life.  

Then I remember that everyone feels pretty messed up inside, thus again reminding me that I even in my faults I am in no way unique.

Death is the easy way out, living will be hardest thing you'll ever do.  Why does this have to be so hard. Why do I want to cry but still feel like I am  right. Why am I so scared yet so confident. I don't know how to fix me being me,  it is easier to just be alone. Terrified but then I can't hurt anyone. I want to  just be ok and not care and deal with myself. Sometimes it just doesn't seem  worth it.

So close to losing everything, give it all up and be done. It's not worth it,  nothing is worth it. I feel like a robin trying to swim, drowning as all the  other fish swim by..,

I am happy, so very happy. My future is bright and I cannot wait to see what I can achieve and what is in store for me. My career is my priority now but dating and finding someone I want to spend my life is also very much something I want.

I do not fear Death.
I fear loneliness. 
I fear sadness. 
I fear disappointment. 
I fear embarrassment. 
But....Death? 
I do not fear Death.

Fuck emotions, may they die and rot in I inviting oblivion. Collapsing, falling  and so very scared. Is this what life is? I don't live for me, I live for those  people who need me to exist. If it were only me I'd kill myself. What does that  really mean? I live for others? Life by yourself isn't work it? Blah blah blah.  I want to fuck shit up, I want to leave and run away. Start something new and  unknown. I want to be quiet with my self, lonely? No. A quiet lover and a gentle  friend.

Have you ever been so happy you could cry? So happy you feel like you could  float away? Bliss encompasses the smells of spring and comfort of fall.

Life is nothing like you see on tv. Now. I'm just very or mildly drunk desiring  food. It's hard to   

I'm lonely.

Pain, fear, sorrow, judgement. Why can I never escape you? 







2/28/13 11:34pm

I want to die. I want to be alone, I don't want to force myself on anyone else,  people say they like me but I don't believe them . I am nothing , I don't know  how to have fun and u don't know how to let my guard down. I want to break this  bottle over my own head, this the life worth dead.  Fuck all the shit and die a  motherfuvkinh death.

Everyone suffers, you are no different. Self pity is a waste of energy.

These days are hard, but not really harder than any other day. I just feel that I spend more time wondering if I am doing things right instead of enjoying what Iâ€™m doing. There are all these things I should be doing but I donâ€™t either because I am too busy or I donâ€™t know how or I am not willing to try.

It shouldn't take being drunk in a bar bathroom for you to remember you actually  would rather be dead. Suck it up an fake it, what do you have to lose? Nothing.

Everyone one seems to know how to live, yet here I sit just being alive.

Iâ€™m so lonely. Scared of forever being alone. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m not worth loving. Terrified that I have screwed myself over. That I am messed up, unloveable. Not worth anyones time. I shouldnâ€™t expect someone to love me when I donâ€™t love myself, when I donâ€™t thinkg Im worth loved.  Life is tooo hard too much to deal with . Sadnees, anger , shame, embaressament, lonlines. Fear and anger. PAIN LONILINESS AND SHAME

I NEED CONTROL AND POWER YET I HAVE none

You ruin everything, you are a funsucker

Nothing, just nothing. Not even worth the effort. Never forget your failure and shame. yOu are not worth the effort so donâ€™t justify it you fuckup of a person.
