Feeling hopelessI donâ€™t want to hurt myself. But Iâ€™m so tired of these passive thoughts of being so overwhelmed I wish everything could just stop.  Iâ€™ve been suicidal with a plan before, and Iâ€™m not that bad now. Iâ€™ve worked with people who are suicidal because of my profession. But I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t seem to bring myself out of that pit of hopelessness and feeling overwhelmed. 

People tell me Iâ€™ve come so far for being my age, but sometimes all I can see are my failures and feeling like no one wants me. I feel disposable. My employer could always fill my job with someone else. I go on dates but nothing ever lasts..it seems like all people want anymore is casual sex, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that but itâ€™s not for me. I would feel guilty because of my upbringing and I need to be in something stable first with someone Iâ€™ve built trust with so I feel safe. And Iâ€™m left feeling like people I date just want to use me, so then they leave when they realize I want more than that and Iâ€™m not gonna just be down for whatever. 

I feel like a burden to talk to anyone about these thoughts. I feel guilty when I open up much to family or friends, so I donâ€™t tell them I have these hopeless thoughts. I donâ€™t want them to worry, or think Iâ€™m crazy or not able to handle the stresses of life. Iâ€™m scared people wonâ€™t take me seriously as a person or as a professional if they knew how much I struggled with always feeling panicked, even when I seem happy or like Iâ€™m having a good time. 

And Iâ€™ve gotten better at masking my feelings than I was as a teenager. I joke around and Iâ€™m sarcastic af, but those same internal feelings are still very real. I try to mask my pain with humor, but when Iâ€™m alone at night it all breaks down. I canâ€™t sleep and just have to deal with my pain and trauma (I hate that word, but fuck it I guess thatâ€™s what it is) and guilt. 

Guilt over creating my own path in life and choosing my own beliefs; guilt for feeling the way I do when on the outside it looks like I have a lot going for me; guilt for being near perfectly physically healthy whenever I care for people everyday who are not and who somehow seem more emotionally resilient than I am. 

Trauma over not always being accepted by my family for who I am, though thatâ€™s getting somewhat better (even though the reality is they still donâ€™t know everything..like that Iâ€™m bi or that Iâ€™m *still* depressed). Church trauma. Secondary trauma or whatever you would call â€œI wish it was me and not youâ€ from work or even from some of my experiences talking to people when I went to church in the past. Trauma of being told over and over by the church I was wrong when I was right or when I was just trying to live my truth. Trauma from the literal nightmares I still have reliving various scenarios while Iâ€™m just trying to freaking rest. And sometimes I canâ€™t even remember all of the dreams I just jolt awake feeling scared and remembering bits and pieces, if anything. 

Pain from painting over all of it to try to convince myself and others that Iâ€™m okay. Sometimes Iâ€™m okay. But a lot of times Iâ€™m not, and itâ€™s difficult to talk about. I think people can see Iâ€™m anxious, but I try not to let on how much it affects me. Maybe they know anyway, and maybe that scares me too.

I thought about calling a hotline or talking to an actual person but that seemed overwhelming and like Iâ€™d be a burden to those people. And I do have a therapist, though Iâ€™m scared to tell her all this; I donâ€™t know why.

But anyway..goodnight Reddit. Iâ€™m gonna keep listening to try by colbie collait while I try and come down from this multi hours long panic attack.
