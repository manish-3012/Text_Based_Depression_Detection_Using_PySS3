I lost , goodbye everyoneHi so my reason for dying is heartbreak. The girl I loved so very much  dumped me and ignores me. I feel lost and still love her. I have nothing left. I would do anything to get her back... to just talk to her and maybe make her smile. But she doesn't want to even talk to me. I feel empty and I don't want to go on. I cut already and that didn't make things feel less bad like it used to. I am just so tired of feeling like this. I don't want to live I want to die. I'm probably going to overdose soon. Not sure when but soon. Maybe I'll said goodbye to her then do it. Fuck I'm so scared I can't do this anymore
