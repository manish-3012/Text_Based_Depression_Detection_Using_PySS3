My family caused me to relapse, I just want to end my fucking suffering right nowA few months ago my sisters husband died and now she lives with us and her young toddler and newborn, now Iâ€™m suicidal again.

Iâ€™m so tired of being told shit to do, and if I donâ€™t do it I get yelled at for it. I always have to baby over her, she canâ€™t manage anything on her own. 

How the hell am I supposed to help someone when Iâ€™m barely surviving on my own? Iâ€™m just barely recovering from my moms physical and mental abuse as well as trying to keep up my grades at school. I have no time to rest.

I started cutting myself again and I keep having suicidal thoughts and honestly I think Iâ€™d be at peace if I was just dead. I have no time to myself, no time to fucking be at peace, to live life and feel free. I have no friends to understand me, I feel so damn alone, I cry myself to sleep every night. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of hurting.

Iâ€™ve already severely damaged my body, my mental health is corrupted, my life is a living hell, I have nothing to live up to, I fucking hate myself, Ive lost so many that I cared about, I think i might just end it now before I hurt myself even more
