I'm tired.I'm so tired i can't breathe, I'm so tired i can't even fake a smile. I'm so tired i want to puke.
I'm just...

Tired.

Does it even matter if i die today? 
I'm just too afraid to do it, just as afraid as I am of living. I just watch as my life goes by, a spectator to this tragedy. 
Would it matter if i died today, knowing i never felt alive in the first place?
I honestly don't remember the last time I was happy.
I'm at the age when the real world tears you to shreds. Why does living have to be so hard, I didn't ask for this, not for any of it.
I thought I escaped from this nightmare, I thought I could learn to live after all of this, but now its all comming back to me. 
I'm so tired and depressed i'm physicly sick.

I'm tired, 

Just let me sleep already.
