I'm getting close to hurting myselfFor the longest time, I never thought I could do it. I've lived with a growing depression for years, and I've always just bottled up my anger or sadness. I used to have martial arts as an outlet, then music, and now nothing. I've admitted to my parents, before, that I've had suicidal thoughts. I could never see myself actually committing suicide, but those thoughts still come and go often. It's more prevalent now due to so many circumstances, many of which I can't personally change. I'm just drifting through life, waiting to die; I'm only 23 and I feel like I'd rather just fade away. Now, the only midway point is to cut myself. At least then I'd feel something, no one at work would even notice. It's the only thing that acknowledges those suicidal thoughts, without committing to them.
