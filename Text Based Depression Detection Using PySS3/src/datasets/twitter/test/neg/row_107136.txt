2 hours into my nightshift and as usual i wish i was dead but dont have the guts to do anything about it7 hours to go and every minute feels like an hour, part of me just wants to end it here so that they are forced to take steps for no one to end up in this situation but at the same time I have hope that things might change and I wish I could extinguish the hope
