Going to do it on Sunday if I can't think of another wayAlright, so I figured I'd post one more thing on this site, since my plan has kind of been ruined by the fact that I can't find the stuff I need to do it. This will be my last chance to change my mind before I choose another method. 

What makes that hard though is that this time it's not an impulse or a feeling. I can fight those, though it's hard. This is logic, so it can only be countered if I can find a different logical next step. Which I'd prefer. When I'm emotional and hurting I want to die, but I'm thinking more clearly and now I don't want it, I've just accepted it. I'm trying to think of reasons not to, trying to find something, anything, online that outlines a different course of action that I could take, but there isn't one that seems plausible for me. 

Suicide is the only way to get out of this miserable pointless existence I'm stuck in. If I could see another one I would take it, but I have logical rebuttals for every other option I've seen/thought of. So what am I supposed to do now?
