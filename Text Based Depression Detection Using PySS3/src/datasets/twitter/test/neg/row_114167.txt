Donâ€™t think I care about the fact that people will be hurt about my death anymoreThat was a big part of why I wouldnâ€™t commit suicide. I honestly donâ€™t care if the people in my life will suffer because of my death. They made me suffer during my life. Why should I care about their feelings (even in death)? 

Thatâ€™s selfish of them tbh... They didnâ€™t care for me whilst Iâ€™m here on earth but now Iâ€™m being told to care for them in death.
