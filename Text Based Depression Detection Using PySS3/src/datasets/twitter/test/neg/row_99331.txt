Soon.I'm going to break out and try fresh but as it stands; but. That word. "Soon," looms a lot closer than it should. 

It's worse every second.  Not every day. I can't eat and sleep is reduced to hour long naps with my heart hammering. 

It isn't news that the folks around me want me gone. 

Think it'll feel like popping a blister. Like the pressure in my head will quit building and it'll be gone. 


Like they'll still blame all the things in the book and never take responsibility, and I won't, of course, because I'll be dead, and they'll just take all the pity they're paraded in while I'm floating down the lane.
