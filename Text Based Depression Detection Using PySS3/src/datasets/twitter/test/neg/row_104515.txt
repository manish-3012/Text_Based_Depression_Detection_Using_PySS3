completely lostthe only person who actually loved me and probably the only person who ever will hates my guts because I screwed up and I have no idea what to do anymore. I love him more than anything and I know this sounds so petty and stupid but I just don't know what to do without him. sure he used me as a rebound but it was perfect. my best friend is absolutely no help because she's in a happy relationship and thinks I can solve everything with random hook ups. I don't see any way out but killing myself and I'm so scared
