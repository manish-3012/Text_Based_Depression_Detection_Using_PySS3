I dont know what to doIts as if every moment of every day I think about how Id kill myself, and its been like that for a couple months now. Its affecting everything, from friendships to schoolwork.

Im scared shitless of talking to anyone and getting help. I dont interact with my mum much, so she doesnt suspect anything. My closest friends are the only ones who know anything, but I dont want to make anyone feel worse because of me because then Ill just hate myself more.

Ive hated every single part of me for a long time. Every bit of my personality I despise, the problem is simply me. Im not gonna write about the "why" here much because Im still fucking scared and thats not why Im posting here.

I just cant take the initiative to talk to anyone because Im so scared of the consequences and I just want to end it. So what do I do?
