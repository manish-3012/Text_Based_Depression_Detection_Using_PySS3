One last goodbye to my catsHey ya. I have 6 cats and they're the only reason I'm not ending everything now. Last couple of weeks were rough. I tried to go today but I simply couldn't find the strength to leave them. Not yet. Not like this.
I feel terrible about that and I'm planning on rehoming them before I'm gone.
I just want them to be safe and be sure they will be alright. They need a home, not just a house.
I love them, they're my everything. I got a better job for them. I got a bigger house for them. 
Even though I feel like hanging myself every day, I make sure they're clean, well fed and play a lot with their favorite toys.
And I'm sad to see them go but I feel is the right decision. I'm terrified that soon I won't be able to properly take care of them. I can't let that happen.

I can't go on anymore. I haven't showered in days, I don't eat, I can't work and I can't sleep. I lost total control over myself and I'm tired.

I just want to end it. I want to finally rest.
