Talking my way through a tough timeHi guys. Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot lately and would enjoy hearing some input from some of you, even if it is haphazard and through the cold face of a computer screen. I also think itâ€™s mostly just therapeutic for me to vent, whether or not anyone actually ends up listening.
 
My story is one thatâ€™s pretty typical of SW. Sometime around the onset of puberty, I began to reflect upon my own impermanence and this silly struggle called life, and began to wonder whether it was really worth seeing it through to the end. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t bring myself to conjure a god to talk to, conversations with my friends at the time more often consisted of penis and fart jokes than existential musings, and I didnâ€™t want to speak with my parents for fear of setting off a chain reaction that ended with me as a medicated zombie everyone avoided and whispered about as the suicidal kid. 

I convinced myself that no one wanted to hear what I was thinking and that if I ignored it long enough and pretended to be happy then it would go away. I bottled everything up and created a happy-go-lucky alter-ego that went to school every day, ogled the pretty girls and joked around with people at lunch. And yet, despite my overt cheerfulness, I could never quite drown out the murmuring voice in the back of my mind. Behind closed doors, within the pages of my journals, the persona I had built around myself would crumble away to reveal a pathetic little boy, locked in a life I increasingly hated, and haunted endlessly by the only resolution I could possibly imagine for such a sweeping and impenetrable issue: the silent embrace of sweet, sweet death.

I was accepted to a good university, graduated from high school and had a pretty girlfriend I liked to the childish point of believing that I was in love (though the relationship ended soon after graduation with her tearfully asking why I never â€œlet her inâ€). I had no real interest in going to college, especially because I didnâ€™t really expect to be alive past the age of thirty, but it seemed like the natural progression, and my parents wouldnâ€™t even begin to entertain supporting a different path. 

I could tell I hated my school from the moment I moved in, surrounded by prattling know-it-alls, narcissistic blockheads and guffawing hedonists with good connections and thick wallets. I distracted myself by chasing girls, drinking too much and generally experiencing typical college life, but I could feel the angst inside of me growing with each passing day. Finally, my infallible faÃ§ade cracked. 

One day during my sophomore year, my parents came to watch me at my cross country championship meet, and I dropped out of the race, broke down and told them how unhappy I was at school. They were flabbergasted and didnâ€™t believe me when I tried to explain to them just how deeply my unhappiness ran. They figured I was having a bad day and was upset because my race. They ignored my cry for help and I went back to pretending like I had always done before.

Iâ€™m a senior in college now, on my spring break, with two months left before graduation, although as of right now itâ€™s extremely unlikely that Iâ€™ll actually graduate. Sometime earlier this year, I hit a breaking point and havenâ€™t been able to rally past it. Iâ€™m tired of pretending that Iâ€™m happy when Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m tired of doing endless busy-work designed to distract me from my pointless existence. Iâ€™m tired of putting up with peopleâ€™s endless bullshit to appear normal. 

I quit running cross country and track. Iâ€™ve stopped going to class. I make no effort to see or talk to anyone. I have a girlfriend who still comes to see me every day, but I can tell she doesnâ€™t know what to make of my sudden change in behavior. I donâ€™t have the heart to tell her that this is the real me, and that the person she loves and who loved her in return is just an utter fabrication. The real me doesnâ€™t love her, just as the real me holds no love for my parents or friends. 

I just canâ€™t see love the same way she can: idealistic, pure and timeless. If I found out tomorrow that my ex-girlfriend from high school died in some terrible accident, I would be shocked, certainly, but that would pass. After all, I havenâ€™t spoken a word to the girl or any of her friends in three years. This person, who once held so much significance in my life, could disappear forever and I would go on, utterly indifferent to her absence. How long before the same could happen between my current girlfriend and me? 

I donâ€™t know how to talk with her about any of this. Iâ€™m the first person sheâ€™s ever trusted with her body and her love, and I selfishly used her to temporarily mask my own pain. Now even the sex is little more than a tedious daily exercise routine. I know I should tell her the truth, but the truth is painful and, even if I donâ€™t love her, I canâ€™t bring so much pain upon her. So Iâ€™ll stick it out until she finally gets fed up and leaves on her own accord, which will probably be relatively soon.

My mother, meanwhile, is baffled by my recent implosion. She calls begging me to just get through the last few weeks, and to remind me how happy Iâ€™ll be once I have my degree. She canâ€™t understand how this demon could have existed under her nose, behind the smiling eyes of her son, or what I mean when I tell her that the degree is a worthless piece of paper symbolizing my preposterous servitude to a loathsome system and that Iâ€™d rather not waste my time on it any longer. My father is so furious heâ€™s stopped calling.

Iâ€™ve been seeing a counselor at my schoolâ€™s health center and theyâ€™ve got me taking medication, but I feel no different than before, and itâ€™s been about five months since I began. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s working, but they insist I keep taking the pills and coming back for talks, so I do.

As far as I can tell right now, Iâ€™m not going to pick up a gun and kill myself tomorrow. But the thought is always there and always has been there, in the back of my mind, as the Grand Answer to everything. Iâ€™ve been reading a lot of Absurdist philosophy lately, and have attempted to truly embrace the Absurd as they all seem to suggest, but I just canâ€™t seem to get my arms completely around it.

Iâ€™m left with the feeling of a captain on a sinking vessel, resigned to his fate as he stares into the cold, dark depths of the abyss. I want help. I want someone to talk me out of it. I want my mom to hug me and make everything all better like she used to. I want to go back to seeing the world the way I did when I was a child: mysterious and fascinating and beautiful. But I canâ€™t forget that each passing moment brings me that much closer to my inevitable death, whether itâ€™s tomorrow or eighty tedious years from now, after a lifetime of struggle and pain. The question is, does the beauty of the world, of love, of friendship, of family, of sunshine and food and women and music and laughter, all outweigh the strife that goes into experiencing it? The thought I just canâ€™t shake is that no, it does not.

Iâ€™ve said a lot, and if youâ€™re still with me then thank you for reading. If you feel as though youâ€™d like to offer your input Iâ€™ll be sure to read and respond.
