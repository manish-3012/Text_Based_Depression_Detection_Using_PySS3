Maybe I'll Kill Myself Tonight...Don't Really CareOK sw.  I am fucking pissed to the point of incoherence.  

I want to be dead.  I know that will sadden the family I never see (and don't feel like seeing).  I don't care.  

I go to a therapist every week.  She's the forth I've tried.  No plan to get better, no instructions on what to do. If she's counting on me to figure this out for myself she's wrong.  Been to 4 psychiatrists, stopped taking the drugs, that made me feel like shit probably more likely to kill myself and definitely more likely to die behind the wheel.  

I don't want active listening and joining me in the dark place.  I want to fucking down the 8 shots I've measured out and lay down so I can choke on my own vomit.  It's been several months since there's been anyone but me in my house.  

My life just fucking sucks and I want out.
