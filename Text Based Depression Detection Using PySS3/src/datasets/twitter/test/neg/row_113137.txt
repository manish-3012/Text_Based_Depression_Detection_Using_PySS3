That happenedLost a lot of relationships this year, lost all my friends, however whether they were friends or not is debatable. Lost my gf probably best thing that could of happened as she was a complete lier. Still though I miss having someone there like that. Would be better if I had friends but nope. I feel like itâ€™s karma was a total cunt when I was younger but I dunno, I feel like thereâ€™s a limit to taking the piss lol. I canâ€™t rest anytime my mind goes clear Iâ€™ll remember something new which which was said or done. All together just very lonely and miserable. Always been paranoid but now I have the proof. Donâ€™t think ima make anymore friends or have anymore relationships so I really donâ€™t have any hope for the future. I just sit about all day tryna get through the day hoping Iâ€™ll get to sleep quick so I donâ€™t have to think about my situation. Which is very embarrassing. Definitely just gonna kill myself. Dunno what Iâ€™m waiting for tbf. Donâ€™t wanna upset my parents but fuck it I couldnâ€™t really care anymore. Bit hard to get a rope in my head so probs just gonna throw myself in front of a train. Just wish I had someone there or could turn back the time. Things will just get worse
