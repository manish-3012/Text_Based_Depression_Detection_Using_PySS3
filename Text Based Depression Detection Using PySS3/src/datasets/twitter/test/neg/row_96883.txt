I Hate EverythingI'll just give a semi quick rundown here but if anybody cares I can talk more about things in pms. I basically just hate everybody, everything, and even myself. I do not like who I am today and I have nothing going for me in life. My friends are gone with just about everything else I've ever cared for and loved all because of me and things I did. I just don't care about anything anymore and I don't know how to fix it. All of this has begun this year too and I don't know what to do.
