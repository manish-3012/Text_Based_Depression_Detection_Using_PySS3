I dont know why this is happening...I wish i knew why i feel like this. I have no motivation to do anything and i just feel deattached from my life.

I applied to medicine in UK (its also where my boyfriend is going) because my marks last year were good. But for some reason Im just crashing now and im failing everything including BMAT. I have lost all hope of getting into any of the unis and i see no chance of me going to study in UK because of how UCAS works. I never considered i might not get into medicine and i have no idea what ill do. I also fell like my relationship will end soon after we move to unis because long distance wont work. I know i can achieve high results but the amount of work is crushing me and my lack of motivation isnt helping. 

I just dont have the Energy to do anything and i have to force myself to even write this. I feel like everything i do is Just pointless and i could just lay down the whole day. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I just wish i were dead and tbh the option of ending my life never seemed more appealing to me.
