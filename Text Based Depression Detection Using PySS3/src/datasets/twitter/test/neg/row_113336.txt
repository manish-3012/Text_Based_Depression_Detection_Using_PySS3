Sailing towards the AbyssI am angry, very angry. It almost feels like I'm at a breaking point. My mum and sister - much less so with my sister - still don't get it. They still don't see why I am angry person. And the damned therapist failed to explain that to them in the family counseling session last week. My last therapist assured me that she would explain what trauma is, but this new one failed to do that.

So I am pretty mad about that. If they want to have the family together, then so be it. Have the stupid fucking family together, but without me. I fucking hate him with every fiber of my being and I will continue to wish death on him until the day I die - and if things keep going the way they are, hopefully this will be my last Christmas.

If I am going to continue to be miserable, then I am going to take care of it my way, and I don't give two flying fucks about who it hurts. I don't give a shit that suicide affects loved ones and society, because I say fuck loved ones and especially society; it's a fucking joke and it's crumbling apart anyways.

Keep it up and see what I do because you can be sure the outcome won't affect me in the slightest. My final request will be to have my ashes poured into the Thames from London's Tower Bridge, so the aftermath won't affect me.
