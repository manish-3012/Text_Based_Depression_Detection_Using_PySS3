Can you cover up your own suicide to prevent pain of loved ones?I can't deal with this pain anymore, but I don't want to hurt anyone. Is there anyway I can do it and it go unnoticed? Like maybe have someone act like me for a little while, or act like i died in a car accident? I don't wanna hurt anyone, i just can't deal with this pain anymore. The thoughts are screaming at me louder and louder everyday, it needs to stop.
