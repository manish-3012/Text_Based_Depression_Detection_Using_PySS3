I would like to be your friend.I am recently divorced and struggling to rebuild my life after many wasted years, broken dreams and bad decisions.  I guess I am trying to say that I know what it feels like to look ahead and see no future, no other options left. I have no family or friends to turn to and figure many on here may also feel alone and unloved.  I dont have much to offer but I am here for anyone that needs someone to be their friend.  I could really use a friend myself.
