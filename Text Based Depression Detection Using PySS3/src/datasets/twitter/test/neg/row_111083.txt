I'm lost please help meFor the past 6 months Iâ€™ve had thoughts of killing myself, sometimes stronger than others, but always there. I don't really know the reason they started, but I haven't been able to shake them ever since they did. I am in therapy and I have a friend who knows and has actually knowingly stopped me from attempting it on multiple occasions (9 if I remember correctly). Iâ€™ve tried to find reasons to live for months, but only for very short periods of time have I been able to convince myself. Iâ€™ve watched videos on reasons to live, read r/sw posts, read lists of reason, but none of this has convinced me for long.
I thought 3 times over the course of these 6 months that I had made into the clear, the most recent being about 3 weeks ago, but none of them lasted more than a week. I found myself back with the thoughts of suicide again. Almost every night I think about doing it before I go to sleep, and usually dream about doing it. The only thing keeping me alive anymore is that I know it would destroy my friend, whoâ€™s worked so hard to keep me alive, but sheâ€™s going off to college and I rarely speak with her anymore and she is a very busy person, so I never get to see her anymore, just text. I feel like Iâ€™m just a nuisance to her now.
I canâ€™t take all the responsibilities and whatâ€™s expected by my parents. All they want me to do is go to college and do what they want for a living, but Iâ€™ve always hated school and I have given up on high school entirely. My last quarter of this past years gpa was about a 1.0 down from my old gpa of around 3.5. I canâ€™t handle it anymore Iâ€™ve told them over and over itâ€™s not what I want to do, but they insist I have to do it. Iâ€™m also an atheist and my family is all Catholics and they donâ€™t understand how I could not believe in god.  
Iâ€™ve never been able to work hard at anything either. Most things come easy to me, but when something doesnâ€™t Iâ€™m very quick to give up no matter the consequences, like last year of school. All of my electronics/privileges were taken away until recently, which made things even worse.
Iâ€™ve searched so long for a reason to live, but I just think itâ€™s time for me to give up and take the easy way out like I always do.
