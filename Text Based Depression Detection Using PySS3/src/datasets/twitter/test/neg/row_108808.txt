Anybody else having problems being an adult?A good day is a day when I am not in pain. A day when I can actually fall asleep, and when my chest doesn't feel like it's going to compact in on itself.

Every month I get to experience misplaced trust, and in return I get a little more numb. It's already hard as it is to have any motivation for even bare essentials, and it keeps getting worse. 

Suicide doesn't feel like a spur of the moment thing, but a realistic calculated choice. My core problem is that I can't refuse others (because it physically hurts), that I am shit scared of starting conflicts, loathe feeling meaningless and that I absolutely detest when people grace against me.

Combine that with my current situation; 

* A wife that has conversational rules that only apply for me
* A job I've had for 2 years, and been trying to escape for 6 months, with:

    * Managers that don't see me
    * Co-workers that are quick to ask but never return the favor
    * Tasks that either mind numbingly mundane
    * A two hour, busy, commute
* An overpriced apartment in a shitty neighbourhood that I don't have the money nor the job to move away from
* Gender dysphoria or some shit, making me absolutely detest my receeding hairline and hairy arms
* That nobody understands why keeping this 40 hour routine is so exhausting that I just want to end myself.

I am writing this because it would feel so good if somebody understood. I am writing this hoping somebody managed to find a peaceful life after having problems with similar shit; because at the rate it has been going my life has been continually getting worse each year - not better.
