Please help meI've been sad and lonely and hopeless for over a year now

And all I've been hearing is that it gets better
But it just seems unlikely

Everything is going down

I've lost all friends and family

I've lost my grades

I've wasted so much time

I've wasted so much money

I've not improved in any way,shape or form

Why should I not just jump from my building

What should I tell my parents

I just wanna fucking die

I can't take it anymore
