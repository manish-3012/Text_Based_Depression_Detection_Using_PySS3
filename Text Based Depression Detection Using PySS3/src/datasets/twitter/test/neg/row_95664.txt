I am ready.I am ready. 

I was in the shower listening to Ich tu dir weh. Thinking about how I enjoy pain. And then, out of no where, Iâ€™ve decided. I am ready. 

I donâ€™t know how to do it. But I want to. Iâ€™m ready to stop hurting. I just donâ€™t want my family to find me. So Iâ€™m thinking of hiding out somewhere unknown to them and doing it.

I am mentally ill. I donâ€™t want to call 911. I donâ€™t want to call a hotline. I think I just want to die.

Iâ€™ve been in institutionalization a lot. I wonâ€™t go back. Those places are bad. They havenâ€™t helped me. 

I have PTSD, Bipolar type 1, OCD and borderline personality disorder.

I know I burden people and Iâ€™m think ready to cease being. 

My biggest fear is if I call 911 or something, they will ship me back to a shithole physciatric hospital and I donâ€™t want to go back. Iâ€™m 28 years old and been in them since I was 9. So I am done with old song and dance.

I think Iâ€™m too far gone. But I donâ€™t know.

Maybe someone can just talk to me.
