I feel weakEveryone keeps saying you have so many people that would be hurt if you died but what about me? I'm hurting now. So I should just sit here and deal with my pain to please everyone else?

Lately it seems like I don't have much to lose and somehow I'm still losing things. I hardly sleep. When I do I have nightmares which lead to panic attacks which make me afraid to go back to sleep.

I cant win. It's like if I tell people I want to die then I'm just looking for attention.
If I try to die and fail then I get the sympathy "we love you, don't go" talk, which leads to everyone ignoring anything ever happened and going right back to where I stated.
And if I succeed I'm a hero and everyone will talk about what a great person I was, right?

Cause that's how it goes. Now I'm just ranting. I feel myself breaking.
