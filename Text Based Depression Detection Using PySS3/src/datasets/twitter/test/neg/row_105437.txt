The point of therapy?I commit suicide 2 months ago. I have been in therapy and I donâ€™t understand it. Itâ€™s just talking to someone. We donâ€™t DO anything. She doesnâ€™t really give me things to do to get better. I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m even doing it. People say it helps them get better, but I donâ€™t get any help from it. Those that have had successful therapy sessions, what did you do? What made it good for you? Is it just talking to someone about how you feel? 

P.S. Iâ€™m also on meds that work somewhat, so maybe therapy is just what you do to stay on meds, idk.
