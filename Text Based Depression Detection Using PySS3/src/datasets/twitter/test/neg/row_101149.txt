HeyHi everyone, i'm sure that no one that knows me will ever see this and i'm still scare that someone could, so stupid. If i'm not killing myself tonight i'm gonna delete this ofc and maybe i will delete it before doing it too. 
I'm being depressed since i was 16-17 yo, and in the last 5-7 years everything got so bad that i didnt wanted to kill myself because i used to think that things could only get better. Well i was wrong, almost 2 years ago my anxiety got worst and i only got out of my house for work because i didnt want to see people, my excuse was that i was too busy between working and studying. Then 8 months ago my parents decided to divorce and my dad got depressed with suicidal thougts, i decided to quit my job to work with him and not leave him alone but he killed himself the day after i left my job. Then covid started and im now without a job and feeling so bad that i cant concentrate to study, i've spent my time playing games. I tried to find a job but nobody is hiring so i lived of my savings till there was anything left. My family gave me food for some time but i feel ashame to live like this. So i told to myself that when i run out of food i will end my life, and for the last days i've been eating almost nothing to buy some days untill yesterday that i run out of food. My last meal was 2 burguers, without anything just the meat lol. The timing is so weird because in 3 hs is my birhtday so idk, it feels like it's time. 
Sorry for the bad English and the long text, i know that people here take the time to read so thanks to all of you for letting me talk about this
