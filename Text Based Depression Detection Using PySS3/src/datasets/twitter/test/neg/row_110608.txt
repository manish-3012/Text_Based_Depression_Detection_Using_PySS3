Save Mother EarthWhen ever I see something super negative in this world my only thought is â€œFinally. A real reason to kill myself.â€ And I have to keep it inside because nobody wants to hear someone close to them say that. I have so much, but all I see is the destruction that us humans have created. Mother Earth needs a plague! A cleanse... I hope itâ€™s soon &amp; she kills me in the process.
