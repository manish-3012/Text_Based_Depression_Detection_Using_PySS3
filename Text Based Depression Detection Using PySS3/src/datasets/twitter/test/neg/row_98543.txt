Who do you talk to when you don't want to talk at all anymore?I've been sitting here staring at a blinking cursor for almost an hour because its hard to think of the right things to say.  I think I've reached my breaking point.  I'm 26 years old and have battled depression all my life.  My family moved around a lot and I went to 12 different schools all together so I have no home and no real friends, just acquaintances.

I remember the first time I wanted to stop living.  I was 8 years old.  My parents did nothing to try and help me.  Their idea of support was to yell at me until I stopped showing any emotion at all.

No one has any idea of what I've been going through all my life.  I'm so tired all the time.  All I do is sleep.

I don't know what to do.  Just typing these few sentences has been absolutely exhausting, the idea of talking to anyone seems impossible.  All I want is to go to sleep and never wake up again.
