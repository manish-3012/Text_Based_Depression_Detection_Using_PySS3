its finally gonna happen, hopefullyidk why but I've been really depressed for the past few days. and now, i can finally say i might kms soon. i know its gonna hurt those around me, but its what has to happen. i can't and don't want to live like this anymore. nothing makes me happy and i feel like I'm never gonna get back to a position of happiness. why can't i just be happy? oh i know, i don't deserve it. cuz I'm worthless, and i don't see the point of living anymore. what's the point? and the ppl around me will be better off too. my sister won't owe 2 grand anymore, my job will be forced to find an actual decent closer. and then, while writing this, i remembered that I'm financially responsible for my part of rent/bills for my house. my family can't cover that. so I'm trapped. I'm stuck until the lease is up then i can be free. then i can die
