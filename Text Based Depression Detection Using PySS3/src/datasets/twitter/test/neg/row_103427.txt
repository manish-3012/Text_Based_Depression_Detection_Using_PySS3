donePretty much done with school. And life. I've never had the best life. Lived with really terrible parents, have no friends or self-esteem, been depressed since I can remember, I'm just done. No one wants me, I'm not important to anyone. You can keep telling me that I am to someone but I know if I were to die nothing much would change, people would being pretend to sad because their image is more important. I kept thinking that maybe if I went to my doctor and asked for help they would, but no...they didn't. I'm done. I never had life. I'm not important to anyone nor will I ever be. I'll just be alone as always, I can't take the stress and toxicity of life anymore, because that's all it's ever been ..stressful and toxic. I'm done. No one can help me and no one will. So I don't know what I might do, all I know is that I'm just so tired of trying to survive each day, when the next is just as bad.
