It's All My FaultEverything was fine yesterday. I woke up next to him and then he got up to shower. I hadn't taken my meds in two days since staying with him. He missed the bus yesterday, and he asked his roommate to take him instead. That's when everything started. I had been staying the past week to get away from my home life. He's 9 years older than me and as a result, already has a place of his own. I was continuously told that it was fine I was there, I wasn't a burden. Then apparently on the way to the bus terminal, his roommate discussed with him how I needed to leave and how I couldn't be there so long. She was concerned about the utilities. I went home and received a text "we need to talk". I was already anxious from leaving, my father picked me up and I was very uncomfortable. I still hadn't had my meds so the bomb was there waiting to be lit. I asked him if he was leaving me, and he said no. I was still incredibly anxious because I've heard that before. Eventually, he told me what was going on and I flipped out. I have issues with boundaries and to me he was trying to tell me that I'd done something wrong. It was like my brain short circuited, and I ended up cutting myself, telling him and trying to get him to leave. I had asked his roommate to help him, but she put gasoline on the fire. She told me I was disrespectful, that I would leave my bf alone, that I needed help, and other things that I was in no mindset to here. By this point I was so unstable that I actually wanted to die. In my religion you go to hell if you commit suicide, but this felt so much worse than anything the devil could throw at me. Me and him talked until like 10 last night. I woke up this morning ready to be angry, only for him to tell me that he's leaving. I begged him to reevaluate, and he said he would. I'm due to talk to him in a week but giving "space" is a boundary in and of itself. I'm horrible at it, that's why everyone leaves me. I hate myself, I'm worse than my worst ex. What keeps running through my brain on a constant loop is "we were fine yesterday. He loved me yesterday. He said he wanted to help me." I can't believe I've fallen so far so quickly, and I'm sleeping most of the time to keep what feels like insanity away. He was my only friend, and now I have no support. I lost my best friend and my boyfriend in one go. I told him I wouldn't hurt myself, but honestly, if he turns out like everyone else, I really have no reason to exist anymore. I love him so much, he's been there when no one else was and I broke everything. I don't know what to do anymore.
