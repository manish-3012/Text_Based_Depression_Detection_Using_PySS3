I've tried everything, life will be much better on the other side.I don't feel like keeping you here with a long wall of text but, I don't want to live anymore.

I can never ever seem to experience true happiness, and even when I think I have it, it gets swept away from me no matter how hard I try.

I'm tired of trying, things never change.

And if I don't die now, then atleast I can escape from reality once VR devices hit for desktop, I have my Google Cardboard to keep me company for now.

It was nice knowing all of you, please don't end up like me.
