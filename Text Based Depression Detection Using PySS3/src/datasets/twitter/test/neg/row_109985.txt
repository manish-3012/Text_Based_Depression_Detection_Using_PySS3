What are we supposed to do when there really isn't any help...or any help that is enough?I have been depressed for so long...after surgeries went bad and ruined my life and career.  I had periods after where I sort of adjusted to my lower level of living and met a woman who suposedly loved me and I tried to live..but when more surgery made me worse she left and I went down again...then I tried to survive with a family member...then alone in another country where it is cheaper...I have done therapy and meds and none of it ever helped...mostly made it worse.   I tried for disability...was denied over and over and thats no longer an option.  I thought I could survive somehow in this country where I had lived before...but nothing is working...my immigration plans have fallen through repeatedly.  My health gets worse and I either cannot afford treatments or they don't help.

I am not sure why I should have to stay here suffering.  Everyone says "you have to fight".  I have never heard a good reason WHY.  "It can get better"...but in all liklihood given my medical problems which are the root of my depression...it won't.  Odds are better to win the lotto.  

All I have done for years is BUY life...pay rent and food...but the money is nearly gone and I am not taking in enough.  I thought I could earn some extra but its not working.  Everything is shit...everyone I ask for help says they "can't".

I have done the things you are supposed to do over and over and it always costs me and doesn't help.  What the fuck am I supposed to do?
