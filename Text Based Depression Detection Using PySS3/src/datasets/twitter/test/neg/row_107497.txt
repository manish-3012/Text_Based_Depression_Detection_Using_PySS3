Cant make the thoughts go away.Last night I got extremely drunk and high to try and stop thinking about all my fuck ups. To just stop myself from thinking about killing myself. But I kept murmuring and slurring his name and remembered how happy he is without me. My life is in shambles and I want to die and I never really realized how badly I hate my entire existence until last night.
