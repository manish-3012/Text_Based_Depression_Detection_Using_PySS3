For the people who are interestedHi.

Whenever I put my mind to execute suicide, my mind gets distracted by other thoughts, and I find myself in half an hour thinking about something different. Then again, I focus , I get distracted. I suspect my mind is trying to keep me away from the idea, perhaps there is a built-in defense mechanism. 

Question for ppl who have extensive info on this topic is: How do I bypass this mechanism; How to get to execute? How to get to work on it? (any info, links, Tips and Tricks are welcome, no matter the degree of relevancy).

Notes :

1. I am **not** here for you to change my mind, so no bs/timewasters please, although you can amuse me with your attempts.

2. Why am I posting this on suicidewatch then? Because although the majority of you seek to offer social support, I hope there are some among you who can support the peoples choice of right to die. 

3. I can chat on an onion website, if you are concerned about anonymity.

4. For everyone here: I thank you for volunteering to pursue the noble virtue of helping the people in need. 

TL;DR: Want to execute suicide, I don't want you to bs me, but I need you to help me on how to succeed
