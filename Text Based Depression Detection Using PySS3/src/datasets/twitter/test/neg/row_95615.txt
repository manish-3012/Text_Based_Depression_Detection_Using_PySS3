you know whati thought I was better but here I am a 5th of liquor down and a bottle of nyquil to soon follow.  I hate myself, I hate my life, I hate that I have texted three people and no one cares enough.  I hate that in the end I turn to this web site to give my last words.  I hate that random people around the world care more then those I love.  I hate that no matter how hard I have tried I dont feel better.  I hate that those who can see it dont think anything of it because I am stronger than that.  I hate that people cant see what is right in front of them.  I hate that I hate myself for what I am about to do, but soon enough I wont care, I guess it sucks for those left behind ...but in the end maybe you should have noticed that outstretched hand reaching for help-
