Iâ€™m envious of anyone with friends and itâ€™s killing meI was brought up by a narcissist that never let me socialise outside of school/ forced volunteering (had to volunteer to make them look good and to keep me â€œout of troubleâ€ as â€œteens are nothing but law breaking/drug addictsâ€). I never did anything bad not even talked back when they talked shit about me). Wasnâ€™t till almost end of my teens I knew this was wrong. 

Sadly I doubt I can ever regain what they took away in many ways. One really frustrating way is that I only have one or two friends. Both live far away and have fairly different interests then me. I have tried so hard to make friends but I donâ€™t understand social cues and people just think Iâ€™m a freak because Iâ€™m anxious and weird in social settings. Doesnâ€™t help Iâ€™m out of education now and life kinda removes the option to make friends like children have. 

I live with my boyfriend and his family. His family are amazing and love me for who I am but itâ€™s not the same. Hope people understand what Iâ€™m trying to say. Iâ€™m so fucking envious he can play games with so many people and has so many good connections. Itâ€™s not fair he can game and talk to so many. I barely talk to one friend let alone see them. Just want people I can  be friends with, not work colleagues to talk about work (if I worked). Feel so isolated itâ€™s maddening as half the time best I get is talking to the voices in my head but even they get bored of me. But letâ€™s be honest the voices do hate me and thatâ€™s no secret. I donâ€™t blame them, Iâ€™m such a horrible excuse of a person, sorry mean waste of space. 

Have talked to my boyfriend but they say they are helpless and canâ€™t do anything. I donâ€™t blame them. Canâ€™t force people to like a freak show.
