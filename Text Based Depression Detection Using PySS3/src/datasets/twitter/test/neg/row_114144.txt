iâ€™m sick of everything at this point and wish i could just die in any wayi just want everything to stop and i wish i could get into some kind of accident that could kill me so i wonâ€™t have to go through this. it doesnâ€™t help that i always hurt people too. i donâ€™t mean it, it just happens. iâ€™ve tried suicide hotlines multiple times and they donâ€™t help. iâ€™m 18 and unemployed and my parents wonâ€™t let me get a job until covid vaccines come out and i feel so behind because all of my other friends either have a job, are in college, or both. iâ€™ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts off and on in my life since late middle school and now iâ€™m out of school and still going through hell. the last time i tried to i was going to sneak out my window and harm myself but i couldnâ€™t get my screen open so i just ended up crying myself to sleep. iâ€™m not out as trans to my parents yet and iâ€™m not sure when iâ€™ll be able to and that really digs at me too. itâ€™s getting to the point where iâ€™m making more and more plans on what to do and how to do it. i purposely stay up late since thatâ€™s when i have time to be alone and sleep late so i have less of the day to go through. iâ€™ve thought about doing drugs so i can have something numb the pain. i just want everything to end for me.
