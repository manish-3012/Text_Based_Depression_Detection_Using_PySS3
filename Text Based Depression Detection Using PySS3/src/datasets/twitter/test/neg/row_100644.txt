Teenager with one reason to live but itâ€™s not enoughThanks for anyone taking the time to read this. Iâ€™m 16, and I live with both parents and two younger sisters, and we have two dogs, two guinea pigs, a cat, and a fish. Iâ€™ve been suicidal/depressed for 5 years now (started in 5th grade and Iâ€™m in 10th) and I attempted suicide with pills April 21, 2015 which left me in the hospital for a week. I have major depression, anxiety, and PTSD (the hospital really fucked me up and when I talked to my therapist about the type of things I went through there she looked like she was going to cry). Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist since September and sheâ€™s helped me as much as she can, but itâ€™s just not enough. The only reason I have to live is my dog Igni I got back in December. I quit band at the beginning of January because of treatment from the directors and Iâ€™ve realized I really do nothing with my life. Iâ€™m not in any after-school/extra-curricular groups like I was last year, and itâ€™s too late in the school year to join any now. I have five close friends and three of them were from band, so I donâ€™t talk to them half as much anymore. Iâ€™m in the top 10% of my class but Iâ€™ve been missing a lot of school lately by pretending to be sick because itâ€™s just not worth the effort anymore. Iâ€™m starting to fall behind on my work and my good grades are held up by a thin piece of string right now. My family causes me so much stress from constantly fighting with each other and me, and my half-sister who lives overseas used to play PS4 with me every weekend but now she doesnâ€™t talk to me but once a month and takes weeks to respond to my messages. So I donâ€™t do anything with my life, I cost my parents money and time, and I have no one I interact with on a daily basis besides my dog (my family all avoid each other even though weâ€™re under the same roof). So Iâ€™m finally giving up. Thereâ€™s a train that goes past the back of my high school several times a day so Iâ€™ll probably write a letter and leave it somewhere itâ€™ll be found after Iâ€™m gone, go to school like a normal day, and tell my parents I have to retake a test after school so I can wait on the tracks. I know itâ€™ll work because a friend of mine was killed on the same tracks almost a year ago. His was an accident, though. Iâ€™ve been thinking of hanging myself but my fat ass would probably snap the rope so this is all Iâ€™ve got. I wanted to go to medical school but whatâ€™s the point anymore? Do schoolwork so I can go to work to pay for a place Iâ€™ll live in until I retire and die. Iâ€™ve talked to my friends about it and simply saying â€œDonâ€™t do itâ€ or having them text my mom isnâ€™t helping. So Iâ€™ll be going soon. Iâ€™ve been setting up a playlist to listen to while I wait on the tracks to keep me calm and horded enough of my Xanax to make me even calmer. Thanks for reading. 

Edit: Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m gonna do it on Wednesday. I was going to do it tomorrow, but my grandma wants me to come with her to the shelter and help her get a dog. I might go to the band concert to see some of my friends one last time. 

Edit 2: Iâ€™m going to keep fighting for now. Iâ€™m going to take the advice to set later dates and see if things improve by then. I talked to my mom about how I was feeling and she apologized and said we should do more stuff as a family and things have been stressful lately so sheâ€™s sorry for yelling so much (she yelled at me last night for vacuuming when she asked me to because she was on the phone) and said on Saturday weâ€™re going to have a family day out and sheâ€™ll make sure thereâ€™s no fighting. Thank you to everyone who talked me down.
