My mental health is worse than what I'm letting people on toSo I'm the kind of person who's afraid to open up about my mental health or when I'm going through stuff. My boyfriend and some friends know that im having anxiety, depression and isolation issues during the covid 19 shut down. But they dont that my suicidal thoughts have gotten much worse and that I've developed a plan awhile back. But I cant bring myself to commit suicide, I know my boyfriend would be devastated and the thought of my parents discovering my body fills me with despair and dread. I'm so tortured by these thoughts though, so I thought come and vent here.
