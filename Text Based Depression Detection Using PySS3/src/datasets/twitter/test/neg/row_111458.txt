18/5I'm filled with rage and darkness. My soul has lost all of its light and hope. I was a sweet girl once, but too sensitive for the world from the start. I wasn't wanted by anyone. A burden to my mother who would say she sacrificed so much for us children so many times I lost count. A father who cared only for his beliefs so what I felt didn't matter and who I was wasn't wanted. But according to their religion I chose them before I was born. My teen years were filled with severe pain from my endometriosis and craziness from PMDD. My 20s were spent trying to find love but really showed me all I was good for is sex. By 30 I have failed everything I ever started and my yearning arrow had fallen to pierce my heart. I thought I had someone who loved me but again he showed me that was an illusion. The chance of me finding my path is so insubstantial as to be nonexistent. I am falling. I am fading. I have lost it all.
