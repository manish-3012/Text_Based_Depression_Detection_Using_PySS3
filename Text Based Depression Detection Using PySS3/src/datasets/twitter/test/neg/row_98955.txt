How could you convince someone that they are beautiful when they hate themselves??I'm very worried about my girlfriend. She has been going through a major depressive fit, and while she's had these moments before, this is just becoming a stressful trend. The stresses she experiences in trying to push through school and having a bad job are contributing factors, but those are not what I'm worried about. 

I do my very best to make sure that she is taken care of, and most importantly that she is happy. Unfortunately, keeping her happy can be like a chore sometimes. She has had her heart broken so many times by inconsiderate scumbags, and I'm truly lucky that she even had enough trust to let me into her life and get to know what an amazing and beautiful person she is. I love her with all my heart, but she hates herself; the kind of loathing that you would have for an arch nemesis, but that enemy is herself.

She does have her moments of confidence, but that is few and far between. Sometimes she gets so bad that she becomes unresponsive to anything I have to tell her. I've tried everything a regular person such as myself knows how to do. She doesn't respond the same way to advice that I do. I like to talk things through, reason, and rationalize problems to have a better understanding of how to resolve them. She's very emotional and empathetic, and just wants to be held when she's upset. That works for a little bit, but solves nothing. 

How could you convince someone that they are beautiful when they hate themselves??

Maybe I'm missing something here. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice for this??

Anything is appreciated, really.
