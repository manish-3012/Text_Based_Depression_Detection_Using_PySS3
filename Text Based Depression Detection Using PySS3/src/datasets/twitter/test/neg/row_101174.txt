What is wrong with this picture??Not even using an alt for this.

First. My love to all of you out there. I am in a bad place, but I see that so many of us are.

Im 27 male. Ive been diagnosed with a slew of things over the years. Chronic pain since age 15. Divorced parents, seen over a dozen psychs since then and countless doctors.
At ages 12, 16, 17, 19 I tried committing suicide.

I am on medicine that has "helped". But I contemplate suicide daily. Hourly.
Depressed, lonely, dejected. Tired! So tired.
Tired of talking it out, tired of explaining myself, rationalizing, trying to make people understand.

Tired of waiting for someone, anyone to see the pain I'm in and offer help...

Here's the thing. I just found this sub. I am absolutely dumbfounded by the number of posts on here that resemble parts of what I just wrote.

My friends and family can't understand what I'm feeling. But reading 10 posts and I feel like all of us are kindred spirits.

What is wrong here?
I have and still do feel ashamed of my thoughts. I have to explain away my bpd. We all hide this away behind masks. Telling people, oh I'm great, thanks for asking. How are you?

We're wrong for being so selfish to even consider suicide.
Screw that!
Anyone that says suicide is selfish is fundamentally wrong. Suicide isn't about that. Suicide is about pain. And hurting so much that there is no way out.

So why are you here? What is wrong that we feel like we need to hide behind anonymity, and vent our problems, our cries for help to strangers?

There are commercials about suicide prevention. I have sat and watched them with loved ones, and all are totally oblivious that I'm thinking about shooting myself right that very second.

There are groups, and call centers (I've had bad luck with those) but... Have they helped you?

There is something so wrong here. What needs to change? What do we need? What needs to happen?

I will pledge myself right now. What do we need to implement change? What is wrong with what is being done currently?
