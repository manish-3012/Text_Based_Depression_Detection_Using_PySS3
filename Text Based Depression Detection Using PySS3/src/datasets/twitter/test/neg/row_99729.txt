Why would i continue if i dont want to?There is nothing left for me. I have live my life and I donâ€™t think there is something left for me. The only reason i am not giving up is my daughter. I know she will hate me if i go. Her mom will take care of her but I know she will have a hard time. Is it selfish of me to want to let go of them if i have nothing left and it hurts to just breathe and stay? I know they will never understand why i am this way and i dont want them to.  Because if they do, i am afraid that the will fell the same.
