I don't know anymoreIs there even anything you can do to help yourself. Talking with someone is extremelly hard to do beacuse I don't have anyone I could talk to and I have severe trust issues. I can't put it into words how painful every hour of my life is. I can feel myself becoming braindead. I don't have any hobbies or any way of coping. It's becoming harder to act normal around people. I know this is just me being a bitch but I truly believe I have more problems than anyone else. I'm the most unlucky person alive, it's not possible that anything up to now could have gone worse than it has. From even before I was born till now, it's always been the worst case scenario when it's something concerning me. I'm not living at the moment, I'm just being alive beacuse of the fear of pain that comes with suicide if you're not using a practical method. I've been dreaming of the moment I can take my life along with all of the shit I had to and still am dealing with. I've given up on trying to find something worth living for. I've been thinking about it a lot the last couple of years and the way I see it is you should only live if you want to live, if you find something that you percieve as being worth all the trouble that comes with just being alive. People that tell you to live and then fuck off are the most selfish people in the world. Apparently it's selfish to put yourself out of your missery when you have no escape but it isn't selfish to force someone to struggle every day so you can feel good about yourself. I not only don't have a single reason to live but I have more reasons to die than I can count. I've probably said it before but it's unbearable. It's just a question of time before the urge to kill myself surpasses my fear of pain and I can't see it changing.
