I don't know what to do. Cutting or pills are the only way out.Everything's gone downhill faster and faster. I'm failing highschool, I'm having more sleepless nights, and when I do get to sleep, more nightmares. I've been seeing things, hearing things.  My relationship with my parents has fallen to almost no interaction at all, and I'm not sure they would put me through college, if I even got that far.

It's starting to get hard to hang around my friends. My ears ring nonstop. My head is always pounding, my eyes hurt to no end, and despite that, I need to keep a cool composure, else someone will try to interfere with my being alone.

I want to be alone, in a dark place, in a comfortable chair.  I want my music.  I want my blades, I want my pills, because as comforting as alone can be, I still have to leave that to waste my time failing school.

I don't know if I can keep my head above the water. I don't think I can. 

I'm scared of living.  I'm hurting to high hell.  Death and demons haunt me and my thoughts.

Here's to hoping there's something good beyond us.

Here's to hoping I don't have to live too much longer.
