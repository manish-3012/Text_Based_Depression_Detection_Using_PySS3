Why i'm going to end it, and why it worth itI have a computer and backpack.  some clothes like 3 pants and some shirts.  I won't get a job because i feel locked up inside.  Ive been to many 72 hour holds and now im 26, living in westminster, MD with less than 2 friends.
In two days i will have no place to live. 
I cant and havent got up from this.  I'm so sure it wont get better.
I dont have to worry about what my familly will think because my Mom and i have a bad relationship (dont talk to her side at all too) and my Dad is sort of "tired" in that one way like myself a little.  
I'm not going to live in a tent and i'm not getting better.
The hospital does nothing, i dont have a social security card so no follow up available.  
I'm writing this so people understand why real people go forward past that "biological safety".  Because of fear of torture.

Stuff i've done im happy about.
Been honest alot of the time
Helped anyone i could, i hate like so little.
vegetarian since i was 16.
911 was bombs and missles.
anarchist because i reserve the right to choose and recognise the need for a culture of awareness and action.
