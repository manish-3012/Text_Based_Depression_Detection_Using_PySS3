I just need to talk to someoneIve had these thoughts for three years now and as my 21st is approaching I get more terrified. I could get a gun and go out the way i decided would be best.... Instant. I have no one to talk to and no insurance of any sort to talk to someone I wouldnt frighten with my thoughts. Ive always lingered on this subreddit never having the feeling that I should post my pathetic problems on here compared to the many that need help....... But i just cant talk to myself about this anymore, it just hurts too much to. Please someone just talk to me.
