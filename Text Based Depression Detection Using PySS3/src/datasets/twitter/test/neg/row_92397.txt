The stress of my own life has led me to be scared to wake up every dayMy entire life Iâ€™ve head expectations, Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice, there are many reasons to live and many to not. My life has been a roller coaster and Iâ€™ve met the girl of my dreams but I can no longer feel anything. Iâ€™ve been juggling with this ideology for months and I now have come to the point in which Iâ€™m lost, numb, and have no more tears to cry.
