What is your definition of a failure in life?Have you ever felt like you've not quite hit rock bottom yet, but it's only going to go downhill for you from this point on?

I am 18, and have always struggled with depression, but for the past 7 months or so, I seemed to have cured myself. I found ambitions, friends, a girlfriend.

But in just one month time, everything came crashing down. I got rejected for university 3 times, I lost 1000 euro's investing in something extremely stupid, 6 of my friends (which is all of them) told me that they didn't want to be friends with me anymore (for no obvious reason at all), and the absolute love of my life has left me for someone else. To top it all off, I tried committing suicide, but just woke up with a massive headache. 

The girl breaking up with me has given me actual PTSD and random anxiety attacks that have lasted for over 4 weeks now, and cause me to wake up between 4 and 5 am every morning. Never before had I experienced any of these symptoms.

I am the biggest failure around, I wake up every morning hoping I will have enough balls to properly kill myself. Reading all this definitely gives me more courage to actually do it.
