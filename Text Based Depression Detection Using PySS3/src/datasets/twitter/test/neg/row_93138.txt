Being killed wouldn't be so badif someone killed me they'd ironically doing me a favor by freeing me from this cruel world. In harsh reality i don't have any friends let alone a girlfriend since valentine's day is around the corner so this gives me a good opportunity to plan my suicide and i have my doubt that anyone would miss me and i don't want a funeral because no one would care to remember me personally.
