In bed all day for Thanksgiving. Nobody understands.Nobody understands why I'm spending all day in bed. I do nothing. I don't eat. I don't sleep. I don't text people asking for attention. I do nothing. My parents ignore it. My brother tells me to get over it and take my estrogen shots. I have no appetite. My vision is cloudy. My mind is cloudier. 

I feel like I'm going to die soon. Either by my hand, or in the form of something that's killing me right now.

Everything is amiss. My throat has swelled up making it hard to breathe. Things are confusing. I literally feel like I've gone out into the third person, and I'm just watching myself lay stoically in the bed. The bed. I've been in the bed for more time that exists. It's the only thing I know.

I'm not happy obviously, but I'm not sad either. I'm empty. I'm not myself but someone entirely different. A worthless person without a soul, without a guideline, or a purpose, or enough health to take a simple walk down the street. 

I'm nobody, and this message means nothing. It's nobodies responsibility to take care of me. The little self worth I have, the minuscule amount, invokes one emotion into me: anger. I feel angry that people can't fathom or don't believe in my insomnia, major depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts. Yet it's not something I'd wish on even my worst enemy.
