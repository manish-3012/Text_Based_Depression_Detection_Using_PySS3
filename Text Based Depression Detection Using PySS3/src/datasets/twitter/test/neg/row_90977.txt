I've talked about suicidal ideation with my ex and it ruined meYou know I had such a terrible childhood. Parents died young. Dad abused me. It took so much from me. I made so many mistakes because of that and I really hate how much I've wasted my life due to recovering from trauma. Not having loving parents to support you. I always felt so alone in the world. At 28 I'm finally over it, but I made a huge mistake in the process: I ruined my health by smoking way too much weed and cigs on a poor diet. 

I had an ex who was 8 years older. She was like a second mom to me. But... In hindsight I think she was a kind of manipulative person. She invested a ton of love into me, bought gifts, made me feel so loved, when I told her about my parents she suddenly had this very fake cry and I think she thought 'I can use this to get this guy to never leave me', she also started a relationship with me after one evening together and went into it head first, never gave me a chance to back out. But... When it was time to 'pay up', I didn't deliver. I realised I wasn't the one for her and ended things. After that she went from sweet to cold. She gave me one last chance to meet up last summer (2019), but after I didn't do that she gave up on me. I'm dumb and didn't understand that she really hates me now. 

About one year later I was feeling extremely down and suicidal. I wrote extremely negative texts to her about how I'm done with life and she was like 'get a life' and blocked me. I then felt like I had to explain myself and made a new account. It takes like 3 seconds on instagram. It's something I did without thinking of the consequences. I was trying so hard to get her sympathy and make me understand me, I was being very vulnerable and admitting how I fucked up everything, but she didn't have any compassion and kept engaging with long messages and then blocking me. She'd also tell me to stop contacting, but I wanted to reply to all the things she wrote and I didn't want her to leave forever so I naively kept going. The dumbest thing I did is when she said 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' and I started arguing about that because I've changed a lot, went from an extremely unhealthy guy to someone who works out 12 hours per week and eats the best food, graduated, works 50 hours per week and so on. In the end she exploded with the harshest message possible. For example she wrote 'you'll never learn how to live your life' and called me a loser, a tragic whiner and said she didn't care if I died. She also told me she would never reply again.

That made me feel even more suicidal. It made me feel like 'you're a loser, you will always stay a loser, you will never amount to anything, you're so far below me, such an inferior piece of shit and you should just get rid of your miserable existence'. I kept messaging her for months begging to talk it out and to explain myself, but she never replied and that only made me feel even more pathetic. So now I'm completely ruined and feel like such a pathetic mess of  a person... I really struggle to make a comeback from this.
