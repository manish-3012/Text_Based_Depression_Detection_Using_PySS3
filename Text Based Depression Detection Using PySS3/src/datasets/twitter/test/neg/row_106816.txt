born to losejust got used again and fell in love again and got my heart broken again and he chipped my lower back bone now i have medical bills and he still doesnâ€™t love me. he never will, just like no one ever has, my family, nobody. worthless as always and just when i thought i was getting better and my self esteem was improving haha. starving myself and playing it off as fasting then i will go into the woods and let nature take its course. Itâ€™s been cool humans but i canâ€™t do shit to help anyone all i do is get used and mess things up for people gtg love yall
