Ever feel like you are just slightly out of tune with the universe?I am 24 and just graduated college, and for the past couple of months have been depressed to the point of just wanting to be gone. I feel selfish because my life is not bad, at least on the outside, but I feel like I am just operating at a different frequency than the rest of the universe sometimes, like something is just a little off but the results are much bigger. I am one two different anxiety medications, but still sometimes just lay in bed all day wishing things were different. 

I feel like I spent the last six years in college and an have only gotten less happy as a result. I love coming home on my birthday and getting fussed at by my dad for not having a job lined up, even though I am still working at my college job with near full time hours. I don't want to leave my college town where I have built up a family only to flounder about for a year while I figure what to do next.

My love life is one constant disaster. I have had one real girlfriend who i broke up with due to the stress of long distance and school turning me into somebody I hated. Besides that its been one unrequited love after the other.
 
I'm in love with a friend who I used to work with but feel like I cant express how much it hurts to anybody else cause she is seven years younger than me, which makes me feel like a monster on top of it all. 

I feel selfish for feeling this way. I have a great family who has supported me. I am a graduate from a good school with a high GPA. Honestly the fact that on the outside my life seems great only makes it worse. I don't know what I want, but often times just wish I could sleep forever. The only reason I dont want to kill my self is cause of the pain I know it will cause my parents, but that doesn't mean I don't wish dead.
