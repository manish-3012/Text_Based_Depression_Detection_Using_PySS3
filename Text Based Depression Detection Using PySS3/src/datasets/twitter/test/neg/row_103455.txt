Wasted my life. I really want a second chance but it's so hard due to me never learning literally anything.Ok so pretty much I realised at the age of 20 that I only have one fucking life. I pretty much had a mental breakdown and have been going batshit insane these past 2 months. I am so suicidal and I don't want to die but I see no way of this getting better. I am not joking when I say all I did was play video games and watch TV. Never did any homework or even studied (which I regret so much to this day) I also had severe social anxiety which caused me to never talk. Due to this, I have no fucking ability to speak to anyone whatsoever because I am boring as shit. On top of all this, I never was forced to do chores around the house and I am such a picky eater so I never got proper nutrition. I am realising this at age 20 and I wanna just want to fucking rewind time so badly but I know it's not possible. I wanted to do so much more in life but my anxiety was so bad it would leave me so mentally drained and my video game addiction pretty much ruined my chances of making friends or fitting in. Fuck man I just want some miracle to happen even though I know it's not going to. I just want to be happy with life, something I truly never felt. I finally told my parents about all this and they had no fucking idea the entire time. I am so pissed at myself for waiting so long to tell them because they would of helped me so much. Fuck guys please live your life to the fullest. I cry everyday because I can't believe I only have one life and wasted such a huge part of it. My brain developed so poorly I feel like a vegetable. What I would do just for a second chance.  Don't ask why I never did anything to fix my situation. I was so depressed without realising it. I just thought depression was something emo kids had.
