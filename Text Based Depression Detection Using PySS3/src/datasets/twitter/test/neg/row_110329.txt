wellThis isn't the first time I've wanted to end things. Probably more like the hundredth. The only thing keeping me away from it was my (now ex) girlfriend. And that ended because of my faults I made. I don't really have friends, just people who will talk to me/hang out with me when they need something. I have someone to talk to but he lives 2000 miles away.
 The main problem is the ex. She's dropped me like I'm nothing. I have terrible anxiety and find my myself trying to contact her a ridiculous amount in a single day, checking her social network stuff every few minutes, and just thinking about her. I have nothing to get my mind off of her and even when I try to do something to get my mine off of her I'll sit there and think "I'm just doing this to get my mind off of you". It'd be a whole lot better if I at least have friends to go hang out with or something. I tried to find some today but not a single person answered my texts or phone calls. 
I had terrible depression about two years ago and this is exactly how I spiraled in to it last time and I refuse to go back down. And things have only been getting worse. I have more than enough pills to do this trick. Plenty of alcohol to add to the equation also. 
I'm 16 btw
