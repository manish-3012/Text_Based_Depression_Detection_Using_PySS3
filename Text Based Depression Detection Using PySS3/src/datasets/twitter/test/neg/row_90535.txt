I can't do it anymoreFailing test after test. Watching classes I try to do well in and study just to end with Fs. Haven't made a single friend yet and have not a single person in real life who I can call a friend. I spend most days silent from class to work with just the constant thoughts of how much I've failed with me. I just can't do it anymore
