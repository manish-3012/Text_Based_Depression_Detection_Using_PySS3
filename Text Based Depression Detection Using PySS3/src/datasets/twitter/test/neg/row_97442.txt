Alcoholism isn't that bad...At least when compared to the alternatives. I wanted to off myself with a rope, knife, poison, drugs... but then with my whiskey bottle everything is a blur. Barely concious of what's happening, it's like being dead! It's wonderful!

Nobody cares too. 'Cause you see... if you want to off yourself everybody will try to force you to live with a fervor of a fascist on heroin. Some with arguments that never even make any sense, but make you seem like such a good little scout when spoken out loud.

But when you start drinking... nobody cares! You'll just be a "useless slob that's a waste of space". You can burn your brain till you don't think of anything else than the booze, all worries go away along with the moralistic snakes that claim to want good but just want to pretend they are good people with colorful words, empty arhguments and hollow gilded morality.

So yeah, to all you suicidal people. Grab some whiskey and make the brain numb! You will get self-righteous people trying to force you to live off your back. You might be hated by family, friends, etc... but if you never had any then you don't lose anything anyway. You will be alive, satisfying the moralistic mob, and the brain will be numb enough to be almost dead. Best of two worldS!

I can findally be left alone. Death by a nother name. You don't have to satisfy the hypocritical species you fucking HATE anb DESPISE at this point. Everything gone, and I'm at pease.

CHeers! ðŸ¥ƒ
