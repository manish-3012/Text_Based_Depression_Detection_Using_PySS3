Suicidal and BrokenI've not really spoken about this to normal people before. I'm writing from my tablet after my computer finally broke. I don't have money to replace it or fix it, in fact, i don't have money for anything. I'm feeling very hopeless and lost in my life, and honestly very suicidal again. I've attempted five times, from the age of nine and up. I've been depressed and anxious for 11 years, later developing ocd and schizophrenia along with a psychotic disorder that i don't fully understand. I've seen three therapists but they didn't really help and doctors don't know what to do with me. I'm mostly living out of habit and not will these days and I feel i have no one to turn to anymore, people grow sick of listening so i just stop speaking. I feel as though life isn't worth living anymore, after my legs and back deteriorated and left me unable to function properly. Is there any hope in any of this? I'm heading to the grave one way or another and I really wish I could minimise the pain that leads me there. I've lost all those i once loved to suicide, it seems linked to my life. Someone please help me, this is a desperate and broken message from a guy on the edge. I need something. Please.
