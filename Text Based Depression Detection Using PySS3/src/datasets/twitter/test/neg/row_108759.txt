I Don't Feel Like I'm Living For Myself...In the last few months I have been in and out of hospitals trying to get help. But it was a waste of time and made things worse.

I don't have anything going for me. The people who love me will move on after a few months, and I hope they will be relieved as I will be that I will be gone.

There is a bridge that I want to go to that has more than an eight story drop into a frozen marsh. By the time anyone notices I will be long gone.
