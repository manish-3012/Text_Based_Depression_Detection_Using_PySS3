Feeling like there is no other optionI can't get over the things that have happened. I feel like something has snapped inside and I'll never be happy. I don't want to go on for the rest if my life like this.


For a while I was trying to get better. But things are never going to be how I want them to be. I have a thousand miserable memories I can never be free of. I just want it to be over.
