Can someone help me please. Ive been harming myself for years and i really want to stop.I don't and never will cut myself but when I feel depressed or have anxiety I do several things to cause sharp pain to myself. As far as I can tell it feels like I'm addicted to the endorphins being released. Once I start doing it it can be impossible to stop and can last days or even weeks. The main thing I do now is squeeze my nose is a way that the skin inside gets pinched and causes a very sharp pain that gives me a huge release. It feels amazing and calms me. Other things I do is drive my nails into the side if my finger punching my skin between the nail on my other finger. Similar release there. I really want it to stop. Thanks in advance for any advice.
