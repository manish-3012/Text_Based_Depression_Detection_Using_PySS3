I want the pain to end...I looked in my counselors eyes and promised I wouldnâ€™t go home and kill myself, but here I am trying to decide how many pills I need to take. Iâ€™ve been feeling so suicidal to the point I canâ€™t even breathe. Thereâ€™s so much emotional pain that I feel as though thereâ€™s nothing I can do. This feels like the only option. This pain will never stop. Iâ€™ll never be able to smile again. I probably wonâ€™t have the balls to do it. Iâ€™ll sob until I tire myself out. And Iâ€™ll just continue this meaningless life waiting until Iâ€™m in a fatal car accident or Iâ€™m diagnosed with some terminal illness. Hereâ€™s to hating myself the rest of my hopefully short stupid life.
