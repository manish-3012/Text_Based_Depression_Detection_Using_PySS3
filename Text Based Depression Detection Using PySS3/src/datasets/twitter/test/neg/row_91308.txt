I'm not sure how long I can go on like this. I need help.I'm 16. I have a great life with loving friends and family. From the outside I would look like a normal happy teen. But my mental health is fucked. It's getting exponentially worse as every day passes. Nothing is interesting to me anymore. I try to have fun and be happy but I just fucking can't anymore. Everything has faded to gray. I've started to hurt myself and that just makes me feel shame and guilt, but I constantly think about it and it's hard not to. Before recently I was hesitant to say I was suicidal, but not anymore. It is the vast majority of what I think about now. My grades are failing because I can't think and have lost all motivation. I just sit and stare at the wall for hours sometimes because the thought of getting up or even going on my phone seems like a massive effort. They're also going down because why should I even bother if I probably won't even be around by this time next year. I just can't take it anymore. I don't want to hurt my family, but the pain is becoming too much. I find it so hard to imagine living to 80 or even 17. I've set a deadline. If I'm not dead or better by Christmas night I'm going to call the suicide hotline and see if they can help me before I try to off myself. I'm sorry if I started to ramble. I just don't know what to do anymore. Please help.
