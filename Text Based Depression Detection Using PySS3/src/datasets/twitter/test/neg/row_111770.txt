Dying from lack of sleepIm kinda scared to jump off and all, ive seen people play games non-stop and die but ive not seen anyone commit suicide like that, im just thinking maybe if I want to start, I can do what I like by playing games, just do it for a few days without sleep and I might just be gone one day, no one would know its a suicide so its like I didnt know playing too much games would kill me, people wont feel as sad.
