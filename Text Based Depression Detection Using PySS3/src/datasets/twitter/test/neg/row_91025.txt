I just learned that school will be online until we get the vaccine, and that might be in 2021I just feel so...broken. I barely made it out of the last round of online school alive, and I thought it was over. I thought I would be able to go back in the fall, and do better. I thought I would make friends, do sports, and be ok for once. I was doing well. But now, now it feels like it was all for nothing. I know I won't be able too keep up online, I know my grades will drop, I know I'll fall back into depression, and I know that, if I have to do this, I'll likely commit before the new year comes. It's just all so bleak and hopeless. I don't even really want with a burning desire to die anymore, although I was worried that would change when school started, but now I know it will. I know the I can't do this, and honestly, I'd MUCH rather be dead than go back to where I was before. I'd even rather be in a ward, just anything other than online school. I just can't do it.
