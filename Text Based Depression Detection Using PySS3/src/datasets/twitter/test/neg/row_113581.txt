I don't want to do this anymore.I feel like a failure just for posting here but I feel like I need to tell someone.

I don't know that I love my wife.  I feel more like I'm addicted.  I don't want to live without her but I don't want to live the same life she wants to.  She loves having a shitload of animals on a farm to either take care of or neglect, whichever she has time for.  There's no compromise, there's no other solution.  If I divorce then I get fucked by debt and most likely alimony, if I stay then I remain miserable and unable to improve my situation at all.  I hate most of her friends, I never get to see her due to her spending days we have off together with her friend for their "business" (I don't think she's cheating), she throws placating statements and occasional sex my way because she knows I'm not happy but I frankly don't believe she cares.

But beyond that:
- No housework (no dishes, vacuuming, laundry only when necessary, cleaning, etc... I'm the only one who does anything and I'm too depressed now to even keep up on everything so the place is going to shit)
- No farm work unless she feels like it or its absolutely necessary (doesn't feed the animals; expects me to do all the yard maintenance, building, clearing, etc...)
- Keeps a fuckton of worthless junk that she plans on "fixing up to sell" at some point but she's never going to.
- Has a business that she thinks is going to make a bunch of money but her and her friend/business partner are stupid about how they spend their money and their business policies are bad so they make almost no money for how much work they're putting in.
- Has two other businesses that are just complete money pits because she "wants a hobby".
- None of the money from her job can go towards us because it all gets spend god-knows-where, so I end up paying ALL the bills.

I'm so goddamn depressed.  When I woke up this afternoon I just laid in bed and fantasized about several easy ways to just "slip away" because I can't just up and leave without causing even more pain to myself.  This way she gets a life insurance payout and can find someone who wants to do this shit forever and has no other ambition. And I won't have to deal with this shit anymore.  I haven't even heard from her today since she walked out of the house this morning.
