oh boyits been a while since i posted here but damn am i having just a terrible awful bad time. ive been suicidal for almost 48 hours straight, every time i try to go to sleep i cant stop crying, my intrusive thoughts are going crazy. i hate living. nothing even happened to trigger me i just got really upset yesterday and because im 99.9% sure i have bpd i internalized it and made it all my own fault and i went to the forest and cried all day today and thought i felt a little better but then i didnt and i felt suicidal again and i have no one i can go to and im 20 but i cant afford therapy and i have had an awful experience with it anyway and im scared that im gonna kill myself because im so fucked up and i just want to die!! im so upset because i have nowhere to go to vent except fucking reddit and my latest reddit experiences have been reddit recommending me the sub that hates people with bpd and basically villifies us and thinks we should be dead and now i feel like i need to cut myself off from everyone or kill myself and i just feel so fucking terrible Brooo this shit sucks
