I should be alrightI'm living my dream job, have been for years. I get to travel and see all kinds of amazing things.  I'm active and adventure whenever I want.  I have amazing friends and so much love for life. Yet... I think about killing myself throughout the day, every day.  I can't control it, the ideas creep in and don't leave.  I just don't know how to feel lately.  Sometimes I hate myself so f***ing hard it's insane.  I can't figure it out, I thought I had a good thing going, and was ready to grow but all I want to do is revert into the earth. I just feel lost, sad, and so alone in my heart.
 
I don't want it to be painful and lately pray not to wake up from sleep.  The only reason I don't want to actually die/kill myself is because I believe that life is worth living, that it will get better, and I cannot bare the pain it would bring to family and friends.  I'm miserable, I think about quitting my job, but for what?  A shitty job?  No way, I love what I do but I just can't wake myself up enough to give a shit about it.
