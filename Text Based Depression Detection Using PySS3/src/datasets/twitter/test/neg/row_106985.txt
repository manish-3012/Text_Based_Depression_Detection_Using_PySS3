Nothing feels real anymoreI know this post will die in new, but anyways. I almost attempted it yesterday, but I couldn't find a proper place to hang myself. Now I'm sitting here, absolutely dissociated, without a sense of time, and just trying to stop the painful river of thoughts. I'm feeling like a ghost at this point, because I'm not even talking to the girls I'm roommates with, they're not talking to me, they're just with each other. I feel like I'm just observing everything. My head hurts from all of this. I can't even get much help from my mom bc she always says that it will get better in a while. For two years. This is my 3rd post here today. I don't even know what to do I will probably just overdose some sedatives I had at home or other medicine I just hope it will be painless
