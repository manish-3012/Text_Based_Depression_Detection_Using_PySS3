Iâ€™m not scared of death, Iâ€™m scared of survivingdonâ€™t know what to type here. im 15, i think I have bpd, ive attempted suicide by overdose twice before. The worst part was facing the world after fully recovering. thereâ€™s this person I really like, she used to care but I guess a combination of me and the rest of the world made her numb. now she hates talking to me. i dont even want to share my average ass problems, all I know is thereâ€™s a kitchen knife at my neck but Iâ€™m scared of surviving. i donâ€™t want to see my mother cry because of me again, but Iâ€™m so tired of being unloveable, so tired of being me
