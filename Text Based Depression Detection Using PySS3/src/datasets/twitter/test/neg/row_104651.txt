Really severe suicidal ideation, I don't want to go through with it, I just need someone to talk to...I'm 25 and female. I feel like I'm being pretty realistic here - depression and suicidal ideation have been recurring themes in my life for a while. I go through periods where I think I'm pulling my shit together and I feel incredible and then, looking back, I see myself as delusional and more hopeless than ever. I think I'm bipolar but I don't want to live medicated any more than I want to live like this. I don't like the world and the options that I have ahead of me. I feel hopeless and tired. I feel like I'm waiting for a polite moment to step out of a party I don't want to be at anymore.

Is there anyone pretty openminded who would be open to talking with me for a bit? I don't use any chat services really so you tell me what's convenient and I'll make it work...
