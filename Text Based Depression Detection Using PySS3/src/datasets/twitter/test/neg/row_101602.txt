I will probably do it. But I'm not sad about it.A short summary: I have a good life. Good family, best fiancee I could ask for, etc.

The problem I have is that aside from spending time with my fiancee, I just feel numb. I haven't done well in school for the past couple years, even withdrawing from a semester due to severe depression. It seems that the only thing that welcomes me in whatever I do is more stress and anxiety. If I do well on an exam or homework? I don't feel success. I'm not happy about it. It's just what I think should be done, so there's nothing to celebrate. It becomes a problem when I can't be motivated to get things done since I don't have any sense of accomplishment whenever I meet my goals. It's grown into a pretty severe problem.

It seemed to peak as I was trying to study for a calculus exam, which at that point was a make-or-break the semester type of exam. With only a few hours left before the exam, I realized just how little I knew. I wrote a suicide note that night and attempted to take my life. Obviously it didn't work, but I was able to keep it to myself and I decided that night that I would do it.

And to my surprise, I've never been at more peace with myself. I don't have to worry about what will happen because I know it will. While I wouldn't describe the time since as "having fun" or even being happy, it is at the very least peaceful in knowing the eventual outcome. But my attitude recently has been- why be sad about it? I've had a good life. I've had good experiences. And while I realize that seeking relief through death is an impossibility, death does bring a stop to nights thinking about nothing other than deserving death.

I'm not even really sure why I'm posting this- thinking out loud I suppose. But it would seem sadness is unnecessary in suicide. In my case, there's only one thing that brings me happiness, but there are countless things that bring me stress. It's not the ideal solution because it also creates some sadness, but (as often pointed out), suicide is a selfish act, and that sadness would not be for me. Hm.
