I am tired of living and don't have any friends or relatives so no one will miss me if I am gone.  I am tired of struggling so much.  I believe in reincarnation and think my next life will probably be better.  The only thing that is stopping me is I am afraid that I will do it wrong and then end up paralyzed which would be even worse than my current life. I don't currently have the means to kill myself so it would take me a few days to get them.
