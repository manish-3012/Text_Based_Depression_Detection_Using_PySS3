Anyone ever feel like their suicide is inevitable?I just want to know Iâ€™m not alone in feeling that way. Iâ€™ve struggled with mental illness pretty much my whole life. Iâ€™m ok in the present moment. Iâ€™m not planning it as I type this or anything. Iâ€™ve just always had this feeling like thatâ€™s how I was meant to die. Like eventually Iâ€™ll just â€˜knowâ€™ the time is right and decide to act on it.
