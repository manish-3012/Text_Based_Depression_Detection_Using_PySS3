I feel like life ins't worth living anymoreBetween reading about how climate change is causing the ice caps to melt faster then ever, and Trump just saying fuck you to the enviroment, then hearing about how we are at risk for nuclear war. I feel guilty for having a child because she is going to inherit a horrible world, thanks to human selfishness. I hate being a woman as well because apparently we will always be considered the inferior gender no matter what we do, and some men will always want to be able to control our bodies no matter how hard we fight. I also hate not being able to feel I can't be more protective of my loved ones. I am depressed that hate crimes keep going up and people fighting bigotry are just called SJW cucks or some crap. I also feel like my ADHD just makes me stupid and unproductive and it is too late for anything anyway.
