So here's an update. It gets worse...So here's my [original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/199oo1/i_think_about_it_every_day/) Where I go on about my wife and job etc.

Anyway, fast forward to today. My wife has her Facebook on my phone. She wanted to check it one night, so it's been logged in ever since. I decide to close some Safari windows and BAM. There it is. Right in the face. I didn't intend to see it and I wish I hadn't. An email exchange between her and her girl friend. Apparently she's "wasted her 20s", "wants to be a whore for a night", "Have someone tell her she's sexy" and "what happens at (her friends) house, stays at (her friends) house". Meanwhile, I'm here. Making advances every day. Telling her she looks great and I love her. This morning, she actually got mad about it. Saying how she doesn't need to be told every day. Sorry, but I accidentally stumbled upon your conversation and apparently that's what you want. **But not from me**.

So, this is it. I'm off today and I've had a few drinks and she's at work. No idea that I know about this little exchange. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know how to fix this. We've had some financial problems as of late, and I asked if we were ok even though all of that has occurred. She says all is well. But I know better. 

I don't know what to do. Someone please help. Give me some advice that might work, or anything. I can't have her leave me. Never mind for a GIRL. I couldn't take that. I do everything I can to make her happy. Fuck, I made breakfast at midnight last night because she was craving it. Who does that?? 

I've come so far since I met her. I was in a bad place before, similar to this, and she set me straight. If she goes, or does anything like they've all done before her, I don't know what I'd do. I'm not even talking about just girl in particular. Friends in general have always been dicks to me, regardless of what I've done for them. I'm already prepared. I've cleaned my house, done my laundry and the dog's been fed. 

When I learned about this new information, I actually was on my way to the garage to "think", but I forgot my keys. Was it meant to be or a cruel joke put on by fate? Who knows.
