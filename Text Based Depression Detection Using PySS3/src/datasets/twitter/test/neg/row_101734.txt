Is there a place that suicidal people can go to seek help that's not therapy?We have places we can go when we're sick (hospital). We have places we can go when we're depressed (therapy). We have places we can go when we're dealing with an addiction (rehab). What about a place when you feel suicidal and just need to breathe and know someone is looking out for you?
