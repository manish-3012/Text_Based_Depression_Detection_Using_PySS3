What do I do?Please help me. The urge to do it has been growing stronger over past few emonths.

Back then I've been able to shrug it off, but it's no longer the case this time. I no longer even have that much interest or creativity in the things I used to be really good at. Right now I'm not at the "peak" that's why I'm able to think of it like this but there are times when I get dangerously close to actually doing it.

The biggest reason for holding on is my family that is very eager for me to finish school so that I could finally (hopefully) give them a better life, but holding on to that reason seem no longer work at times.
