What is even wrong with me?For 20 years I have been dealing with my ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), something that a lot people don't understand the sheer difficult of the most basic things in life. I don't know if I'm going to find a stable job and move out of my mom's house. Everyday I feel exhausted but I don't know why. I know I have depression, but what does is really mean? I have been in therapy my whole life, taken antidepressants, even been hospitalized, yet I'm still the same. so what is it?

Whenever I would visualize my feelings and my problems, I see this black blob completely devoid of form folding in on itself leaving tracers in my vision. What am I supposed to think of this? What am I supposed to do about this? Will it dissipate or be there for life? What's even darker is I know society is incapable of helping me deal with this. If I can't get a stable job, I might be able to go on disability, but hardly get anything.

I don't know what to do. I live in a flawed society at a time of immense poverty, hunger, state violence/neglect, and wealth inequality, and I'm no aristocrat. If things go from bad to worse, my family will absolutely suffer the consequences.
