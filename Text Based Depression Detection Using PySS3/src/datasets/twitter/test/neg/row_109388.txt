I hate my lifeI'm a sophomore at highschool. I keep starting conflicts with my school counselor and my grades are so shit at school. I have no money and can't hire a tutor to make up for those grades. are money probs and doing sht at school thinking that you're worthless in life and in the future enough reasons for suicide?
