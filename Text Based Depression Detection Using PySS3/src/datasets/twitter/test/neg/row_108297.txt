I hope you'll understandI need a break from all this. The past 2 months have taken a huge toll on me. My mental health is really bad but I don't tell anyone because I don't have anyone to share my emotions with. I know this is whiny and bitchy but it is how it is. I feel like writing this down will help you understand more easily that none of which you see is your fault. Its mine.  

From the past 3 weeks I've been crying myself to sleep in the silence and solemn of my room. The only one who sees me cry is probably the mirror opposite to my bed. It seems like nobody cares. Even if they do, it will take a lot to see through the faÃ§ade I put on- that I'm happy and nothing is wrong. I don't want you to suffer because of me. I make a consious effort to not look like my world is falling apart.   

I've tried to hang myself twice. The first time the knot opened and the second time I slipped from the noose. Even the universe is playing a joke on me. Nobody, not even you, know about this. I don't want those fake sympathetic looks from people who KNOW it will be better with me gone.
The truth is, I'm just an after-thought for most people I know. Even the closest ones. My death will probably feel bad for a week or a month at most. After that, they'll just move on and their lives will be 10 times better without my burden.  

Life is not for the weak or the dumb. Its the survival of the fittest. And my death will be in accordance with nature.  

I failed you and I failed myself. I can not ask forgiveness for that since that is of no use. I do, however, apologize for putting this on a public forum, and the mess on the floor. Do me a favor and return the gun to its owner. The poor guy probably still thinks I've gone hunting.  
  


Bye.
