They Won't Let Me Go BackWell, I made it working for 15 years, but I opened up to a psychiatrist who had me committed. After I was basically forced to undergo ECT and filp my mind with chemicals they let me go home. I was able to return to work, but in a lapse of judgment I overdosed on relatively harmless anti-anxiety meds. My wife called the cops and I was again committed.

This all happened 2 months ago and they haven't let me go back. Luckily I am receiving disability payments, but this does nothing to help my self esteem or depression. I'm getting fatter by the minute and I'm not even sure I want to go back at this rate. Doctors suck. Medicine sucks. Work sucks. I suck.
