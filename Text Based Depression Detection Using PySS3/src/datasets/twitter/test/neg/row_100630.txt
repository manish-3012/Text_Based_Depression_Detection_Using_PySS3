I'm sorryI'm sorry for being so selfish
I'm sorry that I can't reach out because Im ashamed of talking to my friends about this because I don't want to burden them 
I know how terrible it is to have someone threaten suicide to you, it messed me up so badly and I'm sorry for burdening everyone here and not going quietly 
I'm sorry for not wanting to fight anymore and for giving up after 23 years and countless therapies 
I'm sorry for having turned so bitter and passive, I barely know what's going on anymore
I don't want to die, but I don't want anyone to have to deal with me any longer. I don't want to have to deal with myself any longer. 

My reaching out was rejected by my sister and my best friend. I am too tired to try again.
