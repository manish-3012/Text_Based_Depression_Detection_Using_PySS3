I canâ€™t anymoreIm tired. All I ever had was my future and thatâ€™s not even real. I got accused of awful shit and I just contemplated suicide but stopped myself of fear of failing and having to live with a disability and I got so scared I passed out . The only thing close to it is self harm. I donâ€™t want my mom to suffer because of me but I canâ€™t keep doing this I need a way out I canâ€™t live like this anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna be suffering forever and I want it to end I donâ€™t deserve this feeling I donâ€™t see a future for myself any longer I wish my heart would stop working so I could die at peace and Iâ€™m still trying to pick the best way to end it all
