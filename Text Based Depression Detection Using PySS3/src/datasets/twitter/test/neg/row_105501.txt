I canâ€™t even finish high school...I wish I could go back in time and slap some sense into myself. Early 2017, I was in my second semester of my junior year of high school. I was #1 in my class and predicted to be the valedictorian. However, I had a mental breakdown over the most stupid thing ever (body dysmorphia related) and dropped out to do online school. Then, I didnâ€™t do jack shit for a year and a half, and now Iâ€™m just starting my senior year while all my friends are starting as freshmen in college. 

All I had to do was stay at my old school, but I couldnâ€™t even do that. I missed out on so much, and ruined my life by being a lazy-ass. I went from being known as one of the smartest kids in my grade to a nearly a high school dropout.

Now I look at my coursework, and I canâ€™t even bring myself to do it. Not to mention, the online school I picked is total ass, but I cannot change it. I fucked up my life, and I do not have the courage or the motivation to get it back together. 

I canâ€™t live with the stupid decision I made.
