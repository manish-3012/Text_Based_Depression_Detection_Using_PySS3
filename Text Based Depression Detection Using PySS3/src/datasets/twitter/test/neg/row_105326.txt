Confused It all went down hill years ago and I often feel depressed, nervous and trapped. I feel like everywhere I go I spread my depression. I have made plans to do some fun stuff in the future but after that I have literally nothing coming. I feel useless and I can't do anything physical anymore because of my intense back pain. I have thought about blowing my brains out into the river but the problem is I have no gun. I don't think I will make it past age 20, honestly.
 I am 15 now and don't say I have an entire life ahead of me because I don't. I have talked to many of my friends about this but they just say I shouldn't do it because I'm a good person or whatever the fuck else, they never have a sufficient answer and the only reason I am here is because I don't have a hand gun and a bullet.

 As I stated above, I have nothing after meeting up with a friend to go around the country a little bit. I would end up living on the street. I have been there before and I wouldn't wish that loneliness upon anyone. I really feel like there is nothing left for me. One of the few people who I know IRL that genuinely cares about me is about to die, so there is that.
 And aside of that gun option, I could get rope and hang myself on my balcony pretty easily.... What is there worth living anymore? We all die in the end, anyways.
