I don't really want to see tomorrow...Why do I post it here when my SO knows my reddit. At least he barely uses it. But still. We talked a lot about the future. I can barely take care of the present. I know some days are rougher than others, and I had improved tremendously. Physically, mentally, emotionally. 

I mean. 
Age
5-12 Physical, verbal bullying and social isolation
13-15 Social isolation. Something started in my head.
16-18 Domestic abuse and an enabler who kept telling me my abuser loves me. Social isolation. Homophobia. Video gaming addiction took root.
18-now Went abroad struggling with language barriers. Gaming addiction currently screwing with me. Social isolation ceased entirely.


I'm not struggling in any way. Financially it can be better but I think I'm well off to some extent. But I'm so nervous. It's hard enough to go to a doctor. And I get sick rather often. Health wise, it's much better nowadays though. I used to get sick nearly all the time, and it's all pretty major stuff.

I'm nervous. I want to sleep. Class is tomorrow. But negative thoughts are swirling in. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to face tomorrow. 

...I still don't get why my SO insists he loves me. My self esteem plummeted and doubt has taken root. ... Though I need to remind myself, I feel much better when I'm not playing games nonstop, either. 

I'm tired. I want to live with my LDR SO some day, but it's so far far away and I'm tired.
