Want to seek help - Don't know what to do. Please help..Not going to give a really big explanation on what's going on with my life, I posted that a few days ago. If you're wanting to know about that, just look at my only other selfpost on this throwaway account.

The last couple days have been especially rough. I've been further questioning the purpose of life, only to repeatedly come to the conclusion that there is no purpose. There is no point in living. We're all insignificant, and we'll all be forgotten in time. I set a date to CTB. So why is it now all of the sudden, just a couple days prior, I'm having second thoughts?

I am unemployed and do not have insurance currently. I'm waiting on a $650 tax return to come in sometime in the next two weeks. I want to seek help and get put on some kind of medication, but don't know where to begin seeing how I don't have insurance or a primary care physician to refer see that can prescribe me anything or refer me to a psychiatrist.
