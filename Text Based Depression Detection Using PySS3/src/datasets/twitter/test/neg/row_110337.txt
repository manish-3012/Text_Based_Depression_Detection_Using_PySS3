I'm trapped.I'm trapped.

Let me tell you what I mean by that. I'm 16 and have been dealing with severe depressive episodes/awful anxiety for the past 5 years of my life. To add to the pool, I was diagnosed with PTSD and insomnia a year ago.

Something that makes all of these disorders flare up really bad is school. I could never figure out why. In 6th grade I started missing a lot of school, my grades started dropping, etc. It use to be the people. My anxiety was pretty much social and I would have massive panic attacks the night before school and in the mornings just thinking about interacting with people. I was actually sent home a few times for my panic attacks throughout the years. My social anxiety kind of cleared up after the first time I was hospitalized at a BHC, but even today being around people is very draining for reasons I can't explain. I would come home and just sleep until the next day, and I would always wake up very disoriented.

My freshman year, I switched to homeschooling. I quit right towards the end of the first semester so I lost all of my in-progress credits. I earned some of them back through my program. Being homeschooled was very less stress inducing and it seemed like all of my problems went away from the most part.

Then I went back to public school my sophomore year. I was still basically a freshman though. The same thing happened. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia all flared up. This was the first time I had been hospitalized. I didn't even attempt suicide. I was just so extremely apathetic and unknowing about the future that it scared my therapist and family so they all decided to send me.

So after I got back from that, I finished up all my missing work (i was excused from most of it) and finished first term classes. I decided that this wasn't for me a second time and told my mom that I wanted to be homeschooled again. My school counselor suggested that I go to an alternative school for potential HS dropouts. It was a lot smaller setting and you did all the work on your own (online) and worked at your own pace. I thought this was perfect, personally. So I took a test and got in. For the first 2 months I was very happy and motivated. I finished my Biology course and was very proud of myself for that. Then, it came back. I was very confused because this time it wasn't the people that were stressing me out. I don't know why it happened. All I remember is thinking that I couldn't get motivated to do all this work, then that lead to me feeling like a failure, and next thing you know I had downed some pills. That was the second time I was hospitalized. I essentially got kicked out of that school for missing too many days and not being motivated.

I remember at some point going back to the public high school and only going half days and finishing finals for that semester, but then getting sent to the ER for attempting to OD. They didn't send me to a BHC that time.

I went back at the beginning of my suppose-to-be junior year which was in August of 2015. I got maybe a month into school and I just couldn't do it anymore. I was extremely suicidal and just overall unhealthy because of the stress school gave me. So I went back to being homeschooled. Now this time, it wasn't as...relieving I guess? In the middle of being homeschooled this time, I went through another depressive episode. My mother and I both decided that maybe I needed to go back to a BHC and sort things out, but the ER didn't send me.

So fast forward. Every time I drop out I feel extremely pressured by my family to go back. My mom would always nonchalantly bug me about it, and I couldn't visit anyone in my family with them bringing public school up. So I emailed my school counselor and asked her if it would be possible for me to go back this semester. She said no, and that if I wanted to go back next year the school would have to consider it. Which is understandable to me now, but then it kind of took me by surprise. I was upset for a bit (probably because I rarely ask for things, and when I do I'm not use to being told no...yes...i acknowledge that I'm can be spoiled at times) but in the end I just realized that it didn't really matter to me. But my mom was very excited that this was even a thought that crossed my mind, so she kept asking me if I wanted to go back. Each time I responded that I didn't care. But she contacted her uncle (the superintendent of the school) and told him about the situation, and eventually I had a full school schedule and was about to go back for the 2nd school semester.

The time to go back got closer. I was excited because I really thought things would be different this time. Then I started getting anxiety. I started having breakdowns and getting into fights with my mom. I realized that this was going to be a very, very bad idea.

Started last week. Third day, I woke up and had a breakdown, got into an awful fight with my mom and had to stay at a friends for a while after school.

I can't switch back, because apparently her uncle "pulled teeth" to get me back in school (which, he literally just told the principal that he wanted me to have a schedule and that was it) and she isn't going to let me back out.

I can't. I've literally done everything in terms of trying to keep myself motivated throughout the years. My therapist and I have even come up with wacky ways to keep myself from getting sad. She even told me (because I had been thinking about it since I started high school) that down the road, maybe dropping out would be the best option.

But here's another reason I'm trapped. First of all, my mother would never give me permission to drop out. Secondly, if she did, what would happen to me? My family would be extremely disappointed and talk endless shit about me (yeah, they do that) and take any opportunity to make me feel awful about my decision.

So, I literally have no way out this time. I'm trapped. If I stay in school I'll probably actually kill myself. If I drop out, I'll probably end up killing myself. More likely to happen while I'm in school, though... But I can't just quit for good this time. I'm being forced to stay and be stressed and unhealthy and suicidal every waking moment...I don't know what other options I have other than to just end my life and not have to deal with it anymore.
