Am I lazyI feel like Iâ€™m being such a lazy asshole by wanting to die. I feel so overwhelmed with the absolute endless ways life isnâ€™t worth my time. I just think of how easy it would be to just not exist and then I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about the endless cycle of work to gain nothing and scrape by for nothing. 
Like why work when nothing is to be gained why do anything nothing is going to show for it. Itâ€™s the way the system is designed, thereâ€™s no escape Iâ€™m the lower of the 99% and can never hope to be anything more than that. Very literally the way this society works makes it so that I will never be able to live comfortably so why bother.
