I just feel so utterly pathetic and like I just let everyone down.I go to sleep alot often wondering, "Who's going to miss me if I just disappeared?". here's some background. Well I'm 17 in high school and I'm absolutely terrified of college. My parents have no faith in me. My dad even told me I'm recieving none of his GI bill and it's all going to my younger sister. Along with the stress of trying to figure out my life, I try to have relationships, but I ALWAYS train wreck. I feel responsible for each and every mishap. I'm not trolling, I'm just really stressed and just want to lay down somewhere where I won't ever bother anybody.. 

Edit: I'm turning my novelty into a throw away
