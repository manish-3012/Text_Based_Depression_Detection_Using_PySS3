I don't know what doAll my life I was abused. Biological parents abandoned me; at school I was beaten every day for four years. At the age of seventeen, I threatened my classmates and was expelled. I've been jobless since. Only found work once cleaning bathrooms, and I was fired in a week. I attempted suicide a number of times, but I failed. Going to attempt again soon, a bunch of days I was about to chug valium with some alcohol, but I didn't have the guts at the end. This life fucked me up. I shouldn't have been born at all.
