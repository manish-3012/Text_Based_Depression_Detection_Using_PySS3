Not sure where to leave my noteSo I'm struggling with  a place to leave my note that will be obvious to my family after I die so they can find it and read it, especially because it includes instructions about my funeral (i don't want them wasting money on it) and shit like that. they need to find it as soon as they can. 

I don't want them to find it before I kill myself though, which is difficult. because I am an impulsive person and I don't know exactly when I'm going to do it, just that it is definately happening soon. 

I don't want them to find it before I die and freak out. What should I do where should I leave this.
