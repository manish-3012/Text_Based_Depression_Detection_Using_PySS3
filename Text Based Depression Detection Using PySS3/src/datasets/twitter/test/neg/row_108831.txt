Loaded Gun Part 2: AdviceSee original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f14a9p/loaded_gun/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

There have been a few changes in my life since the last post and I need some advice. 

First change, I took out the maximum amount in life insurance. Not quite as much as I hoped it would be, but still. Now my problem is that I have to wait until March 1st because that's when it takes effect. Doesn't seem like a very long time but holy hell I feels like it.
 
For some reason this two weeks waiting period has sent me into a constant anxiety attack. I'm panicking all the time. I can't sleep. 

The stress and anxiety lead to me having a breakdown while talking to my mom on the phone. Now she's worried and is trying to take action. 

She lives out of state. She wants to get me closer to family. When I feel optimistic I want the same thing. She has gone about getting a family camper and is trying to convince my stepdad to let me live in it. 

Kinda a dream situation to be honest. I've always wanted to live in an RV/ camper. There is something freeing about being that close to nature. 

At the same time if I choose to take the opportunity I am draining my family of their limited resources and taking even more hand outs. I feel like I am screaming for attention and being rewarded. It's disgusting. I would much rather die. 

Part of me wants to just get in the car and drive. But I can't. Part of me wants to just shoot myself already and stop this fucked up game where I panic and ruin people's lives. 

I am shaking all the time. I don't know how to make it two more weeks. 

What should I do?
