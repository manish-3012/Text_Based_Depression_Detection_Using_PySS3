I suppose it could be called "anxiety"Hi! I'm not really suicidal, but I still need help with a depression-related thing. Actually, I've never been diagnosed with a mental disorder because I have never been to the hospital/therapist for anything mental-related, but I still often feel dull and depressed for often no reason. I also find myself hating many people and things, while feeling very listless, lazy, and weak a lot of the time. My life has been very simple. I'm lonely and I don't have real friends, so I stick to the internet, where I write my poetry and also play video games. In the process I also meet great people. I've only had one girlfriend, and in a long distance relationship at that. To sum the relationship up - it was great. It lasted over three years, and she was the best friend I've ever had. We also got very intimate and sexual, and I was basically obsessed with her. And I seriously mean obsessed - She was my only friend, who else would I invest my attention towards? But then eventually she broke up with me, for reasons I understand. Sure, I still feel sorrow from it, but I'm not one to dwell on it and get suicidal because of it. I still feel the same "depression" I felt before - That quiet, dull, weakness that made it so I never felt like doing anything. It happened for absolutely no reason. I don't understand if it's actual depression, or just my own pathetic laziness. Like I mentioned earlier, I have never bothered to visit a therapist, so I wouldn't know. Now, it is here that I will bring up my two main concerns regarding the summary I have just provided.

1. The "depression". I put it in quotes because I don't know if it's real or not. My parents don't "believe" in mental disorders - They say i'm just so down because I play too many video games and rarely go outside. However, when I was as young as ten, I would remember feeling down just like this, for absolutely no reason, even when I was social and active. So I want to know, should I go and get checked up for that? I've always thought I had something, because of the random sadness that would come up inside me, and also the severe anger I would feel at little things. If I should, then can someone explain to me what to do/where the best kind of place to go would be? Just general stuff, obviously, since I have never considered seeing a therapist before. Any information regarding that, or anything I should know about depression, would be greatly appreciated.

2. This is strange. As I mentioned earlier, my girlfriend and I were very intimate and sexual. I was obsessed with her too, in all ways. After the breakup, when I'm no longer in contact with her, and no longer have any of those awesome pictures of her which I used to enjoy, I feel different. I'm constantly, and I mean *constantly* having stomach pains. It's the kind of feeling you get when you're about to vomit, when you can feel the pressure building up your stomach and up to your throat. I've vomitted many times too, almost every day because of it. My eating patterns have been the same as always, so it's not that. I'm also a very skinny person, so me puking daily is not a good thing. This feeling, however, dies down when I am not thinking about her. But when I happen to see a picture of her, or a mention of her anywhere, I instantly feel immensely sick, and either throw up or feel like it's stuck in my throat. I am almost completely sure this has a link with my sexual obsession with her, because I still see her as I did before, as "sexy" beyond any other girl I have ever seen, etc etc. Not only that, but if I do happen to see an ordinary picture of her, I immediately get crazy horny. It's a really strange and new feeling for me, because I didn't know it was possible to get that horny and also feel that sick at the same time. So all I would like are some ideas or suggestions for how I can deal with this. Is it a kind of anxiety? Or what would it be? 

If it matters, I'm an 18 year old guy. I know my "problem" isn't that big of a deal, but I really felt the need to talk about it and receive some intelligent advice for it, and I would be grateful if some people could help to guide me and recommend things I could do to fix these issues. Oh, and I'm also *extremely* anti-social, self-conscious, awkward, and uninteresting. I'm not suicidal, but often I'll start thinking about it for some reason, wishing I was dead so I wouldn't have to go through this weird confusing feeling.
