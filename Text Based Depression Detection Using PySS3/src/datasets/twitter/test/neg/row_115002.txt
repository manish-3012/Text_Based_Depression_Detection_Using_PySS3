Would jumping in a river in hope to hit a rock on the dmway down a good way to die? Bit chilly maybe, but im sure once im unconcious from the hit and what not ill be fine. Dead but yanno fine.Goodbye reddit. Gave me a few good chuckles n hard breathieness. Hope everyone else on here can figure out a different way but this is my only way. I honestly cant live anymore. Havent had the will to do so for a while. Been on autopilot for a while just tuning my emotions out, but between having to work from 4am to 5pm and not being able to sleep because of insomnia i just dont have the energy. I feel bad for what im gonna make my family go through. Theyve been nothing but somewhat supportive of me. Yeah sure they dont care about my mental health, but thats because they dont know any better. I dont hate them for that. Wish i could be stronger but im just not. I also deal with multiple physical health issues as well to top it off. Nothing major but something bothersome nonetheless. Also worthnoting i dont really have friends. Like seriously you might think i have 1 or 2 and im exagerating but im serious. I have no friends. Zero. Im just pretty much a waste of space. The government should help people like us. Use our organs or something. It really should be a human right. Its insane this isnt a thing. Sure make it a huge step program where they keep you in watch for say a week, then if you still wanna go through with it, then they basically could just give you a lethal injection. This needs to be a thing because alot of people are just suffering. And a good legal useful way to end the suffering would be a grace to someone dead inside. Theres no point being alive if youre not really living. Always a constant battle with myself. Im sure many on here can agree. Anyway thank you for your time. Sorry if this is a dumb reason but i think its reasonable.
