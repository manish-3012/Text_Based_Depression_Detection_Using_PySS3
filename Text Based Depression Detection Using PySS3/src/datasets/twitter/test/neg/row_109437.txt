What point is there in living if you can't deal with your daily lifeI just can't. Fucking. Deal. With my life right now. I can't deal with it and it's killing me day by day. So why should I keep living if I'm fucking miserable every day?

My feeling used to be that I'd never kill myself because it'd crush a lot of people, but honestly it's getting to the point where I don't care anymore
