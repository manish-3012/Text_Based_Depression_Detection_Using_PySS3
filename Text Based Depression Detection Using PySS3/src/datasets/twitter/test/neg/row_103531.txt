I have two paths, both of which require a whole lot of courage. Either I commit suicide or face the harsh adult world.Oh boy. I never posted on this subreddit using my main account. But I guess keeping appearances doesn't matter anymore.

Hi, I'm 19 and I'm a 2nd year college student. I'm didn't choose my college course; My parents did that for me. I'm not really complaining though. The course is not that hard, though I don't feel any joy from it.

I will be taking a leave of absence next semester though. Because of new developments regarding my parents' financial situation, and a little bit of an economic crisis happening in Lebanon, I won't be studying for a while. I have no emergency funds with me at this point in time, which I blame myself for because my parents were always generous with my allowance. My parents have every right to be angry with me for not having an emergency fund. I have to drop out and get a job.

But the thing is, I have known nothing but school and studying for the past 16 years. I have no work experience nor do I even know my own qualifications for anything. I don't even think I have the mental capability of working under pressure which a lot of job listings require their applicants to have. I mean, that is why I'm here instead of submiting my resume to a call-center recruitment agency. These excuses sound so stupid and childish, and it is. I hate it. I know I need to suck it up and go out there to save myself from poverty and to keep up with the bills. I just don't know how.

My other option is to commit suicide. It sounds like just running away from taking on responsibility as an adult, and I acknowledge it fully; It is. But I also see how it would benefit my parents. I've lived like a parasite my whole life. I have been given everything so that I can be the person my parents want me to be, but in truth, I am never good enough. All I have is a good-looking report card. I have seen my parents' bank accounts. They'll have a good enough pension for them to live comfortably until they die. They made a mistake keeping me alive for so long. My only regret will be the financial cost my suicide will bring. I hope my parents aren't the type that spends way too much on burials. 

I have never contemplated suicide on this level. I even researched on how to hang myself properly. And now that I am here, it is scary. I remember when I told myself that I was gonna commit suicide this weekend after I finish our group project, other than suicidal thoughts, my brain kept on saying, "But I want to cosplay in the anime convention this December," and "I want to see how my favourite manga ends." It's so pathetic. I can't get myself to get a job, and I don't even have the guts to kill myself because of my stupid hobbies.

Death sounds like the most likely option. If this financial crisis never happened, I still don't see myself going anywhere past graduation, much less even completing my college thesis. I don't even know what I actually want to do as an adult, which is why I never complained when my parents forced me to take the course they pushed on me since I was a kid. It sounds so degrading knowing that my parents gave me everything only for me to end up looking for a low-wage job because of my lack of a degree and work experience. I've wasted the life I've been given and I will continue to waste it unless I just end it all.

If any of you manage to make it to the end, I'm so sorry for the long rant. I needed to get my feelings out there and I feel like I've ranted to much about my depression with my friends already. I think I'd hate getting answers like "money can never replace you" or "it will be better", but I don't know what kind of help I need either. So I will just say thank you in advance for listening to me.
