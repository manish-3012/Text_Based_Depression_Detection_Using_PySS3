My mind is a messThe first time I experienced suicidal ideation was the mid to latter half of 2016. Back then, it was just a wanting to escape sort of feeling with no intent. I don't really remember any significantly memorable feelings from the second half of 2017-2018. However, last year, I felt great for the majority of the year. It felt like that was how I would feel from then on; it made me think that feelings from 2016 would never come back. Everything was just wonderful. Then since the end of 2019 (even before quarantine and the virus had any impact on life), my feelings have been bouncing all over the place, and every time I end up at the bottom of a pit emotionally, those thoughts slip back in.

It's like it's turned into a giant circle. Feel great for a few days or weeks, feel like dying for a while, and repeat over and over again. Yesterday, I started the day in that awful mood, which I had been in for the last few weeks, but at the end of the day, it went away again. This type of back and fourth crap has been going on all year. Each time I've felt that way, it's gotten more and more exhausting to put up with. It's gotten to the point that even every time I feel decent or great, I don't know if I can take falling back down there another time. 

Now, if things switch back, I'd be falling back onto a full plan that was made prior to the end of yesterday. This current state makes life seem worth it when, and only when, I'm not stuck in that pit at the bottom of the circle. My brain is essentially a pile of instability at this point. The random mentions of "suicide", "crazy", etc. from something that's most likely not even real don't help either. I have no idea why I'm like this or why my emotions change sometimes.

I'm not the type of person anyone would usually care about as well. I'm easily irritated, no matter how I feel otherwise. Normal things don't appeal to me, and I'm unable to truly care about anyone else or how my actions affect them. I have extremely morbid fantasies; I'm the exact type of person people wish would die. I feel like I wasn't meant to be part of *this* species in the first place, but rather a cat or some other predatory animal. I relate to them more.

I don't know how to open up to people in real life, or what I would say to *anyone* I physically know. I've never been able to form that kind of trust, especially not with those I live with when they have a tendency to say they don't like emotional or "crazy" people. Not to mention I feel like having a physical conversation in this mood about suicide would come across as extremely out of place and non serious.
