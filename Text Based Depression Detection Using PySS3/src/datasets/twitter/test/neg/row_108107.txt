if my attempt worked i would have missed all this bullshit.I wouldâ€™ve left life content and knowing that my family will be okay and knowing that the world is a little better from my efforts to save the climate and that 100,000 people have died(idk the actual number)but no. i didnâ€™t take enough pills and now i am suffering through this isolation shit and i honestly canâ€™t handle it but now is a terrible time to end it. just needed to share this on here since i canâ€™t really share it anywhere else
