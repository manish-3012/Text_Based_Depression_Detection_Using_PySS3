Does hanging hurt less if youâ€™re really drunk?Iâ€™m a â€œrecoveringâ€ alcoholic. Life is too much for me. I tried to buy a gun a few weeks ago, but my permanent address (and drivers license) is in a different state; Iâ€™m a college student. I always swore a gun is the only way Iâ€™d go because itâ€™s foolproof, but I canâ€™t do this anymore. 

I know hanging is not an ideal death unless you do it just right and snap your neck. Well I fuck everything up in life, so I assume Iâ€™d manage to fuck that up too. Would the pain be less or would I be likely to pass out quicker so at least the suffering was over if I was very drunk? I also have a Xanax prescription - if I took a bunch to relax myself would it make the process easier?

I live in the mountains. Iâ€™d go to the woods. My house isnâ€™t very tall inside. Iâ€™d leave a note and Iâ€™d tell all my friends I love them before I go...because I do, but I canâ€™t take it anymore. None of them understand. I know people will be sad and traumatized and itâ€™s selfish so please, save your breath with that. I am in such a dark place I donâ€™t care who I hurt. I always get really depressed and think about it, but itâ€™s different this time. Iâ€™be finally reached the depressive episode I wonâ€™t make it out of. 

I just want to sedate myself, get drunk one last time, and then end it.
