Why do I still feel so suicidalLike, I'm often having fun, have a pretty solid life and the only problem that I have is that I'm trans but I could take hormones and go thro all the surgeries n shit but I still feel so fucking bad all the time. I don't know why I just can't accept the fact that I'll have dyshoria for the rest of my life. I just feel so tired everyday I really don't wanna go thru so many more years of suffering
