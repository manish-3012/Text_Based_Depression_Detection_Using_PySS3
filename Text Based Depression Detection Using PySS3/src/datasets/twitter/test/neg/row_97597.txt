Wish I Had the Courage To Do ItI think about getting it over with literally everyday. It's always on my mind, sometimes in the back, often at the front, that thought that I should just kill myself already. I don't know if it's some shred of hope that stops me or just some base survival instinct or cowardice or what. If things aren't going to get better then I hope I work myself up to getting this over with.
