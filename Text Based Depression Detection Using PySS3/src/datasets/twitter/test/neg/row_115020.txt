It's a good thing I'm a virgin, because deep down inside I'm a misogynist and monster.Fair warning... this may very triggering for some people.

God, where do I begin... ok so first of all I've never been intimate with a girl. It's because I have 0 sexual appeal, no matter how much I try to "improve" like everyone on Reddit advises and how much I workout, etc. doesn't matter one flying fucking bit. Girls don't wanna come near me. You're not gonna believe me because of my psychotic writing below, but I promise I come across as perfectly normal. People love me... just not sexually. I'm a sexual failure.

But the most fucked up part... it's good for society that it's this way. If I ever got into a relationship with a girl, I'd be an abusive asshole.

- I get off on thoughts of humiliating women sexually and making them do things they don't wanna do. It's fucking sick but I can't help it. Let me clear up any confusion from you readers: what's hot is the idea of forcing myself on an **genuinely** unwilling participant. Role-playing wouldn't work because I'd know at the back of my mind that it's a role-play and she really loves it. The idea of consensual pleasure is an instant boner killer.

- If I were to ever get into a relationship with a girl I would only accept it if she were a virgin. I had a quasi-sort-of online relationship with a girl I never met for about 4 months and it fell apart because I was always bitter and resentful towards her for having done heavy petting / sexual stuff with guys before me. What a fucking joke. We never had the chance to meet and I was still jealous. And my feelings have not changed since then, I still can't bear the thought of being with a girl whose loved and touched another man.

- I've taken creepshots of girls, particularly to satisfy my fetish (I'm too ashamed to reveal what it is here). After taking the pictures I feel guilty but I save some of them anyway for later.

After a lot of self-reflection I realized I have basically an obsession with sexual power and aggressive dominance more than the actual aspect of pleasure and fun. So it's a truly scary thought that one day maybe my sexual appeal will attract some girl... and I'll mentally destroy her with all this shit that festers inside of me.

So maybe my crushing loneliness and imminent suicide is actually God's way of saving some poor girl from a terrible fate down the road. I'm actually thinking about doing it tonight, I got an easy painless method and everything. Guess I just wanted to admit my sins to somebody, so maybe God will forgive me after knowing that I told somebody and didn't just keep it inside of me.

but at the same time I'm so fucking lonely and I want someone to care about me even though I clearly don't deserve it.

Have a happy weekend. I hope you all find the peace and love that I could never.
