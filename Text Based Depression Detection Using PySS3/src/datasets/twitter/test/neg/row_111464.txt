Things have got better, I still want to dieI've struggled with mental health for around 8 years, I'm now the best I've been since. But, I still don't see the point in me existing. I just don't like myself. I don't see any benefit in me continuing. I just want to fall asleep and not wake up. I'm sick of always feeling this way.
