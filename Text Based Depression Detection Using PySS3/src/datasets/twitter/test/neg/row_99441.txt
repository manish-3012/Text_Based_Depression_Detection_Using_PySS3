might as welli'll try to ramble as little as possible.

was finally trying to get treatment for my psychotic symptoms after years of being too scared to do anything about it. it's going pretty fast but not fast enough. the last time i dropped in (last week) they refused to hospitalize me even though i was hysterical and hallucinating. even if they had, i dont know how i wouldve expected to afford it

i cant work and im failing school. if i drop out ill have to go live with my abuser for god knows how long. my girlfriend killed herself last year and i keep expecting all my other friends to go, too. i cant help anyone. i cant do anything.

i dont know what else to do. im really sorry
