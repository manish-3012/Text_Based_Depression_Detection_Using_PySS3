I just don't know any moreSo I detoxed off a drug subutex last year and got 8 months clean after 10 years on it prescribed. It holds a big taboo in society. 

Had a break up after 7 years, lost my apartment after 3 years. Moved home, got a new place 5 months ago,, after 5 months moving into the new place I left my stressful job. After the break up my doctor put me back on a micro dose of 0.25mg of the med. 

Now the last 4 days I've been sober(not tonight) and started to really get my ass kicked. I was drinking every day since my ex moved away, abusing and snorting my meds, drinking, doing coke on a weekly basis that I've kept hidden. 

Now that I've been trying to get clean, I don't know what I'm withdrawing from at times anymore. I'm in far worse shape than months ago, or even this time last year.

I feel like I'm never gonna beat all this and keep fucking up, even with long sprints sober. Thinking about all this makes me wanna just die, knowing everything is gone, and I can't seem to escape addiction, failure, living up to expectations, being so behind at my age and rejected by everyone.

I just don't know how this is gonna go and after 37 years... I'm just tired guys.

I just had to get it out of me. It's such a struggle, and no one wants to be around someone like that, unless I go out and be the fun guy. But inside I'm fucking dying.
