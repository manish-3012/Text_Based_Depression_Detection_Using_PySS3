What to do when you realize you are severely incompetent at your job?I have my dream job. 3 years in the belt already, but I am severely incompetent. My anxiety and depression have been horrid and since I have been working from home during quarantine I dont get work done properly. My boss (who is also my friend) is pissed at me, and I dont blame him.

Im kind of ready to give up on life. This job was what I wanted and worked so hard for during college....if I cant do well then honestly whats the point? I'll never be able to provide for a family of I dont have a job like this so I'd rather die than be impoverished or dead weight in a relationship. 

My heart burns to much. I feel like the worst person on earth right now.
