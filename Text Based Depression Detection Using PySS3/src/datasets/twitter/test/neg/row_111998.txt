Lost memories, fear of adventures, minimized future. A story.Hell. 

If you're anything like me, it's torture. You begin by knowing it will never happen, but you spiral into an uncontrollable pit of sorrow. This is actually happening to me right now, so it will be fairly relatable to what I'm going through.

To start off, it's someone you have never talked to before, but you have friends who are close. In my case she's in my friend group. This alone makes it difficult to talk to her because for me at least social anxiety is a bitch. 

The second part is holding their attention, for me this is a challenge because I typically only talk well with friends. I've been crushing on her for weeks at this point so it's bad. I mess up my words every now and then, but other than that it's alright, the conversation dies every once in a while but that's the only main challenge when talking in person. 

The third part is talking outside school. We normally text, which isn't an issue but lately it's gotten worse. The increased time between responses paired with one/two word answers shows to me she doesn't really care about me, and would rather do something else. Then again, this could be me overthinking it again. 

You overthink everything, like she hasn't responded in an hour, but at least it hasn't said she read it yet. She could be busy but this happens all the time, and I was usually responding immediately in an attempt to hold the conversation. I get that she has a busy life but it's odd getting one word answers when others get sentences even. She never goes in depth either, and when we talk about something personal and I ask stuff about her after she does the same for me, she always skirts around it. Either something is difficult for her I don't know of and should(aka I want to help), or she just dislikes me.

These are the main things I go through, if anyone cares more about this topic just respond and let me know if you have any questions. The reasons I put that she doesn't respond are there because I can read people like books, easily distinguishing their attitudes. 

The reality of it all, is that I'm uncared for by the ones I love. I don't have a loving family, I am the lover. Please, I don't know how to go on with false hope.
