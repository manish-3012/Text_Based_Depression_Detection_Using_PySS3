Do suicidal thoughts go away as time goes by?I once tried to do it but obviously failed it miserably then after that time,

my suicidal thoughts just became weak but It recently grew up again. 

So I keep fighting this thought even though I believe I won't do it.

The question is, if you had this thought or actually tried to do it,

it eventually goes away someday or you have to fight it till the end of your days?
