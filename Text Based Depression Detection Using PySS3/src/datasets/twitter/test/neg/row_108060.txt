Too uglyI really canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m just so ugly. Itâ€™s affecting my entire life. It sounds like such a small problem, right? Who cares, everyone has confidence problems, right? Why is this stupid girl crying about her looks when people have actual problems, right?

Wrong. I cannot go outside. I cannot interact with people. All I can do is wallow around in self hatred. Why was I made like this? Why do I look so ugly? 

Being Ugly wasnâ€™t always such a huge issue. Before, I used to simply cry myself to sleep and cut my wrists. No one knew how I felt about myself. (I hate telling people I think Iâ€™m ugly bc it sounds like Iâ€™m fishing for compliments, and I know theyâ€™ll give me pity compliments in return. But I donâ€™t want pity compliments, I know Iâ€™m ugly. Anyone who says Iâ€™m not is simply lying in order to help an ugly girlâ€™s self esteem.)

Being Ugly has become a bigger issue. I cannot talk to people. I cannot interact with people because Iâ€™m afraid of how Iâ€™ll be perceived. My social anxiety is at itâ€™s peak, and I know itâ€™s going to keep me from achieving any of my dreams. You see, Iâ€™m just so afraid to talk to people, but Iâ€™m also afraid to be alone and look like a loner. I just got my first job, but Iâ€™m terrified to go to training. Everyone will see me as this ugly loner girl. 

I do well in school. I study SO hard, and I want to go places. But I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to. I wonâ€™t be able to climb the corporate ladder, no matter how good I am in my field. Why would an employer hire an awkward UGLY girl when they could just as easily hire a charismatic white man? An employer has no reason to, and wouldnâ€™t hire me. 

Kids are something Iâ€™ve always wanted. But again, I am ugly. When youâ€™re this ugly, relationships arenâ€™t achievable and so kids are out of the question. 

My two main dreams in life, getting somewhere in life and having kids, are nearly impossible. Iâ€™m simply too ugly. And so, I donâ€™t want to live. But I also donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™ve attempted it, but I could never bring myself to do it all the way. I feel stuck. I just want to stay inside all day, roll up in a ball, and cry. 

This post sounds so stupid. I canâ€™t even articulate what Iâ€™m going through. I hate myself.
