I'm so aloneplease help me

no one in my life cares about me anymore. i'm too crazy. even if they care they don't care enough to work around my stpd but my abuse made me feel like i dont even deserve someone who cares that much so whats the fucking point.

everything in my life has been pain. its all been people hurting me and leaving me for things i cant help. i have so many problems, im in pain all the time, and i have no one. my own girlfriend doesnt want to listen to me anymore and shes too messed up to really give a shit. everytime i try and talk about how i need someone she mentions how shes suffering too and i cant take it anymore i cant take my emotions hurting others and being taken less seriously or just being annoying

last night i attempted and the only thing she could do was tell me she wanted to die too 

i cant do this anymore

its been 18 years of abuse and pain and suffering 

there have been too many attempts before now

i cant stop myself anymore and im scared i just want to stop feeling
