How can I change?I also posted this on r/depression, sorry if it shows up twice for you.

I am a 22 year old man. I have been depressed since I was 13 and I have been suicidal since I was 16, more so come 20. I was bullied a lot and pushed people away when I was small. Due to this and growing up in a community removed from people my age I have completely ruined the development of my social skills. For years I have had trouble with people, just talking like a functioning human being, picking up on social queues, and making eye contact with people. I have had few friends, and for a long stretch of time, probably 11-19 had none at all, physically or online. I really only have two right now and we are very infrequent in doing anything. I am overweight, some 255 lbs at 5'10-5'11. I am balding quite noticeably and have poor skin. I have never been wanted by anyone, not hugged, kissed, nothing at all. Never felt that validation and I am terrified I never will. My dad thinks me a useless failure and a freak while my mom loves me but really pities me. Their halves of the family share their views.

I am at a loss right now. I don't know how to hope but I want to. I want to be normal, to have friends, to feel loved by someone. But I can't feel happy unless someone cares for me and no one would care for me when I despise myself. I hate myself so find it hard to be consistent in weight loss, eating well &amp; exercise and always falter. I went from 290 to 235 and now I'm back up to 255. I feel like I'm stuck and if I can't un-stick myself I will die.

I need help, I need a way to break this cycle and I want to know what I can do, how I can feel loved or to care about myself enough to fix the way I look as much as I can. Please help me.
