I want to die, but dying is troublesome.I have a pretty good life, it's one that I guess most people would love to be in. I live in a safe country, good healthcare etc. etc. My family's a bit distant, but everyone's an adult with their own life. I could probably stand to talk to some of my friends more often but I often can't bring myself to chat with them. I'll linger over an open chat window, type and retype conversation starters and eventually leave it because *what if*... (they don't want to talk to me, they don't really think of me as a friend, they're just glad that they don't have to see me in school anymore, what if I'm *that person* that you dread seeing at every class reunion) and I just don't know how to talk to anyone anymore.

And the thing is, my absence doesn't make a difference in anyone's life. When I leave for uni, there's more space for everyone and all my things are used well. Nobody misses me. I stayed alone in my dorm room for a whole week once, couldn't bring myself to get up and go to class, or eat sometimes. Nobody noticed. If I disappeared the world would move on, nothing would change. 

It's stupid, I know. I feel like this over the slightest things. Our achievements (or lack thereof) in life do not define who we are as a person- I know this intellectually but every time I fail a test, don't get a call back, get brushed off/rejected *I can't shake this feeling that my existence was a mistake that should be corrected*. The people in my life would be better off not knowing me, not having known me.

I haven't killed myself yet. I'm a reasonable person- killing myself would cause complete strangers trouble. They'll have to clean up my corpse, which is really messy. The property value of the area where I died would fall. There'll be funeral costs, investigation costs (since in my country suicide is a criminal act). People will be upset because they invested in me and I haven't paid back that investment. Someone in my family is going through a milestone/large event, having a death in the family is going to detract from that. That statistically, my suicidal thoughts are just a cry for help/attention and I don't really want to die. I plan and plan but I'm too chicken of the pain- or that it wouldn't be successful enough and become even more of a burden to my family- to actually commit it.

But sometimes I also feel that this can't go on- that I can't keep living like this, a life that should never have happened in the first place. I used to think that an immediate end would be better- plan out my last day and all that. But now I feel like I should put an deadline to it- perhaps an unknown one but one that I'll know is there and it can't be stopped. I wouldn't know when it comes exactly, but that would seem more natural and it'll be less traumatising for everyone; an unfortunate quirk of health or genetics. It's not like I have much of a future, I'll just be correcting a mistake and stop using resources that could go to someone better. 

It'll take so much stress off- that I wouldn't have to think about the future when I wouldn't live past the next year. I can just focus on making sure that everyone would be fine as I slip quietly out of their lives, push them away gently so they'll forget about me. It hasn't been so difficult; people barely talk to me anymore and I don't go out to meet new people. Just my family left. Once I start on my plan, the effects would be irreversible. I wouldn't be able to back out.
