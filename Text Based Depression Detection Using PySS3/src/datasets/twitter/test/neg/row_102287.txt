I can't keep the suicidal thoughts out of my head. It's all I can think about lately. Can someone please just have a conversation with me? That's all I ask for. Just one goddamn conversation about anything to stall the aches and pains. I'm not asking for much, just a little kindness. And feel free to ask me about anything, I'll gladly answer any questions.
