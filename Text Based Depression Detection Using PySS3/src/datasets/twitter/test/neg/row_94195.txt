The melancholy is backThough I have everyone around me I feel lonely as fuck. There's no one out there for me. I wish I had someone who could listen to me and make me feel comfortable. But unfortunately I don't feel the same with my family lately. I'm too tired of this life. It has become a drudgery of its kind. :(
