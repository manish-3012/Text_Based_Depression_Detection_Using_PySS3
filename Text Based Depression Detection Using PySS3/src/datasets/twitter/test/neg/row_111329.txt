I just want to dieI don't really see a point to living anymore. I'm going to spend the rest of my life alone and friendless. I'll go to work each day and put on a good face, keep moving my career along - a career that I'm really not that suited for - and then go home to an empty house and waste time until I fall asleep.

I have no friends that I see regularly, only long distance friends. I live with my parents but I'm looking at houses right now but that's only because it's what I should do. It's the financially responsible thing to so and I don't think I could live another year with my parents.

I'm just a waste of space and resources, there's no point to my being alive anymore. I'm a disappointment to my parents even if they won't admit it to themselves. I'm just a burden on the world. I don't even want to risk passing on my fucked up brain chemistry to any children that I probably wouldn't have.

I've tried to exerciise and all that. It helped for a bit but I ended up back here. Isn't there something about everything we do - all of our choices, and actions - pretty much being determined by our genetics and past? So I'm pretty much doomed to fail any time I might try to get healthy or "EEOD." I'm a lost cause.

I've been watching and reading a lot of horror stuff lately. I guess it's because, I kind of wish that I could just get killed by some monster or ghost or whatever. It'd make things easier. Probably easier for my family too.

I'm probably going to kill myself in a few weeks. Maybe sleeping pills? It'd be kind of nice to just go to sleep an never wake up.

I'm sorry for all of the friends and family who have had to deal with my awkward, annoying, depressing, or all-of-the-above bullshit that is me. I'm sorry mom &amp; dad. I'm sorry Ali - you have good friends and a good family. You'll be ok without me. Probably better off even. You never even had to be that nice to me except because of you being my "big sister" in college.

Sorry for the incoherent ramblings. I'm half-asleep at the moment. I'm going to try to get some rest before another week of work.
