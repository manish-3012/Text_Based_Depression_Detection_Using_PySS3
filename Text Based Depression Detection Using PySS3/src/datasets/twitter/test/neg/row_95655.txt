TrollsI think their is a troll in the suicide watch subreddit, I have been talking to this lady that keeps trying to make me beleive she is real and wants to meet up someday, and marry me. I believed her because I was really sad, but now I feel like this is one elaborate trick that some guy is playing on me. I don't know, I'm really stupid, and desperate so it's not surprising that this would happen to me. I just have anxiety, and nobody really understands my anxiety, they think it's something you can switch on and off, but it's actually something that controls your entire existence. I just don't want to deal with this, I'm scared I won't be able to handle it when my "reddit girlfreind" tells me she's a 45 yr old guy, who thinks I'm cute. Or she is an actual girl that is a compulsive liar and goes around saying the same things to all the guys on suicide watch, i've read through all her reddit posts and comments, and I saw that she says similar things to other guys and tells them to message her. I don't know, I feel like an idiot.
