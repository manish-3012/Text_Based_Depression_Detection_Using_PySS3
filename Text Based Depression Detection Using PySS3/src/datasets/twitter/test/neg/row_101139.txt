Please someone just talk to meI'm so tired of either being ignored or being called a child for what I'm feeling. I just need somebody to talk to, just for tonight. Please I'm so close to speeding in my car into a bridge, none would be hurt in the process and the steering column would go straight through my chest (painless)
