So... one of my favorite rockstars blocked me on Instagram because I'm pro-suicide.I commented something on his post:  [https://www.instagram.com/p/B8nSEY3hqp\_/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8nSEY3hqp_/)  saying "As someone who's pro-suicide, I can't comment on this further". Maybe he saw it, and eventually deleted it. Then he blocked me.

Then again, why do some people find it easy to kill themselves? Wish it was easy for me too..
