What is so wrong about committing suicide (BESIDES the reactions of those close to me)?That is it. That's the only thing which keeps me from killing myself. I remember when I was a kid, I talked myself out of it because I didn't want my parents or younger siblings to find my body. Basically, committing suicide would be seen as selfish. No one cares about the misery that I struggle with every day, but my death would of course be horrible for them to deal with. They would grieve, they would be depressed, angry, etc. 

That is the only thing keeping me from killing myself. Because if I did go through with it, I would of course be subjecting everyone close to me to pain. They would be angry with me for being "selfish", they might feel guilty and think that they could have helped me, etc. I do not understand why other people like me or care about me or want to have me in their lives. It is so tiring and bizarre...maybe that sounds weird, but I don't understand it or know what to do with it.

I am so fucking tired of living my life out of convenience for other people. I don't enjoy life at all. It is very difficult for me to keep myself going. Other than other people's feelings, what is so wrong about suicide? What is so wrong about ending my existence (and my suffering)?
