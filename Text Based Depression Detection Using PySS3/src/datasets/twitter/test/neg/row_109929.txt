15 years old, sick, disabled, isolated and lonely. Why should I live?I am almost 16 years old and have spent the past 4 years sick, and the past 2 years bedridden and later housebound. I canâ€™t take part in school (even homeschool) because my mental ability is so decreased. I used to be a straight A student. I canâ€™t pursue any of my passions and I donâ€™t really have any friends. After I got sick, they never asked how I was or wanted to see me. They just forgot me and moved on with their lives. I feel terribly lonely and isolated, but I canâ€™t make any new friends. My body is too weak for me to go out or talk to people without feeling ten times more tired after.

Every day is the same as the last. Imagine having a terrible flu or mono, and it never goes away. Day after day I do nothing. The days have blurred together. I canâ€™t remember anything from earlier today, much less yesterday. Most of the time I donâ€™t know what day of the week it is, even when my mom has told me. I can ask her multiple times and not remember asking, or the answer the gave me.  

I have been in treatment for more than a year with pretty much no improvement. Even so, there is no cure for this disease. I live every day wishing to die. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Donâ€™t tell me â€˜it will get betterâ€™ because it wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to make my parents sad, but why should I live solely for someone else? Other than them, no one cares about me. Even before I got sick, I still hated myself. I hate how I look, how I sound, my personality, everything. Iâ€™ve hated myself to death since I was nine. This illness is just the icing on the cake.

I feel like I wasnâ€™t meant to be born into this world. I feel like I donâ€™t belong anywhere. I would have killed myself before I even got sick if I wasnâ€™t so scared of dying. Now I donâ€™t think I care anymore. Living is such a negative experience that it makes total sense to kill myself. When you are dead, you are not conscious, therefor it is very neutral. There is no future for me except sitting in bed sucking up my parentâ€™s hard earned money. There is nothing else here for me except suffering. Iâ€™m so tired. I want so very badly to live but I guess you donâ€™t always get what you wish for. This isnâ€™t living.
