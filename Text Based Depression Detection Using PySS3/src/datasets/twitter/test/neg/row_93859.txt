Having no one care about youHow come some people just don't get anyone that cares about them? My mom acts like she hates me, doesn't care what i do or really want to talk to me, my dad wasn't in my life for most of it and now he is he doesn't speak to me either, I dont know if he cant be bothered or whatever.


I have barely any friends and just bother them when i talk to them, and then finally when I stumbled across someone who said they cared about me, they waited just long enough until I believed it and then decided they dont want a relationship, then they do, then they told me they just want sex, then now its that they care about me but couldn't be with me. But never mind, cause I know that's not true anyway.


Soooo anyway no one cares i get it, just ranting
