HelpI can't turn my brain off and I just want it to stop. I have a constant voice in my head and it only stops when I'm on drugs or asleep and even when I'm asleep I wake up panicking. I just really really really don't want to be here anymore and the guilt of how it would affect others is always what stopped me before but I can feel that starting to fade and not be enough anymore. I just want to be at peace and I cant handle 60 more years of this
