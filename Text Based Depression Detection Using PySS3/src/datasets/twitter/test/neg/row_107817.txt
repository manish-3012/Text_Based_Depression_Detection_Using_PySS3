Suicide note for 2022I am writing this note 2 years before I actually do it, the reason being because I wouldn't want to deal with this during those 2 years. As a matter of fact, I am really doing this so I won't procrastinate this note as I think that my family deserve an explanation for my acts. 
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say either, I wish it didn't have to end up this way, I'll save you the details as I didn't plan the act out. 
I haven't been able to feel anything but sadness for the last 6 years, maybe even more than those years. I am studying to become a social worker, but I absolutely can't help people if I can't help myself, so I am literally just wasting my time, everything in my life has been a waste anyways. 
I can't help to feel this way, every damn thing in this life has gone out in the wrong path, I just hate myself, I truly wish I wasn't born. Not only myself, I also hate my egotistical boyfriend who thinks he knows what I need and how to cheer me up. I hope you live long, X, but listen to your girlfriends next time and be more patient with people. I hate everybody around me because nobody takes me seriously and I am never listened to no matter how much I try to be heard. I feel like I am the ....

But as much as I would like to express myself, nobody, not even my loved ones would bother to read this note. They'd just ask themselves for years why  I would do such a thing. Why bother explaining.

Anyways, I don't know how to end this note, also don't ask why I am giving myself 2 years, I jeed to sort some things out before I die, and that is not any of your business, you should've listened when I was still there.

So, forgive me and bye. 
I love you KIRLMM.
