Gets worse every yearHappy New Year

2016 has pushed me over the edge, I barely got out. In my experience it gets worse and worse each year. I thought that I wouldn't make it out of 2016, I did but I don't think I will make it further. The pain won't end and I just hate myself and my life as a person. I feel like just the first week of 2017 is going to push me to say goodbye to this world, and I already know what's coming ahead of me and I don't think I can take it. I held on for so long after people saying it would get better, It did not, no matter how much I tried to hold on and improve at life. I don't think I'll experience much of this new year..
