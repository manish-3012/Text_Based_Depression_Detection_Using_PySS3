I am a failure.This is the first time i am doing something like this, so in advance, I apologize for any mistake that I make.

I am 18years old.

I had once been the perfect child, perfect grades, perfect relationship with my parents and siblings. As I grew older, everything changed. 

My grades dropped lower than ever, I became a stranger not only to people who knew me but also to myself.

I grew up in the most amazing environment and in a very wonderful and healthy family. And after each and every screw up I had, I was still understood and supported.. my family was always there for me.

I first started self harming when I was 15, I don't know why I did it but when I did, I know it made me feel better. I have tried to kill myself several times.. I've never talked to a therapist, and all these was done without the awareness of my family. For all they know, I was just a very moody teenager.

I don't really know what is it that I am feeling nor do I know how to express it.

I have done so many things that have made my loved ones worry and cry.. and each time, I tell myself I will do better, but after everything, I become numb and just continue on becoming a worse version of myself. This cycle keeps repeating on and on and on, until I become a monster. I am afraid of the person I am turning into. My life is deteriorating before my eyes, and what keeps me awake at night is that I don't seem to care at all.

Even as I am typing this, the whirlpool of feelings that plagued me just a few minutes ago have become faint..

I plan to kill myself when I get home during the summers, I don't want anyone in my university handling my body. This is selfish of me, I am aware of it, but I also know that if I continue living as I am doing now, the support and love I receive from people will soon exhaust. I want to die a very loved person. With what little conscience that I have now, I have made this decision and I don't think anything or anyone will change my mind.

People are going to wonder why I did it, my parents are going to wonder where they went wrong, my siblings are going to wonder if it is their fault. The truth won't be ever be revealed to them, but I am writing this hoping that there is someone out there who will read this and remember the thoughts and feelings of a stranger.

I am sorry if you are unable to understand what I wrote, I did my best but English is not my first language. I still have a few months of living, but I consider this to be my suicide note; I am sorry if you think that I am a stupid person, but it took me a very long time to come to this conclusion. I am sorry if you think that I am making a selfish decision, I am a very firm Christian, and me coming to this decision even after loving Christ and knowing that I will spend an eternity in hell, was not at all an easy choice to make.

I just hope that God will forgive me, my parents will forget the pain (I know they will, I am not a very special person) and that my siblings will have a very fulfilling and happy life.
