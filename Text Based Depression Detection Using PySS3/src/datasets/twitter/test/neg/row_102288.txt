"Not giving a way out is the most incompassionate act a human can commit"I stand by this statement

I think people should be given a quick, painless and peaceful way out. There are many people whose lives are pointless

Perhaps prescribe a worldwide "Angelic Pill", or give one\-way tickets into forests where you somehow kill yourself in exchange of yourself as fertilization to trees

Nothing personal, no one deserves to die, everyone deserves to live. But if someone really wants to die, then they must have very valid reasons, as hard as it is for me to say this
