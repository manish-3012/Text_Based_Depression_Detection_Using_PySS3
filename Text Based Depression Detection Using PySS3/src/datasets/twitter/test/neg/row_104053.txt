Everyone only thinks about themselvesEveryone only thinks of themselves I have run out of options. Now itâ€™s time for me to think about myself and whatâ€™s best for me, and I believe thatâ€™s to end my life. 

I have reached out time and time again and I have been made to feel awful each time I do that I shouldnâ€™t bare that burden on anyone else. Last night I needed help I needed support and I was left alone stranded with no help, people just left me when I needed them most and made things worst. I know me being like this helps no one but they donâ€™t understand how hard it is, I know it makes people sad but Iâ€™m reaching out a bit of sadness is a small price to pay to help someoneâ€™s life. 

But itâ€™s doesnâ€™t matter anymore last night was the last straw as things are getting worst for me. Goodbye everyone Iâ€™m sorry for being selfish.
