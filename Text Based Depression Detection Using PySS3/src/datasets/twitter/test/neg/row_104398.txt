What reason do I have left to live?I have no one. Let me expand upon that. There are people in my life who love and care about me. And I feel nothing for them, and I don't know why. If my parents and siblings disappeared I wouldn't care. I've been desperately desperately trying to make a friend over the past few years. And so many times, I have come close to succeeding. And then it devolves into romantic attraction. I just want a platonic friendship but can't achieve this. I've tried so many times now and it just keeps failing. So, I have no one. And while I don't mind having no one for the short term, it's the long term that makes me want to end my life. Because my situation keeps on repeating itself and still after all these years, I am alone.
