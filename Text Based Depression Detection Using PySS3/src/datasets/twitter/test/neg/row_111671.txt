life sucks yo.im 29, i have had bad luck my entire life, which led to depression, maybe depression led to bad luck, nothing for hte past 10 years has went right. not a single thing. evil woman that destroyed me emotionally, drugs would make me feel better for a day or 2 then depression would come back. i have been on every anti depressant known to man, i just feel like im stuck with cancer around me that keeps leading to it. My parents try to help most of the time. they were the ones that got me arrested for a driving while suspended after my girlfriend kicked me out in the middle of winter and i had nowhere to go. 
SO here i am now, i have an awesome girlfriend, but the bad luck just keeps going. wrongfully garnished shit, my parents got me a pos truck, Point A to point B. it lasted me 2 weeks and just wont start, threw a rod. so i beat the fuck out of every panel on it and had a melt down in the middle of the street. i dont know what to do. i have been walking for 3 years back and forth to work, and of course, my parents swoop in after all this shit, and give me a gift that lasts 2 weeks. of course it would only last 2 weeks. if it lasted any longer i might have been happy and made it out of my slump. 

i really want a reason not to kill myself. i love my new girlfriend, shes great, but its 1 little beacon amongst so much cancer and bad shit. fuck me.
