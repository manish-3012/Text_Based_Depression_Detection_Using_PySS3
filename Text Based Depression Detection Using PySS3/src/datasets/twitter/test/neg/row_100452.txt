My anxiety torments me no matter what I do.Sorry if this is a bit incoherent- I took some xanax and benadryl earlier to sleep through my problems.


Anyhoo, I've been having a real hard time lately. I wake up and immediately wish I were dead. I'm talking to a therapist but that's slow going. I've fount Generalized Anxiety Disorder for about 6 and a half years. I have fought it through therapy and medication but no matter what I  do, I find myself back in the same place. I freak over the simplest things. I'm tired of living this way. I took some xanax and a bit too much benadryl so I didn't have to experience this day. All my friends are busy and my boyfriend apparently can't be bothered to respond to my texts. All I really wanted was to not be alone tonight so I didn't feel compelled to hurt myself- too late.

I don't know entirely why I'm posting this. I just want to not be wracked with anxiety no matter what I do. Maybe some sympathy that my friends are too busy to provide could help.
