6/4/19I don't know how people write suicide letters and I don't want to think that there's. A method to it. My life isn't amazing, but it's not for the fault of others. Mt name is Â  son of , a man who's greatness knows no bounds. A man who strives for greatness even to this very day in his retirement age 
A man whom I've let down
My mother is one of the few people I know who is guaranyeed a spot in heaven. She is an inspiration to which my pathetic life has been a parasite to for far too long and I need to rid myself from her precense. Honestly, I act like everything is fine, but since 5tth grade I've bottled emotions and every day has been rinse and repeat. I even recently had a therepist which I've dropped under the pretense of lack of money which isn't a truth. I drink a d smoke kine I deserve it but 6/4/19 will.Â  Be the day I rid the world of another parasite. I. Will do something that has needed to be done for a long time and to say it feelss so good. I know a lot of you will care about another stranger but tbst is from your own internal goodness in your souls. I have not one. I only deserve what God sees fit a d the rest of my life as a pathetic shell of what I am remajns. Every breath feels labored. Every thought feels the same. I apologize when I shouldn't, my being here doesn't feel right. All my friends a d everyone I know has become something and I have become nlthi g but a fake depressed shell.. But I will do dkmethj g right for the first time in aong time. I will relieve the bjrdon that doesn't know its there. 6/4/19. I'm sorry.
