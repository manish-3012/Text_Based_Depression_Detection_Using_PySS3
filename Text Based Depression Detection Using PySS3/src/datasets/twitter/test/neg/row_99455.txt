People like me deserve hell.I want to be a good kid.  It is hard to connect with people because so my past.  I've been prescribed anonymous (to my knowledge) medication since I was 8.  8 year olds should not be suicidal in my opinion.  I hate people with a passion yet I crave their approval 24/7.  It is all I can think about.  I'm so angry at the world for what it has done to me.  Sometimes I thrash out at people that seem to have nothing to live for, just so they could go into a state of high-and-mighty that would allow them to end my life.  So far it has not worked.    This makes me laugh, as if I could survive prison, thriving off hurting others that may deserve it.  I don't think I'm a badass, don't get me wrong.  I just really DO NOT CARE.  The problem is that being self aware that I am a psychopath puts an incredible strain upon my life.  I am possibly horrible to my coworkers wich I regret everytime I clock out from work.  I feel so ashamed every time I try to be "myself" around my brother or his friends.  It is hard for me to connect with people.  I want to connect with people emotionally, yet when it comes to any social situation it seems to be out of the social norm.  I hate myself with a passion.  I want to kill myself so badly but I know it would destroy my family.  On the other hand, if I keep on living it is possible I may destroy other lives in the process.  Sometimes I cannot sleep unless I think of way I could take someones life and get away with it.  Like a heroin dealer that destroys lives either way.  Maybe I ill not have a point, but I will have a good reason.  Stuff like this has been ongoing.  I was a bit of an insiomiac for about 2 years until I figured out how to change my thoughts of resenting myself into something as simple as taking the lives of scumbags.   Being self-aware of my lunacy is still hard.  Though 1 lunatic 1 ice pick had me aroused, I still do not want to hurt anyone.  I just want to know there is such thing as help for people like me.   I am a sick and depraved person, yet I am aware and disgusted by this fact.  I don't know if there is room for people like me in this world.  I don't want to hurt anyone, but I may do it just to feel a bit better.  I cannot become the next Jeffrey Daumier.   

If there is any hope please tell me... 

UPDATE:  Thank you all for your kind words.  It really means a lot to me that you would take the time to help a random kid on the internet.  Sorry it took so long to update, I had to help my dad take some crap to the dump today.  This subreddit is really amazing and so are all of you.  I just needed someone other than my therapist to confide in.  I'm going to work on using my relationship with her to sort out the very serious issues I'm still embarrassed about.  Felt great to get some things off my chest, I can't thank you enough :).
