I think about you all as i drift off to sleep.Know that i, a completely random stranger at the university of arizona, care about you, wherever you may be and whatever you have gone through. i hope the love i feel for you makes a difference, because the title of this post is true. i read this page every day, and every night before i fall asleep, i pray for you individually. i am always here if you ever wanna chat (food is a good subject for me:P). i wish you all clear judgement and nothing but the best each day. and i truly do love you.
