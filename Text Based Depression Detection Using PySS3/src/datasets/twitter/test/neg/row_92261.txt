I just want someone to talk to.I just want someone to talk to. Please. This is a cry for help, and I don't know where else to go. I've tried reaching out to people before, but nothing's changed. I've tried reaching out to friends, family, and others, but I don't feel like there's anyone I can talk to who will listen and understand right now. I have never felt so disconnected from myself, my friends, my family, my community, and my environment. If life is about people and relationships, I think I've failed: I don't feel like I've ever had a meaningful relationship or friendship with anyone. If I'm honest, I am afraid to talk to someone, because in my experience, people either underreact or overreact. If I decided I wanted to commit suicide today, I'm not sure who I would be able to talk to. I don't want to want to kill myself, and I don't think I want to, but there's not a day that goes by where it doesn't cross my mind. This is a cry for help. Please, I just want someone to talk to.
