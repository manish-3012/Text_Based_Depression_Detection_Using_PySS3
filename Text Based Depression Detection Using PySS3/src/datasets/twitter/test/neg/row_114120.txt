My friend left me todayToday my friend told me on skype she's leaving, and she's not coming back, we had a 3 hour long with our other online friends call, but when she said goodbye I just broke down in tears and I tried to make her stay but she didn't.

I don't have any friends in the real world, and the other online friends I have in skype hardly talk to me. She helped through all the hard times and I helped her with her issues. I do have a past of suicidal thoughts and her leaving is starting to push me toward it.

I just can't take life and it's heartbreak anymore
