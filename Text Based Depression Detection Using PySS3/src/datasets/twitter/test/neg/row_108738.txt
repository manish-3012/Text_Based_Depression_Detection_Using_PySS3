I'm a horrible person that deserves deathLast night, I was told by my closest friends that my ex had been traumatized by a sexual encounter we had that I thought was 100% consensual. The experience wasn't good for me either as she did some stuff that I am still fucked up about but that doesn't excuse the fact that she still feels horrible from that. I understand what I was doing and I take full responsibility for it. I set up a new therapy appointment, I have plans to talk to family about it and I've been keeping my closest friends posted about my current status as to avoid self harming or worse. I just don't know how to live with myself knowing this and I feel like the world would be better off without me so I don't have to hurt anyone ever again. I feel like a liability to all those around me and I just don't want to interact with anyone again knowing this now. I can't do it
