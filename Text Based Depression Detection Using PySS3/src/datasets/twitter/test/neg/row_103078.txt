I'm going to kill myself tonight.I've had a week long break from school and today is the last day. During the break, I experienced the most amazing thing. It was at the top of my bucket list, the thing I wanted most in life. Now it's over and it will never happen again. But that's not what is making me want to kill myself. I've been depressed for nearly nine years and suicidal for seven years. I've seen 8 psychologists/psychiatrists and been on medication for three years. It's never going to get better. In fact, it will only get worse. 
School starts again tomorrow and I can't take it anymore. Every day feels like an eternity. I can't take it anymore. I'm done. 
So, I'm going to end it tonight. I've experienced the most amazing thing that will ever happen to me in my life, so I think I can die happily now.
