Iâ€™m scared to admit that Iâ€™m suicidal.I have never had these thoughts before. They past 5 month at least have been rough for me mentally I have gone through so much stress shit before but now Iâ€™ve actually caught myself considering suicide as a option. My problems Iâ€™ve been having arenâ€™t even that serious so Iâ€™m embarrassed to even thinking this way. I fail my all college classes in semester because I canâ€™t find a way to even move forward anymore. 

This has even caused me to ruin my relationship with a girl I love more than I ever have anyone. Sheâ€™s such a good person but Iâ€™ve been too scared to even tell her. She took me back but tonight I broke down again like before and Iâ€™m fearing Iâ€™ve caused the same thing to happen.

Everyone in my life is always pushing me to be the best. To achieve something great. Iâ€™ve gone for that my whole life but now Iâ€™m letting everyone I love down. I even lied to my own parents saying I just missed the sign up dates for college this next semester cause I just canâ€™t go through that again. Now I feel like I canâ€™t go through even another day again, and that feeling gets worse everyday.

I never saw a day where Iâ€™d be posting on reddit saying all of this but now Iâ€™m here. I donâ€™t know what to do. Please please help me
