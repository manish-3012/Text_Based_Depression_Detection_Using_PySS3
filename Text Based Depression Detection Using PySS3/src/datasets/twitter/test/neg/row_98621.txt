Im not even sad anymore but I still want to die.I just want to die. Life is too tiring for me and i dont see a point in living.


Even if life is happy and good, i still dont see a point in living, im at a point where my thoughts are basically like


'if i die i wouldnt have to care about anything, i wouldnt have to worry about my family/friends who would feel sad about my death, i wouldnt care if i miss out on the happy things in life because im already dead, right?' 


If someone were to ask me why i want to die, i hate to admit this but i genuinely feel that I dont know anymore, i dont know what is it about life thats making me wanna die, im super confused, i just need a huge break, or a forever-break from life, i dont feel like doing anything anymore. I dont think im stressed or tired. I dont know if this is due to my hormones, but i just dont see a point in living, i just want to not exist.
