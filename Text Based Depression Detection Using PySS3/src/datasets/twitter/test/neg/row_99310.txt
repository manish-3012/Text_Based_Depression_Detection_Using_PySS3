im about there againim so tired. im so over it. i cant even explain myself. hes done with me. for real. and im alone. i have no friends here. im stranded while hes home with all the support he needs. i just want to die. im alone now. and now i have to tell my abusive father hes gone. again. i dont know how to live without having someone to tell how i feel and be loved. i spent 250 dollars on a plane ticket for the first week of november. now all i can do is go down there and stay with friends and get high and be sad about him. if im there for that.
