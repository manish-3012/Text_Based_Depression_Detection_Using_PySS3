EmptyThey say find friends that make you happy, but no one does. They say find a hobby that you enjoy, but they all are boring. Look for the good things in life, but every thing reminds me of better times. I'm not poor or in a rough patch but I feel so numb. If I complain they say I have it good. Why shouldn't I do it? They will miss you. Why do they get to be selfish and keep me here to suffer. My heart is a TV with only static, feeling nothing, I want to turn it off since it's beating for nothing. I always feel like crying, but feel too empty. I'll die anyways so why not end it early? The world will keep moving whether I'm alive or not so why does it matter. Everything is repeating pushing me into a deeper depression. Good things may come but I'll have to pick up a lot more bad to carry. The only time I feel true happiness is when I imagine sliting my wrist and letting the pain slip out.
