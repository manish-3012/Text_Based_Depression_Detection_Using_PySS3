I can't keep living in 2018 anymore.Everybody here hates me and they're probably right to do so. I can't fit in with the world anymore. It seems like sanity is an increasingly rare trait. I hate what the Internet has done for us (yes, I'm aware of the irony I'm using it to communicate with you). I have no idea what's going to happen us, but I know it's going to be hideous and scary. How I wish and I pray that I had the privilege of being alive during the 60s/70s/80s. Obviously they were very different times from now, and I'm not for one moment implying they were better than now... but they would have been better for me. I don't know what happened to us. I wish I was dead and I deserve it.
