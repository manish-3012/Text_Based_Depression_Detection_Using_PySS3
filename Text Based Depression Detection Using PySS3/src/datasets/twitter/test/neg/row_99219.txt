26 years old, 5â€™4â€, 88 pounds. I canâ€™t force anyone to hire me, so Iâ€™m starving to death.I commented on someoneâ€™s post just now and related to the empty apartment, job rejections (300 for me), etc. My apartment is so bare that Iâ€™ve had neighbors ask where my couch and wall decorations are. Well, there are none because I canâ€™t afford to live.
