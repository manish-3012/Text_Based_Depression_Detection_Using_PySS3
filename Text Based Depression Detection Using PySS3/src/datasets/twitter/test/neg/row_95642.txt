Title.Hey. I didn't bother reading much (any) of these other posts to see how this works or anything. So I'm just gonna say what's on my mind. And it's impossible to type what I'm actually feeling, but. I'm 24. I haven't *really* had a bad life I guess. And I now live with good friends. But I've been dealing with depression and anxiety that I inherited from one side of the family. I used to look in the mirror and worry about problems I'd have in the future and tell myself those things aren't worth worrying about because I'll have killed myself by then anyway. Not in a really emotional way. Just a fact. I got medication. It works. I talk more, I am more outgoing, I go out with friends more. And I've had positive feedback. But my urge to, ya know, kill myself, has not gone away. In fact, medication has made me feel more hopeless. Like this isn't a real problem I can solve. Like I can't get this feeling of existential and emotional exhaustion out of my brain.
