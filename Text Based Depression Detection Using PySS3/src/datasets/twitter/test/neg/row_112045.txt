Please I need somebody to talk to meI'm so alone in an unwelcoming home, I was just diagnosed with another painful chronic illness, and just like the one I already had, there is no cure.

My only friend is my boyfriend and he is absolutely tired of me and my problems, and I don't blame him. I am across the country from any other family or friends, not that my family would help me in a time like this anyway.

I'm 19 years old. I've been homeless, starving, abused, sexually assaulted hundreds of times. I am a hollow shell of a human being.

All I want to do right now is self harm. I'm begging for help before I hurt myself worse than I already have tonight. I'm home alone where no one can stop me. 

My roommates have a rifle and it would take me under 15 minutes to steal it and kill myself on the mountainside where nobody would know, and nobody would have to see or clean my body.
