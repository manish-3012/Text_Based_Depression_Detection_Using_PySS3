no one takes my pain seriously, everyone thinks I'm exaggeratingi brought it all upon myself. 'm starting to think, possibly realize that it is impossible to redeem myself. it's terrifying to know that's possibly the truth &amp; i'm just in denial. nothing i say or do matters, the end seems to be the same, or worse. 

i've had issues with wanting attention from others since I was 3 or 4 years old. it's only gotten worse since then, and while I seem to have been able to improve my behavior, I keep getting myself into shit because of my stupidity &amp; dissociation.

someone saw me writing my suicide note &amp; smiling and immediately assumed it was for attention

it was because i was fucking happy to finally write out something that i'll need before catching the bus
