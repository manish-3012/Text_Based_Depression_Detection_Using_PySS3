DisappointingIâ€™m a disappointment. Nothing stands out about me, Iâ€™m short, unauthentic, stupid, I canâ€™t make friends, Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life. My sisters already got into her dream college and had plans for her future, straight Aâ€™s, and Iâ€™m a lazy piece of shit thatâ€™s failing school. Iâ€™ve known where the gun cabinet is but the idea just came into my head. Honestly Iâ€™m just writing this to stall, in reality Iâ€™m really scared of death but Iâ€™m more scared of living my life.
