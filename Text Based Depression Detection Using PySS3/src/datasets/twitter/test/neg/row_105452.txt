Please talk me out of these thoughtsI used to be a model, traveling to Europe and New York and LA all the time.

I used to think getting out of the industry would make it better.

So I did. Then I thought money could make it better. Today I earn well over six figures working for myself.

Then a relationship. Iâ€™m depressed in my relationship. Iâ€™m depressed outside of it. The antidepressants are only doing so much.

My parents have a lot of guilt over letting me get assaulted by a doctor over and over again as a kid. Theyâ€™ve apologized but wonâ€™t talk about it with me. The doctor has since died of natural causes; there is no justice.

Nothing makes it better. I drink too much. I have too much sex. Then the pain comes back.

I have everything, and people remind me of that. But still I feel empty. I want it to be over. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family or my boyfriend, but itâ€™s getting harder to resist the urge to end it all. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Someone, please talk me out of this. My therapist and psychiatrist are doing their best, but I think Iâ€™m broken beyond repair.
