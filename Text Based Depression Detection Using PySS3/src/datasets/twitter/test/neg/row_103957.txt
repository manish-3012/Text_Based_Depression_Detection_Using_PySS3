Too lazy to kill myselfSpent the last 20 years of my life just shambling about, havent spoken to anyone outside of essential contact like work, never made friends because I dont see the point and it seems like so much work. I do everything to the exact bare minimum to balance out effort / consequences. Have no empathy or concern for anyone around me, nor myself and have no desire to. Ive got no special talents or dreams, just a constant annoyed feeling that I have to do anything. If Starving / dehydration or homelessness wasnt so much more effort than a regular existence I would have stayed on the street and sat it out till I died. All I want to do all dy is spend as much time asleep as possible, even if it means not eating until it gets annoying.  Thought that if thats really all I want then theres a better way to do it.

Ive been telling myself today is the day for the last 12 years and Ive never mustered the energy to do it. Closest Ive got it is slicing my carotid artery with a knife I happened to have at the time, but started thinking halfway through about how much effort it is to actually slice that deep, so ended up with a huge cut and nothing to show.  Is there a method which doesnt involve me leaving the house to get any supplies, that are also reasonably low pain / effort? 

Dunno what im expecting with this just felt like posting it somewhere to get an answer or just to have posted it.
