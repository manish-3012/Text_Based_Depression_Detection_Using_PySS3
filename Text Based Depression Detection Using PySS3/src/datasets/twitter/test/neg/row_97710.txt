Should I just end it?Hello

I am a high school junior with a depressing GPA of 0.78, I am so lost I just want to hang myself and end it. I have a hom and a family but I'm always dependent on others like tutors and friends when I started school. I stopped getting a tutor as it costed too much.My friends don't talk to me anymore since I'm in a super competitive school. I'm not going to make it in life, what do I do? I'm not telling anyone I know in real life as I haven't yet.
