It really is getting too muchThought I'd gotten over this shit in high school, but here I am, 2nd year into my bachelors degree and fuck, it's all rushing back to me more than I've ever experienced. Don't even know why, too much shit at once I guess. Sick of seeing who I am but not strong enough to change. That's it. I'm done.
