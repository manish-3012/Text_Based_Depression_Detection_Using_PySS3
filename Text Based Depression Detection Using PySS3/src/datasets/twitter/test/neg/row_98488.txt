I think iâ€™m going nutsIâ€™ve been thinking about a lot of stuff thatâ€™s been happening in my life and so far Iâ€™ve only known fear and pain so far my dad has been hanging stuff over me head and if I breath wrong at school I get in big trouble and he makes things WAY bigger than they were supposed to be all I want is one month ONE FUCKEN MONTH without fearing for my wellbeing I cannot even see a car thatâ€™s looks remotely looks like his and shit myself looking over the whole day thinking I did something wrong and if I were to give him a piece of my mind he would say that it â€œhurt my feelingsâ€ Iâ€™m sick of his shit Iâ€™m sick of sleepless nights Iâ€™m sick of pain
