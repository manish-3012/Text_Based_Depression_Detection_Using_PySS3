Everyone hates me and I can't take it anymoreIt is so clear how worthless I really am and how I need to just end myself. I keep fucking up and forgetting to do shit at my job because of my severe anxiety and constant panic attacks. Keep dropping shit and can't even talk clearly. I'm not on any meds or anything. I can't do this shit sober. Maybe I should start packing alcohol with me. I need something to calm down. I am currently on my lunch break crying. I hate my life and myself so much.
