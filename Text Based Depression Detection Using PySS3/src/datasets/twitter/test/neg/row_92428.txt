I'm desperate for a change , terrified it won't change, suicide is a solution if it doesn't .I'm an 18 year old girl who is trapped in my house, who cant take homeschool classes anymore cause dad cant pay , who constantly hears mom and dad fighting over money issues and mom is gonna leave dad soon and dad is in denial so he pretends everything is fine and puts on a fake smile. who drinks pain away.  my sister is suicidal aswell and always attempts suicide and even has a suicide note all ready. I have No friends ,. (at least friends i can hang with in real life) i only have online friends cause im not allowed to leave my house to go anywhere. I just want a normal life where i can have friends , and get to leave my house on a daily basis. I want to actually LIVE . I dont want to go on in this EXCUSE of a life. Im terrified im stuck here forever. Its been years like this and i am wasting away. I need change,  HOW? If this doesn't change, im DONE And leaving this world thati didnt get even to experience much :( i just want a normal life
