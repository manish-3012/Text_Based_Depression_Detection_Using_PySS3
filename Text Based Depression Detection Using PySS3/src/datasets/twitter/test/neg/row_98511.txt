Where do we go from here my friendI feel like my mind is deteriorating. I don't have any friends and my girlfriend left me after several years, which I thought would never end. I have decided to buy a motorcycle with the money I've saved from work to see if that will allow me to enjoy life a bit more. I always worked on bikes in my early teens and rode them a little, but now my friend is selling me his clean CBR for dirt.  
I can't stop the suicidal thoughts though, I don't know if my method of stopping it will work. I want to ride the bike through the mountains and through the farmlands around here. I'll also ride it to school and work.  
I can't figure out how to see a therapist as I don't know if my insurance covers it and I'm not willing to ask. I'm curious as to if anyone has tried this kind of thing. I've also thought about traveling but I don't think that's really possible.  
Otherwise I think I'm out of options. I honestly feel like my personality has disappeared and I don't know if that shows in this writing.  
This is a throwaway.
