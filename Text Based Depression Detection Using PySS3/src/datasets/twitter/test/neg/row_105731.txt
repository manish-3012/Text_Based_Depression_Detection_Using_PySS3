I really really hate it hereLast night I was watching a show called Ray Donovan , it's about this gangster guy who eventually loses his wife to cancer but while she's dying from it he's cheating and doing all kinds of fucked up shit and as it turns out , can't deal with her death at all. 

while watching it , I thought about how big of a monster this guy is and how terrible I feel for his deceased wife and all that sentimental TV jazz . eventually, I don't know how, I started to think that maybe terrible things keep happening to me because I'm the monster. Maybe I'm just so terrible a person that I really do deserve all the heaviness and hurt that I've been served and maybe I the fact that I've not been able to die after having tried a lot , is a real 'psych' moment from life . the hell of it is waking up the next day , making it out alive to see another day and having to find reason's to really live . 

I feel like I'm stuck in a loop and really I just want to die, I want to die. I only want to die but I can't seem to and I'm not sure why
