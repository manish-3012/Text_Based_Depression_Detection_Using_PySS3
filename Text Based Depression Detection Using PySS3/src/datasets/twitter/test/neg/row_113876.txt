I cannot believe how much I changed.I just want to confide myself, It can be complex to read and follow but Iâ€™m full to my throat, I cannot fight anymore.

I do not know where to start, I guess I need to start from somewhere.

My father and mother divorced when I was 4, this was not a big deal till I start to elementary school, all of my friendsâ€™ family was happy and together, while my father was having fun with his Russian girlfriends and wasnt caring about me. I seek for a father figure till then, I admit that my father helped me a lot in case of a financial help but never in emotional way, he always compared me with my cousins and told me that he wished I would be like them, at least he could feel the feeling of a son. We barely talked and all of them were about my financial needs, nothing else. Also, he shamed me because of my feminine soul, annnnddd, Iâ€™m still having problems with talking with boys as you know, Iâ€™m insecure about myself, because of that son of a bitch.

Iâ€™m afraid of expressing my feelings too; you know, people would make fun of me, laugh at me when I tell them what Iâ€™m thinking. Because of this fear, Iâ€™ve become a liar, I lie about my feelings, my fears and ideas. Just to protect myself from hatred and jokes. I even hide my sexual orientation from everyone. In fact, Iâ€™m bisexual but as you would guess, I pretend to be a straight. I hide my sexual experiences with guys, even from my current girlfriend. Only my best friends know this and it hurts me. 

Another thing is, I hate my country, I live in Turkey and Iâ€™m really sick of this ugly country. Everytime I open the news, I see different kind of rape, assault, abuse and our dictatorâ€™s shitty talks. I just canâ€™t handle this, I cannot believe that people can be that bad, it depresses me. Literally everything in this country. Our dying economy, our asshole president, shitty citizens. EVERYTHING. Iâ€™m really tired of thinking about my future, Iâ€™m really tired of this anxiety. 

Thereâ€™s a lot of that I did not mentioned but you know, confessing all those things to someone, and even myself started to hurt me. 

Briefly, I missed the old me; I was cheerful, funny and happy person. I used to spread happiness to all around me, I was strong enough to hide my problems and deal with them. I had a will to live, at least more than today. But currently, I lostâ€™em all. I act really bad towards the people around me, I delay all my programs, trying to escape from my responsibilities and avoid to talk with people, even my precious mom. I had never been thought about suicide in my life but now, Iâ€™m considering it sometimes and cannot help it. I want to live but Iâ€™m not strong enough to do so. There are people who is having worse things than mine and Iâ€™m still complaining about myself. Iâ€™m a mess, Iâ€™m just a weak ass. I do not deserve to be alive.
