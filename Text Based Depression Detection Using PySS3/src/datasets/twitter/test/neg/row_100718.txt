Suicidal Friend ran away from home and contacted me. What do?We met at a depression treatment center and I know that she's been in other ones like it before. She got out a little while after I was admitted. She recently just contacted me saying that she ran away from home because her parents were "over controlling, kinda abusive, etc". We're both 17 year old females. I've only been friends with her for a couple of months but considering what we went through together we were really close. What should I tell her? How can I support her but not make it seem like I'm becoming an overbearing parent? I think that she should find a stable environment to live and continue going to school and at least finish high school because in my opinion without a high school diploma you are screwed for the future. Any advice would be appreciated. **tl;dr Suicidal friend runs away from home and contacts me. What do?**
