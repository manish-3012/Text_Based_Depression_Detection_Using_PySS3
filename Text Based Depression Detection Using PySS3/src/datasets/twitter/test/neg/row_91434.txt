I might die soonI feel guilty feeling happy about this but I found out I might have a heart problem because of my bulimia and I might not have a super long time to live. I know I shouldnâ€™t be happy about that and Iâ€™m not but at the same time Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression my whole life, Iâ€™ve been hospitalized multiple times, seen multiple counselors, on all types of medicine and nothing ever worked. I even asked for shock treatment but they said because of the type of depression I have it wouldnâ€™t work. And Iâ€™m too much of a coward to kill myself. So there might be a light at the end of this tunnel you know. Anyway I appreciate that this was always a safe place to say stuff thank you and I finally feel soon I might have peace.
