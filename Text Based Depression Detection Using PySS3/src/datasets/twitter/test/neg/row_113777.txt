Feeling seriously trapped and depressedI don't know where to begin. I'm a 19 year old girl living in a first world country, which should be good enough, right? But no.
My family life is in shambles because of a whole bunch of reasons involving my dad's constant paranoia, and all I hear every day from him is how much debt we're in or how we're going to lose our house. I'm still in school working a minimum wage job in retail which sucks. I barely ever talk to my friends anymore. I don't partake in any of my hobbies anymore. I just watch YouTube videos and play with my cat.

My relationship with my boyfriend was the only thing helping me keep myself together, but now, for absolutely no reason, he's completely ignoring me. We didn't fight in months, and we've been together for nearly two years, in a long distance relationship. I've been so happy because I thought I would finally be able to see him, but I guess not. Despite my begging and plwading, he still won't respond. I think he blocked my phone number too. This is the guy that I literally thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. We worked together so well. I don't know how to live my life anymore. I feel like all I am is a shell of a human being, just the butt of every joke for being "smol and shy and cute". I don't feel like a person anymore. I just feel really numb. 

I really just want to die. I don't think I'll ever do it, I love my family and my cat too much. But I can't stop thinking about doing it.
