I only need $15k (give or take) for treatment, otherwise I see no other optionJesus fucking christ, it sucks to fucking be in poverty and let finances control your life. I want treatment for my addiction and depression/psychiatric illnesses. 

I know a place I have been to before, with the best doctors and staff and best programs. its only $15k for a week inpatient program. Why can't I have this? I truly see this as my last hope. I think these are the only people who can help me. But I dont have the funds for it.

im about to turn 28 and I have been laying in bed in my parents house for years, I can't do this any longer. I really want to take things seriously, but I'm not going to be able to do that without very good psychiatric treatment and a new environment, and that only thing holding me back is money.

There is no way im going to let myself live my 30s like this again. I can't and if, eventually, death is the only way out, then so be it
