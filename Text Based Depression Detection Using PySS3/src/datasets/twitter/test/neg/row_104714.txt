ConfusedHappiness is overrated.

Why do we have this guiltiness if we're not happy? Sometimes I feel indulgent in my depression, like I could drink it the same way an alcoholic does.

It's as though the gravity of life calls to me when I feel this way.

I feel like I can't connect to other people - I can't stand them. But when I'm alone, I feel so bored and hopeless - I can't even move.

Why do I fall into this limbo?

It's as though each moment is so precious, and yet so pointless - the realization of each second is so dramatic, it's debilitating. It's as though these thoughts stab into my mind and pin it against the wall and if I try to get away then they cut into me.
I have a good career job - but every day I am staring into a screen. Every hour I think, "X dollars -" to what, to rent, to what...


Are we scared that we'll never own property?

Is it simply that we realize we live in a slavery society?


Is our depression not just an honest awareness at this sham of existence?
Or even more, is it the lack of extremely deep connections? The realization of one's bias, and that so many are not self-aware, and so autopilot with things that DON'T FUCKING MATTER.

Or that people take the idea of emotions and they fucking put them on a pedestal, as though art was God, and of course THEY were the artist.

This self-righteousness is overwhelming.

I wish we lived in a different society.

One where loneliness wasn't even stronger around a crowd of people.
