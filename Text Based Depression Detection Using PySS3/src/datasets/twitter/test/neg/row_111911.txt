COVID makes me feel like life is no longer worth livingSeriously, what's the fucking point anymore? It's clear as day that life isn't going to go back to normal any time soon and more than likely this pandemic will last for another few years. I'm just beyond sick and tired of feeling disconnected from everyone and everything, I miss my friends, I miss being able to go to the shops without it being a hassle and I just miss being able to go outside without having to worry about social distancing. I just want this shit to be over and over soon but it looks like it's not going to happen. I'm wondering to myself is life even worth living anymore? I honestly don't think so anymore, I'm seriously resisting the urge to hang myself now because I fear that life will never be how it was before. I'm just so fucking pissed off and I've had enough of this fucking virus. I honestly feel like killing myself is a better alternative to living in a reality where COVID is still present.
