quietudeive reached a somewhat peaceful place from all the rage of life, in planning my own death. it will not come to much of a shock as my immediate family already knows im suicidal. i will not live to be a beggar of the family, i will not live off their resources. since there is no other way, i must die. it is a logical conclusion to the situation. mental illness plagues me? sure. but the person who is not mentally ill is of the illest ilk. highly functioning people continue their immortality project, whatever it may be in life. whatever it is, it is what they hope will secure their immortality on some level. we all die. why bother so much about the suicidal? death is a part of life. it always has been and always will be. it's nothing to be troubled by any more than any other "troubling" thing, whatever that is to you. finally the anxiety has become whole, and the end is near. it is so clear that the end is near, dear. deer in the headlights, a death to stop fights.
