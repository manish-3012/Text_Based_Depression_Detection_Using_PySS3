itâ€™s over nowi want it to be over. i hate living. i hate breathing. i hate being alive dude. i just wanna take a gun to the head. or get run over by a car. 

iâ€™m alone. i have no one. i am not going to see my boyfriend for three months and now he doesnâ€™t want to see me before i leave, which is in 3 days.

i want to kill myself. i want it to be over. i want to die.
