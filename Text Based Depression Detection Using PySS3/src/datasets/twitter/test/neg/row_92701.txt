i have nothing to live forim a burden to everybody and i dont have a future to look forward to. im better off dead, im stupid for thinking anybody would ever care about me. im stupid for thinking for even a second that i would be important to anybody. i dont want to kill myself, but if i was in harms way, i wouldnt step out of it.
