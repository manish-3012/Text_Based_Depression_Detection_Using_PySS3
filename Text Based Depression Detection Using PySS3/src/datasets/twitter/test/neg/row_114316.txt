This sub is full of such good heartsI'm usually the dark humor, sarcastic, emotionally closed off guy that doesn't share feelings in life, but I can't help but be so glad we have this forum to just be open about the darkest places in our minds and I have to tell you. All the comments I see here are just so supportive and honest. I know we all hurt so deeply and we're just tired, REALLY tired, in our bones, but it makes me so bitterly happy that we have somewhere to be heard sharing our painful truths and often, to get just a little help from a kind stranger. You guys are angels.
