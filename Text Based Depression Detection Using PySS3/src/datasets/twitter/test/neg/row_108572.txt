I want to kill everyone and destroy everythingThat's it. I just hate everything. I'm a 28 yo loser. I'm poor, I'm depressed, and I'm overflowing with hatred. I live in a shitty, underdeveloped country that I hate (Brazil). I have 0 friends. No girlfriend obviously. But that's probably for the best, my personality makes other people depressed.

All my life I've been a good boy, a good son, doing what I was told, I was a brilliant student, I went to college, grad school, but all school does is reward you for obeying, it doesn't teach you anything valuable. It's a place that rewards cowards like myself. I have 0 useful life skills and now I've already wasted most of my potential. I failed badly, even though I was told all the time I would succeed. And I can't fix it. I just wish I could have some fucking impact in the world. I hate being invisible.

I have some issues with women, Iâ€™m not physically attractive enough to get women that Iâ€™m attracted to, I donâ€™t have much in common with them. I'm too unstable to date anyway, I can barely take care of myself, how am I going to take care of anyone else. I want to be free from sexual feelings, urges and thoughts. I want to get rid of my sex drive. I have no use for it, since I canâ€™t have sex. 

I refuse to masturbate, so Iâ€™m constantly thinking about women. Friends, random women, actresses in movies/tv shows, I feel hopelessly drawn to any remotely attractive women. I resent the fact that they hold this power over me, that Iâ€™m too much of an animal to be able to just block it. It makes me feel like a loser.

I just fucking hate life. And not only my life, life in general. It's just so stupid to be put in this world just to suffer senselessly. To be a slave of some biological imperative, to have no true free will. I wish I could end it for all of us honestly. Pull a Thanos and erase life out of existence.
