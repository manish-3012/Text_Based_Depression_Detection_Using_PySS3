Too manyThe sixth suicide just happened at my high school this year. There were another three that happened in December. Nobody is glorifying it, nobody even knows unless they ask around or go to the funerals. Itâ€™s starting to sound like the norm, another hanging, an OD. hell, one kid floored it into the back of a school bus. I knew most of them, seen them around. Itâ€™s very different hearing of a death, then seeing the empty seat right next to you. Iâ€™ve made two attempts on my life, and I remember feeling so alone and empty inside. I still do sometimes. Every time I hear what these kids are going through, and how alone they feel, all I can think is â€œwe were here ready to listenâ€ unfortunately itâ€™s not that simple. We all know how severely alienating this disease is. We all know how ugly it is. And thereâ€™s no end in sight. I donâ€™t know what to do other than keep living. Every time one of my friends ends it, it strengthens my resolve to keep going. To survive for them, and everyone else who is struggling to prove that this monster can be killed, if not at least tamed. At first Iâ€™m angry at them, then at their circumstances. Suicide has already taken so much away from me, and I refuse to give it the satisfaction of giving up. The grim reaper will have one hell of a time getting to me, you can be sure of that.
