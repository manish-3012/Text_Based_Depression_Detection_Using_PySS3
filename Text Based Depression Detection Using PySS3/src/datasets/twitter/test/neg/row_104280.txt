Game OverI never wanted to be alive. I didn't ask for this. My dream for getting out of any hardship has always been a variant on hanging myself. Being alive is the ultimate hardship. I'm not really cut out for life. I got an English degree, I anticipate doing nothing with it besides dying because I don't see myself doing any job or living or being mildly happy enough to stay. I don't like doing anything anymore: guitar, videogames, watching television. I don't like talking to people which bars me from most facets of life including making friends, working, dating etc. I have very few friends and I'm losing them by the minute. I will die a virgin and I have accepted the fact that most people will think I'm gay when I'm dead. My parents love me but I'm sure on some level they hate me for quitting school and not wanting a future. I don't want a job, I don't want to go through the turmoil of being awake anymore. The only things keeping me from buying a gun are a maze of gun laws and the fear of burning in Hell. I wish someone would give me the strength to kill myself. I think I'll give myself a month, but I regret not killing myself earlier at the dorm adjacent to my apartment. I want to jump or try hanging myself again.
