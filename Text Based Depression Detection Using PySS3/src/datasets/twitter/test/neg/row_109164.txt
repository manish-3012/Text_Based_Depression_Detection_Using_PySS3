thank you all for the help but I should gobeing forced to go to college against my will despite my severe social/general anxiety, know full well I won't be able to handle it and I have nowhere to turn for help/comfort so I think I'd rather kill myself than go through any of this

going to hang myself tonight when everyone's sleeping thank you for your help but I'm a broken person
