losing hopehi, i just got diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder in august, and i started medication and therapy, and for the first time in my life, i have stuck with it. i have been on prozac multiple times despite my emphasis on telling my psychiatrist i hate prozac because i always wanted to kill myself more. i am 7 weeks into the medication and i never have considered suicide even more. iâ€™m also in nursing school and doing surprisingly well. but despite my acceptance of the amazing people i have in my life and the great qualities i do have. itâ€™s like i feel nothing but an empty entity walking on this earth. helping patients overcome their physical and mental disorders reminds me why life is worth living. but once i leave the hospital and civilization, iâ€™m left with my true suicidal depressed self. iâ€™m tired of faking it everyday, iâ€™m tired of being â€œstrongâ€ everyday. iâ€™m so tired of this life and who i am actually. i just want to commit but i know i will have others suffer from my death and that has helped me prevent myself from actually committing. but the idea of it just seems so right. i donâ€™t want to bring disappointment for my family, the vietnamese culture is very i accepting of mental health illnesses and i donâ€™t want my family to be bashed on. i just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. thank you for coming to my ted talk
