It's timeI've done it all: talked to therapists, anti-depressants, exercise, good diet, sleep, used my support system, waited for feelings to pass, all of it.

It's been years of the aforementioned things and suicidal thoughts have remained my constant companion and I'm tired of it. Tired of trying and failing. I just want to go without an extreme amount of agony.

So, is a massive overdose of benadryl and a liter of gin enough to do it and not wake up?
