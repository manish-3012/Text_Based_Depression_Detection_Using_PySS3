Seems like the only logical option in a World you can't fit yourself intoHave never fit into society, I'm too much of a non-conformist. I have no motivation to finish college. Grades are fine, but I just absolutely hate being in classes that can't keep my interest (pretty much every class I've been in my entire life.)  And I've tried multiple types of classes spanning different majors. 
No friends (to their own benefit), no success on finding work (parents had to use the "work for McDonald's" critique smh) or a career path as well. I'm worthless.

Highly likely I have BPD, MDD, ADD, as well as GAD. Honestly they all sound like subsets of one another. Tried medication and that was unsuccessful. Tried stimulants and I hated that as well. 

There is no cure for depression, so I'm essentially screwed for life. What I imagine death is at it's worse, is candy compared to what I can picture is close to my lowest point. I'll probably get kicked out soon and become homeless.
