LDR Nevermet girlfriend is probably going to break up with me. There is nothing I want more in life than for her to just want me again.I live in the UK she lives in the USA. We met through a discord group for an online game where we became friends and I could tell she wanted me for a few days before she broke up with her then boyfriend and got with me a couple weeks later. She begged me to be hers every day before I finally gave in and made my mind up and decided that this is what I wanted. She is my first relationship ever and we had so much planned together. This summer we had planned our week for when she would fly over and stay with me and everything was going perfectly. She kept telling me how intent she was on making this happen and how she had never fallen in love with someone as quickly as she had fallen in love with me. I was the happiest I had ever felt in my life.

Then the last 2 weeks something changed. I don't know what but she suddenly became distant and I became frustrated. She was being completely unreasonable and would get so upset with me whenever I asked what was going on. Our daily hours of calls suddenly stopped and she would even reject my calls, which is completely unlike her. She began ignoring me and we went from talking to each other whenever we possibly could to sending maybe 10 disjointed, unenthusiastic messages a day. My life was falling apart and over this past week I have been planning this as I felt us drifting further and further apart. Just 4 days ago she showed her last remaining ounce of love for me before then ignoring me for another day. Today she has told me things are not working and has not yet messaged me back again. I am here with hundreds of thoughts going through my head yet I am still just numb. She is offline and I don't know when she will be back. I truly feel like it is the end this time. 

Now that I know what I would be missing without being with her, there is no way whatsoever that I can cope after this. I don't expect to be alive by this time next week.
