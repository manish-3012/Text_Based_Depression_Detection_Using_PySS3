Hi, I want to dieI saw this subreddit and just wanted to share my story, because otherwise I can't fall asleep tonight. I am 21 years old now and I am have been diagnosed by professionals with gender dysphoria, autism and depression (this all factors in later).

I've always felt different when I was young and (apparently) grade school rules are if you are different than other kids, you are a prime target for bullying. So I was bullied from when I was 9 till when I was 15 or 16 (physical, emotional and all the such). This, very unfortunately, came to a head when (around when I was 16 or 17) I was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. I'm talking a groping of my nether regions and cupping of the chest. That...fucked me up...to say the least. 

For context I was right in the middle of transitioning from male to female at the time, so was looking rather androgynous, prompting kids to ask me "are you a boy or a girl" frequently. This particular day Mr. Douchebag himself asked the question. Unsatisfied with my silence,  he probed further, asking "whether I knew if I had a d*ck or a c*nt". My silence remained, and so he...decided to figure out by himself. I will say again it fucked me up...real bad.

Flashforward to today and I have been living on my own for a year, also seeing a psychologist (luckily). This does not, however, save me from the very frequent assaults from my mind reminding me of what happened all those years ago. The emotional torture my mind relays upon itself is almost bearable on some days, while on other days I cannot sit down without wanting to desperately leap off the balcony of my apartment (I live on the 4th or 5th floor depending on where you're from).

I do not necessarily need advice, though won't turn it away. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Goodnight.
