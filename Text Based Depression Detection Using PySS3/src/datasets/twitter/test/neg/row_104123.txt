I thought death would seem like a last resort, not a good idea.I have come to the conclusion that i just don't want anything.
I the usual "goals" people have in life don't appeal to me anymore. It doesn't matter how much i think, not only i can't imagine myself actually achieving something, i simply don't believe achieving anything is worth it. 
Until recently i thought that i had some sort of objective, and i would resort to suicide if i lost the will to keep going towards it.
Now i realized that there's no point in having objectives. I don't want anything. I don't see what good can come from having any kind of goal.
I only see going forward as tiring myself for stuff i don't want. Putting an end to it seems like the most logical idea, after all, why keep struggling?

I'd really appreciate some thoughts on this.
