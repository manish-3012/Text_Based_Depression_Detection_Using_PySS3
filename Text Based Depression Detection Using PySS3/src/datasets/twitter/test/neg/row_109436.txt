Me againHi, I hope you had a better day than mine. It wasn't the worst, but I felt empty.
Anyways my situation is worst than last time I posted. Summer is here but I don't feel any better because I know Noone wants to hang out with a looser like me. Everyday I think of suicide, I see myself hung up on my room or wherever I go.
I've tried doing things to distract me. I went to a football camping with some people I knew during a week, but it did nothing.
I honestly don't feel like a human, everyone seems to have something that makes them special except me, I look at myself in a photo or in the mirror but I just see a stupid, ugly and selfish 14 yo kid.
