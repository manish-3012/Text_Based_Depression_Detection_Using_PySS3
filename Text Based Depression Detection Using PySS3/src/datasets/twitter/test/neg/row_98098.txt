Methods and resources to help deal with thoughts of suicide that don't require therapists and medication?Hi /r/suicidewatch,

I have been struggling on and off with suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now. The only thing that's holding me back from killing myself is my family. My family has been very good to me and I love them very much. Regardless I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts due to other factors in my life.

I really want to get help so that I won't cause any grief to my family. I've tried therapists but they don't really help much. Some of them actually make me feel even worse afterwards. I also don't like speaking out loud about my feelings, especially to strangers like therapists, who otherwise wouldn't give a shit about me if it wasn't for the job they had to do. My oral communication skills aren't that great. I'm not very articulate and I always trip over my words, so I end up sounding dumber than I actually am. Also, I hate the fact that some therapists will automatically label a person as "crazy" before you even have a chance to speak about your problems. I'm just a normal person who just has a shitty problem, and so I want to be treated as a normal person.

Another reason for being wary of seeking this kind of help is the stigma that comes with things like this, and the fact that this kind of history of suicidal tendencies and visits to therapists can be used against me (i.e. for work, relationships, etc.)

Does anyone know of any coping mechanisms or other alternative methods that can help me? Most resources for suicidal people are for emergencies, or are short-term and are not anonymous. I rather that my friends and family not know about my problem. I want to be able to guide myself out of this (mostly) on my own like an adult.

If you need more background, I am currently in my 4th year in university, with two majors: one in the STEM field and one in the arts. But the job market is shit and I will probably end up working minimum wage for the rest of my life, which will be a huge disappointment for family, friends, and everyone else who knows me. So the horrible outlook for my studies/career is very demotivating. In terms of hobbies, I make art. Art is also completely useless and doesn't contribute anything to society so that's also demotivating factor. It just takes up space in my room and it drains whatever money I make, so there's no point in doing it. 

In addition to the uncertainty in my future in terms of work, finances, etc. another factor that contributed to my depression was the constant bullying and harassment I received in school from the age of 4 until my first year of university. I developed some self-image issues and social anxiety because of this, so it's difficult for me to trust people and make friends face-to-face, which makes things even worse.

I know that many more people have worse problems that they are dealing with and have better reasons for killing themselves. I'm sorry that there are other people in this world that have to suffer through worse things. 

I simply don't want to live anymore just because I don't feel like it. I just don't like life. I don't like the fact that I was forced into being alive. I don't like the fact that I have to stay alive no matter what. I wish life was optional. And I wish that my life and death wouldn't have an effect on loved ones.
