I'm not gonna tell anybody I'm gonna kill myself this time, no note no calling anybody etc.They just send the fucking police who are literally the worst people to handle these situations. Physically force you into an ambulance that costs a fortune and treat you like a criminal, handcuff you and hurt you if they need to because all police know is violence and aggression.



Send you to a prison at the hospital where nobody gives a shit about you and you're just a money pot for them, keep you there as long as they can to get the most money out of you. I've never seen any "professional" at any psych unit who gave a damn about anybody there.




So this time I'll just do it. Not gonna tell anybody this time. It'll be a surprise to people but it shouldn't be.



I think this is the thing you realize after almost killing yourself so many times
