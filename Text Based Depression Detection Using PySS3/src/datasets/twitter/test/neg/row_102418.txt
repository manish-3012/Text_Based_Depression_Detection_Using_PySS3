i think about death a lotand wonder what happens afterwards
will i be reincarnated ?
as a different race/nationality/religion/sex
-a new born on present time,
-a new born in the future
-a new born in the past 
-an unhealthy newborn with a rare disease, terminal illness or genetic disorder, e.g. cerebral palsy, down syndrome,  
-re-incarnated as an animal like insects 

2nd chances ?
-to back in time to specific life changing decisions made on a wim or was sleep deprived and stoned to think about
-to restart my life again from the get-go

religion
- if christianity was right = eternal damnation/hell
- if islam was right = hell
- if any other was right = equivalent hell

nothingness
- its like life never existed , then what would be the point of studying and learning pretty hard stuff if i know i'm not going to be some cool inventor, or nobel prize winner, or do something that will change the world in a grandscale, and be remembered in history ...or wikipedia

darwin's law :but why should i pass my wicked monstrous genes that carries sick thoughts and wierd fantasies, plus my unhealthy and lazy way of living, while torturing my mind everyday with sick demented thoughts and self loathing and hatred. 

pagan beliefs
-my soul will roam the earth until the specified time i was supposed to die
-my spirit will haunt the home of my family
-problems in life will carry on to the afterlife except it will be impossible to try an solve them now that i am dead
-as much as i regret so many things, i will end up regretting death itself....for eternity

an island called lost 

what i think
-my problems will carry on to the afterlife, i will forever be haunted by the past mistakes, especially killing my self, my consciousness is awake in this time period, where there are many cool things going on with the internet, memes and video games, anime, tv shows and there has never been a perfect time for me to have been born the last 2-3 decades and be entertained.

but the cons sort of outweigh the pros, in my mind, for almost 5 months i have been thinking of suicide like pretty much everyday , and its killing me.

the world is fucked, millions of people die every fucking day, from accidents, illnesses, homicides, suicides, starvation, silly wars over a piece of fucking land and oil, corporations suck the living life out of the little people, diseases, hate, greed, child trafficking, child abuse from strangers to families, mental illnesses....


i think i might die in a few weeks
