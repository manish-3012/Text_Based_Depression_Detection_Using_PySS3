Girlfriend of 8+ years left a month ago, only gotten harder every dayWe've been together since middle school. We'd never been with anyone else and we were so fucking perfect together. 
 
To make a very, very long and wonderful story short, I forced myself on her, sort of, a couple months ago and ruined it all. She had recently been very into being tied up, used, and forced, which was something I was always hesitant to try because I'm not at all a violent person. And by forced I just mean licking and continuing when she says no, not physically harmful. So she was into this at the time... And one night I got carried away and continued when she clearly didn't want to because fuck knows why. 
 
I cried along with her that night because I felt terrible. Shortly after, we took a month trip to Europe and it wasn't the right place to reconnect. Too much new, not enough catching up where we needed to. 
 
We got back home and I had to go out of state for 2 months for a summer internship. No problem, we'd done long distance tons of times, for 2 years at one point. She told me we were fine, we were talking as normal. 
 
I can't keep telling the rest of this same damn story... She left me through a fucking text message after eight and a half years of being happy together. As soon as she did, I begged her to just talk to me about what was wrong. Nothing. She's ignored me for an entire month. So I drove back home to see her a couple weeks ago, 12 hour drive, and she wouldn't hear anything I had to say. Just looked at me without a tear in her eyes, and told me she doesn't love me or care about what I have to say. After almost half of our lives together, that's my closure. Nothing. 
 
What the fuck is the point of going through this miserable existence if the person I care about more than anything can instantly flip a switch and not care if I'm alive anymore? 
 
So now I get to be alone up in another state, away from any friends or family, and suffer this hell. I'm just going to save what I make and send it to her so she can have some comfort while she finds a job and then stop this shitty pain. I love this girl and I believe she's just poorly handling stress or something, but she literally won't even reply to me.
