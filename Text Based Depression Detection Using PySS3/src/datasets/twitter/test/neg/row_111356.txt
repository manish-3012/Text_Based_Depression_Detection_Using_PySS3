US Suicide Hotline SUCKS!So I replied to someoneâ€™s pos with this, but I thought Iâ€™d share my story here:

     I was on my way home from work and was tired of going through the motions. I had scoped out a place to hang myself and I was ready. I called the hotline and talked to a man who may as well have told me Iâ€™d be better off dead. He was so monotone and incredibly dull. â€œWhy do you wanna kill yourself?â€ â€œOhhh Iâ€™m so sorry to hear thatâ€ those phrases in the most INSINCERE tone. After about 20 minutes or so, I hung up because he was bullshit. Fast forward an hour later, KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! Police at my front door. I stepped outside and they had told me the suicide hotline had called and reported my location (which I never gave them?!?). Police told me I either go to the hospital or go to jail. So I go to the hospital. Police leave the emergency lobby and I get called into a room. I walk back there and take a seat. A therapist walks in and asks me if Iâ€™m going to hurt myself and I say no. She has the NERVE to give me a page with the suicide hotline number on it (LMAO) and sends me home. A couple months later, BAM! I get slapped with a $1,400 emergency room fine. It has now been 4 years since that happened and I have a nice big $1,400 bill sitting in collections because I canâ€™t make enough extra money to pay it off. Thanks suicide hotline for ruining my credit :)

To conclude: if you think you need to call them, go ahead. But from what Iâ€™ve learned, you MUST be careful with what you tell them. In my experience, theyâ€™re more bad than they are good.
