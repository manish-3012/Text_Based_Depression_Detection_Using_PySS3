The lowest Iâ€™ve ever been and Iâ€™m afraid thereâ€™s no way out of this.Hi everyone. So Iâ€™m a 20 year old college student who was kicked out of the house a month ago for smoking weed. It is only decriminalized where I am, not fully legal yet but it has been approved to be legalized. So I went to a hotel and I have blown all my money there for a place to stay. I have spent close to $2000 on hotel rooms, I know I couldâ€™ve gotten an airbnb for a month but I didnâ€™t think about that until it was too late. I have no money currently and am living day to day paying for my hotel rooms through DoorDash. I have applied to at least 20 different jobs including Walmart, Amazon, UPS, and several other immediate hire warehouse jobs in the area and none have answered back. Itâ€™s been 2-3 weeks for those applications and no word. I just failed half my classes this semester due to time constraints between DoorDash and classes, I didnâ€™t have enough time to study for all of them. When I went back to the house to talk to my mom about trying to move back in paying rent and other utilities she called the cops on me for trespassing. I was sent to the hospital under voluntary psych evaluation because I had a nervous breakdown in front of them which I have never done in my life, that was also the first time the cops were ever called on me. When I went back to get the rest of my boxes from the house that were left outside there was a pile of mail for me which one of them was the bill for the hospital which says I owe $430 for expenses. Just when things couldnâ€™t get any worse I backed into someone who was waiting for a parking spot. I didnâ€™t see him because he was in the blind spot of my car (Jeep Grand Cherokee) which had a dirty rear window and I hit his door (Honda Civic) so when the cop got there I got a ticket for careless driving and likely to injure others. That ticket equates to $89 and will for sure skyrocket my insurance. Now stuff in my car is starting to act up which will rack up even more money that I owe. My credit cards maxed, I have no family who will take me in because of their views on weed. The only thing keeping me going right now is my girlfriend who is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Iâ€™m afraid that sheâ€™ll get tired of helping me and see me as a burden and dump me. When that happens Iâ€™ll seriously have no reason to keep living. Iâ€™m afraid there really is no way out of this rut for me I figure Iâ€™ll just kill myself before Iâ€™m living on the streets so at least I wonâ€™t suffer. I canâ€™t even get loans through the bank due to my credit not being mature enough.
