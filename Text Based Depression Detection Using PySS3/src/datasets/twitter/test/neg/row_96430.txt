Can somebody be in my corner please?The mistakes I've made in the past and now are  fucking me so hard...I regret shit so much and I hate myself...I can't get past it. I know I need to think of compassion but I deserve to feel pain and to be beaten. I don't want to go on because  whats the point? I'm reading self-help books and they have been helping because I'm better than I was but Every. Single Time. I I mess up I'm reminded how much Of a fuck-up I am and its too much...I've done too much and I so scared because I don't wanna die...

Please sombody tell me not too
