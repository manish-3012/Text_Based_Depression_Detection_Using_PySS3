I'm 29, I've decided I'm going to do it on my 30th birthdayI just truly see no point in continuing my life, or any life for that matter. My husband and I have decided not to bring children into this fucked up world. So at least I don't have anyone depending on me. I hate my job. I don't have the confidence or desire to look for another one. I don't have the money to do anything that would bring me even an ounce of pleasure, nor can I even pin point what that activity would be. I had started a blog which gave me some motivation over the past year but even that seems pointless now. Food and cooking were a hobby of mine, but I don't even enjoy that anymore because I'm just stressed out that it will contribute to my weight problem. Everything seems pointless. My husband has started going to a therapist. We can't afford for me to go to one too, because I'm not insured and he is. I have a congenital heart deformity that prevents me from getting onto his insurance. And I don't even think I want to go, because I'm afraid if I tell anyone what I'm actually thinking, they'll just try to stop me. I listened to the S-town podcast and felt angry that the main characters feelings about the world were dismissed as mental illness. I don't think I'm sick, I think I'm right. 


Edit: the reason I've set a date is because I want to do some research as to the best way to do it. I don't want to screw it up and be paralyzed or have brain damage. I also think I want to go off somewhere and have police or a stranger find me. Not my husband.
