Tired of gender questioning...I started having persistent fantasies about being a woman (AMAB) 2 years ago (currently 25) and i'm so tired of it. I've tried socially transitioning (a few months ago), but it's just made me very stressed and oftentimes unhappy. I like looking like a woman, but interacting with others makes me feel incredibly anxious. I know I'm obviously unpassable &amp; ugly as a girl, so why bother. Even if I was perfectly passable, I'm afraid it wouldn't feel right and I'd just want to go back to being a man.

I'm not even sure whether or not I'm trans - sometimes I just think I need attention or something. Like when I present as a guy I'm not in dysphoric anguish, but I do have these nonstop compulsive thoughts about transitioning. Whenever I see a woman, I get jealous and just wish I was born that way and didn't have to agonize about gender 24/7. But this obsession only started a couple years ago, so is this just a weird cry for help? My therapist has (more-or-less) told me I'm trans, but something in my gut tells me something else is up - like I have Munchausens or OCD or something. 

Also, if I don't transition at this point I'll be the weirdo that crossdressed full-time (including at work) &amp; used she/her pronouns for a hot sec. Feel like I fucked up big time - if I do transition i'll never be passing and my life is over, if I don't transition this weird period is going to be an embarrassing rumor about me forever. And I'm pretty sure I'll never want to stop crossdressing sometimes, at least in private. Which I think is going to prevent me from finding a partner, as I more or less outed myself as a crossdresser to everyone already.

So why not end things now and spare myself further humiliation? If I kill myself I don't have to live with the embarrassment of transitioning or crossdressing, my parents don't have to lose their son, and I won't be depressed and unable to focus on the things I used to enjoy.
