I've given upI've given up. On changing. On getting better. On changing my life. I feel helpless..like nothing will ever get better..like I can't get better. I just can't do this anymore. I have nobody to turn to. Nobody who can help me. I have nobody.
I cant do this on my own anymore and i am tired of fighting every day alone. Every single day alone.
I just cant do it anymore.
