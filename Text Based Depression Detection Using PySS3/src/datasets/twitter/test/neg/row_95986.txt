My girlfriend is suicidal.. What to do...Hello, I haven't been on reddit in quite some time, but I'm having a bit of a crisis that I'd like some advice on.
A couple of months ago my girlfriend purposely overdosed on medication. I ended up finding her and reviving her, after which she spent the day and that next night hospitalized. She then seemed pretty okay, she claimed she didn't remember taking the pills (she was very drunk). Then twice since then she has attempted to take pills and I've caught it in time to make her throw up. She's been depressed for years and doesn't feel like anything will help. She has no real support system, no family, very few friends, and an issue with alcohol dependency. She has a history of PTSD and a lot of sexual, mental, and physical abuse stemming from childhood and some later in life. I know I can't force her to do anything, but I'd love to hear some input on what to do, how to approach things, pretty much anything anyone can tell me to help me process it for myself and any advice on how to help her.
Thanks in advance for any input. I'm having a hard time dealing with this and I want her to be okay.
