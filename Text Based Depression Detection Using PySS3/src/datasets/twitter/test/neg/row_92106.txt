Using hard drugs to kill myselfI am in no way capable of the suicide methods I read about.  Instead I am doing as much meth and cocaine as possible. I'm trying to OD but I just won't die from it and I'm still stuck here. I confided in a good friend and she threatened to call the police. I can't tell my therapist either or he'll call the authorities on me. I live with mental illnesses and am in chronic pain from multiple, unsuccessful back surgeries. I just feel I've done all there is to and I'm ready to go to the other side.  Can't believe I'm still here.
