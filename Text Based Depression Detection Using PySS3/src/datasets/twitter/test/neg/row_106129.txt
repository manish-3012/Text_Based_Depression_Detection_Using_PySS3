I'm so lost I don't even know who I am anymoreEver since my grandma died I've been empty. She gave me a safe place to go to (my mom was physically and verbally abusive). When she died my life went to pure hell. I started selfharming and later drugs and alcohol. I tried to find love from guys but I never found that feeling agian. The one person that I had ever trusted and loved was gone. She thought me what love was and with out her I do t have any. I'm so broken. Her death date is coming up on the 10th and I wanna kill myself at her grave then. I don't want to live anymore. It's almost been three years and I feel like she died yesterday. 

I miss her so much. I can't live without her. I'm sitting here typing this out while crying and selfharming. I just want to get high and drunk so this will go away. But nothing helps. I will never be able to forget what I lost. I'm a failure to her. I'm a fucking addict and that's what she was trying to keep me away from. I can't do this. I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm lost w8thout her. 

Somebody please just kill me. My life is tolttal shit. I would do anything just to see her one more time. 

I love you grandma. Rest in peace. I miss you so much. I'm sorry.
