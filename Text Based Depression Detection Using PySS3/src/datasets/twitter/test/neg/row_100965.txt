The Human Race deserves to die a painful deathThis may not be well received - but what have we REALLY contributed to this world?

We are the only living things which will kill themselves on purpose. What does that show?

It shows that we are a waste of space. I know I clearly am. I'm astounded that everyone else is so delusional to think that life is worth it. Maybe they had parents who didn't rape them, and were kind to them, and sheltered them from the truth about what human beings really ARE. I don't even envy them any more. I think everyone should die.

Maybe from reading this you think I'm weak. Well, I think the whole human race is weak. I can't wait for the physical pain of suicide.
