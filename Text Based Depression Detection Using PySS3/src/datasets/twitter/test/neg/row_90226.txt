19 and ready to goI have felt like this for such a very long time and I feel as if there is no way out of it. I have tried putting a smile on for so so many years and that has put a wear on me. I honestly could not describe to anybody how much mental pain I am in and be exact about it. The only thing I could say is that Iâ€™m in a very dark place with no way out. I have no friends to reach out to, or family. I am the one in the family that nobody really pays attention to. It is almost as I am invisible. I was physically abused as a child and I can say that is a huge part of why I am the way I am but I do not let that excuse it. I just need friends and this is honestly the last attempt of pushing further before I give up.
