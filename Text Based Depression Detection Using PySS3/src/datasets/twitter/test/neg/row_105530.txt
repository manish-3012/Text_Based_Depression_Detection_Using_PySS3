The urge to dieEveryday for the last few months I have not stopped thinking about killing myself.
I obsess over it, and Iâ€™ll hit my head on walls, or anything close to me at the time.
Iâ€™ve always felt depressed, and always felt alone. 
There is a lot going on all the time and it feels like itâ€™s never going to stop. 
Everything I feel seems irrational, but at the same time itâ€™s real enough to make me constantly think about dying.
