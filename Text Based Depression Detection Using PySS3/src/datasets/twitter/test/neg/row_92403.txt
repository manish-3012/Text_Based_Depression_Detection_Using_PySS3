How can I help my manic depressive roommate during suicidal episodes? (x-post r/depression)I (28M) have a roommate (26F) who has chronic manic depression and for the past couple of weeks has been in-and-out of suicidal episodes. Up until about 2 months ago she was seeing a therapist, but she stopped. She was also on medication, but could not get past the initial couple months while her body adjusted, so she is off that as well. She has a boyfriend, but their relationship is on the rocks because she frequently lashes out at him and he is afraid to say anything that will set her off. She is convinced that he is going to break up with/cheat on her at any minute. On top of that, I have just started a new relationship and anytime my girlfriend is around or the subject of our relationship gets brought up, she gets even more insecure about her own relationship.

I have previously dealt with my own depression, but nothing on the level she has. She has years of unresolved trauma from her abusive family, sexual assaults, and more. When she does go to therapists, she lies to them because she does not want to be judged. She is working a job she hates, but she is terrified she will get fired, because she has a bunch of credit card debt and needs the money pay it off.

Last weekend she told me she was going to kill herself. I was able to calm her down and talk her out of it with the help of some friends. But this weekend, she seems to be headed in that same direction. When I recommend in-patient treatment or going back to therapy, she dismisses the idea as ridiculous. She says there is no point in going to therapy because she is unfixable.

This is a person I care about and want to see get better, but at this point I feel like I am out of options. What can I do to help her get better or just help her WANT to get better?
