I feel like it's my only choice at this pointI have suspected I have been depressed for maybe going on 6 or so years but now I think I know.

My whole life fell apart. I split up with my girlfriend who made my life bearable despite in hindsight the emotional torture I endured, who then turned everyone I know at uni against me, not sure how. All my "friends" just cut me out of their lives about 6 months ago.

I failed the year at uni.

Naturally I had a horrendous summer due to these but thought when I got back to uni I'd be able to focus on my work. This helped me realise I hate my course and despise being here at uni.

Everywhere here in this town so far from home us a reminder in some shape to everything I lost, I can't escape it.

All I can think about is how I hate everything and want to escape.

I thought time would heal but here I am probably more depressed than ever.
I am the most anxiety ridden person I've come across so I can't speak to people, since being back in uni in september I've spoken to 4 people, my new random housemates, each of which I've probably had 1 or 2 conversations with.

I tell myself I hate everything and care about nothing but at the same time being so anxiety ridden I care way too much about everything.
I've seen doctors, university well-being advisers, counsellors and more but nothing has happened. Ive gone to them and tried to explain what's going on and in response I feel like I get "okay" and that was the end of that.

These past 9 months of my life have been pure agony (towards the end of the relationship things got bad). Whenever i try to go to sleep I stay up for another 2-3 hours just dreading the next day and over thinking everything I've done that lead me here.

I want to be dead so badly, thinking about myself being dead is the only thing that gives me peace of mind, but I'm too much of a pussy to probably kill myself because it would probably devastate my grandparents, mam and sister. But the temptation is just so strong now.
There is nothing in this world I want to do, nothing I think I can do with my life, except end it. The only thing that brings me any sort of happiness is thinking about being dead.
Sorry for this unorganized rant of a post, probably isn't very coherent but i need to get this off my chest and I have no one at all I feel even the slightest bit comfortable with to talk to.
