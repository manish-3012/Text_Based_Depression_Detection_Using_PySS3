I think I deserve to end my lifeWhen someone cheats once, when someone feels so numb as to barely cry or feel the way you should about your loved ones as you used too, when someone just fuck up every good thing they've had an hurt people no matter how much they always try not too, when they are only jealous an insecure about someone they knew damn well they never deserved an that other person is happy now but your such a piece of shit you can't just be happy for them. If someone has done theses things like I have you don't look at them like a good person with a bright future. Not a kind person or someone that deserves any good to come to them. I want to take my life, I want to almost everyday but knowing what it would do to my family it stops me. I just want to die, if I could wipe their memory of me I would an finally just painful kill myself as I deserve. Since I was young I wanted to find a gun but I only needed 3 bullets. I want to shoot myself twice in the stomach an then an only then if I'm still breathing will I earn the right to plunge my last bullet into my skull an finally leave this world an if there's a heaven I don't deserve to go there I just want to rot in the fucking ground. I can't make my fuck ups up and can't redem myself not while constantly feeling shame and an ever growing self hatred. I think most would agree I deserve to die an I want to just take myself into a oblivion.  I'm so tired of being me, I'm so tired of going through this day after day. I don't want help, I don't deserve it. I just want to die in pain as some sort of redemption for all the trouble, annoyance and pain I've caused in my life of 24 years an all of its amounted to nothing. I can't go back to being younger me who actually had some sort of will and imagination for the world. I hate the fact people would cry, I've even considered hiding deep in the woods till I starved to death that way no one would blame themselves they'd just see an accident of how I got lost in the woods while hiking. I'm fucking stupid enough for that to be believed. The only things that keep me planted to life is my family, but it gets stronger everyday an as hard as I try I'm afraid one day I'll lose control. I'm trapped, I can't rid of myself to benefit others who worry, hate, are disgusted and are annoyed by me even I want too but can't without living my family in tears and tearing them apart. Especially my younger brother who I have failed to be a good big brother of. Trapped in a never fucking ending hell of my own fault, no one else's I did this. I'm hoping something takes me out, I can't stand myself an I don't want to keep going like this forever.
