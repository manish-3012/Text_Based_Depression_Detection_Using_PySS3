emptyI don't know, there's nothing good in life. Nothing to look forward to, nothing enjoyable. It's gotten to a point where I can hardly stand being around people, I can still talk to them and laugh but inside I can't feel any of that. I don't want to go on forever like this. I barely see any point in getting out of bed, there's nothing good beyond sleep. I don't know why I'm posting here, I know this seems boring and self-pitying. I can't feel anything, I just wish I felt so I'd have the motivation to actually end myself.
