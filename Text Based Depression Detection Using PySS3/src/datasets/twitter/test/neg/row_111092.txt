I am literally obsessed with my friend and it is making me go crazy.I have Aspergers/autism. For as long as iâ€™ve remembered i always have one or two â€œspecial interestsâ€. Just a fandom, game, or show that i will obsess over for a a few months at most. Recently i stopped having any special interests. I assumed it was a result of my depression getting worse recently. But i realized that i have a special interest. It is my best friend. I have had crushes before, i assumed i had a crush on her. This feels different though. I am so obsessed with her, it feels like iâ€™m getting into a new fandom or game, except for a person. My whole life revolves around her. I love her so much, iâ€™m so jealous of her other close friend. I never stop thinking about her. I feel so horrible all the time because i know she wonâ€™t date me, and at this point i donâ€™t think i wanna date her. I feel like i canâ€™t live without her, like if i canâ€™t have her then there is no point in living. I started self harming again around the time i had a â€œcrushâ€ on her. I feel like my life is falling apart, is there something wrong with me?
