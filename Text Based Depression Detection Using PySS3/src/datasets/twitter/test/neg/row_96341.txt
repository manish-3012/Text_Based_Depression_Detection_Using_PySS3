I'm trapped.I'm not suicidal, I just want to die. I don't want to, and cannot kill myself, but I don't want to continue life and I feel trapped in this mind of constant misery with no way to escape. I don't know why I'm typing this because I don't want help, I've already given up and I know I'm fucked.
