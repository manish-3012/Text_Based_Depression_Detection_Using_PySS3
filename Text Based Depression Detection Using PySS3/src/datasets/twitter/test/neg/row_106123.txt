I don't know what to do anymore. I am not able to go on like this.I don't even know what to say here. I am absolutely destroyed now. I don't even know where to start. Absolutely nothing is right. I genuinely feel like dying now.

Haven't seen my family for 7 years due to political reasons. Away from my wife, who's the only one who can stop me from killing myself. Being so poor, that I literally have to choose which days of the week I can eat on. Can't get a job due to the country rules that I live in. Being stuck with clinical depression, and not being able to afford real help. Having no friends whatsoever. I am completely destroyed. I tried everything. I tried making a Fiverr to get some money for my mental illness. I tried borrowing from people I know. I ever tried a GoFundMe. Nothing is working out, and I honestly can't go on much longer. I need help, and I don't know where to find it. I literally can't find a reason to stay alive anymore.
