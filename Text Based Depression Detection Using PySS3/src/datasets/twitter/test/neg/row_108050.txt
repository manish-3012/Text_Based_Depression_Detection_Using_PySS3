I have reached the end of my line.I found out my fiance had been lying to about pornography for a full year. then i saw history which lead me into a spiral. i hadnt been doing my best before. but now its a whole different level of betrayal. the worst part is the fighting. if i bring up the issue he becomes IRATE with me. ive just been given laundry lists of all my flaws and the things ive done wrong. the worst part is that he is 100% correct. i cant live with myself being a monster and upsetting him all the damn time. i slept for 3 hours the rest of my night i was on the verge of suicide, and i still am. the only thing stopping me is the possibility that i might be pregnant but if thats not the case I have my date set and my means to it. i dont know why i am even writing here. i am desperate for relief to the point of death. i just want to feel ok again or nothing at all.
