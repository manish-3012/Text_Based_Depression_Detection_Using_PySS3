I'm almost ready.For a variety of reasons over the last few years I have considered ending it all and around 6 months ago I finally decided to do it. Sadly I failed and ended up in a hospital were I was able to pass off  my sudden bout of 'illness' as a hereditary disease that runs in my family with very few questions being asked.

It was then I realised that more preparation would be needed so I've done many things to prepare. I have stockpiled a lot of drugs. I have maxed out all my lines of credit and sold/transferred ownership and valuable items so my estate will be deemed insolvent and any debts written off, I have taken the money I gained for this and locked it away in a Bank Account in my sister's name, I've written notes to anyone who might care about what I'm doing and I've withdrawn from University. Is there anything else that would be recommended that I do? I intend on taking action in the next 48 hours. One last meal of my favourite takeaway and that's it.
