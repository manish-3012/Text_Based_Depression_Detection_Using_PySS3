A girl started making out with me on a party, I have never wanted to kill myself more.She started making out with me, we were both drunk. I asked her if she had a condom, since I didn't have one. We both ended up going to our own places. 

When I got home I hung my tie in the ceiling and sat and stared at it for what felt like an hour, slept 14h with terrible nightmares.

Today in school we just... didn't even look at each other.
