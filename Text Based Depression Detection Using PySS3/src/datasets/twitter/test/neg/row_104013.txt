Fuck my life.I canâ€™t go one day without having a panic attack and hating myself. I canâ€™t even function properly. I canâ€™t taste food, I canâ€™t feel anything but pain. And worst of all Iâ€™m the loneliest person on earth. Doesnâ€™t matter no one cares. No body will miss me and no one will remember me. I was just a waste of flesh a walking thing that roamed the earth for 19 years searching for something to live for. Unfortunately I couldnâ€™t find one. All thatâ€™s happened to me is my heart being crushed. I canâ€™t take it anymore ðŸ˜¢. No one cares. Everyone ghosts me who tries to â€œhelpâ€. I just wanted to find love and be able to smile. But I guess thatâ€™s reserved only for the rich and those who donâ€™t deserve happiness. I hate life, and life hates me. How can anyone live happily? How is happiness a emotion? Because to me itâ€™s a figment.
