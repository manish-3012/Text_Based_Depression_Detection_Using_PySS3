Just takes courageI've been struggling to cope since my mom died two years ago. I have no other family, save for my dad who beat, raped, and whored me out my entire child life, and my sisters who support him. I've lost most emotions. I only occasionally feel anger, just primarily heartache and sadness. I've got everything set up to kill myself on Christmas. Multiple contingencies. If one thing doesn't get me, the next will. I'm so sick of trying to get better when everything reminds me of my mom in the most painful ways. I can't handle life without her anymore. My last attempt, I was physically pulled down from a ledge by someone who saw me. It took me months to work up the courage to try it then, and it's taken me months to get back to that level of courage. I've wanted this more than anything for so long, I've planned on Christmas so that my friends and family will suffer more, because they deserve it.
