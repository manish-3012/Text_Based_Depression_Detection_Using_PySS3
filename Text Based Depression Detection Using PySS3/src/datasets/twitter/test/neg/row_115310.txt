I really dont understand20 yrs old scared to post my own thread on here cause feel like ill just get the typical wish you happiness comments when in reality its not there at all . It sucks cause i feel like at the age i am now i should be in a better state mentally. Literally everybody who knows me they know im a stand up guy always tryna have fun w my guys i love my Girlfriend dearly. A big reason i havent done anything to myself yet but everytime i think about it i feel like my time is running out before i cant control the way i feel on dat day and do it . Ive had these thoughts all starting at 16 but they would always be random id always find myself spacing out time to time thinking what would happen if i did and how i wouldnt have to work for another single thing in this world. Yk what i find sad is how if i have a kid and i still havent gone anywhere in life how ima have to bust my ass to provide for him and thats no problem for me but its fucked up cause ik theres gonna be hard days when we barely gonna have anything it may look like im good and theres no problem but in reality im struggling on the brink of bein homeless i fear this for my future children and NO. CHILD Under any circumstances idc no child should be forced to live homeless just cause there parents are and to make it worse im pretty sure if dat did happen ik they would probably just take my children away until i got my shit together but then again no child deserves to be away from their biological parents and no parent should be seperatwd from there kid idk its just things i think about . And to top it all off these thoughts wont go away sometimes i wake up in the morning i gotta be up 6:15 Every Morning Just to work a back breaking warehouse job w no happiness at all basically feels like a modern day slavery and sum days i wake up in real bad moods and ever since ive been getting older more expectations from family members as i get older to be successful i try to do something i like in youtube but even dat requires time and i never have it cause its only 2 day weekends and mon - fri im to tired to do anything and youtube shit takes time and effort which i dont have cause working for money and to do what u want u need money . Idk never thought id be here sharing this on a topic thats very troubling for me to understand rn all ik is that these thoughts of bein free after im dead are more constant as ive been gettin more and more depressed everyday . And everybody im around all think im the happiest person in the world im the type of person that just goofs around all the time make jokes but in reality behind all dat is a broken broken person and im not here for sweet talk from people nun of dat i just wanna understand why i feel like this cause im 100% sure the day i do wake up at 6:15 and im not feeling to great and have those thoughts i will do it idk what to say 

Sorry so long i finally decided to write this out
