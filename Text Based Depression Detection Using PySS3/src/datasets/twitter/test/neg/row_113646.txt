I dont even know why Iâ€™m writing thisAs the title says, I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this right now. Itâ€™s 3am and Iâ€™ve spent the majority of the day to unintentionally contemplate my suicide. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Different ways to do it. Even though Iâ€™ve been saving up pills for a year now, Iâ€™m still considering other options. And I know that a part of me does not want to die. But everything else is always overwhelming. I canâ€™t think positively without automatically turning negative. I was doing pretty well mentally between late july to middle september. And that was definitely the longest period of time Iâ€™ve been mostly okay ever since 2017. 
I canâ€™t sleep right now. Ive been trying and trying but I cannot fall asleep. I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself within the next couple weeks. Usually when Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before, I plan. Make sure to do several things and what not. And I feel strongly that I *really* want my gender mark change to go through before I kill myself. Which Iâ€™m just waiting for the application to be approved. But right now I just feel like I canâ€™t be bothered with any of the things that Iâ€™d wanna do before. It doesnâ€™t matter, Iâ€™ll be dead. Iâ€™m really really genuinely happy that Iâ€™ve come far enough in my medical transition to be able to shower without crippling dysphoria. And I wish I was gonna live long enough to go bathing without a T shirt. But every shitty thing in life is just too much. I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore. 
A part of me really want to tell my therapist about what Iâ€™m planning. But the part of me that wants the pain to stop is bigger. 
Iâ€™m so tired of living.
Itâ€™s too much
