Its finally finishingI've had severe depression for 5 years now. There's not been a day for at least 4.5 years where I've not thought about ending it. Since October its focused a lot more. I developed emetaphobia - a phobia of vomiting. As a result I can't touch any surfaces and any time I have any symptoms of norovirus I panic. Every day I feel sick and I'm tired now. I can't even kiss my girlfriend. My parents forced me to see a psychologist and in the initial assessment they said I have OCD and severe clinical depression. In the past few weeks its gotten worse. I can't even eat any more for fear of ingesting something that will make me sick. Once you can't eat its pretty much game over right? I've lost 4 stone in the past 2 months. At 6.8 stone and 5ft 9 I'm simply waisting away. Each day I'm alive feels like hell on earth. My girlfriend cries for me every time we talk about this. I can't stand this fucking torture anymore. I can feel the end coming. I feel nothing for my girlfriend or anything anymore. She loves me so much and I know I love her back, but I can't feel it anymore. The last week feels like I'm turning the final pages of a book. I'm reaching the end and really it makes me feel happy. I can only imagine the bliss from this place. It feels very different this time, about the realest anything has ever felt in these last few years.

I'm writing this in a last ditch attempt for some sort of revelation, though I'm focusing it more as a final piece.

Wish me luck.
