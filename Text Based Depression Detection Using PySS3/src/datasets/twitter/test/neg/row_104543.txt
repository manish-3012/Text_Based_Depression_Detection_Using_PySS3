The schedule of my life.I hate my life so much. Here is my schedule:

 Everyday I wake up around 11. I then check my phone to see if I got any messages or anything. Nothing. I then proceed to watch YouTube or w/e till 12 to get me fully awake. 

12-4; I then check my email and other things on my computer, and work on my game to hopefully distract me from the world. It never usually works. 
I also call on job apps and the likes to see if anything changed. Nothing. 

4-6; I go to the gym to try to change my life style (being fat sucks). But never see any progress, if any. 

6-whenever; I do a range of things including playing games and watching movies. Same old same old. 

What's the point in doing all these things if my depression will eventually win against me. I do plan on ending my life by the end of the month. 

I have no money, no job, no girlfriend, no friends, got kicked out of college (out of my reach, no matter how hard I try to stay in) not really close to any family members. So why put off the thing that's suppose to happen. I can't change my life, bc Everytime I do, something bad happens. Fuck it all.
