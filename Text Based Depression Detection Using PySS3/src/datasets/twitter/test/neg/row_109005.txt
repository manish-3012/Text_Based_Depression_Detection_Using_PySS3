I keep saying I will kill myselfThroughout the day I keep finding myself muttering things like "I want to die" or when I'm driving alone in the car I will say "I want to kill myself" over and over and over again and I don't know I think I'm losing it. Is this normal? Can anyone relate? When I listen to music I just think about guns firing off at my head in sync to the beat. I feel like I don't exist. I feel soulless, and like I'm in between something and nothing. I hate that I have younger sisters and an almost overbearing mother that loves me to death. I just want to die. Shouldn't those things make me happy? Instead it annoyed by them and just want to stop existing. Can anyone relate and if so what did you do to make it stop
