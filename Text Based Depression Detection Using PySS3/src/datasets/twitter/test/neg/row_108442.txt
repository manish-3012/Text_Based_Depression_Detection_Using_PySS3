Friend is cutting himself, he confided in mI really donâ€™t know what to do for my friend. I knew he was depressed and Iâ€™ve tried to help him with advice about being positive and whatnot. But tonight he told me he had the urge to punish himself, so he decided to cut. I said exactly this to him: 

â€œHurting yourself wonâ€™t solve anything. And you know that. I think you donâ€™t value yourself, (his name) You think youâ€™re a piece of shit, that youâ€™re worthless, that you donâ€™t deserve what you have. Iâ€™m crying right now (his name) I care about you a lot, and so do a lot of other people. You ARE worth something. You are loved, even if you donâ€™t think you are. Youâ€™re one of the most genuine people I know. But not everything is fantastic on the other side of the fence. Youâ€™re battling with yourself. You need to try to realize that youâ€™re not the scum of the earth. That you are LOVED. And it might be hard to do that but Iâ€™ll be damned if I see you fall further down the rabbit hole.â€

Maybe this was the wrong thing to say? I donâ€™t know. He responded saying that it was a mistake for him to confide in me and to never tell anyone about it and to never bring it up to him ever again. He says he doesnâ€™t have actual suicidal thoughts, and even if thatâ€™s true, those violent thoughts may develop into suicidal ones overtime. Any advice for him and I?

TL;DR- Friend is depressed, has resorted to self harm,  what should I do to help him?
