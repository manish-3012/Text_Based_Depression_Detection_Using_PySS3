Time is Running OutI decided today that I will begin procuring the implements needed. Just leaving my options open. I would go somewhere else, do something else, but I have been handed everything I've asked for within reason and I am still plagued with thoughts of suicide. I know my medication isn't working as well, anymore, but I don't want to even live with the shame of having been this way, being treated so sensitively and still feeling so weak and angry all the time.

Besides, when I think about being dead, it's like weight lifting off my shoulders. Anxiety at the hands of uncertainty, cruelty, inability to comprehend what makes all the badness worth it, I will struggle with this as long as I am alive. I am so sad and always confused, everybody wants me to hang in there like the darkness will suddenly end somehow. I know it will not.

I am uncomfortable with how this has all shaped up. The worst part is that suicide in itself is frowned upon, so I can't even just mention it, I have to just decide to do it. I have to carry this guilt of choosing extreme measures to stop these incessant thoughts. Even though these intense feeling ebb and flow, I want to catch them at their peak and take advantage of it to end this slow and painful shitshow.
