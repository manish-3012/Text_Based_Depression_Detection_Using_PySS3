I just want to write something.I just need to write something I guess. I have ADD, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, but I'm too poor to get any help or medication for it. at the moment, I'm working 20 hours a week and living in a really shitty apartment. there are days where I feel amazing, motivated, and actually wanting to do things, but then there are the low days when I'm like this. I'm thinking about getting a second job, which I could get no problem, but I have a feeling that it would make these low periods even worse.

I've had suicidal ideation for about 5 years now, and that's when I really noticed the depression kicking in. I've only had one suicide attempt and I took a gamble; I took 12 mg xanax and had about 6 shots of whiskey. I wasn't sure if that was enough to kill me, but I also left it to chance (after doing some research just now, I think that 12 mg xanax is nothing.) while I was doing this, I wrote in a journal just to document whatever I was feeling. I was out for 32 hours, but when I woke up I found that I had written a lot more than I remembered. I took it as a sign that I was supposed to be here and really haven't entertained the idea since.

because I lived, I feel like I'm supposed to be here... but why? I don't have any skills. I'm unmotivated. the only thing I want to do in life is sit and listen to music or be famous by making music, but I just know that isn't possible. as much as I want to believe, I just don't have the talent to do anything like that. I've been thinking about focusing on going back to school for a position in the medical field, but I also know that I'm just not smart enough for it.

it seems like the two things I want to do in life are unobtainable. I'm not good at making or maintaining relationships. I haven't made a friend in years. all of my friends are from high school, and they're like me; no aspirations to succeed. we're all just wasting away. I don't want to do that. I don't want to be anything less than someone great, but I know I am. I don't want to live as someone average. I have dreams, and they seem impossible to achieve with me being how I am.

I'm also gay and I hate that. I wish I were a woman, but I'm not. I constantly struggle with identity every day. some days, I feel content, some days I love myself, some days I hate myself. I'm just so fucking tired of not having a consistent view of things. I'm so flighty and I can't commit to anything. I feel like I'll never get anywhere in life. I'll live life in a dead-end job and that depresses me. I don't, can't live like this forever.

I'm almost set that, if I'm not successful or on the road to success by 30, I'm going to kill myself. I feel like I want to live, but at the same time I'm just so tired of trying things just to be disappointed in myself. I'm just so very tired. I wish I was someone greater than I am, but I am not.
