I want to kill myself beyond all elseThrowaway for obvious reasons

I canâ€™t fucking deal with life anymore.  Everyone hates me, my parents, people I havenâ€™t even met, it doesnâ€™t matter.  My parents hate me and treat me like shit because I said I was bisexual and trans.  They get me in trouble for the stupidest shit and think everything I say is a lie.  On top of that they wonâ€™t do anything to stop my uncle from constantly groping and touching me besides say â€œyouâ€™re overreactingâ€.  When I was 11 I was raped by my best friend (we are both biological guys) and now besides not being able to trust anyone, the only thing I can think about is someone doing it to me again Iâ€™m such a sick fuck, my parents saw me saying it once and threatened to take everything I had away if I didnâ€™t admit it.  The only thing they did was bring me to some shady place with armed guards where they asked me some random questions on a tape recorder.  They couldnâ€™t care fucking less about me.  Anybody I try to talk to just tells me to fuck off in one way or another and I canâ€™t even trust anyone after that sleepover.  Iâ€™m nothing but a useless slut that has never been good at anything besides being a breathing toy and Iâ€™m better off just killing myself, itâ€™s not like anyone would mind from what Iâ€™m seeing.  I hate myself and all I wish is to just die.
