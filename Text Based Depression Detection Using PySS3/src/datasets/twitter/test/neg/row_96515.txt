What is the purpose of life?Hello.

Some people in this group maybe know me because I've talked to lot of people who have (or had) suicide thoughts in this reddit group. I always told this people that it's worth it, to continue living but now I actually think why I said that. Seriously, what's the point in living? Most people live very simple lives and don't really question the purpose of their life. When they're kids/teenagers they go to school, then they work, maybe have a relationship, maybe have kids and then die someday. But what's the point of going through this boring cycle? Why not die now if we anyway now that we will die sooner or later? To continue living our lives as we do at the moment other ones have to suffer for us. If we eat meat animals are killed for us. Why? Just because so many idiots like the taste of meat and just take the future of those animals to eat a steak, etc. To live our lifes like that we have to oppress other species. We simply destroy natural habitats of animals just to build cities or villages in this places. The only thing that we cause on this world is pain. We harm the environment so that we can drive around in our big stupid SUVs and so on. And what for? No one thinks about that question. Why do people in general think that they're heros if they prevent a suicidal person from killing themselves (mostly even against their will)? Why? WHY? In greek mythology a story even says (I don't know which one) that humans only were created to amuse the gods and have no other reason to live. I know that I sound very selfish when I'm saying that, but I don't give a fuck how my family feels after they will find my dead body. What are the reasons why you guys continue living?
