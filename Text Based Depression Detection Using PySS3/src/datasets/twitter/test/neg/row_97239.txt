Still suicidal seven months after breakupAnd the relationship only lasted seven months as well. Heâ€™s with someone else and started dating her almost immediately after the breakup. I had a near fatal suicide attempt on the day he left me, and havenâ€™t felt okay since. 

Iâ€™ve done everything I can to try to feel better- starting Zoloft, working out, eating healthy, dating, getting a new place, getting back into my old hobbies, working (a lot), and making more money than I ever have in my life (quadrupled my income). I should feel optimistic right now but Iâ€™m just not. Heâ€™s all I can think about from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep (and dream about him). Iâ€™m desperately trying to fill this hole in my heart and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever be able to fall in love again. I have a consultation on the 30th for cosmetic surgery- never before did I think Iâ€™d have the opportunity to pay for this kind of thing in cash and I should be thrilled but Iâ€™m not. 

Iâ€™m currently working 12 hours a day as a webcam model and Iâ€™m stuck at home, living down the street from my ex. I canâ€™t even describe how miserable and lonely I am. I thought I was doing better but now all I can think about is killing myself again. Iâ€™ve never been more miserable in my life. Iâ€™ve never felt more worthless and hopeless. I so badly just want to love and be loved.
