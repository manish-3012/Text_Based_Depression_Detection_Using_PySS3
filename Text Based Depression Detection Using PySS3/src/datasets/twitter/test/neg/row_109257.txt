Picture this if you will.I had a moment of revelation about an hour ago as I sat here doing my homework. I discovered I have lost my battle with depression, and that I can't take the thoughts anymore. It's an absolutely helpless feeling and I feel awful for anyone else that has to go through that.  
I finally came to terms with a plan. I will be sitting at my desk doing my homework much like tonight with my laptop up and my papers strewn across my desk.  
I will get my favorite song that saved my life once before, Bob Marley's Don't Worry Be Happy to play on loop on iTunes at full volume. Then I will dial 911 and inform the dispatcher I have found a dead body, she'll ask who and I'll tell her it's my own. At that point I'll leave the phone connected to her as I set it on my desk and shove my 12 gauge over under into my mouth pointed up at the top of my spine, at the back of my brain. I'll pull the trigger listening to my favorite song, alone as I always am, in a sort of odd serenity I've created for myself.  
They'll come haul me away and family members going through my dresser will discover I've already written out a Will and notes to important people in my life written in pen, in a college ruled five star notebook.  
Everyone will move on eventually and the emptiness will no longer exist. And if all goes well my ex-fiance will feel like the despicable bitch she is for what she did, although she's not the only reason as that would be juvenile.
