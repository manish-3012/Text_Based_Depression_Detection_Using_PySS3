I'm done30 years old living with parents, only make 42k, stuck in a level 1 tech support job despite getting IT certs (CCNA) and applying for hundreds of jobs.

Girlfriend cheated on me and had a secret FWB. She wants to maintain the FWB and is pushing marriage on me.

Taking the blame for everything. I'm always painted as the bad guy anyway so why not just get rid of myself or be the bad guy. It's always the man's fault.

Wake up everyday feeling like shit and lonely. Always have to reach out to friends to hang out, they never ask me to hangout.

Being outgoing and idealistic only to get ahut down.

Have to see my therapist regularly as I'm not normal.

5'7, short, and not packing that much either.

At this point, I'm gonna either hang myself or crash my car.

The other option is to live but self medicate with drugs, alcohol, and escorts.

Yayyyyyyyyy
