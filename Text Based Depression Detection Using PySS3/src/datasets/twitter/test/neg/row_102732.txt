2019 was the worst year of my life.I've never been so fucking disappointed in my life. 2018 was the year I met the love of my life. Or, so I thought. From May of 2018 to god knows when in 2019, I have been talking to a guy whom made me feel like I was *unstoppable*. He made me happy, made me smile, made me laugh.

Yeah, we'd joke around and were practically inseparable. But, now I feel as if I made a mistake even being in his life. The things that have happened between him and I in these last few years have made me fucking wish for death. I never knew loving someone who had hurt you multiple times could be so hard. From all the shit he has said to me, verbally bringing me down. Constantly hurting my heart. Me being able to physically feel this shit *shatter*.. I may not make it far into 2020. I've lost him, I've got nothing. No job, no car, no friends. Nobody. 

Maybe it's good that he's not with me anymore, though. Cause, he practically cheated on me with some ugly ass 40 year old looking bitch, with a massive ass forehead and no lips. Can't be arsed to type anymore of this bullshit. It's all shambles, you can see that just from reading this crap. 

Kiss nemesis all you want. I'll be **dead** in 2020.
