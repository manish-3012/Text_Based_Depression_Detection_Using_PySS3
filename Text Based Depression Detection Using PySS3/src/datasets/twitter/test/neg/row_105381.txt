guys, i have suicidal tendancies, but i don't want to post here because i feel like i already know the comments you will have. why do you think statements like "don't do it, it gets better" are sufficient answers ?i feel like the answer "don't do it, think of all the people you're hurting" or "suicide is selfish" and "it gets better" are bullshit answers to be honest. can you imagine being numb for years on end, going through the same routine and then expecting things to get better? fuck that. of course i don't want to put my loved ones (really just my sister and one or two of my close friends) through pain, but shit man, i've got my own situation to think about. wouldn't it be selfish of them to deny me this?

anyway, prepare for wall of text:

my mom died 5 years ago. i go from feelings of intensely missing her to moments where i almost black out from rage about what she did to me and my sis. she was hit by a car walking home from the bus station at night in the cold because my dad didn't want to pick her up. kind of sums up their relationship up right there. since '01 when the planes hit the towers, my mom's bipolarity kind of manifested itself and she was convinced the government was following her. long before that, she was a horrible person to me and my sister (telling me repeatedly i was ugly inside and out, how i cost her her career, etc. and then apologizing profusely a few hours later, leaving me unsure how to feel and manipulated). she was brutal to my sister too. she told us she was going to divorce my dad when i was 5 and she 4, and that she couldn't come with us (i was her favorite in her weird way). however, this was difficult to reconcile because she genuinely seemed to care for us. if i was sick, she'd spend hours looking at her medical textbooks and worrying about what i might have (she was a doctor). looking back on it, i could see how she could have been having episodes or whatever of bipolarity/schizophrenia etc. 

my dad understandably removed himself from the situation and came home as late as possible so he didn't have to deal with our (or our mom's) bullshit (she turned us against him, even convincing my sister that when he hugged her, he was trying to sexually molest her, etc.)

to be honest, sometimes i feel pangs of regret for things i said to her. i even hit her a few times, and made her cry a bunch of times. as i matured into my teens, feelings of resentment for her two faced attack/apology habits coupled with my own raging hormones made me stop tolerating her shit. i became vicious with my words and used them to cut her, which sometimes i regret but most times don't. 

i guess you could say i was academically successful, went to a top college (always hovers around to t10 range), decent grades, managed to get a good job out of college, but got fired from that because of dumb shit (wearing jeans to work when you had to wear khakis/dress pants). cycle repeated itself for a bunch of years, i'd take a year off working, live off my savings, and then manage to get another decent job. i can't focus on work at all when i'm working, and i end up just worrying about fucking up and never actually get anything accomplished. i've tried taking adderall but that just makes me focus on random shit like the song i'm listening to in the background or the clock ticking etc., it usually doesn't help me work. this is really frustrating to me. i think it has to do with the fact that my parents would force me to study when i hated it, and i have a weird relationship with learning. i don't know. 

i recently got a job that pays 200k ish a year, but i'm pretty sure i'll fuck this one up too, and frankly i'm tired of being a fuck up. i take  drugs to numb this shit, but i can't right now because i have a drug test in a couple of weeks for the new job.  that coupled with the fact of my unresolved issues with my mom and dad (i dislike both of them), makes me pretty sure suicide is the right path out at this point. i'm almost 30 and i've been a fuck up as long as i can remember. i think i'm going to give myself until my 30th bday, and if shit is still fucked, i'm just going to end it. 

where am i going with this? i have no idea. why did i post this hear? i really don't know, i don't particularly expect anyone to talk me out of suicide. would love to hear your input but please, please stay away from the typical platitudes. honestly makes me roll my eyes when i read that stuff. 

cheers
