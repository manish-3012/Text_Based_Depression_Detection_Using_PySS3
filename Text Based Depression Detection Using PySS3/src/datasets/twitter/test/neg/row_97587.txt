A little over a week ago I wanted to kill myself. Today I still want to kill myself but not as much.I was debilitated to the point of not showering and not able to leave the house. I was praying to die. Now I take showers, wake up at the same time, eat healthy meals, but still low key want to die. Like if I went to sleep and never wake up or if I was miraculousy struck by lightening that'd be so wonderful but I am not actively thinking about hanging myself. Baby steps.
