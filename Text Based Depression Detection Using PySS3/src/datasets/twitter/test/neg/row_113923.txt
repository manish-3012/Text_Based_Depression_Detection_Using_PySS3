Lost my girlfriend. Feels like I lost my life.Just broke up with my live in girlfriend of 7 years. (live in: 2 years, dated 7)
I'm ADHD to the extreme, have severe social anxiety, and a fairly persistent cloud of depression.
I haven't had a friend or acquaintance (AT ALL) since I was 9.
I'm 22 now. Graduating this year with a bachelor's in psych and a minor in sociology.

I don't want to make friends.
I don't want another girlfriend.
I don't want to be a therapist.
I can't afford another college degree.
And I don't want to be with my family again.

She was the only reason I was still alive. Now she's gone.
I don't see myself having a future.
I'm sure at some point this year I'll do it.

Shame is I feel like I could keep living if only I had her in my life. But now I don't and I won't find anyone else. I am 100% sure I'll just be a lonely fuck wandering through life until I die. And I don't want to experience that. Might as well accelerate.

Wonder if any of y'all experienced this too. Losing the only person that gave you any hope of living.
