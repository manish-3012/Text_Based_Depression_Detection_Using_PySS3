Cancer?Several symptoms of cancer in/on my body, although I wished a couple of years back to get any sickness/disease. Since I was a pussy to hang/cut/fall/die and kill this irrelevant life. The only thing encouraging me to continue is my mediocre music,
Having no funds to afford beats, copyrights and all those fantsy equipment to buy. Well, not really mediocre, but exceptionally well written tbh. Reviews by several people commended and even wanted me to pursue, but I'm too overwhelmed and rather play video games to ease my depression. Sigh. Imma wait until it's stage 4, currently stage 2. Guess I'm an expiring  bomb.
