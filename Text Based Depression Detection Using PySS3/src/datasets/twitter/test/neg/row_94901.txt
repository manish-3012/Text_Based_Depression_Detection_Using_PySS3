My first love and friend commited suicide. A message to him. (Didn't know where else to post this)Last week I found out that you commited suicide.  I honestly have never felt so broken, like a knife straight to my heart.  Other people from highschool have passed but nothing could prepare me for this.

I find myself replaying every detail of our past in my head and it just hurts.  The moment I met you, us falling in love, breaking up, becoming friends and the list goes on.

I have old emails and letters that used to make me smile but now reading them just has me in tears.  I can honestly say nothing has ever hurt this much.

Even though we hadn't been together since highschool a part of me always loved you and felt like you were the one that got away.  I know maybe you didn't feel the same but even after so long I still cared for you so strongly.

I know the past year we hadn't talked because we were both so busy with life but now I regret that greatly.  I keep on thinking all this is one big dream and there is no way you are gone.

Even though we didn't talk much knowing you were living life and that you existed was enough to make me happy.  I never wanted to live in a world where you didn't exist and now I don't know wtf I'm doing.

I wish you had realized the effect all of this would have.  How much the people around you cared.  Now you have left us all behind trying to deal with losing you and let me tell you it sucks.

I really hope this gets easier because I'm sick of crying.  I just feel like part of my heart is gone forever and I don't know what to do.

I will always love you and where ever you are I hope you are happy.
