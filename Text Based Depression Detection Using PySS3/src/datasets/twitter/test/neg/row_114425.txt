Could you please talk with me?Hi, I'm almost 20 year old man with asperger. I recently started very hard studies of Microbiology. Unfortunately they turned out to be harder than I expected, and now I don't know what to do. I had suicidal thoughts before, I had antidepresants, but they destroyed my liver, so now I have to  take special medicines to repair it.

I feel bad and tired, I'm just different from all other people, and I don't have the power to keep pretending to be someone else. Suicidal thoughts are back, and they are stronger than ever.

I know nobody here can magically fix my life, but I just want to talk with someone.
