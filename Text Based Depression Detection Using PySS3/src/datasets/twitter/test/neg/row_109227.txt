I hate the way...I hate her.
I hate the way she makes me feel.

I hate the way that every time I see her name pop up on my screen, on my feed anywhere; I instantly get happy.

I hate the way that seeing her can make me smile and forget everything.

I hate the way her smile is one of the most intoxicating things I've ever seen.

I hate the way her laugh can make me laugh even if nothing was said.

I hate the way we *were* able to talk for hours about nonsense, but it still felt like we managed to connect on everything said. 

I hate the way we *used* to be able to give each other *that look* and know exactly what the other meant. Be it: "Look at that", "What's wrong?" anything.
The look was so unique that you knew what it meant regardless of situation; even though it just looked like a normal face to everyone else, we knew what it really was.

I hate the way that I *used* to know what was going on on a day-to-day basis and used to love hearing about all those quirks and ticks that set you off throughout the day. Now I barely know anything and you may as well be a stranger.

I hate the way that we used to be able to call each other up. Any time. Any where. And get an immediate answer. But now, I struggle to get a text back off you in the same week without getting the standard *"Sorry, missed your text"* 

I hate the way that you managed to make me feel so useless and worthless without trying.

I hate the way, that despite all the 'history' we had... You were able to throw me to one side so easily. 

I hate the way that, despite all the emotions you've put me through; you're still able to make me smile just by seeing your name.

I hate the way that every time I smell the perfume you used to wear is able to give me a few seconds of happiness but a day of feeling like crap.

I hate the way I never made a move. Looking back, it was so obvious. 

I hate the way I silently resent your boyfriend for having such a perfect girl but not even realising how lucky he is.

I hate the way we can't talk now for longer than 5 sentences without it getting awkward.

**Mainly**

***I hate the way you're so oblivious to this.***

I hate all of this about you, but I dare not say anything. 

Because for those minor seconds of the day where I see you sending me a goofy video of you on snap chat, a random text asking me what we have to do for class, the random flitter of eye contact we have and you smirk and leave me looking like a loved up fool. 

For those random few seconds of the day or week, I'm beside my self with how we used to be. I'm reminded of a part of my life where I was legitimately happy, where I finally had someone who cared about me and would make the effort to text/talk to me on a daily basis and could tell something was wrong just by a text.

Basically, I'm reminded of a time where I wasn't miserable every.fucking.day.
Where I put on a brave face day to day and pray I never get major news and break down and everyone see's just how much of a vulnerable, pathetic, useless person I am.

I hate you, but you don't know how much I still fucking love you.
