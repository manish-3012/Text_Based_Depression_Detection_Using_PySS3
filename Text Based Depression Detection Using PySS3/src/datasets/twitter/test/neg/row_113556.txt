Would my death really affect so many people?I saw a thread recently about someone who jumped from a workplace, and everyone in the comments were describing their own experiences with people killing thenselves at school or in college.

They say that everyone was effected and that the whole atmosphere changed. Is that really what would happen? I myself kinda have a hard time believing that if I killed myself it'd happen. Im a 10th grader and i've been in the same district my whole life, with the same people in my grade level. They know my name but no one really notices me. I've been alone so much, but I also talk just enough not to be known as the "quiet girl".

This kinda has ensured my spot as the invisible person. Would it really effect *everyone*? I feel like its a exaggeration.
