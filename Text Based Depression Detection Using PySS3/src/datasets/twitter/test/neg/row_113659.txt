I am trying to make myself cry.I just feel like crying. I don't really have a reason to cry(I've probably cried my life's worth already) but I'm feeling extra shitty and thinking about suicide and you know that great cathartic feeling you get after you cry, I just want that. I just want some respite from this haze I'm walking through.
