I think ending my life is the best optionHi there! 

Iâ€™m just sitting here,filled with sadness,grief and pain. Itâ€™s been a week since I was dumped and having any reason to be happy is pretty much non existent. Kind of funny donâ€™t you think? Lol well letâ€™s see here. Iâ€™ve got this box cutter from my work that were issued and i hold it and look at it with awe and Iâ€™m thinking to myself,wouldnâ€™t it be great it just use this to end it? That way,I no longer have to deal with the pain of not being loved by the person who meant so much to me? I think it would be a proper conclusion to this insane and
Cruel story known as life. 

I will be awaiting your responses as I sit here and admire this fine blade.
