I'm a failure to everyone because I'm unemployedI don't blame them. I'm not contributing and i sit around doing fuck all.

I have TMD, BPD and anxiety and depression. I dropped out of uni almost two years ago. Since then I've been on benefits. I live with my uncle. I give him Â£20 a week.

I gave up drugs and alcohol. But i started smoking cigarettes. I've gained about 80lbs in the past two years, mostly this past year since meeting my boyfriend.

I'm a failure to my family. My mum says she failed me and she knows it every time she sees me.

I'm looking at half a bottle of vodka and thinking about drinking the whole thing.

I'm such a failure
