What are we?Iâ€™ve had this thought stuck in my mind for a while now, what are we?

So far all I can think of is a statistic, a bump on the system, a device for others to toy with

As of now, I guess I have friends, but I canâ€™t tell if theyâ€™re friends, they care, but do they really care? If I told them how I really felt, would they report it? Would they listen and give advice? Would they become over protective? Will they try revolve life around me so that I fell special and important? Will they visibly change because they donâ€™t want to hurt me? Will they just leave me to deal with it on my own? 

And then therapists and doctors, they donâ€™t care, they just do the job because it works for them and it pays their bills, all theyâ€™d do is prescribe me some Xanax or something then tell me to come back if it doesnâ€™t work, then what? Bigger dose? Being locked up? And then if it did work, all it would do is just build up inside me, I go off, if something reminds me of it, snap, back to square one.

Guess medical history has something for it eh? Everyone in my mumâ€™s side had depression when they were young, i actually only know 1 male in my family other than myself so I canâ€™t really comment on that, currently dealing with acne and Iâ€™m taking tablets while also doing creams and tablets, just got braces put in today, having teeth pulled in 3-4 weeks, also know that my grandmother had glaucoma, and thatâ€™s starting to show on me. Schizophrenia might also be one thing that I have, all I ever do at school is sit there quietly waiting on a bell, always gives me a minute to have a chat with myself, recollect my thoughts per say. And then I have trust issues, I know I should trust people around me, but I canâ€™t, thereâ€™s fear that theyâ€™ll go against me, itâ€™s been done before, I tend to just go â€œone mishap, all mishapsâ€ so that doesnâ€™t help, donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even trusting this site, guess itâ€™s because of the more secrecy of it, less chance of me being directly approached.

And then thereâ€™s my dreaded 3 words, â€œare you okayâ€, Iâ€™ve heard it stated various times, but no one cares in all honesty, do they? If you say you are, they walk away, nothing else said, say no and they say sorry then walk away, so why bother asking it? And even then, what does it mean to be â€œokayâ€? Itâ€™s used to loosely, so much that I canâ€™t give it an appropriate meaning.

Honestly I would like to kill myself, is it selfish? Is it justifiable if I write out a note on why, going into depth? I walk past an active high way to get home from school every day, it wouldnâ€™t be hard, but then, if it wasnâ€™t fatal, then Iâ€™d be in a really bad shape wouldnâ€™t I? Iâ€™d get ridiculed for trying to kill myself, for being selfish, for not caring.

Anyways, I think thatâ€™s enough for me, Iâ€™m going to get off and go to sleep, itâ€™s almost midnight, if you want to talk, donâ€™t expect a response for at least 10 hours, and thanks for reading I guess, so t say it helped, but wonâ€™t deny it either, Iâ€™m not sure, you all have a good night
