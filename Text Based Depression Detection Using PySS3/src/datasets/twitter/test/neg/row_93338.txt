I can't see him anymoreHe's gone. I can't even see him in my head. The memories, dreams, thoughts are disappearing so quickly after so long. That was the last thing I had of him besides photos. I can see me and him together but his face is gone. In other memories he's just not there. Everything is a blur. I miss him so fucking much I can't do it. I never said goodbye, I never saw his body for the last time, never got to lay on his chest like I usually did before I went to sleep, never said I love you one last time. I can remember always listening to his heart beat. I would have never seen him coming. My whole life feels incomplete. Fake. Unreal. 

I can still remember us running back home through the woods, laughing after I fell over, scraped my knee and cried. The blue smurf balloon I got from McDonald slowly rising up to the clear sky. I can remember him hugging me. I can remember the exact spot. He was the best dad ever and I never even got to tell him. He gave me everything he never had. Attention, care, love. 

It feels so empty here without him. There's never been a clear sky anywhere since. Every place I went with him is now dark and cold whenever I go. He was the only one who kept me going. I'll always feel like this. There's no way out. He deserved so much better. He was finally recovering and doing so much better.
