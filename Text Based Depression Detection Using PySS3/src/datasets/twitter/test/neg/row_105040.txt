I have no friendsI tried really hard this school year. And I just donâ€™t understand how to get involved or hang out with people or get them to want to hang out with me. I have no friends. I just realized that again tonight. The one friend I did have stopped inviting me to things. I just feel mad jealously at their ability to be friends with people, and I realize theyâ€™re going to go farther in life than I ever will.
