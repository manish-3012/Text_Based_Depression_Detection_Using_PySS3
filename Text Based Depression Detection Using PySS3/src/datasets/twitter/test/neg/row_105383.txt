I feel like dying, but I donâ€™t want to die at the same time. Iâ€™m 18 and I donâ€™t know why im feeling like this so bad.For some reason itâ€™s like I canâ€™t function or be happy without a girl in my life. I donâ€™t know how to be happy all on my own and it sucks so bad. I have guy friends but itâ€™s like I donâ€™t care about them. It sounds mean but I prefer to have a girlfriend and to be hangout out with her whenever I have free time. I have 2 exâ€™s and my recent one broke up with me about a month ago, and she had basically chose the â€œhoeâ€ life which is why she dumped me quickly. For some reason all I do all day is think about girls how I used to be so happy with my ex. Now itâ€™s all gone because this girl decided to how around instead of sticking with me for however long we can. Another thing is that so many things are boring to me and I donâ€™t do anything either beside sit on my bed and do nothing. Iâ€™m going to get a job soon, but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be happy instead of constantly thinking about having a woman in my life. I wish I can be happy with or without a girl in my life to be with. It makes me want to die with how much bordem I have and itâ€™s hard for girls to like me back. It seems stupid but I just donâ€™t know why I want to really die. Can some people give me ideas of how I can try to
Be happy or how to find a perfect women who isnâ€™t a â€œhoeâ€.
