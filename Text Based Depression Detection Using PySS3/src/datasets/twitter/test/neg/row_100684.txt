lgbt people who suicidewhat do you think about lgbt people who suicide themselves? I mean, I think it's fair that someone can choose the time to die as it is some kind of autonomy, but at the same time, I think it's unfair when someone wishes to die because their life is unlivable.
by the way, some studies show that lgbt people is up to 7 times more likely to commit suicide than heterosexuals.
