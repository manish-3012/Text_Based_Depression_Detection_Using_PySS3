How?okay im a straight 19 year old hetero.
but i live in mordor (balkan) so women here are stupid and comlex. i dont care i dont need them. 

i would like to date myself before i move to western europe for a temporary while.

i am okay with autosexuality cause i know how it feels to be abused and not having to lean on anything but yourself. 

i slightly cross-dress in my room for 20 minutes to make myself my own girlfriend and i talk to the mirror with myself. i gave this female version of myself the name Tiffany.

i talk to myself thismway in front of the mirror and i onlymsee tiffany in front of my eyes- so i feel my male self, my male body, talking to a girl behind that mirror.
i can make my pitch into female easy causen i am a amateur singer in my shower haha.
its like socialising with the female friend that i never had.
plus i get to feel what a respectable man behaves like.

so how do i start this temporary secret romance?
