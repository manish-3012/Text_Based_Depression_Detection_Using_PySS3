I don't know what to doI don't know what to do. Everything seems so pointless and empty. I keep wishing I could just die everyday. But nothing's really wrong in my life? I'm studying things that I love, I have wonderful friends, my family's pretty okay too, I have plans for the future. I used to have hobbies but they all seem so pointless now. I'm not new to having suicidal thoughts but they're usually quite passive. Like just wishing I could end things when I'm feeling overwhelmed. But now it feels kind of like the opposite. I can't even tell if I'm feeling overwhelmed or just numb. I've been thinking of more specific plans, kind of have a date and way to end it all in my head, I've written a note and divided my possessions up nice and neat. 

I have a psychologist and GP who I talk to about my mental health problems. The last time I saw my GP I lied to him and told him I didn't need a suicide safety plan anymore, and I really want to cancel my last appointment with my psychologist because I really don't want to talk to her right now and have to be confronted with my thoughts. I don't want to talk to anyone about this, because I feel like I'm kind of just looking for attention. I feel like I'm just being a crybaby about this. Maybe I just convinced myself that I wanted to kill myself so I could tell others and have them shower their attention on me because I'm manipulative like that. I don't know. I feel so trapped.
