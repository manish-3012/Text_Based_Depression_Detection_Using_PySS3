Did you lose friends after an attemptI made a suicide attempt recently (took sleeping pills) and thankfully I survived unharmed after a friend rushed me to the hospital where I spent a week. I am now recovering mentally and emotionally and I currently donâ€™t have suicidal thoughts.

However, several of my closest friends have pulled away from me or turned against me.

The friend who took me to the hospital (who was my main source of support for the past year) has completely withdrawn and refuses to communicate with me (he says he doesnâ€™t hate me and that we will remain friends in the future, but that he currently needs zero contact).

A few close friends who were informed of my attempt as I was still unconscious in the hospital formed a Facebook group chat to try to figure out where I was and how to help. As soon as they could, they all called me with loving and supporting messages. However, as I was still hospitalized, that group chat (who I was not in, but a friend sent me screenshots) turned into a conversation bashing me, saying I always had a shitty personality, that I was looking for attention, that I was doing emotional blackmail and manipulation, and that it was better to just ignore me. Two friends (including my BFF for 15 years) said the meanest things, and two friends remained completely silent in the group chat. One of those who remained silent said that she needed time before she could speak to me again.

This really shocked me and saddened me. These friends were my closest friends, they knew I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts in the past and they had always been supportive. (For the record, we are all in our late 20s/early 30s).

Did any of you, attempt survivors, experience something like this? How do you explain it? How did you deal with it?

Thanks,
