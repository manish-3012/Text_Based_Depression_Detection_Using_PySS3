I'm doing it November 30thI don't really care anymore. The suffering is to great and it's become obvious painfully that my chronic pain while not get better and debilitating enough that I can't function. If it was just a matter of mental illness, than sure i'd be happy to try whatever drugs/therapy available, however because i am in chronic physical pain that will never get better, I have made the tough decision after a year of trying to avoid it. I am sorry.
