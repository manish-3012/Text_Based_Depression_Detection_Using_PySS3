I have never been happy, but I've tried so hard! I feel like I'm running out of hope.If I didn't have to worry about hurting people who know me or failing at a suicide attempt and dealing with the aftermath, I would love to end things. I don't know how to deal with this anymore, so I guess I would appreciate some advice.
