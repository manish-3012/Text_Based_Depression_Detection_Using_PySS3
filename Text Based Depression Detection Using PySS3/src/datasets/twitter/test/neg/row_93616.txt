I Will Never Be EnoughI don't know why it took me seventeen literally years to understands this, but since then I've been crushed over every tiny mistake I make. No one should be feeling that way, and yet I do! I can't help it! If I can't even remember I'm cooking tator tots and it nearly sets the house on fire, of course I'm useless! And a safety hazard! If I can't even get myself to walk to class then of course I'm a waste of space! The college doesn't care for me and my family would say I deserve it and my boyfriend is the only one who ever cares.

But I'm such a horrible girlfriend  to him! I cry all the time when he's always in an abusive and stressful environment with his family, and yet I have the gall to feel emotions like worthlessness and depression! How selfish can I be?! Just now he finally had some time to hang out with me after literally weeks of grinding and slaving to his abusers, but every night I stay up until he can sleep and even later (lately I've been pulling allnighters and getting no sleep)! And I kept falling asleep! And every time I did he would get annoyed! Of course he would! I'm being annoying and useless and rude and I just treat him so disgustingly I don't know why he's with me!

I want to die.

I want to be erased.

Everyone in my life will be better of without me.

I am not good enough.

I will never be enough.
