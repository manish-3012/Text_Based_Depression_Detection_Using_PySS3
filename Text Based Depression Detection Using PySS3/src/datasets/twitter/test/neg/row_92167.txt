A friend of mine is saying she's gonna kill herself, or get killed by someone else.She specifically told me not to call anyone on her. And to trust her, but for obvious reasons I can't. I know there's nothing I can do, if I do call, she'll hate me for life, even if it was needed. If I call, and it wasn't even needed, it may be the last drop for her to finally really snap. If I honour her wish and don't call anyone, and she ends up dead, I'll hate myself for the of my life. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and don't know what to do, if there's even anything I can do. I've pretty much made up my mind of not calling anyone and honouring her wishes, but I feel helpless and don't know what to do anymore. even just some distractions are appreciated.
