i feel like i upset people just by opening upit was a rough night tonight. i expressed to my friend and s/o that i wanted to die. they both were completely kind and comforted me, despite having hard nights as well. i feel awful and selfish now because they werenâ€™t ok but focused on me. iâ€™m a nuisance. i donâ€™t want to be alive and even after opening up about it, nothing has changed. i just feel worse.
