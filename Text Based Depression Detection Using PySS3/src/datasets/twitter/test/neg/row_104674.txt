if god exists he's a prick.christmas just gets more exhausting and depressing with each one that goes by. the only thing that makes me feel better is imagining a gun to my head pointed at my brainstem. i'm just pissing people off left and right and last week i proved that my family would be happier without me. 

i'm sick of this. i've fucking had enough. i didn't ask to be born so i shouldn't have to talked down from killing myself, i have the right to die just as i have the right to live. living is torture, and not just for me. i can guarantee you anyone that's seen my face would be much better off knowing i don't exist.

my mum hates me, my dad's sick of hiding his frustration with me, my sisters cry whenever i try to be around them. I DIDN'T ASK TO BE MISERABLE, I DIDN'T CONSENT TO BEING ALIVE. also my psychiatrist is also not wanting to assess me for autism and i mean that's fine but what if i do have ASD? what then? and if it's a sensory disorder it won't be diagnosable. what happens with me then?

i feel unheard, ignored, forgotten, hated, unloved, lonely, hopeless, and i don't know how but right now i feel already dead. i literally can't explain it, i just feel dead. like i already died, i'm just in a flashback of my life. my only hope is my gg uncle. he has tourette's and has been through some stuff i have. i'm seeing him soon. i want to talk with him. i need someone like me. to tell me i'm not just some shitbag making people's lives harder than they need to be.
