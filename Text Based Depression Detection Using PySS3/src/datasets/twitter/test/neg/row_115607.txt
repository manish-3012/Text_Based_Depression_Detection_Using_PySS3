I really hate this life. What am I waiting for?Please skip if you're pro-life, not interested in being talked out of it. 

What am I waiting for? I watched every video on Adam Meier Clayton's youtube channel. He ended up taking his own life after documenting his battle with chronic pain and depression. I watched each video and sometimes rewatch them to feel less alone. I love his videos. He says something I personally don't understand. He said he didn't hate life, and that life wasn't boring. He said that if he didn't have depression and chronic pain, he would hope to enjoy life. I have chronic illness and depression and anxiety. I don't enjoy life. I think it's boring. Mundane. Empty. I feel empty all of the time. I feel disconnected from my life and reality. I have no goals and aspirations except dying. I hate work and school. 

He said even if he didn't have depression, he still wouldn't want to live with the chronic illness. And he said if he didn't have the chronic illness, he still wouldn't want to live with the depression. It's a poor quality of life. I could relate to this so much. I don't want to live with either. Why? Why? Life feels empty to me. According to a doctor, that would be because of my depression. But nothing eases my depression. Antidepressants make me hypomanic, but never happy. I still feel agonizingly empty and sad on them, except I couldn't cry. 

Now I don't know what I'm waiting for. I want to jump soon. But what comes after? I don't know. But it's better then this quality of life.
