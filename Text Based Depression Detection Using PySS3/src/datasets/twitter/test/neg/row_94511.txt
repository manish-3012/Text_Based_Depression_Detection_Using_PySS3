Do you guys think about intentionally abusing drugs for the rest of your life?Iâ€™m suicidal, and Iâ€™m gonna die. Either today, tomorrow, or 70 years from now. It doesnâ€™t matter when to me. But I was thinking, if I just balled out and spent my whole life doing drugs I would die within a year maybe. This way I could just feel good and â€œhappyâ€ for the rest of my life. I would be content for the rest of my existence, and when my time came, I would be ready to welcome death. Just a thought Iâ€™ve been having recently. Anybody else been feeling the same?
