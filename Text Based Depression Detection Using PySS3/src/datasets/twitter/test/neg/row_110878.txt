I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. Too many failed relationships because of who I am.I'm typing this while I listen to my girlfriend tell me she's not sure if she loves me anymore. I'm bigendered. I enjoy both masculine and feminine activities. sometimes one side more than the other, but never to the point of body or gender dysphoria. think "in private drag-queen once in a blue moon" style indulgance.

This may be it for me. God I'm so sick of it all. Sick of who I am being what ruins my life and every fucking chance at love Iget. I can't love anymore because I know, deep down in my heart, they hate it. and today just fucking proves it. All I said was that I wanted to experiment with makeup and express my femininty a little, not even in public but in the privacy of home with trusted people. She knew all this before hand. I told her all of it when we first got serious, months ago..

Now that it's come up in a non-hypothetical way, she's not okay with it. At first she just said she would be okay with me doing it when not around her, and as muchas it hurt  because i wanted to share this with her, I compromised. But now she's just up and saying she may not love me anymore because of it.

God, and my last relationship ended because of this too. My ex's last words to me before the breakup?

"With the femininity thing, you'll never find anyone who will accept you."

well fuck if she wasn't right. OF course, she had her downsides but she was always smart. I'm so sick of this. I think it all out in my head and see the only places im gonna find anyone interested are fetish sites, and i dont want this to be the main reason why i'm loved or why someone is attracted to me!!!!!!

I can't take this anymore, i feel like im going to explode and cry and scream and pull my hair out... im listening to my girlfriend tell me now "we can still keep trying" but goddamnit I know how this will end.

with me, alone with that girly voice in my head that asks me why i deny doing stuff i like, and when i deny it i get so irritable. im so lost and confused and I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

fucking virgin too. at 26. yes because of this. because of who I am. A man who finds fun and comfort in expressing varying levels of femininity, oh and a diaper fetish. the whole fucking shebang.

someone please talk me down from this scary place :'(
