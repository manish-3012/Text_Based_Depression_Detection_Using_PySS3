I need help, desperatelyI'm relatively close to performing the act, I have had cries for help before but it always turned out worse than It was before. I haven't known happiness or anything for years now, I've nothing to be happy or proud about. I live with my parents but I don't talk to them, I spend about 15 hours a day/7 days a week on the computer and crying myself into sleep almost every day. I'm in a bad situation whereas I can't find a solution, I'm stuck in here. My parents don't really seem to care about me and have made my life miserable, literally. 


I've been in a depression for atleast the past three years, locking myself inside and being in my own little world. I got into a depression as I got bullied really hard and my cries for help were not heard, my friends turned against me aswell. In a span of 9 months I got verbally and physically abused where they made sure I felt like I was worth nothing. The days of me heading to school in the morning were terrible knowing what was waiting for me. I tried to get help on that school but resulted into getting myself into more problems (caused by them). I dropped out of school as my depression changed into anger and kicked out doors of classrooms etc. My mum decided it's better for me to change school. I changed school for about a year and dropped out of there as I didn't feel good there either resulting that I don't have a degree and haven't finished my school. Developed lots of medical issues due my bad 'state of life' caused by lots of stress. I went to a therapist for one year that didn't help me, he took advantage of me (money wise) and never really 'checked my case'. In these few years I got better at faking everything was okay, but my depression developed to my worst state ever so far, which I am in now. On top of that I get treated like a little kid whilst I'm 19 years old right now. My mum decides what I wear and when, wakes me up and talks to me like a little kid. If I can choose my clothing that I want to wear three times a year it would be a miracle. They don't really care about what I'm doing etc. They don't even know who I am exactly, they do not know what I'm capable of or what my interests are(I've literally asked them this). They also do not show interest in either listening or getting to know what I usually do. I'm practically just 'jailed' in this house. I became very good at faking I got better, if I would go outside (if i'd have to...) nobody notices it that I'm in a depression whatsoever, I just became good at being a normal person eventhought I'm not really one. 


I've never been able to chose what I'd like to study, the studies I used to do were decided by my parents. They've never let me do what I wanted to do. Now I'm here without a degree, not allowed to work by my parents and not allowed to go back to school. I'm literally stuck here, I want to move on but I can't. I get treated like a child and can't show my maturity in any way. They don't know shit about me and I wouldn't even call them my parents anymore. On top of that, my parents were never there for me as I've said above, also when it was really needed for example when in the middle of night I had to go to the hospital cause I could barely breath and my face was so swollen, my father refused to drive me to the hospital as he had to wake up 3 hours later for work and work was more important. I couldn't believe it but couldn't react to it at that given time, later when I got back home I cried and felt worth completely nothing. They are deciding how my life goes, instead I decide what I want to do with my life myself. I can go on and on for a while, I'm just not living my own life and my parents dont seem to understand it. When I had talks with my therapist he hinted to my mum that they (mum+dad) should involve themselves a little bit more in what I do so I don't feel abandonned or I don't feel like they don't care about me. She agreed and once we left the therapy-place it got back like it always was. My parents are very two-faced and bring me down as many times as they can.


I've thought about running away and start my life over again, but due myself not having enough money the plan is pretty much cancelled already.  I would just disappear to a different country and not get into touch with my parents anymore. I've also thought about suicide, alot of times as I don't feel like I'm worth living as I'm doing nothing with my life... 


I've also thought about sueing my parents for neglecting me which I can do but I don't see a point why I should, I'm not made like that. And also if I would sue them they would probably kick me out of the house anyway which results me in being homeless.


I really need someone to believe in me and have a good word with me, I feel that it would help me immensely. I'm getting desperate for help, Please. 

I'd also want to apologize for my English, it's not my mother tongue.
