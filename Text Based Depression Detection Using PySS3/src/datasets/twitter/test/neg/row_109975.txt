Just really sad, want to diei just want to rot in my bed. nothing is going well, i think im falling for someone and theyre a good friend but yet every other day I think theyre just trying to avoid me. every day i go from thinking that im lucky to have friends to thinking they hate me and theyre all just pretending to like me. im in debt and still unemployed. i want to kill myself. i just want life to stop.
