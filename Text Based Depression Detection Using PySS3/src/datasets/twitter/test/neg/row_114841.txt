Closer than everI always considered myself as strong person who can face any difficulties no matter how they can damage. Well, I used to be like this, but armor is shredding every time I endure problems and I don't think I have so much left.

I'll start from several years ago, I was going through puberty, tough times, you know, when suddenly my family fell apart. I noticed snowballing sometimes, but I didn't care much. Dad is pissed about mom's behavior, mom pissed about dads's behavior and I'm in the middle of it. I was living in the hell for half-year, witnessing conflicts almost everyday. I was bullied 24/7 back then, at home and in school, but I carried on. It resolved eventually and I got few lessons from it. Back and forth there were some other accidents, but I won't elaborate further.

Maybe it helped me a bit, at least I realized that I have hygiene problems and started working on it. Days passed, I slowly recovered, went to the gym (which was almost useless because my of eating disorder), life was stable. 

Fast forward to present. We (me and Dad) started a business, small pub. I discovered reddit, after that I found /r/pornfree and /r/fasting. I really believed in success of the business, we started roughly, borrowed money to stay alive for a few months.
I was at the peak in my life: eating healthy, got a job, stopped watching fucking porn (I discovered it 7 years ago), lost some weight (12 kg in a month). Nice, huh? Fat ugly kid finally transforming into adult! I thought the same, but time is cruel.

After all those problems we had with business, we discovered another one â€“ disappointment. Often, you believe in lovely words, see a perspective and this motivates you. For some time.

Why I am even on this sub and typing all this? I lost almost all I had before. Pornfree streak? Gone. Healthy eating? Gone. Positivity? Gone. I started skipping classes, I haven't done it before. Quality of my life at the moment is the worst I could imagine. I barely have money to buy food, meaning I'm eating cheap and junk shit. Damn, I haven't eaten for a few days. Not to mention internet, I'm in debt. My phone is barely working, sometimes I wonder how it's possible according to it's condition.
The worst problem â€“ debt in business. Business doesn't generate profit, only lesion. If early we had some money to pay rent and bills, dad borrowed money and sold his car, now we don't have any and we need to pay a rent tomorrow (about $1000). 

You may say that someone's living conditions worse than mine, it's 100% that, I won't disagree. All I want â€“ hear some words of wisdom or support, because I don't have people like that in my life. 

I need to bump SMM, buy ads, make some creative posts. And I don't have any motivation. All life I do things for "thanks", I only give and can't take anything. As enthusiastic person, I only want to see response of my actions, that's enough. But I don't get it even.

Tommorow (for me) I'll start my last attempts to rescue myself and business from a grave, because it's my only hope. I may succeed, I may not. Let's hope I won't end up at the bottom of the ocean.

Thanks to hearing me out. Have a good day.
