I'm done after 4 yearsWhat more have I left? I'm just useless, and everyone hated me. I tried living and dragging on for 4 years but now, it feels like I should've done what I've always wanted. I really wished my attempt long ago would've worked. I just wish I would have never existed just so people around me could have their peace. I'm losing this fight. And I don't think there's any part of me left to fight for myself. I'm so sorry to everyone I've hurt. I know there's nothing more I could do but maybe my death will bring a little peace to everyone around me. I'm sorry to everyone.
