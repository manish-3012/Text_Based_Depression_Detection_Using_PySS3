i dont see a point in doing anything anymorei really want to be happy and im trying all i can to do so but no matter what i try theres always something that ruins or reverses it, making everything i do seem pointless. shaving my body or facial hair (something i do because of gender dysphoria) gets reversed within a day or two. talking to my online friends becomes stressful for me when they aren't online to keep me company. even reaching out for professional help feels pointless, everytime i do something happens to ruin it.

the first time that i did reach out for professional help i was promised that i would be referred to a couple of places, one that would help me out with my dysphoria and one that would possibly get me an autism or adhd diagnosis. but i found out like a year after that neither of those places had me on any waiting lists. the second time i tried to reach out i couldnt even make an appointment with my doctor because of some computer system error and my case wasn't deemed urgent enough apparently.

i just want to give up, im sick of feeling like a worthless shell of a human
