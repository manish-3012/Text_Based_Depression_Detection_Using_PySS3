This world is too hard for me.Throughout my life I have been degraded, humiliated, alienated and just ignored. As a person and not,  literally ignored like I don't exist. This world being bleak and having no purpose, I have nothing to stride towards, work and stress put up on schools makes suicide seem very appealing. Forced mental and physical labour isn't good. I'd rather put an end to my miserable life than deal with people ever again.
