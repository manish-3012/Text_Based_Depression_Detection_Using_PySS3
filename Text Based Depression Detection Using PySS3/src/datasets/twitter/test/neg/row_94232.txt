I don't know what's wrong with meCompared to most of the posts on this subreddit I have a pretty great life. Currently in high school, doing well in school and all that. I have a great girlfriend, but something is always off. I think about suicide pretty daily. I don't think I could actually follow through with it, but it's always there in the back of my mind. How easy it would be to just give up. Recently it's been getting worse. I get 2-3 hours of sleep a night, not any tonight. I know my issues aren't anywhere near most of the people here, but I don't know why I feel like this. I got drunk for the first time today. I never used to be a kid who was even in an environment like that. It only made me feel worse. Suicide just seems like such an easy option, even though I could never do it. I guess I'm just posting here to wonder how I should move forward.
