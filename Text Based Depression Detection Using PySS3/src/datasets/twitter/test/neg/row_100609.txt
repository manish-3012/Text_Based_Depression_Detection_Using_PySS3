Noone i can turn toIt's abit of a rant.
I have been depressed for the past 2 years of my life, i'm studying for my diploma, but i hate my school. Everyday i go to school, i feel immense judgement being cast upon me by everyone, i do well in school with a gpa of 3.92 but i've still got 2 years to go and i just don't see how i can survive school anymore. I want to vent and seek help but i don't get to see my psychiatrist or therapist everyday, even though i feel so alone and desperate for help. Even the few of my friends aren't comfortable with talking to me about my depression and anxiety. They are talking to me about it over text but normally it just turns into some jokes. I don't want to burden them with my depression problems as well, that applies to my parents as well. So i'm just stuck suffering alone.

I've always been a studious person with anxiety and depression. I take anti depressions and a lil bit of medication for when my anxiety affects me too much. I want to quit school because i hate the environment i've been stuck in for so long i can't see me going through another year much less 2 years. If i quit school i'll be labelled a failure (if only my classmates who thought i had a bright future could see me now), universities won't allow me to enroll, my future may be doomed shld i try to leave school. My country has national service so if i quit school i won't be safe for long especially since i'm very unfit. I also don't really have anything that i'm particularly passionate about so if i leave school i'll have nothing to do. I looked into certain career paths but i'm afraid i'll find them boring after awhile.
I often have suicidal thoughts as well but don't follow through with anything as i'm scared i will fail.

I just want to disappear why can't god grant me this 1 wish.

I hope that you guys can help provide some of your thoughts about my situation, as i really have noone else i can turn to...
Thanks for the support
