Need someone to talk toApologies if this is the wrong place to post to or if I'm tying up valuable time/resources that could otherwise be used to save people, cos I guess I'm not actually gonna do anything, at least I spoke to my dad earlier and a friend and I've got some weed so I'm not that worried but I'm all alone and my entire life just fell apart and I really, really need someone to talk to. I have Skype and a UK mobile with tonnes of credit (mobile really works best, my laptop is shiiite). Um, thank you.
