In a crisis centerI finally told my bf that I havent been doing well, and mentioned i had a timeline that I'm trying not to act on. So he called the police, who said I either would be in the hospital for 3 days, or I could go to a crisis center. I cant miss work, so i went to the center. I'm supposed to be up in an hour or so and have only gotten 4 hrs of sleep. This hasnt helped me. I just feel worse cause now my loved ones know how ive been feeling. I could barely look at him as I was telling my bf cause he has told me a lot recently that he doesnt like how much i cry, and i dont mean to, but I do, so i was trying not to as i told him, and then he says its not the crying. He told me he just had to go to the bathroom, but then the cops came. I just wanted to hug him for a bit and see him, but instead ive got 4 hrs of sleep to function on for work later. I'm sorry this isnt super coherant, I'm really tired. I gave him the thing i was thinking of using and he still called the cops. Now all I want to do is find another way to do it cause i feel like I was just shuffled off to a place so i wouldnt cause them worry. I just....this didnt help and so now I just feel more alone than ever.
