I want to give upI am 23, almost 24, still in college and just was told today I will not be getting into my collegeâ€™s graphic design program. I dropped out of school my first semester because I was mentally ill and not ready to live alone. My family is conservative and homophobic and I am gay and queer. When I dropped out at 18 I lived on a strangers couch until he sexually assaulted me. 

I went back to school, changed my major from computer science to visual arts, and now I have too many credits to apply to the graphic design program. Theyâ€™re saving the few seats they have open for freshmen and sophomores. 

I work all the time to pay rent at a shitty job I hate and the friends I had all graduated and are achieving some goal. Iâ€™m going to graduate with a useless visual arts degree at 25/26 and continue working in food service. I want to die I have no family and no money and so many medical bills and college debt.
