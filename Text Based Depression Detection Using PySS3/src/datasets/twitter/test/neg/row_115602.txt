Is this all there is?I've become suicidal (again), and nobody knows.

It seems like no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, nothing ever gets better. Everything is just misery and futility. I'm 2 years out of college and making minimum wage. I've only had one interview for a real job since I graduated. Almost nobody likes or cares about me. 

Why go on? It's just going to be more of the same. No love, no success. Nothing but failure. As I've aged, I've realized how little control I have over my own life.

I even fantasize over how I'd do it. I would just... drive to the coast one night, and shoot myself while looking at the ocean. Either that or inject heroin for the first and final time, and die on a fluffy cloud.

I just want to escape. I want to wake up in a happy universe.
