Really wanting to die, all the timeI know I'm not the only one on here who feels this way or talks about it, but I need to air it all out before I do something stupid, I've tried several times to end it all, and nothing seems to work, 3 failed ODs and one failed hanging, one failed drowning, and cutting deep into my wrist and watching it bleed hoping it doesn't stop. Sometimes I just look around to see if I could kill myself with something around me. I'm not in a bad situation, I live in a first world country, a white male who was born into a bit of privilege, but also had two shitty, neglectful parents who had addictions and constantly fought, took me years to realize my mom was a terrible, abandoning alcoholic, and my dad couldn't force himself to properly care, and only recently got his shit together. My friends abandon me all the time, just lost 3 in the past week, got kicked out of school because they feel they can't keep me safe, and all the time I'm kept up because I feel like offing myself every minute of every day. I have two options remaining, at least options that are easily obtainable, death by my allergy, or death by OD on Tylenol, it sounded stupid at first but I was willing to try everything, so I got a bottle of extra strength Tylenol and hid it in my room, but after some googling I found out that it's an awful, slow, painful way to go. My allergy is to peanuts and all nuts, and I have some peanut butter chocolate on my bedside table that I look at, but suphocatting doesn't sound too great. Nothing is easy, or painless, or quick, especially where I live, but I want so badly to just die.
