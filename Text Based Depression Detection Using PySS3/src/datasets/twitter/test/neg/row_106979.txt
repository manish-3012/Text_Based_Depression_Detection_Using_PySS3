Does anyone know if its posible to call a suicide hotline in another country..I was thinking about the time i didn't have the Best mental wiew on the world, and an old memory came forh.

I wouldt like to apologize first an All for the bad english poor use of words an very bad use of periodes and commas i like to blame it on i am a 15 year old Boy from denmark...

Is it morally acceptable
