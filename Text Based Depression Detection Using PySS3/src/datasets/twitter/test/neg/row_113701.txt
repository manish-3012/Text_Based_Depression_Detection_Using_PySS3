I was told I deserve to be killed because I have autistic meltdownsI want to kill myself to get it over and done with.  I have uncontrollable autistic meltdowns and I deserve to be killed for them.  I feel subhuman and I'd rather get it over and done with instead of live my life in fear.  If I don't kill myself now I'll lose the courage to kill myself and end up living in fear that the police will kill me.  I was told that there is no excuse for having meltdowns and I deserve to be killed for them.  It is legal in my country to kill someone for that reason.

Sorry for the terrible grammar
