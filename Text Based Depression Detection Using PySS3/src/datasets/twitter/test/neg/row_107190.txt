My lifeI have nobody else to share this with, or nobody that actually cares. This is the story of my life. i need to put it somewhere and this seems fitting. i started out as a young boy with all the love any kid might have. both parents together in the same house and all the blissful ignorance of being a child. In junior high i met my first long term girlfriend whom i dated until around my sophomore year of high school at which point she left me for one of my friends. at this point i had already tried to commit suicide and cut myself multiple times. i was seeing a therapist and wasnâ€™t doing well. i lost all my best friends and became friends with a bunch of absolute losers. i covered my pain with drugs and alcohol at a young age. this destroyed me. i hadnâ€™t cried in years and covered my emotions every time i got sad with more and more substances until i had just about done them all in bigger quantities than most. at this point i gave up my last passion which was football. i was at an all time low. then i met a new girl and we really hit it off. we stayed up all night on face-time together when we couldnâ€™t see each other and fell asleep on facetime looking at each other too. she woke up one morning and told me she just wasnâ€™t feeling it anymore. for someone whoâ€™s felt cast away and not cared about for so long and to finally open up to someone and stop using substances and finally be happy just to have it al shut down on me i canâ€™t take it. i was starting to feel happy and excepted and loved after years of feeling like the worlds afterthought. i am here at my breaking point and i can not take it anymore. iâ€™ve heard every bit of advice , every sentence of support and i think i have finally come to the conclusion that i am not worth being alive. thank you for everyone who read this all the way through. every person who reads this all the way through gives my life meaning. thank you all.
