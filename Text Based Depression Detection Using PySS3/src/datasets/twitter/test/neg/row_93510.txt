Been in the mental health system half of my life, but getting worse.It might be that there's so much about my past traumas to unpack and work through, but it's like I'm at a point where it feels like all of them have sort of merged together into one huge cluster-fuck to the point I experience a ton of different intense negative emotions at the same time and find it incredibly hard to even be decently introspective about myself anymore. The combination of meds I was recently prescribed and insomnia have also been fighting to stop me from being able to get a handle on my recovery. I don't feel in control of it at all. It feels like this is happening at a rate I can't keep up with, and nothing I'm doing in terms of external efforts to heal is working. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here; I'm not exactly looking for advice or words or anything, it just feels like I need to spend time in this section with other people going through the same.
