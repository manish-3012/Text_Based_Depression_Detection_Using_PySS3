I wish I knew what my life entailed.No one told me my life would be a desire to die for nearly a half-decade straight, every moment of the day, with zero happiness and nothing but being forced to wear a mask every day for people whenever I have to work or meet people.

The present moment is something I literally have no idea what it's like to experience anymore, because I lost everything that mattered to me, and it is factually and literally impossible to rewind time and reverse the arrow of time and the events that have transpired. I have nothing and feel nothing but hate all of the time, and it doesn't matter if god is this mysterious all loving source, it doesn't matter because the world's laws are not. Certain people such as myself are born to be spat on and never rewarded with what they truly desire for even the most maximal selfless acts and sacrifices made. No one fucking gets what it's like to be on rock bottom except for the suicide interns (people who are brand new to the suicidal ideation club) or people who've already crossed through the portal from this hell into any place, any better place than this shithole we're living in, where we serve the powerful, the beautiful, the glorious, and the dominant, while we get nothing.

I wish I wasn't told you can do anything you put your mind to, because although some fuckers are allowed to, I have learned for myself that whoever is up there has strictly prohibited me from completing any task with even the slightest uncertainty. If I pursue a goal that has uncertainty to it, the odds are always shifted, every time I am close to putting my hand on it after slaving away... so that it is never reached. I hate everything about the asshole who created this planet or this program we're in. I hate what he's done to me. I never deserved this, I never mistreated anyone, and in return I get the worst mistreatment possible, and am still whipped every day into producing some bullshit, something for the laws of nature to acknowledge automatically and allow me to suffer for yet another fucking day. No one understands what it's like to lose everything and have every ounce of motivation and incentive removed.

This whole godamn ordeal would have been at least manageable for me to deal with if I was simply informed you're meant to suffer at least one-hundred times more than a human is normally meant to endure. I would at least be accede and say, "Okay, at least I know what I'm in for." But no, there was never a starting gun, never a warning shot, I just got slaughtered, and now have a permanent problem, not a temporary one that can ever be solved in my sorry fucked up life time, a permanent problem on my hands that kills me every day, and it hasn't gotten any better. I wish I was told I was on the path to war, and not the path to present-moment bliss. The last time I can remember living in the present moment was when I was a kid. I can't live in the present for the life of me, because I'm always disassociating into the past or the future, anywhere as far from the present as humanly possibly, so that I don't have to feel the flaming dagger in my heart and the twisting and muscle-breaking contraction of my brain with the pain of my sorrow which keeps me insomniac and awake all night, and stops me from being able to even so much as read or do anything of the sort.

It seems the only way life gets any better for me, and I've been practicing this for years, is to accept the fact my personal story is an absolute nightmare, and once I accept that, and know that this is where I am ordered to be, at least I can deal with it better. It doesn't make me want to live another day, but it at least lets me know I have some morbid, still ambiguous duty I have to align my actions with. To not be myself is the only way to happiness I can find, and being myself brings me nothing but sheer torture.
