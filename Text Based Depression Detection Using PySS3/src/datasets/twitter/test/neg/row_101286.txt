I think im immune to overdosing?!?!This is my first post I made the account to talk to people about this.

I have had depression a longgg time and been suicidal since the beginning. I have overdosed 6 times now, twice at the beginning of 2016, once last december, once last thursday and this thursday and then this friday too. 

I think I am somehow immune and it sucks in so many ways.

I took 15g of ibuprofen last thursday and felt only mild heartburn and discomfort that went away within 12 hours.

I took 8g of paracetamol this thursday as a tester, yakno? I know it will be a painful death so I wanted to see how much 8g hurt so I could decide if I am willing... I felt literally nothing. Fine.

I took 16g of paracetamol on friday and again feeling nothing, I have read up on it and know you can be asymptomatic and then get liver failure and im just waiting for that but i keep wondering if ive just metabolised it and why i seem to be immune??? 

24g of paracetamol within about 26 hours and on top of that 15g of ibuprofen from last week....and still I feel nothing....

Idk how to continue with all this im 21 next month and i weigh 10 stone/6ft/male i have researched it how much i took shouldve killed someone bigger than me but it has done nothing to me... help
