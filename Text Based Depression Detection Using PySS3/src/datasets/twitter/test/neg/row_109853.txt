How my life endedFirst, let me begin by saying that I wrote here before, but I am writing again under a different username and I've removed the previous submission to ensure anonimity. As requested, I will use paragraphs to keep ideas separated. The contents of my submission will be in the comments section, because it is too long to write it as text here. Each comment reply will continue my "novel" so if anyone wants to read it, they can read it in the order in which it was written.

Second, I would like to say a few things about this submission: the events presented are intentionally not in chronological order (unless otherwise specified).

In the following "novel" I will try to summarize the events and thoughts that led me to the conclusion that my life has no meaning on this planet and it never will. I have taken antidepressants for a while, but they didn't help much. They did make me feel better, but they didn't help me get over these thoughts. Please do not vote this, because I want it to get burried. I only hope that the wrong people won't find it, because I'll be really screwed if they did. That's the only bit of hope I have left.

This is a new accout, so reddit will probably limit the number of comments I am allowed to make so it may take a while to post it all.

**edit** I left out *a lot* of important things about my online life which contributed about 50% to my decision. I will write about that tomorrow.
