Snuff" Where did that bring you? Back to me. "

Not a nice place to write stuff. I will try to be as short as posible .... I have Aspergers (7-8 points more then it's needed to be positive on Simon Baron Cohen test), I have familial adonematous polyposis (colon/anal desease which will bring me colon cancer at the age od \~35, and I will die before 40 years of age).

Now, very simple. But very complicated ... I hate my life. And I'm not ashamed to say it ... my family is beyond fuckable. My brother is a verbally agressive moron, my mother's brain is stuck in fuckin 1940's and it hasen't evolved since. And she always takes side of that moron of my brother. My father is ...... well, smartass of his own kind. I'm more like that "cinderella story" girl ... Home slave while that dickhead of my brother is scratching his balls .....

I live in a Shitsville .... Where people got stuck in 1940's and also haven't evolved since then. Their brain got stuck there. And I hate every single person with that cancer of their brain. They are just annoying and dumb people, with their stupid shitsville way of thinking.

Now let's go to positive sides ....

I don't have collage .... I even wouldn't finished it, because of last year and a half, I was in hospital bed for ... \~ 6 months? So there is no point of me to even bother with collage ....

I have some shitty high school, where I can only clean glasses in local drunk people hang out bar, with full of morons ... for 300$ a mount. And my mother thinks it's a great job. Yeah right.

Here is a top of life, fuck first neighbour girl, get her pregnant 3 times, move into your own garage which was build in \~ 1930s, take money from bank, and be their slave for 40 years. And she fucking think that is super okey? Really? -.-

Now let's go to a brighter side ....

I found a way to get away from all of that ... I had huge passion for gaming on YouTube .... Ofc people in my genre of gaming are all cocksuckers who only care about money, and they play on being nice in public card, but they are bunch of morons ... Money hungry shitwaste whores. They don't care about "fans", they don't care about helping small people, they don't care about donating money to charity or make money donations to people who need it .... They care only how to get more money. And before we go there .... I don't care about houses, cars, buying bullshit, get cocky in public and all that shit. If I ever earn money from that .... I would probably donate 50% to like medical cases who needs money for hospital care and stuff like that. And other 50% I would probably split so my friends could have some pieces.

..... But as always, shame it won't happen. I gave up on that.

Now let's go to a bright side again ....

My doctor is a moron, he gave me 2 hernias above my legs after last colonoscopy ... So for last 10 months I'm walking like I had sex with Cristiano Ronaldo for 6 months without pause .... xD . He also gave me stomach hernia ... so stomach acid is slowly destroying my neck and mouth. My throat is hurting like hell last 3 weeks, I started to spit a lot of blood .... And the best part ... I can't do a shit about it.

They gave me some time to live really .... If I decide to go to stomach surgery, and to colon surgery. Both are extremly hard and I wouldn't make it .... And I don't want to spend my last days of life in hospital. And if on some miracle I make it .... I probably wouldn't recover ... My body is beyond fuckable. Like way beyond fuckable.

Well .... I will for sure get neck cancer in next 2 years ... And I haven't been on colonoscopy for 10 months ... I need to go on that also after one more leg-hernia surgery. Then be praying that leg hernia doesn't some back after colonoscopy ... And pray that I don't get cancer in this next 3-4-5 months .....

I just freakin' hate hospitals ... nurses are garbage. Cocky and not of nice behavour .... Doctors are morons who just cut you and then they throw you outside from their offices after 45 seconds .... I can't stand this anymore.

I just want to buy a plane ticket to somewhere on some private island on south pacific .. turn down all garbage and stay there ..... I just wanna sit on plane and drive for at least 12 hours.

The good thing if I decide not to live ..... I always wanted to go to Chester Bennington concert. Shame he saved my life few times, and I never saw Linkin Park show. When I die, I wanna do that. xD Meet Chester. \^\^

Also two other great guys who I adored, were Paul Walker , ... who gave me his passion for cars and racing, .... And Jules Bianchi ... Who I admire so much. I'm pretty much like Jules, that kind of person ... I see a lot of myself in Jules .... What an Angel ... Shame.

I'm not sure if I wanna write more ....
