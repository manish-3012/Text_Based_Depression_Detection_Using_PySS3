I find it hard to put into words how much I don't like myself or want to be here. Tomorrow is my last day.I'm 24 and I don't have one single thing I like about myself. I find it unbearable to be around any more. I am fat, disgusting looking with an even more disgusting personality. I've got no friends, no motivation, no skills, no hobbies and even my family don't care about me.

I feel like such a loser because for nearly 5 years now I've been attempting to teach myself computer programming but I keep failing tremendously even with other people trying to help then getting frustrated with me so i've decided to give up.

Never had any sort of relationship with a girl and I mean it's pretty obvious why anyway I have no personality I look disgusting and I am disgusting in every way. Also gave up with this.

Simply put nobody gives a fuck about me anymore including myself.

Tomorrow is my last day. I'm going to jump from a very tall bridge onto a free way with oncoming cars to ensure I do not live.
