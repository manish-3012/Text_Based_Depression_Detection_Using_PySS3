I just wanna diesometimes I feel like my life is just one big cycle and it just keeps rolling. same shit different day. I can't get out of my life sometimes I feel like the only option is to kill myself. When I try to get help I get so nervous I swell up and can't do anything about it. I can't seem to shake it off. friends keep my distracted school keeps it worse and my stepdad and me don't get along. I don't know what to do
