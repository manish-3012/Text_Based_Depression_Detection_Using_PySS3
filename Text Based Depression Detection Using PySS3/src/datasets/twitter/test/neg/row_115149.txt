What do I do? I lost the love of my life and now I spend every night going from wanting to sleep to avoid the pain or to stay up and embrace it.I just want it all to be over.  I fell in love and thought it would be great, but itâ€™s all over now. Heâ€™s gone. Someone told me today that I always wake up on the wrong side of the bed and I told them that itâ€™s because I would rather not wake up at all. Itâ€™s been over a month since the breakup and it only gets worse. I get desperate. I check my stories to see if heâ€™s viewed it, I still check his reddit account every day, though I think he made a new one :( The pain is so immense...
