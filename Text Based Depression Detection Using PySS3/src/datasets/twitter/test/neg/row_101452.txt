endsi want to be done trying. I want to be so fucking done. But I canâ€™t be!! because even when I want to die the most my stupid fucking brain motivates me to change and stay here. I donâ€™t understand. I want to be gone but I cant die. I always find something to hold on to and it never lasts. I always give up. so when will I stop trying?
