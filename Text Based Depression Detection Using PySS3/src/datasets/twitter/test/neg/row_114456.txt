Was gearing up to leave my wife, now she's pregnantBack again, my narcissistic wife of 12ish years told me a few months back that the reason we have only had sex maybe 15 times is because she doesn't find me attractive. "She loves me like a friend" That was after assuring me she just had a low sex drive for all those years.

So I was gearing up to leave, not easy as I have no money. She must have caught on to this and suddenly was open to more sex than we'd ever had. Now...she's pregnant. I'm too messed up to take care of a child. This has to of been planned by her. So maybe in my final act I can shake this all up.

When I was 21 my gf at the time got pregnant and took her life shortly after, not a day goes by that I don't think about what I could have done, and what things would be like if I had managed to stop her. Maybe my wife needs to feel a bit of.
