 got it all plannedI'm at the end of the line. I've been addicted to opiates for all of my adult life and now I'm stealing from my family again. I'm living with my aunt because all the rest of my family kicked me out. As soon as she finds out I stole from her I'm kicked out of here and living on the streets. I am a felon so I'm probily gonna go back to jail. None of my friends will answer my phone calls anymore. I had to move to a city 500 miles from my hometown. I'm a huge disappointment to my family. I've already got it planned I'm gonna take a lot of sleeping do some heroin and fall asleep in the car as its running in the garage. I would just slit my wrists but I'm to big of a pussy. I'm such a huge piece of shit and a waste of breath and space. I just don't want to fuck up anymore I just don't want to keep doing this I'm so tired. Everytime I have tried to get clean It ends in failure Can't really see any other way out of this. I don't even know why I'm posting this, It may be a cry for help but I'm anonymous on the internet not like anyone I know is going to read this.
