I don't know how I can go on.Posting on a throwaway, since my girlfriend knows my main account and I don't want to hurt her by having her read this.

My life fucking sucks. I'm a miserable pile of crap who can't do anything right. I'm living with my best friend and his parents because I got kicked out by my parents and I don't know how to keep going like this. I have no job, and finding a job has been impossible for me. I have Aspergers, clinical depression and anxiety, and a generally antisocial nature. I've only ever had one job, and I lost that job right before I got kicked out.

I don't even have a social life, I don't know how I got a girlfriend, but I have her. She's my only damn purpose right now, my guiding light, and I worry every damn second that that light is going to burn out and I'm going to be lost again.

The worst fucking part is that when I ask for advice, I just get told the same 10 things that have never worked for me. When I complain about being overstressed by life and by the people I live with, I get called "entitled" and "lazy". But fuck, I'm trying my ass off to not be like that... I apply for 10 jobs a week or so, because that's the average my brain can handle without burning out. I pitch in around the house as much as I'm asked, and sometimes even when not asked... I do as much as I can to contribute in other ways than financially, but it seems like no one really gives a fuck about that.

God, I wish I could just die... Get hit by a car biking home from college or something out of my control like that. The only reason I don't plan on actually killing myself is because of my girlfriend. But if something were to happen and I were forced to act or die... I'd choose death gladly.
