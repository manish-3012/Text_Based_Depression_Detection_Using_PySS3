A little worriedDuring school today, one of my friends told me, everyone gets suicidal thoughts sometimes so shouldnâ€™t take it seriously. Iâ€™m not sure what to do now. Peoples opinions of me matter so much to the point that Iâ€™ll cry because someone dislikes one small thing about me. It makes me feel like Iâ€™m not good enough and my self esteem goes down the drain.

If I get help for being suicidal, Iâ€™m sure my friends will just think Iâ€™m faking it or looking for attention. I hate the idea of counselling in person since talking to people about my problems is something I hate to do since Iâ€™m awkward and itâ€™s really hard to do once youâ€™re in front of them. Iâ€™ve struggled with self harm and just fall into a cycle of feeling bad, self harming, feeling bad again and then doing it again.

Iâ€™d like it if someone could just talk to me
