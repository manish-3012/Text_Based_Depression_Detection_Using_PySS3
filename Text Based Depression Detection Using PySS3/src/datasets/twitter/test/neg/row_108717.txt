I just want the pain to stopNothing makes me happy
Humanity is shitty 
I hate everyone even the people I pretend to like 
I'll never trust anyone
I hate myself. All I do is make mistakes. 
I have a mental illness that's ruined my life and is apparently untreatable

I have people who care but they can't help me. I just want it to stop.
