I don't know why I keep tryingMy mom literally just told me that I can't be a biologist because I'm not doing well at Uni due to health issues (she thinks are made up), and that I should stop trying. Even though being a biologist is the only goal I have.

It was like this from the beginning. She never supported me on this; always saying "what you chose is really difficult, why don't you pick something else?"

I *don't* want to do anything else. The only thing that keeps me going is this goal. And if I can't do well in a career I like I'm gonna do even worse when studying something I don't like. My fucking health issues won't magically disappear if I study something else. I wonder what having an actually supportive mom who encourages you in what you do and believes you when you tell her about your health is like...

She was the one who brought me into this world but for what? Now I'm gonna be alone and have NOTHING. I'm not gonna have a college education and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life working miserable jobs IF I can, which I probably won't thanks to my social anxiety and myriad other health problems. I will achieve absolutely nothing. What a great life! I canâ€™t wait to be depressed for the rest of it.

Just kidding; I won't because if I have to live like that I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna do it this year, I don't care. I've been suicidal since I was 14 and I managed to push on for 8 fucking years. Nothing has changed. My life is still a nightmare. My therapist isn't helping. No one ever helps and I'm more alone than Adam on Mother's Day.

For how longer do I have to keep feeling like this? I love myself and I know I deserve much better. I'm so tired. I need to make all of this stop.
