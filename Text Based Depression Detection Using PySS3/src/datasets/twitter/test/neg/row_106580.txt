I mentally canâ€™t take anymore and I feel empty and worthlessIm so sorry if this is super long, Iâ€™m just gonna let everything outta my system, not because I want people to feel bad I just hope this makes me feel better to write it all out, Iâ€™m sorry if this is crappy writing itâ€™s late and I walked around all day. 

So it all began in the later years of middle school, I get diagnosed with a learning disability and I get put into a special class room, only for math though. My friends make fun of me and belittle and make me feel dumb for about anything, like they had to make me know I was not as smart as they were and they always get visibly upset when I was correct about things, this gives me major anxiety and confidence issues, my friends also continued this trend into high school. 

In high school all my friends, stop talking to me around 11th grade, I have no friends what so ever, Iâ€™m lonely and I hate it , but itâ€™s also comfortable at the same time. I go to therapy every now and then but I guess things are decent. In my senior year things take a nose dive, Iâ€™ve always had depression and ever since a little kid for reasons I canâ€™t remember. My parents force me to get a job and I hate it, it gets in the way of my school work and happiness and I begin to crumble, my mom said she would hate me and treat me like shit if I quit, she lets me quit about a month later. Ever since then itâ€™s littered with horribleness. I almost Fail senior year, I miss about a month of school, my mom tells me all the time Iâ€™m ruining her happiness, her marriage and that my dad and her hate eachother now, I caused my dads diabetes. I had a breakdown and my dad comes downstairs to try to punch me in the face. I cut myself constantly and try to overdose constantly on anti depressants, I get another job I didnâ€™t want, I miss a lot of work to be with my then girlfriend, she lived far so it was a nice Escape, it was until Iâ€™d get harassed by my mom to come home and bully me. I tried to talk to my sisters and say sorry for issues I donâ€™t wanna. Get into, they brush it off as too bad and we dealt with it, I know they resent me. I feel everyoneâ€™s hate and it starts to eat at me.

My girlfriend becomes pregnant, my mom tries everything to make me believe itâ€™s not mine, it causes anxiety, but Iâ€™m happy this baby is making me happy and Iâ€™m only 20, everything feel right. Well I wake up one night with my feet wet, I hear my girlfriend crying and calling my name, I get up and realize thereâ€™s blood all over the bed, I wake up her mom and we rush to the hospital. My girlfriends miscarries, Iâ€™m broken completely, I try to tell my family and no one cares at all, they were just trying to make sure I went to work the next day, and I was forced too. I just lost my baby and I couldnâ€™t be there to grieve with my girlfriend, I had to leave her alone, while I heard her crying and yelling at me because I left. This breaks me, I blame myself for her miscarriage and wish I could have done anything to make things better for her.

So itâ€™s been two years since Iâ€™ve graduated, things arenâ€™t as bad but the scars are still there, and I cry and I feel everything that was ever said. Then two days ago happened. My sisters are moving out and they buy a couch, they donâ€™t tell me about, the couch is still disassembled so I donâ€™t know what it is, my dog is being bad and barking at me and such, so I Leave him downstairs to cool off and relax, itâ€™s a winter dog, so this heat is hard On him. He ended up tearing two holes in the new couch my sisters had gotten, granted it was at the back so no one would see it. I say sorry and it was a very honest mistake, my sister says next time that happens you owe me 500 bucks, I get mad because thatâ€™s kind of Ridiculous to me, she goes on to say thatâ€™s the real world, now my sister is the person that doesnâ€™t care what anyone things, therefore shes very rude and has no filter, and that bothers me, I donâ€™t know how it happened but I start telling her how rude she is all the time and that itâ€™s not funny nor cool itâ€™s jsut really mean and rude, she goes on to tell me about how bad I am as person, how lazy, childish and what not, sheâ€™s just going off, and completely missing the point if why I was mad. I leave the argument to go to my room and she follows me, the whole time saying how horrible I am. I want to say I walked away 3 times while she berates me about how much I suck basically, then she starts smacking me and abusing me, even though I walked away 3 times, the last thing she says to me is that she hates and wishes I was dead, she even goated me on to hit her which I didnâ€™t, the worse part is that my two sisters start crying in front of my room, In front of me while one of my sisters, is saying how much she hates me and how easy I have it, while the other one is saying she knows. I havenâ€™t spoken to them since, I donâ€™t plan too either, that ended our time as siblings. 

Now Iâ€™ve tried to explain countless times, Iâ€™ve been going through so much internally that getting job just didnâ€™t seem okay for me, Iâ€™ve had so much abuse that I canâ€™t handle it, I canâ€™t handle a lot anymore. I like making money because Iâ€™m human, but it never seems at the right cost anymore. 

Basically I want to die even harder. I donâ€™t even see a reason anymore. Words canâ€™t describe it. I just canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™ve been my families punching bag and scapegoat. I canâ€™t deal with all this pressure and hate I feel all the time.

Iâ€™m sorry that this is so long and boring or has bad grammar
