The Lie of LivingThe Lie of Living: This is a prose lacking of any substance, this denotes my current state. A substanceless being that can only reproduce the accountâ€™s of others. In my own lacking of essence of life, my prose shall be a systematic approach to the reduction of life. This may sound quite unsettling, but it is the only rational conclusion to my suffering. A faceless entity that inhabits a strangely shaped temporal being known as me. I cannot truly define myself as a part of my own existence, this is the essence of living which I lack. I have a distance between who I am, and what I am. I am different, that I have always known with a strange certainty. I have existed in a state uniquely different to my peers, it sounds arrogant to say. It is not some blessing but rather a curse, I fear the many duplicitous faces that human beings hide. Yet past the fear, I have always been curious as to the thoughts of the people I exist in close proximity. Autonomous moving being who often have varying thoughts of my own existence, perceptions that define their interactions with me. To my mother I am a son, to my teacher I am a student, to my friends I am a comrade, and to God I am a slave. Before I could understand what I was, I knew what I was in the eyes of others. It is not some critique of the concept of nature vs nurture with a focus on nurture. But in a sense I do not have that a sense of self that is unique to my so called peers. Where they can find pleasure in the most banal of things, I could not help but feel puzzled. The act of eating which evokes some kind of primal pleasure in the glazed over eyes of my family, I lack almost entirely. I often ate as if it were a chore, a daily maintenance that was only mind numbingly tedious. The very act is rather disgusting, to simply stuff a slobbering grinding machine with the sustenance of life to be mashed and digested. While I was conversing with an acquaintance of mine, going through the process of social bonding. She started to ask me an almost machine like set of predetermined questions about various topics. How did I feel about this or that? It felt as though she was testing my ability to feel, to assess if I had any humanity. I answered her questions sufficiently until she said to me â€œI just adore pine trees, what is your favorite tree?â€ I felt tongue tied, how does one begin to evaluate a tree? As if some guidelines had been decided and given to others but not me? How was I supposed to perceive things as good or bad? I was born with no guidebook to evaluating life in its many forms, I could only steal the superfluous words of those around me. I myself believe in nothing, so my views are merely regurtiations for the sake of social acceptance. I often feared that one day I would be found out, that I was lacking the most essential parts of humanity. They would recognize my otherness, they would then reject me. I for some reason believed my pretending would one day become reality. I hoped to one day regain my lost humanity, because I presumed I had it at all. One day in a hopeless stupor, I decided to retrace my steps. I wrote a long dialogue regarding myself, in which I presented my myriad of representations. Amalgamations of my various parts, and I scrutinized each and everyone of them. The first part of me was born from physical abuse, my father often emphasized a simple point to me. â€œYou are a worthless disappointment of a son, God will damn you to hell.â€ He would often roar at me after leaving me physically broken. I would sleep in my own blood and tears, with my mother coldly looking on as it was my fault for provoking him. I was a rebellious child who was forced to learn about a foreign God, a god who would damn my eternal soul to hell for not loving him. I would question if this God had already damned me. Otherwise why would he torture me so? My name means the slave of God, and it was this rhetoric that inspired in me a sense of worthlessness. We are told that God loves us, yet I am a slave? God loves a worthless slave? For a short time where I was in â€œGodâ€™sâ€ favor, I thought only God could ever love me. Yet once my own father brought down Godâ€™s damnation upon me, I accepted that I was a worthless slave. One that even God could not love, and that hatred extended to Godâ€™s children. I was nothing more than a slave, and my peers are the children of God. I was given the role of the dutiful holy son, a role that I could not play. My punishment for failing to fit my role, was to be a slave to the children of God. A loving advisor was my fatherâ€™s God given role, who was to help me complete my guidebook. Instead of advice and love, I was given hate and misery. The second part of me was born from emotional abuse, I would often be bullied and coerced into various predicaments. As I child though I tried to conform to the social standards, and although I often succeeded. I would almost always be found out to be no more than a fraud, and consistently I would be ridiculed for it. I was afraid of being beaten by the kids at my school, so I lied about having a big older brother. In reality I was the oldest in my family, yet with the certainty of my tongue they believed it. Until my youngest sister unexpectedly sold me out, I would often hold grudges with her. She would conspire with her other sister to cause me hell as I was not performing my role as a brother. I have been called all manners of names, and given every type of injury. I remember when an older child named Jonathan and his group told me, â€œYou think youâ€™re funny, and youâ€™re right. You are nothing but a dumb joke, thatâ€™d be better off dead.â€ My sisters who stood by the side giggling at the comments, only furthered my otherness. This pattern was often drawn out, where I would often confide in one person. They would betray my trust, and sick the dogs on me to see me squirm. My parents would then contribute to this cycle by believing I was merely a problem child. I would transfer from school to school, and they would always find out I lacked a guidebook. After a time, I learned to embrace my role, the bullied buffoon. The entertainer, I made myself believe the insults were teasing and that I was happy. But underneath all that buffoonery was a weary mind, that could not lie to itself. The third part of me is the sexually abused self, this part of myself has been hidden for the longest time. He was the root of my substanceless existence, as he has been missing. Part of my otherness comes from my lack of experience, I was to interact with students in another country while I myself had amnesia. I had lost all my memories from 8 and younger, I was completely unaware of the customs of being human. Because I for the sake of my own sanity, sealed away my own humanity. That chronic lack of humanity seeped into my existence, until it took over all that I was. When I discovered these hidden memories, it was purely by coincidence. I had read an article on sexual abuse, and it started to get to the details of the attack. As my eyes scanned over each word, my breathing started to get heavy. I started to see flashes, and her face as she strangled me into submission. She forced me down in the comfort of her own home, and without the monitoring of an adult. She proceeded to do the most vile human acts to me, and I my muffled screams were heard by no one. She would do it with increasing intensity, waiting for the leave of adults to do it again, and again, and again. I felt each time that part of me would be lost, and I would contemplate telling my parents of the crime committed against me. But I was a man, I would one day inherit the family name. I was to radiate strength and to dominate others, to be dominated and weak was shameful. I held that my only redemption and hope at regaining my lost humanity, was to hide the truth. So each time after, I would deny the truth and slowly it would fade away. Coming to this country, my mind became a Tabula Rasa. Completely empty and blank, at least on the surface. But the sacrifice was my humanity, which I would never truly regain. Re-experiencing the memory in my dreams, in waking life would often torture me. I feared sleep so much, I had to force myself to sleep with sleeping pills. The already foreign people around me seemed more foreign, I could see in their eyes her demonic glint. An appraising look, one that gave me more roles. My otherness is founded on my belief in my worthlessness, I know with certainty that I am nothing more than a failure, I am a less than human slave to the roles that I have been given. I can no longer trust anyone, Iâ€™ve heard many a times the honeyed words of love. A language completely foreign to me, what I truly know in my life is the language of hate. Hearing compliments, hearing friendship, hearing love, and worst of all pity. They feel like the lies of demons, I will never believe the words of humans. Who I am is something I do not truly know, I only know what I am not. I am not a good friend, I am not anything worthwhile, I am not human. What I am is a slave to the children of God, a jester deeply terrified of humanity. The things that humans understand about themselves, about who they are objectively and subjectively. Their understanding about how to evaluate and navigate the world, are completely foreign to me. I blame my lack of cunning, and wit for all my blunders throughout my life. I am nothing more than a funny disaster, one whoâ€™s buffoonery inspires happiness in otherâ€™s minds. When you go to the zoo, you go there to see the strange forms of life. To laugh at their pitiful existences, and to get a strange sense of superiority founded from your differences. Humans are truly foreign to me, because I lack the essential qualities of a human. Instead I am nothing more than a failure as a son, friend, brother, student, slave, and as a human. I am a failure in every sense of the word. I once believed my act would become reality, because I believed that the humanity I sealed in myself was waiting for me. But after opening the seal I found nothing more than emptiness, a rotted corpse of a little boy of 8 years old boy. I have forgotten what I set out to do, to reduce humanity into an essence that I could clearly define. But I now only feel more confused as to what it means to be human, I am acutely aware I am lacking somehow. My life is a life of shame, one of unending failure. I realize now that I have been dead for a long time, and up to now I have merely been living a lie, the lie of living.
