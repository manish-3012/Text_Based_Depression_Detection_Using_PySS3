It feels enoughI been dealing (or battling if you like) with anxiety, depression and suicide thoughts all my life, I've been in and out of psych treatment as well as almost continuos psich treatment.
At first I just felt bad of "coming out" with what I felt, i was 22 on my first  and only real attempt (which was so close it hurt like hell to have missed) I was under treatment but I could not handle the pain, the frustration, the feeling that this was it, I spent a few days in coma, another few in ICU and under psych evaluation, and of course being the very well adjust functional depressive person I am I was able to convince everyone it was just the pressure of the moment, I just broken up with my bf and nothing more.
It's been 9 years since then and I have lived a very full life (can't say happy, I'm not a happy dude, I'm a ball of anxiety, stress and depression, I can't find joy in anything that's not shiny and new, and even then the joy only last a until I process the situation and it becomes routine).
Why do I write?
Cause I decided that this is my last year, I don't have the strength to keep up, I'm heavily medicated, i try to deal with it in therapy, I reach out to my family and friends, and even though I have all the tools recommended to "be ok", I am not.
And the awful thing is I'm tired, I can't keep up with the effort of being a person, sadly I need to as i can't just lay on a bed or couch (I feel useless and in the end I just get up and start doing things, which only make me feel awful cause I can't even enjoy a good rest)
My head is all over right now, but the thought that keeps coming back is that if I had terminal cancer no one would argue with me that it is ok to die, but no I am "just" depressed, being depressed does not count, because it's all in my head, and come on your head is not that important right?
It's been 16 years now, and I'm quite frankly tired, i've done a lot, I work my ass off, have a social life, travel, play sports, fall in love, have pets, don't have debt and even though all is good I just want the pain to end, and no one can fucking understand it, no one gets that I ache deep in my heart everytime I think about facing a new day, that waking up every morning is a fucking job in itself, or that I fantasize about what's would be the best way to get killed by accident so no one should feel bad, cause there's that too, I don't just have to carry myself I have all the feelings of the people in in touch with to deal with, so if I killed myself it's not just a how, but also a whom should I give answer for them to have closure and to make this less painful.
I keep collecting this excuses to avoid doing it like who would take care of my pets? How will the manage my replacement at work? How are they going to explain it to my nephew's? 
And in the end is just more weight on the backpack that coincidentally just makes me wanna killed myself.
I'm tired, I could sleep whole days (and I have done it), I know it does not have a cure, so why just not end it for once and for all.
I'm rambling I know, I try to find reasons to do and don't and everytime the do's win, and I want to live, but I don't want it to keep hurting me.

Sorry for the long post.
Thanks for reading.
