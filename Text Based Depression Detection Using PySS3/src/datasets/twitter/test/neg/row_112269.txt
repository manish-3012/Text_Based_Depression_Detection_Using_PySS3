I'm definitely suicidal, what can help me out of it?I've been semi-suicidal for a long time, I've known for at least 4 years that I want off of this ride, but now the thoughts are getting way more intense. I am really depressed. I have a lot of great people around me who I could talk to, but in the end I know I don't want to live anymore. I have nothing to do in life and there is nothing I want to do, there is no way forward for me, I just want to be dead. I don't want to try any more medications/drugs/supplements, they don't work and they make me feel shitty or tired all the time. I don't even know if I want to be helped, but I should try I guess.
