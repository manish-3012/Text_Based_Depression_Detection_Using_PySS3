Please, please talk to me. I am so alone.I feel like I can't do this anymore.  I had the most horrific depressive episode in 2015 with two capital-T traumatizing run-ins with inpatient psychiatric care.  I won't survive another episode like this, and I feel myself sliding, fast.

All I've wanted to do over the past four years is go back to grad school, and now I'm here all I'm doing is fucking it up with my drug addiction.  I'm so lonely, and it's heartbreaking.  I've been looking for a therapist in my new location since before I moved to go to school (that's about 8 months now) with no luck.

My ex-boyfriend (we dated for about six years, have been broken up for two) has been doing someone new for about four months.  I don't care, I'm not jealous, but he was my best friends.  Now he never contacts me, doesn't respond to my texts, and just told me that we shouldn't exchange holiday/bday presents (we both have bdays at around the same time) because 'I'm just his ex now.'  I'm not stalking him, I give him plenty of room (he also lives across the country), and now tonight I really feel I lost my best friend.

I know about CTL, I know about 7 Cups of Tea, I know about the Samaritans, I know about the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.  I have actually worked for two of those  I've tried meditation, yoga, and exercise.  I'm on antidepressants.  I try to practice self-compassion and self-acceptance everyday.

I can go on, but I mostly just need some support, to know I'm not alone.  I think it's just so tragic how little people are willing to give to each other in 'real life' and then this bullshit narrative of 'if only they had reached out' comes out when someone actually completes a suicide.

Throwaway, for obvious reasons.
