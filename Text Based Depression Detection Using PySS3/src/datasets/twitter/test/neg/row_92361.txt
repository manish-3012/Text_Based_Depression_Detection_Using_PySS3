HelpOkay so I feel like I am slowly being pushed past my breaking point. I don't want to commit suicide, I just am in a position right now where I can't promise I won't try it. The past week I have done everything to prevent that from happening but I feel drained and can't keep doing this on my own or I might do something I'll regret. The thing is, I want help but I get really bad episodes where I am basically erasing every rational thought I ever had.   
I want to go to a clinic, but my parents would a) never forgive me and b) never take me there if I were to tell them by myself. The situation is difficult. I have an appointment with my therapist on Thursday, which can't be held earlier in the week. I don't know if I will be able to pull through until then. I honestly don't think I will.   
Asking my parents really isn't an option.   
I do have a teacher I am very close to who has been assisting with phone calls and all. I don't know if I should ask her to help because she probably doesn't even know the options and would just unneccessarily freak. 

I just don't know what to do and I am so scared of what I might do if I don't manage to get into a safe environment soon.
