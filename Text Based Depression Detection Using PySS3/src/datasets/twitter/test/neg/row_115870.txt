I want to start overtheres nothing left I haven't ruined. It doesn't matter what it is, if I'm involved it will go wrong. I have no one I can turn to and it isn't fair for me to push my problems onto internet strangers. I can't afford a therapist. I'm honestly so calm right now and I don't like it. It's so easy to sit here and hurt myself. I can't get back all the things I ruined or the things I wanted to do and never did. Ok young enough I guess but most of it is gone forever. People keep giving me platitudes about how it will get better but I've been hearing them for 8+ years now. It's only gotten worse. I've ruined myself too. I'm so tired of being alone
