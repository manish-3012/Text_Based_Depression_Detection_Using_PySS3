Is it an issue if I thought out how and where I would commit suicide, but have no desire to carry it out?Sometimes while depressed i think about suicide. I have an idea of how I would do it, where I would do it, a small idea on what I would write to tigers, and what I would say before the act. Thing is that I do not wish to carry it out(For now, who knows what the future holds).
