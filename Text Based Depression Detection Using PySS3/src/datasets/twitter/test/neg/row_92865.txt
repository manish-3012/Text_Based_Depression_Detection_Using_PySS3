Am I being baited?I'm talking to someone who claims they want to commit suicide but their messages got kind of weird. I'm pretty suspicious at this point but you can never be too safe.

Well, here we go. Sorry that it's a wall of text but I don't really have time to format it.


I feel lonely right now...and I might not answer tomorrow... 
I'm going to attempt again...
what are you doing
Twisted Galaxy

If you wanted to know what I looked like...but It'll be the last you see of me..
And what I'm doing is hanging myself...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GuV0OPCGRcg/hqdefault.jpg 
that is me
Twisted Galaxy
Can't open it...
okay, what I want to know, is why you are doing this.
oh
Twisted Galaxy
You can copy image and paste it..
And I'm doing this because... no one cares about me, no one likes me, no one loves me... 

Twisted Galaxy
No one will realize I'm gone 
Thats why I'm doing this..
what about your family?
Twisted Galaxy
I don't have family... 
I'm adopted..

Why are you trying to help me if you need to sleep. 
because I don't want you to end your life
Twisted Galaxy
Why 
because that's really sad
Twisted Galaxy
You don't like me. 
You don't care. 
what makes you think that? I hardly know you?
I care though.
just because I don't know you doesn't mean I don't feel empathy for you when you say you want to commit suicide
Twisted Galaxy
I've been trying for three years.. 
I'm on pills... 
I've been sent to hospitals. 
is there anyone with you right now?
Twisted Galaxy
No. 
I'm in a cold dark room. 
why are you alone?
also that image says otherwise
Twisted Galaxy
What image. 

that one
Twisted Galaxy
Thats my hand. 
it also shows you are in a lit room
Twisted Galaxy
so..I turned off the lights. 
is anyone in your house right now? and if so, why aren't you talking to them?
Twisted Galaxy
Because they won't help me. 
have you tried to ask them?
Twisted Galaxy
They will bring me across the country. 
If I talked to them about it again. 
and it won't help?
Twisted Galaxy
nope 
you need to tell them then so they can find how else to help you
Twisted Galaxy
Won't help.. 
No one can help whats happened to me...
how do you know that?
Twisted Galaxy
I've been sexually assulted. 
And raped. 
I'm sorry to hear that but I can't really help you much more because I have no experience with anything like that. I know that it has happened to my mother but she is still alive so it's not impossible to deal with
Twisted Galaxy
My mom went through the same... 
She's alive but suffering anxiety and depression lung cancer and other stuff. 
I'm suffering my own medical problems.
wouldn
oops
wouldn't your mom be upset if you killed yourself
Twisted Galaxy
No. 
she hasen't seen me in years. 
you really need to call the suicide hotline
Twisted Galaxy
Plus her and i suffer anxiety depression lung cancer but I also suffer bipolar, liver dysfunction and kidney disease, 
that's really the only advice I can give you. the people on the suicide hotline have spent years dealing with situations just like yours.
Twisted Galaxy
....
I tried calling different hotlines. None work for me. 
I can't give you any more advice, I am 13 and I am not good as a suicide hotline.
just promise me you won't do it
if no one, it upsets me greatly
Twisted Galaxy
why..
because I've been through it. I never planned or attempted suicide but I still know how depression feels
empathy is part of our genetics
Twisted Galaxy
...
-Hugs you tightly- 
I'm not trying to make your situation seem like it's minor because it really isn't.
Twisted Galaxy
I wish someone can hold me... -Cries into your chest- 
also I don't believe that it doesn't affect you when someone tells you to kill yourself
you said it doesn't
but if you really need someone
and someone you don't really know can affect your feelings positively
it could also go horribly wrong
Twisted Galaxy
....
C-Can you hold me.... 
virtually
Twisted Galaxy
yeah..
...

Twisted Galaxy
You could've typed 
-Holds you- 
actually spacing is wonky in this chat (believe me, I tried)
Twisted Galaxy
I have a question...
yeah?
Twisted Galaxy
d-do you l-like like me....
why would you ask that?
if I didn't like you I would have gone to bed
yet here I am
despite the fact that my mom keeps telling me to go to bed
Twisted Galaxy
like like though...like more then friends...
is what i mean...
I'm only 13, that's silly
Twisted Galaxy
....
ðŸ’” 
now i'm crying again....
Why do you care so much what other people think?
Twisted Galaxy
..
i-i'm going to suicide now....
Are you manipulating me?
Twisted Galaxy
no.
I'm really getting that vibe
If you're not, then I feel terrible. But only you know the truth so just know this. If you are baiting me, maybe because you want me to be sad, it's not working.
I am sad, but it's not making me want to kill myself
Twisted Galaxy
why the fuck would I want people to suicide...
because I can't know for sure if you're baiting
I want to believe you are because this situation is quite sad
that's how much I care if you are being serious
I'd literally rather you be lying to me
Twisted Galaxy
....
Can you cuddle me....
Vertual  
I think I've already shown you I care
It's way more important than sending you some ascii art
if you are not baiting, don't be upset that I believe it's a possibility
My mom just said she is coming in and shutting off my computer in a minute. 
You need to stay safe and get some help. Like I said I have empathy but I don't have any experience to help you deal with this. Best
Twisted Galaxy
I...I like you a lot...
