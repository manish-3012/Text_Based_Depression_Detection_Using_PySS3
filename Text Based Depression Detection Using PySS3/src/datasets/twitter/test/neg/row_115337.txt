I hate that Iâ€™ve been alive this long.Iâ€™m 22 about to be 23 and I always wanted to die before 17. 
Iâ€™ve put so many things on the back burner because Iâ€™ve just wanted to be dead for so long that like, why bother ?!  My health. Financials. 

I moved out for the first time last August, and I just keep fuckin up. Havenâ€™t kept a job. And have had the worst depression ever. 
Last week I stared a brand new job I thought was gonna be great. 
I ended up quitting 10 mins before my shift on Friday because of a giant manic depressive like breakdown 

Idk. Idk what typing this all out will do. Last month I had one of those manic breakdowns and almost killed myself. I was so fucking close. We only had a cord to use but it was too short to use. I ended up smoking weed and taking a nap. 

Idk. I just donâ€™t know what to do or how to pay my bills. I canâ€™t tell my family I fucking quit my job. They donâ€™t understand and I canâ€™t afford therapy and donâ€™t wanna take medicine IDK 
I just am so overwhelmed by small tasks and donâ€™t know how to make fucking money for my bills. Fuck. I dedicated so much time to my art the last few months for it to go absolutely no where. Nothing sells. Nothing is working for me. Nothing will ever work. 
Iâ€™m too stupid. Iâ€™m too fat. Iâ€™m just agh Iâ€™m just stressing dude. My life is so fucked 
Thereâ€™s so much more. An endless amount of thoughts I have daily. Hourly. Every second Iâ€™m on overdrive about shit. 
Iâ€™m 22. I hate that. I hate how far I got. How many people Iâ€™ve now affected. My poor SO. Doesnâ€™t have mental illness. Hardly knows how to react , heâ€™s getting better but FUCK DUDE. I will have now permanently affected him.  
im so fucked up. I hate it here I hate it here I fuckin hate it here. Like I just donâ€™t know what to do now.
