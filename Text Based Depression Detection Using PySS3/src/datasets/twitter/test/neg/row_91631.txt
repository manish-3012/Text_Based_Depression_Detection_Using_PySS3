Why shouldn't I do it this weekend?24M, been trying to date for the past 6 months but all I've had is a load of rejection. The last time I had anything last longer than a month (I've never had a long-term/serious relationship) was when I was with my ex (who I only dated for 5 months, then they broke up with me this past January. I don't blame them). Since then, people just ghost me, tell me they don't want to meet up again or they say they want to meet up again, but eventually ghost as well. The things I've heard the most when I ask for advice:

-"Read PUA literature/improve your 'game'!" -- all of these techniques would involve me being charismatic/charming/extroverted, which I am most definitely not (I'm a somewhat shy introvert)

-"It'll get better for guys like you as you get into your late 20's/30's!" -- sure, but I don't want to be a burden to my first serious partner if I meet them at that age due to my inexperience with serious relationships. Also, wouldn't it be weird as fuck saying 'I love you'/celebrating an anniversary/travelling with someone for the first time at fucking 30?!?

I'm just done trying to be happy. Some people just aren't meant to be.
