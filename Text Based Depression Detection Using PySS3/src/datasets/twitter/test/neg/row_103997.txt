Anxiety and that world-crumbling feelingI've been full of anxiety over the last few days, and contemplating the last couple years of my life. This might be a bit lengthy, so I apologize for that, as well as any disjointedness.

I'm a 22-year-old guy. I have a few issues related to my posting here, one being the fact that I live at home. I was in a four-year relationship from college: I lived in a dorm the first year, then lived in my girlfriend's parent's house for another until her mom had one of her drunk episodes and threatened violence, and we decided it was best to move on. So we traveled the four hours to my mom's house and lived in her basement for two years, until a bit over a month ago when we broke up.

At this point I'm a man-child with ambitions but no energy. I want to produce music, for example, and know that I'm capable to some degree, but equipment is expensive and I'm afraid of failure. I'm trying to find an apartment currently, but I'm scared of a major life change like that. I've had a soul-draining cube job for a year and a half, it pays well and it's easy enough.

I think I messed up my brain a little bit during the first couple weeks of college four years ago, lots of alcohol and weed (which had always garnered borderline psychotic episodes), so from then on I've been in third-person mode. Which is a downer. I'm always detached to some degree, this white film covers all of my vision. Wikipedia calls it derealization or depersonalization.

And of course, the most recent major event, the breakup with my girlfriend. We had had lots communication problems and things built up over time. I got tired of the ins and outs of life and thought maybe there's someone better for me, someone more accepting of my introverted nature. The introversion that annoyed her came from having no energy from the job I hate, regressing into computer time to numb my mind. When I brought up I was having doubts of the relationship, a lot happened quickly and she was gone the next night. She picked up her stuff within three days. I was a wreck.

That night, I got a text, saying she wanted to talk. Despite being the much more emotional one of the relationship, she acted respectful and thoughtful. We had a long talk, and decided we would have weekly chats to check in on each other, and maybe in a year or two, assuming we're both available, we would try another relationship. In the meantime, lots of honesty, but save for the chats complete separation. We would both strive for independence, something that neither of us has really had, considering school and parents.

So I started an OKCupid profile. Time to move on and get a leg up on the rest of my life. Alright. So I've been talking with people somewhat. I met up with someone, had a drunk fun time, kissed at the end, bubbly feelings all around. My now-ex and I (let's call her A) had our chat Saturday. I still really care about her, so I check her Facebook masochistically. I want to be in her head and I'm so curious, it's fucking creepy and weird but I can't help it. So I ask about her dates and time with OKCupid, knowing she'd made one and has had dates. I ask if the main one is more attractive than me, she says yes, by a lot. It's jarring for a couple reasons, one is that she had always told me I was the most attractive person she knew, and meant it sincerely. She's the type with mates that they become her whole world, and obviously she was devastated the night we broke up, saying she hated me and I'm as bad as her previous fucked relationships. Also, one of the reasons we broke up was that I had been discussing polyamory for a long while, her adamantly against it but testing the waters and seeing if guys were attractive. I was totally ready to feel compersion. But I can't now. I always correct people and say that jealousy isn't envy, it's fear of loss, but this is the first time I've felt it. It's horrible. 

So a lot of regret and questioning how badly I fucked up is swirling around in my head (one of her Facebook posts last night was "Had a great date! Definitely second-date material!"), fear of never being loved again, you know, one of the most ridiculous-sounding things to whine about. It's pretty pathetic and I realize the whole "time will heal" but I'm just an average-looking guy and OKC is obviously not a great place for people like that. I keep comparing how easy it is for A to get dates, for example. She's taking antidepressants now so she's almost emotionless, and I get the feeling that in a year or two she won't even be interested in me anymore, realizing I'm the sack of shit I've always been without the blinds of limerence, comfortable familiarity, and histocompatibility

Anyway, that's where I'm at now. I'm a big clusterfuck of stupid emotions and detachment. Afraid of change, afraid of being alone. I read that now is the time in life when you find out if you're a recluse and stop making friends and I'm already introverted, so I'm afraid of this anxiety I've been plagued with becoming an unending source of isolated agony. I'm unhappy. What's worse is that I'm rationally a hedonist and an atheist - if I don't believe in an afterlife, I'm apathetic and detached, and I'm a hedonist without happiness, then I'm just sort of a shell without purpose, right? I just stop existing if I die. Logically yeah, I think that all this will be over eventually. I'll move on. But who wants to date someone so unsure and mediocre, with baggage and promises to get back with an ex in like a year? I'll get to live in some shitty apartment eating shitty food because I can't cook, having even less time for creative pursuits because I'll have to take care of myself. People say "you're special" and "think of the loved ones who would mourn you" in these threads, but I've been told of specialness countless times in grade school, and generally I think people suck. My family and friends would mourn but I wouldn't have to deal with anything and they'd get over themselves.

I'm not sure why I'm posting here, I guess.
