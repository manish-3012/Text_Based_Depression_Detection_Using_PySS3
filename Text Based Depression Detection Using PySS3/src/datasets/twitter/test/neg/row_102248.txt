How does motivation from strangers help so much?Like many other people I haven't confided in anyone I know about my suicidal tendencies, but just browsing through forums and messageboards, hearing people out there say that things will get better and that happiness is a possibility helps me. It confounds me.

It's not just one incident, everytime I feel like I'd prefer going away I try and look out for some groups of strangers somewhere on the internet saying that things can be better than they are, and said strangers almost always help me, even if only a little bit.

Even if they're not actually responding to a message I posted, or know nothing about my particular situation, it still helps. The human psyche is so strange. These aren't reasoned arguments or links to studies that have done research with large samples or anything of the sort, just a simple "hey, I'm sure you'll get better, good luck" or something along those lines.

I just felt like typing that out, particularly shit day, I think I'll sit down for a long meditation session now.

Thanks people. Good luck to all of you :)
