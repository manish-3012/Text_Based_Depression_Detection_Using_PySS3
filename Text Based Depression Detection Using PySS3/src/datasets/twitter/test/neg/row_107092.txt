Loneliness 

## Hello,  I have suffered from loneliness and isolation basically most of my  life. I had a very traumatic childhood, was bullied, suffered from severe discrimination and I think that has contributed a  lot to this. It seems like something that I will never get out of.  There were times when I had no friends at all. I live alone as well and  was doing distance study so I am literally totally alone. I have two  sort of friends right now. One isn't a good friend at all. Many things  happened that were bad but I held onto it because I did not have any  other friends. This other friend is her roomate that I met through her. She only moved in there a few months ago so its not like they are best friends. They both know that I feel really alone. We live like 2 minutes away from each other but whenever they go out walking they never ask me even  though I already said that I would like to come with to her. When I text her  she often takes forever to reply and usually only gives short replies.  She basically never texts me first. He is the same. Whenever I ask him  to do something he often invites her along but he never does the same  with me. Its really tough to know that people know you might be all  alone but still just chose to exclude/ignore you but then claim to be  your friends. I don't know if I am overreacting or if they are really  being mean. For example today they went out walking together. They could  have just asked me along. It really hurts. I feel so lonely and I feel  like no matter what I try i can't get out of it and all the people  around me are just cold and disinterested. I have to say when I am  around people its hard for me to connect (because of my life story). I often feel so trapped in this loneliness. I think a lot of this comes from my mother always telling me about her loneliness as a child and making me feel responsible for this. It is as if I am carrying it around with me. She parentified me as a child. Also I was ignored as a child. I do try to make contacts as good as a I can but its tough. I am als looking for trauma therapy but nothing works out. I feel like I have been trying all my life. I have become severely physically ill due to all of this as well. I was abused as a child mentally and physically by my mother and my stepfather. I grew up in a European country and my father is a foreigner and I look "non-local" to put it that way and it was hell. As a child I felt very misunderstood because I developed behaviours that were offputting to others due to the abuse and I think I was also judged much harsher because of bias. Now I have these people who claim to be my friends. I am reaching out to them and the just let me sink. And if would kill myself, which I have been thinking about a lot again they would all pretend to be so sad. What lies. I  think I should stop seeing these friends because it really pulls  me down. I would be all alone but I really can't take this rejection anymore. And i think they don't really seem interested in knowing me.
