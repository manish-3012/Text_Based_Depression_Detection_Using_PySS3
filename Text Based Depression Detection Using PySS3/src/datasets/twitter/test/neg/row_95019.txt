Iâ€™m posting here because I need helpIâ€™m too broke to live, because of my living situation, getting to a job is impossible. Today, I was raped for the 6th time in my life. Iâ€™m at a low point. Iâ€™m starting to think my family would be better off without me. A coffin &amp; a headstone are way less expensive than a coffin. I really want to do it but Iâ€™m so fucking scared.
