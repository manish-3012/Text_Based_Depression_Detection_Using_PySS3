I've made a plan.I've had passing thoughts of posting this here as a kind of cry for help, and I've finally found enough energy to do this. 

I've been suffering from severe depression for... about a year now and its stopped me from realising something.

I think about suicide every waking minute of my life, for the past few weeks now.
I have this feeling of certainty that my life will end in suicide - its inevitable to me now.

I've started coming up with theoretical plans, trying to come up with some way to kill myself while causing as little pain to my family and friends as possible. 

Every plan starts with me biding my time for several years, saving up money and building up the courage to do something - so I am not at any immediate danger to myself. There is a small voice in the back of my head telling me to just wait it out until I am in a position to see a therapist privately which still sounds very reasonable.

Thinking about a painless death and painless consequence for my family is one of the few things keeping me going. I have no dreams, no hobbies, no aspirations and nothing I enjoy. The only thing I do anymore is browse reddit and play LoL or GW2 but I realise now I play them only as an escape, and its more like a dull addiction to them that makes me bother to play them since I don't really enjoy anything.

I guess I'm hoping for a response of some kind. Even if there is no magical answer I foolishly hope for, just writing this down and submitting it is making me feel better than usual.
