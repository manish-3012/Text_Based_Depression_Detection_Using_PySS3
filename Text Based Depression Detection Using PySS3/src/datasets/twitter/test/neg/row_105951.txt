The only thing keeping me here is the fear of causing more pain.Iâ€™ve wanted to die for a long time, for many reasons. There are many wonderful people in my life who I cause pain to on a regular basis due to my substance abuse issues.

I donâ€™t want to be a burden to them any more.

I am trying so, so very hard to get better. And I am getting better, slowly slowly. But I canâ€™t stand that my fuck ups along the way cause so much pain to the ones I love.

The only thing worse would be to make one of them find my dead body. I just wish I could erase myself from existence without a trace or memory of me
