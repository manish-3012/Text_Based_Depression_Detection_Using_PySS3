Today, let's label it a victory. Everyone will press on.The political system in the US is under such scrutiny/fire and it's not getting any better. My student loans have drowned me since my mom made me sign with her on a dotted line. She has no cognizant idea what it's like to live in a properly-cultured society. (I grew up in redneck-trumpville). I don't have faith in Hillary. Millennials have been growing up with warfare throughout their lives. I am one of them. My talents in my work are not needed, nor appreciated; and I'm so ready to cash in. 

We are the first generation whom will not be as financially successful as our parents; and it's very hard for them to understand that their political decisions have forced us into this. Nonetheless, we are labeled as lazy, attention deprived, and emotionally radical. 

My mentors within my work have told me that these people from my past (family/friends) do not define me and I am not responsible for them. Yet....the amount of backlash I've begun to receive for my political beliefs within my "upbringing" has me spiraling between my heart and my head. I want to help, to teach, to lead; and nobody cares to listen. 

I made a mistake of going back for my brother's graduation to visit and celebrate. It was so boring and white trash, all that I could think about was how much money I was missing out on in NYC. I had the worst panic attack on the flight and began trying to bash my head open on the window of the plane. Nobody removed/escorted me as I spiraled. Then, I gave myself alcohol poisoning and began throwing up black (bile?) in my sorority sister's bathroom, whom I was staying with. She's so bored with her own life, she gets high every day and had no idea I was that sick. 

I hallucinated my dead family members laughing at me in her bathroom that night. 

I can't breathe. 

It's taken me months to retrain myself to stay away from these triggers with certain people. In the city; I am working on 3 shows, one of which I was fired from last night for not being able to keep up with their expediency. They offered me 20% severance for an I-9 job. It's $100. Seems low, right???

So I turned to stripping last week, after a friend at my runway show had encouraged me to join her. I wasn't able to pay back the house fee; and lost even more money working at a strip club. HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN? Then I turned back to my dominatrix work, and the club I found doesn't have a clean environment, nor the amount of clientele needed to be sustainable. I left the establishment at 6am today, without making a dime. This is after a "slow night" on Wednesday where I had two clients. One for ass worship and another, Jackie Mason's, best friend, who was into dental work and wanted me to pull out his dead tooth and massage his missing prostate. 

I watched another girl spread open the owner's urethra and shove needles into his cock until it bled. 2 Gold St; apt 605; Wall St, Manhattan; for any of you wondering. 

BOTTOM LINE: If this is what my life is coming to, I'm better off dead. Everyone is too selfish and wrapped up in their own shit to care about me and what I'm doing, and it's not my job to fix them; and I'm done trying. 

I go to bed wanting the courage to stick my head out of my bedroom window and slice my throat open with a butcher knife. I enjoy the fact that I could force my family to possibly come out here, if only to pick up my body. It'll teach them culture. 

And if I spiral first and get sent back to the backwoods, I'll pretend to care about spending time with them shooting guns. The 9mm looks fun.
