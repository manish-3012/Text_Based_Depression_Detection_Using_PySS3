It's always just me and my jokesI love to make other people laugh.  i love telling jokes and seeing them smile because for a minute I feel happy seeing them happy.


But those same people always leave and then it's just me and my jokes. my bad jokes.


You know how people like Robin Williams and Chris Farley always like seem so happy they're always telling jokes and then one day you wake up to the news about them dying.

I understand how they reached that point.

 I met a guy 2 weeks ago and we hit it off.  We make each other laugh and spend time playing video games and watching tv.  I smile at work again because I think I found someone.  

Fast forward to now.  "Now isn't a good time." he says.  "I just have a lot going on."

For the past 2 weeks I've just been a good lay.  

I'm tired of this cycle of being happy when I think I found someone who wants to be a part of my life and they leave. They always leave. I'm never enough.  The smiles and laughs and what I thought were fun times aren't ever enough.

So it always ends up being just me and my jokes. And I'm ready to walk into traffic.
