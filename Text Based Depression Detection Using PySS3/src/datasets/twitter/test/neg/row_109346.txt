I am sick...Not just sick of the shit that I have to go through in my life, but I've been making myself physically sick the past few days. I'm supposed to be in class right now but I can't bring myself to leave my house. I want to do it now. I want today to be the day. I've been sitting here actuelly the entire weekend contemplating why I'm alive. I am SO FUCKING LONELY. 

My soulmate has a girlfriend who is not me. That's my main issue in and of itself. I suffer over this every single day. My best friends don't even text me anymore for god knows why. I know for a fact they're replacing me though. My best female friend, let's call her Sue, has been friends with me for the past 4 years, but she has other best friends. Me? All I have is her. And she's replacing me with other people because I think she's just sick of my shit secretly or something...

Then there's my family, who don't know how bad my life is because I'm too embarrassed to show it. They know my mood is crap all the time and I'm sure they have a clue, but I can't bring myself to tell them, after 3 years, my fucked up situation with this guy who is undoubtedly my soulmate. My depression isn't just about him and how I can't be with him, but that's just a key point. So please don't call me a fucking stupid depressed naive immature 18 year old. I beg you. So my family doesn't do shit because if him and I were ever together after me telling them that, they'd hate him more than they already do. And I'm pretty sure they really dislike him because of what they know he's done to me emotionally.

I just don't know I am still alive here. I need to know something. What's the point to being alive if you're constantly alone and need emotional stabilization?!
