Tried getting some help online. Shit went sidewaysIts fucking hilarious. Truly. I wasn't even feeling downtrodden or suicidal. I was reaching out to a webservice here in Australia, for teenagers and youngadults. Headspace. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was reaching out because of feelings and interpersonal shit i had going on, inconjuction with self harm. Which is normally easy to deal with but i needed some help this time around. They offer the service from 9am-1am. thats a massive amount of time. its not 24/7 but its great.

&amp;#x200B;

First contact, 8:00pm, put into a queue. Get connected at 9:10. The notification sound didnt go off. 5 minutes later, disconnected. 2 minutes after that i realised. Thats okay, Im pissed beyond belief but its okay. Hop back into queue itll be what another hour maybe hour and a half. should be in before 11. They closed. I was in queue for 3 fucking hours, 4 if you count the first one. 4 glorious hours of waiting for help.

Getting help is hard enough. Ive been to hospital, ive been there vby choice and ive been forced with guards 24/7. Every chance a doctor gets, they try to get you out and im sick of it. Last visit, i was saying clearly "If im sent home, i know ill try something stupid, ill either down another bottle of pills, cut my arms, or jump in front of a car" I had to beg for a room for the night. When there involentarily, after downing enough medicine to OD, 3 Saline drips, and im being sent home. They have short and long stay wards. People talk about being scared they will be commited. but ive tried ot get that sort of help to help my half decade long fucking shitstain of a life. I literally have been handed back my blades after being dismissed, used them in the hospital infront of a nurse because i was so angry, they got taken away i was still sent home.

Im fucking tired of this fruitless, everlasting, bitch fest, steaming pile of putrid shit that is mental health help.
