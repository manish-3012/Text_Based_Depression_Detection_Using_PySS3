Lucky one (30f)I should be on the top of the world. Great house, cute cat, pretty clothes, well educated, great career, great naughty side hustle and still the thoughts of suicide haunt me day in and day out. My friends who envy me make comments on my â€œso calledâ€ perfect life but all it does it depress me more. It pisses me off more when they think I have no right to even think like this because Iâ€™m o so blessed ha yea. 
I hate the most when people talk you down from the ledge while making you seem crazy or weird. 
I see death as a pure release, an ultimate spiritual awakening, a gift for the soul released from bondage. I wish death was viewed in a better way rather than a cowards escape. I find the thought of transition blissful. 
Just venting
