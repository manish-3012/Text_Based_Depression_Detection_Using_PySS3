I am tired of hurting myself and everyone around me. I canâ€™t live with myself anymoreI (20f) have hurt so many people I care about. I binge drink about once a week and every time I do, I take it too far and cause damage to myself and everyone around me. my family and friends are so disappointed in me, and I am too. I donâ€™t know who I am when I look in the mirror. I go through life in a fog, nothing feels real and everything seems so pointless and itâ€™s been this way since I was about 12. I attempted suicide twice when I was 13. I went to the psych ward and they didnâ€™t help me at all. They didnâ€™t care. I didnâ€™t see one single therapist while I was there, just a doctor who kept asking me the same painful questions and was very rude. I canâ€™t keep a job because my anxiety hinders me from going out into the real world and being normal. Iâ€™m toxic. I neglect myself and the people I love. Iâ€™m selfish and a liar and I donâ€™t know who I am anymore. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up and finally be at peace. I feel like Iâ€™m drowning every single day and I canâ€™t stop being toxic. I want to try to change so bad but every time I try i get knocked down even harder and I feel so weak. I canâ€™t bring myself to even do the fucking dishes. I used to take care of myself but I have gained 50 pounds and I have worn sweatpants and baggy t shirts for two years. My boyfriend hates that I canâ€™t take care of myself and he is tired of taking care of me. I donâ€™t blame him. Iâ€™ve pushed everyone out of my life. My friends and family are tired of me fucking up. Iâ€™m just a fuck up and I havenâ€™t been happy since I was a child. Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m so fucking tired.
