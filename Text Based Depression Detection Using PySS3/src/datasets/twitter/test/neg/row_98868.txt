I deserve to dieIâ€™m mean, annoying, stupid and a burden to everybody.

Iâ€™m thinking about drowning myself (I donâ€™t mind it being pain full).

Iâ€™ll just go to my local lake, swim as deep as I can and take a deep breath. I know I can get pretty far (From not trying to kill myself situations). I know a place were I think nobody will notice me. I might even get drunk before to make it even harder for me to do anything about it.

Why am I annoying (etc.) I complain too much. Iâ€™m mean to often. And Iâ€™ve lied to many times. 

I have one friend. And I keep on annoying him, and I have noticed that Iâ€™m mean to him too (Itâ€™s too late to change what he thinks. And he wonâ€™t notice that Iâ€™ve changed.) I manipulate him, and Iâ€™m not good at taking care of him, when he feels down.

Iâ€™m a burden to my family. My mom blames herself for my sadness and depression. I want to make my suicide look like an accented for this reason. I might be easier for her. 


I keep getting better for a period, but the get depressed again. It becomes worse and worse every time i get into a depressing period. Nothing ever happed to me to make be this way (no traumatic event).

Excuse me for my poor English. Iâ€™m sorry if I have broken any rules for this subreddits. I tried to find them, but I donâ€™t think I didnâ€™t a very good job.
