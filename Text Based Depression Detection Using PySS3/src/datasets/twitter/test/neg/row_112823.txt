My best friend and love of my life just commited suicide last night and it really really hurts.He was only 16. I loved him dearly. He always wanted to be with me but I wanted him to get his head together and get help so we could be perfectly happy together and have a great relationship. I should have seen this coming. His brother got him into drugs and I trued to really really help him get out. He thought I didnâ€™t care about him and I really wanted to be with him I just wanted him to get some help so we could be perfectly happy. He tried many times to push me away but I needed to help him. I should have told his mother but I didnâ€™t and I regret not saying anything. I got a call from his mom, she told me that he overdosed and I didnâ€™t ask for more details since I didnâ€™t want to make it worse. I love him. I miss him. Please, any of you, before you make a choice to end it, please think about your family and friends

Alex, I love you with all my heart, I miss your arms, your smile you would get when we saw each other. I miss your beautiful brown eyes, your perfect lips that I always wanted to kiss. I miss how happy you made me, I especially miss how it made you happy to see me smile. I miss your smart funny jokes, your help for all my homework, I miss how we used to go to the gym together. The first gift you gave me, it was a gift card in a little cute box, then I hugged  you tightly for hours. I remember when I first met your mom, I really feel sorry for her. My mom loved you a lot, she cries for you, I am crying for you, we were meant to be together. Why? Why did you have to do this at such a young age? I miss you
