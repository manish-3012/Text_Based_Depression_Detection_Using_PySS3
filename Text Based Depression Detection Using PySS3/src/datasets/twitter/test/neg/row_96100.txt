Today is the first day of my last daysI am giving up. I have fucked up too hard for too long and I don't want any more chances. I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. I don't want any one to be angry with me. I don't want anyone to love me or be happy for me.  
I have nothing left for myself but despair and self-loathing and I can't comprehend anyone looking at me with anything but that same loathing and hopelessness. Any positive emotions people claim to feel for me are for what I pretend to be, not who I am. I have lived my life a lie-- acting like I'm worth something when I'm not.  
Now I know there is nowhere for me to go. Any future I might have had is no longer worth living. The worst part of it is that I am fully aware of how FUCKING EASY my life should have been.  I am spoiled. I am selfish. I am surrounded by good people and I should be happy. I am disgusting.  
I haven't had much to eat or drink the past few days, but today is the first day I have cut myself off altogether. If all goes according to plan I will die of dehydration in about ten days. I will likely lose consciousness before that. I do not want to be talked out of this. All I wanted was to tell someone.  
I'm sorry it had to be you.  
edit: for those who want to know what's going on, I've been in trouble with the police three times since coming to college (this is the first fucking year). I'm an atheist. I'm pansexual. I can't get a job and I have to pay for my own tuition. I struggle with bulimia. Past sexual assaults have left me unable to handle relationships. My family either does not approve or is not aware of any of this.  
I am in pain. I am tired of disappointing the ones I love. For so long I wanted to learn and grow and change myself into "the person I am capable of being", but I have failed again and again and now I've made up my mind.
