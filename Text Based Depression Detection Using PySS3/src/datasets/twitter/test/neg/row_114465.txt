I just want to know why I ruin everythingIt seems like nothing can ever go right and when it does, it doesn't for long. 

Relationship? Gone 
Friends? None
Schooling? Fucked 
Everything else? Just as bad

I'm nothing but a negative impact on everyone and I wish I wasn't too scared to die. There's so many ways I could but I always panic last second. I just want to be good enough for something or someone. Just one thing or person
