Help with HR not helpingI told multiple coworkers and supervisors I'm suicidal as a result of job and feel that mutual termination agreement is best.
HR is all pretending to be helpful, call EAP, call hotline. I'm trying to think if I should just show them photos of me self mutilating, but I feel like they would just say we all have scars or tough it out.

I am thinking of hurting myself to prove to them but I really just wanted help to get out of stressful work situation that increases suicidal ideation, but since they are not taking me seriously im thinking maybe I can have a really bloody death to raise awareness.
