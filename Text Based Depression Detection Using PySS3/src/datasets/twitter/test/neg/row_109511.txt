I feel bad for being yet another one in need of help, in this sub, but yes, I'm contemplating suicide.Hello. I don't know how to begin... I've been extremely lonely for the past 9 months. Each day I feel worse and have no one to talk to about this. I had a (somewhat) reasonable life, which I tried to change for the better and failed. I ended up unemployed (the least of my troubles, hated being fucking exploited), with no significant other and with no friends. My closest company was my girlfriend. We were together for 6 years and lived together for about 4 of them. She was my girlfriend, my friend, my everything. I feel ashamed because this is almost a clichÃ© by now (hey fucking girlfriends, man!), but yeah. I'm not saying that is the main reason for my mental state at the moment, but it is a very big part of it, in that, she was the one I talked about all my other problems. While life wasn't perfect by any means, I had her to talk to. Now I miss her trust more than anything, it's like I lost my closest family member. We went through so much together and we know each other better than anyone else, at the moment at least. She blocked every kind of communication medium with me. It's like she killed me inside her. I just don't know where to turn to now. I'm really confused, even as I write this. It's like this is the pinnacle of a number of issues that had been dragging for some years - there is so much I've been through that is contributing to my current state of mind that I honestly don't know what to talk about. I'm in a breaking point of loneliness, regret and guilt.

Sorry for my awkward english. Hugs.
