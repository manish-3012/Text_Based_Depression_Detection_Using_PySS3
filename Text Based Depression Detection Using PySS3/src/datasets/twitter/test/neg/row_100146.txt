Everybody thinks i'm faking all my symptomsI'm 16 and I suffer from a huge range of debilitating symptoms. The main being an anxiety/panic disorder, which i've had since I was 5. Its gotten worse as i've gotten older, and i'm too scared to leave the house. I've been bedridden(literally) for 6 months now because of nausea and fatigue. I spend my days online on the laptop. 

Last year I was admitted to hospital 5 times for suicidal thoughts/depression, and I am now known to the medical community as an attention seeker. I have doctors refusing to help me and my (ex)psychiatrist all of the sudden stopped seeing me. I was sent away from the emergency room in the past(many times).

I found out that my old therapist told everyone I was manipulative and blackmailing her. I don't know why the fuck she even thought that, but obviously the doctors believed her. My psychiatrist wrote a note in my records that i'm an attention seeker and have dependency issues. Now nobody takes me seriously.

I'm suffering everyday from severe nausea, stomach pain, anxiety, panic attacks, depressive episodes and hearing voices. My parents believe me, and they have been advocating for me like crazy, but theres no getting through to anyone. Nobody is willing to help anymore.

I'm scared. This is my *entire life* now. I am forever known as an attention seeker, because of one persons misinformed *OPINION*. Be careful what you tell a therapist guys. You never know what they really think about you. Jesus christ, I can't do this anymore.
