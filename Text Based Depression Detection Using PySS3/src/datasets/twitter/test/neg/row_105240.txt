Scratching in My BrainI have been feeling very suicidal lately. I haven not had intrusive thoughts for a long time. They started about two weeks ago, and today I started being sober to see if it will help. Now I'm having a full blown anxiety attack. I feel like I have bees inside my body and the only way to make it stop would be to slit my wrists, but I won't. I know I have to be strong. I can't talk to my friends about it. I don't know how to find a therapist and I can't afford a copay. I just want to cease to exist. If I could just melt into this couch and disappear into a cool numbness forever; that would be ideal. At least with drinking I could drink myself to a point of euphoria before drinking myself to a state of sleep. I run my hands over my body and I can FEEL the bees. The soft vibrating of not feeling like I belong in my own skin. I feel like no one understands how I feel and I feel so out of control. I know I'm just talking into the void but maybe this helped a little. I think I should go to bed now.
