im going to make my voice heard and then im going to disappear.im so tired of keeping things in. i get frustrated with constantly being around people who have no idea that im in pain. it just brings about insensitive comments. i could be open about it, but i know no one would understand it or help and that would only make me feel worse. but in this upcoming days im going to make it my goal to have my voice heard because im tired. im going release all my pain and let everyone know how hurt i am, and then in going to kill myself. im not doing this to be stopped, im doing this so that when im buried, no one will use the excuse that is â€œshe never told us she was hurting. i had no idea.â€ ive held on enough and anyone who tells me otherwise is just inconsiderate.
