Starting to realize I am a loserI am 18 y/o . I just failed the most important test of my life last week. I have been preparing for it since I was 16. I was one of the best in my school. I gave it all the time and effort I could. I lost all my friends, my confidence and all the faith I had in my overall ability in the past 2 years. Time went by so quickly sitting alone in my room that it still feels like I just started, I didn't grow as a person at all. I used to be a bright kid, everyone wanted to be my friend and hang out with me but now it seems like everyone has surpassed me in every aspect possible. I fell behind. I m losing my hair, heck I am on rogaine at age 17. I've got nothing to do now, I am used to studying all day alone in my room. Feels like life is over. (Thnx for reading)
