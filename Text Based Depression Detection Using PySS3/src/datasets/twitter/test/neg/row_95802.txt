I'm done trying, encouraging words aren't enoughIâ€™m tired of boiling hose water to cook with. My neighbor very politely told me today that I canâ€™t borrow the hose anymore and I had a complete hysterical sobbing meltdown.

 Iâ€™m not upset with them, I canâ€™t imagine how we would have survived without their help. Iâ€™m so embarrassed and Iâ€™m running out of creative ways to tell my girls why we don't have running water.
