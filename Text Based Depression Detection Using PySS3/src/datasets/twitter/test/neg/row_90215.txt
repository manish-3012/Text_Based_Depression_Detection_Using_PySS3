im finally saying goodbyeive finally figured out how im going to make my exit. I am just too tired of suffering. Ive tried pills before but to no avail (obviously) but I think im going to use asphyxiation. Ive already kinda practiced i guess you can say to get a feel for it. How it seems its going to work is im going to slowly black out until i lose consciousness. Once I lose conciouness i wont be able to really do anything to reverse it. And it's a quiet way out so i wont be interrupted. 
I just can't keep going anymore. This is the first time ive felt truly excited in so long. Ive been suffering for years and today might really be the last time i have to feel this way. Im spending my day watching my favorite episodes of Naruto, spoiling my cat, going to work, and then i'm going to say goodbye to everybody in a note, and go to sleep for the last time.

Good luck everybody. I love all of you.
