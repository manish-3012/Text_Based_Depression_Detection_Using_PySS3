Need help, advise, or anything...Hello fellow redditors,  Hope you all are having a wonderful day.

A bit of background:

I am a depressed individual.  Who, for most of his life, has dealt with it as best he can.  I have been depressed since the wee age of eight. As a young boy these feelings of sadness and loneliness were unfamiliar.  I became a bully for some time, but realized that being mean didn't  help me much.  In middle school i found some peace in books and learning. This continued on through high school where my true deppression came into fruition.  I was a scolar with high hopes and ambitions.  That changed when most of my academic dreams were shattered.  I moved on as best i could, went to college, dropped out, found a decent job nonetheless.  Tried my luck with love multiple times, failed.  As of right now, i am alone with few friends and no support.

Now for plee, and paradoxes:

I'd  like to start with a few things.

I cherish life above anything.
I do go out and socialize as much as possible.
Only my best friend knows of my depression.
I live a mostly care free life.

Now for the sad part.

I have never been clinically  diagnosed with depression, but know damn well I suffer from it.  i have made an attempt against my life multiple times, failed attempts.  Damn suck at that too.  I mostly hide my sadness by either being funny or a dick.  I suffer from insomnia and spend most of my nights thinking up creative ways to end existence.  This has been going on for years.  I have managed to deal with by going out with my few friends and messing with stuff.  Somehow, i have not been able to get rid of these feelings.   There are many days where i simply just  want to disappear, i think of all those who will be affected and just break down.  I don't  want to end my life, but can't  live with myself in the same sense.  I know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  I dont know what's  wrong with me. I tend to push people away from me, often I'll use awkwardness and say things i don't mean.. i don't  like talking about my feelings and will often become hostile.  I feel the less people know about the higher the chance they won't  get hurt.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I currently have it under wraps.  But to be honest i don't  know what to do anymore.  I'm  not entirely sure I'll  be able to stop myself in a future attempt against myself.  I can't  do this alone anymore... 

Tl,dr: been depressed  for several years, made attempts against  my life.  Need some help so i can stop myself.
