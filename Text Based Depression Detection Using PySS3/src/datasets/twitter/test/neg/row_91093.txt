Is this how the real world works? Is it this shitty?Just started my first job out of college. iâ€™m very grateful for my opportunity but just finished my first week. friday was too exhausted from the week to do anything i enjoy. saturday i was able to enjoy myself from about 10am - 6PM. at this point you have to start worrying about sunday, because do you really have sunday off if you have to worry about getting up the next morning to go back to work? mentally i feel like iâ€™m on a â€œbreakâ€ for just 8 hours per week. saturday from 10am-6pm. 40 hours of work per week for 8 hours of rest? if this is how life is i donâ€™t want to be a part of it.
