another night of excess (escapism), bad ending, massive depressive boost and suicidal thoughtsQuoting another post from me

&gt; I went out Friday night, and it ended in excess. Drank too much, spent money I essentially don't have, and at the final stop, a significant amount of money was pickpocketed from me.

&gt; I was sitting on the floor yesterday, ashamed for being robbed, and considered killing myself. The thoughts don't go away, and I feel like isolating myself from everybody I know out of shame of how pathetic I am. Plus, people wouldn't be able to enable me that way, they don't see the problem I have and are just gracious and generous. I definitely don't deserve friends, and I think I'm a burden to most, even though they probably wouldn't admit it. If there weren't one or two relatives who I know it would hurt very much, I probably would have done it already anyway.


I currently see no hope, no out. I think I'm more than worthless, and that all the bad things that keep happening to me are almost destined, that I deserve all of it. That I don't deserve a "normal", functioning life.
