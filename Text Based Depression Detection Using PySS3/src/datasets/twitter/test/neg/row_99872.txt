HELP PLEASE!!People always say it is my fault for everything. If I cry they say to ignore it. But it is hard to ignore it if every day someone shouts at you or hits you and makes you feel worthless. It is even worse if it is your family. Every day I tell myself the next day will be better. Yet it never is. Every day I want to die yet I feel sorry for my little brother. If I do I  will never be able to speak my mind.
