People keep telling me that Iâ€™m a strong person but I donâ€™t feel itPeople tell me that Iâ€™m a strong young women because Iâ€™ve lived through two difficult sexual assaults and didnâ€™t end up killing myself no matter how much I wanted to but I just donâ€™t see how being alive makes me strong, I just want the thoughts to stop I want the reminders to go away and I want to be a typical 16 year old at my school.
