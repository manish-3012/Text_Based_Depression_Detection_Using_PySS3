Wanting to stop pretending. I'm done.I have no idea how to start this off. I have no idea where to begin. I'm 26 and I feel like my dream is shattered and I should kill myself. I grew up practically getting screamed at in life. It all started when I played basketball in second grade at one of those rec centers. After either the basketball game or practice my dad would scream in my face about how I was not good enough. I would cry in the back seat of the car because he would not stop yelling in my face that I was soft. This was in second grade! However it carried on throughout my life. I'm a slower learner I was always a slow learner and when I would ask for help with my homework from my peers say my grandma she would constantly scream at me because I did not get it among other members of my family. They convinced me to play basketball for my middle school because my cousin was apart of the team but they only ever cared about him. They would boast him up and tell me I was stupid. So I never tried in school like I should had. My parents got divorced and I quit sports all together in High school. However when 18 came around was when I pursued a job. I worked at a preztal place in the mall but quit because my dad told me it was not good enough. He told me I needed a mans job a factory job which spiraled me into depression even more. So Ive just up and quit quite a few jobs because I thought they were not good enough. I worked in a call center for two years but purposely walked out and got fired because I'm 25 and I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. Im always so stressed I feel like I was robbed of child hood and a life. So I got a new job at Walmart the first days have gone well. I'am a hard worker I will work and save my money. However I should be sleeping because I have a 9-5 but I feel like not even going in and instead finding a gun to kill myself with or jumping in front of a semi. Whats it matter? I'm worthless. I never got to do what I wanted to do in life I was forced to play sports and finally I have cracked under the pressure. I remember one time in 6th grade when I was placed in JFL my dad screaming in my face because I was not doing tackling drills properly. I seriously hate this life. My mom also told me she wanted nothing to do with me when my parents got divorced and its a rare occurence I hear from her. I have no issue with my jobs but ive gotten to a point where I really do not want to go in and work a 9-5 I never asked for that life I only ever did it to pay bills. I just feel robbed of everything. I have so much pressure in my shoulders and as I try to sleep in my mind I constantly repeat the words kill me let me go to another life where I'm happy and have a normal family life where I'm loved. Why was I put on this hell hole. I dont wanna be here.
