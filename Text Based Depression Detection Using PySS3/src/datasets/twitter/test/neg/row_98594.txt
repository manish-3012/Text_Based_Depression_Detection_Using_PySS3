OCD and spirituality and the feeling of something bad happening soon in my gut is making me suicidalIâ€™m afraid I misspoke and accidentally offended a deity when trying to compliment her when praying to God, I know in my heart i didnt misspeak but i am afraid I did and i dont know if there will be consequences even though i did not mean to misspeak. When I prayed to God I said if you love me God then this deity is the most beautiful and Iâ€™m afraid I misspoke and sheâ€™s going to ruin my life and take away the person Iâ€™ve been obsessing about who I cant live with out because of my foolish mistake. Im so scared bc i bleieve in all of this and I dont want to live anymore if the person leaves bc Iâ€™ve been obsessed adn in love for so long.
