SpirallingI've been ill for the past year with conversion disorder. It is the conversion of anxiety, stress and depression into physical symptoms. I have had the majority of the symptoms which include paralysis, muscle spasms, blindness, screaming and laughing and have developed a permanent tremor in my right hand.

Most people recover within a few weeks and are never affected again but apparently I'm unlucky. I've seen some very high quality psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists and am on antidepressants but I still live in constant internal pain.

Everything I do is tainted and warped by my condition. It has stripped me of my social life as I focus on working to pay rent. It has stripped me of my dignity as I collapse in public. It has stripped me of being able to commit to anything at all.


The last year has been absolute hell for me and its all coming to a head now. My nan has just died, my dream job just sacked me and my aspirations and hopes are dying around me as my illness consumes everything I have.



I don't want to be here.
