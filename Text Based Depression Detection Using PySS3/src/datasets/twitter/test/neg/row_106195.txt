Feeling hollow and aloneHey, I am not sure how to explain this but I just am not feeling myself and everyday I think about ending things more and more. I have had some medical problems in the past and recently got broken up with. I realize Iâ€™m not the most excitable and bubbly person, I have never been, but at this point I canâ€™t find joy in anything. I find it hard to feel like I have a purpose and that I wonâ€™t die alone and that people actually care for me. I take care of a lot of people and I have been told I am very caring but I guess I never feel any of that back. 

I guess, how do you get out of a rut and feel like you deserve to live and that things wonâ€™t be like this forever. 
Iâ€™m just loosing hope fast.
