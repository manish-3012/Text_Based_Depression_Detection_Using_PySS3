I'm tired.I am currently active duty military and I'm so tired of everything.  Not just the job that I can't quit but the fact that I have no one to love or keep me sane. I'm getting out soon, on medication, in individual and group therapy but I still hate everything. Everyday I deal with people I cannot stand while following rules that make no sense.  I have been suffering from this for the past 10 years and it doesn't seem to get any better.   I just want to not exist anymore. 
Everyday I want a reason and I thought a dog might do that.  Some type of emotional support animal but when I mention it to the only person I really trust they expressed doubts about my ability to care for it. Honestly, they are right.  I don't know where I'll be in a year, and I can hardly take care of myself anymore.

I don't think I'll do it because I'm a coward and afraid of a botched attempt and inconveniencing my family, but there is honestly nothing I want more. Sorry for ranting, but I just don't have anything else.
