This is where it endsI've tried to do this so many times but held on for one person. Because he loved me and cared about me. Just found out he doesn't and never did so I have nothing to lose. Nobody ever needs me as much as I need them. The one person I needed didn't need me. I can't fucking live anymore. Everyone would be better off without me. I've lost so many fucking people and he was the last one and it turns out he doesn't give a shit. I can't wait to fucking leave this world. I've been wanting to do this since I was 12 years old. It's about fucking time. I'm sorry. It's better this way
