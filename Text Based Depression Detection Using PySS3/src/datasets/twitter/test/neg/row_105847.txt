I feel numbI canâ€™t really feel anything anymore. Sure, Iâ€™ll smile but itâ€™s fake, thereâ€™s nothing behind it. Iâ€™m having trouble at work because I could care less about it. All I do is sleep. I donâ€™t even do stuff I like anymore. To top it all off is Iâ€™m 32 and still live with my parents.

Now all I think about is death. The feel of the grip in my hand. The cold and smoothness of the barrel. The weight of it in my hand. The thought weights on me heavily. Iâ€™m going to pick it up after my parents leave for work. I donâ€™t think my dad knows that I know where itâ€™s at. I canâ€™t wait to hold it.
