Hopefully itâ€™s my last week.Iâ€™m hopefully going to kill myself by the end of Friday, but when an opportunity arises I will do it sooner. I now have nothing good and nothing to live for. Everyone will benefit from my passing, and I canâ€™t find a future for myself. I remember when I was smart, but now those days are long gone. The last shreds of reasons to live have ceased.
