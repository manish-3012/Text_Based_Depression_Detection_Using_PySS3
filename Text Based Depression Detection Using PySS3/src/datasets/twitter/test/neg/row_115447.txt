At night.Sometimes i close my eyes at night. Pretending that the pillow im holding is a little cat sleeping right beside me. Only then, the sides of my bed wont feel as cold. I really want a cat. A companion thatd love me and only me. I have a dog but she doesnt really like me. Even a dog doesnt love me. Im that unlovable.
