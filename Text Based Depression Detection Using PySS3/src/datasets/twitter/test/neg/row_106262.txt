I can't do it any moreI don't even know where to start.

I've had depression and severe OCD for ten years now (I'm 24), and therapy never helped. (Neither did meds, if anyone's asking.)
I don't have any friends (I tried, years ago, and then the OCD kicked in, and now I'm just a friendless fuck-up.).
I had to quit studying for my degree because of OCD.
My mom and I will be kicked out of my apartment in a few weeks if we can't afford the rent. Which we can't, because it's just so damn much despite being a really shitty really small place.
I can't work because of OCD/depression.
I've spent the last few months doing literally Nothing. Nothing at all. Of course I'd lurk reddit some times, if I can take it (OCD), but most of them I did nothing.
I don't know what to do.
There's nothing I can do (OCD), and everything I'd want to do costs so much energy I don't have.

I used to be a nice person.
I used to get along with people and at least I was happy.

This post doesn't even cover it. I'm just so fucking tired of it all. I can't even afford a pair of shoes now that mine are torn to shreds after having the same for 5 years. I don't have any other family, I haven't seen my grandma in months because of OCD. I tried therapy and everything multiple times and Nothing helps.
I don't even feel anything any more. I just sit there and do nothing.

I can't take this any more.
I just can't.
Good bye
