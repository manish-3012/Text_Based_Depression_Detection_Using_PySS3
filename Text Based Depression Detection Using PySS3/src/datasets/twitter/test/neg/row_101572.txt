Another day trying to hold on.Every day I think about death with increasing fondness. I see it as an absolute inevitability that I'll kill myself. The only thing that's held me back until now is the lack of a reliable method. 

The anxiety and suicidal thoughts compel me to distract myself by constanly doing something. The depression prevents me from doing anything meaningful. I spend a lot of time just laying in bed in pain, doing nothing.

In desperation I told a friend I would move out and be his roommate. After realizing that I'm not in the position mentally or financially to actually go through with it, I had to tell him I can't do it. I feel awful about it because I was saying I would do it for a while and now a couple weeks before we were going to move I just bailed. I never should have agreed to do it in the first place and it was selfish and short sighted of me. I agreed because I was desperate for a change, anything. But it would be compounding that mistake to go through with it when I'm this much of a liability and an emotional drain. He won't even talk to me now. How I manage to fuck up when it looks like I'm at rock bottom with nothing else to fuck up I don't know. Now I've managed to damage one of the few friendships I actually had left.

I don't want to live through this day, much less the next few months. I want to drive off somewhere and jump off a cliff or something.
