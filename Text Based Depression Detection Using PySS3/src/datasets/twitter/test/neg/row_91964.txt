I hate everything. Im serious.Im so fucking done with everyone and everything in my life.  Hardly anybody gives a shit about me except for what i can 'accomplish', test scores, get a job, do this, do that.  No one gives a fuck if im happy or not, or about anything i do really, unless it benefits them. 

The real killer is the fact that i have Misophonia.  To those of you who dont know, Misophonia is the 'hatred of sound'  Which is a good way to put it.  I would say things 'annoy' me but that wouldnt be nearly a strong enough word.  Certain sounds, triggers, make me so mad.... its impossible to explain.  Being annoyed is to being sad as misophonia is to depression.  It started as just the sound of chewing, then it was the way people's mouths move when the eat, and then more and more until now pretty much everything is liable to set me off.  

It makes you so angry....  Its literally, and i mean not figuratively, like if i cant kill or destroy the trigger, im going to kill myself.   Whichever is easier.

Oh and to top it off ive been cheated on in every relationship ive been in.
