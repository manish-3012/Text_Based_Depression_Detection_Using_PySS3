i want to die so badly that iâ€™ve basically given up on life.because i think about death so often i literally just donâ€™t give a fuck anymore. itâ€™s all meaningless to me. college, work, and other pointless, temporary life things. does anyone relate to this? i guess my thought process is that if iâ€™m going to inevitably end my life at some point it doesnâ€™t matter what i do while iâ€™m still here.
