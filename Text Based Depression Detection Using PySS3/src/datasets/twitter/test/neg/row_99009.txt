Void, empty, blank, no commentNo guilt trip intended here: I don't expect anyone to read this.

Not even using a throwaway -- just want to get this out.

I'm scared. I'm truly frightened.

Been sad for no objective reason lately. Just sad. Was already a diagnosed alcoholic, but drinking more to avoid feeling real. Been starving myself (again) for some reason. None of it makes sense.

I was raised Atheist, so things confuse me. I want to die, but am scared of the endless Nothing I've been told to expect. I cannot imagine not existing.

Beyond that, I feel selfish and stupid and egotistical and dumb for even typing this post.

I want to end this. I've tried before and narrowly avoided death. Its not an emergency now, but I also know I'm close again 

Sorry.

There are people more worth it here. Idk. Im tired.
