InevitableI am pretty sure I am going to flunk out a program that I have dedicated my entire life too. I know Iâ€™m only 21 and that a program is not the end of the world. I mean academically itâ€™s concerning I mean my professors basically tell me Iâ€™m dumb and I shouldnâ€™t be pre med. Iâ€™ve been told constantly how I donâ€™t belong with the other students. I get that I have bpd and bipolar and Iâ€™m different. I learn different. I experience emotions completely different. When someone has a mild panic attack mine would equate to an extreme one. Iâ€™m unable to experience emotions at a normal intensity rate. Everything is over amplified. Highly intense. And being told Iâ€™m not smart enough. Being told my whole life Iâ€™ve never been good enough. It does eat at me. The thing is I wonâ€™t give up. I wonâ€™t let myself fall until I know. I do plan on the inevitable if I do fail. But at least I can know that I died trying. I fought hard and Iâ€™ll keep fighting until I flunk out. This program is really all I have left and if I lose it then I guess I know where I stand in life.
