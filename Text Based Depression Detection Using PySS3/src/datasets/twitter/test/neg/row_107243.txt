I failedI failed another attempt.

I cant do anything right.
I want to feel loved, I want to laugh with my friends like we used to.
I am so tired of this. I want someone to talk to, I need a listener in my life for once.
Everyone asks me how I'm feeling but when i say bad they just go on and say oh same. I cant help but feel hopeless.
My imagination and dreams are the only things that feel good. I can do whatever I want and feel whatever i want. I want to get away from the reality. 
Trying to do anything isnt worth anymore, so I guess I'll just exist with the feeling of being a burden to everyone.
Every day feels the same, I wake up, listen to music, and sleep.
I want a hug. I want a kiss to make me happy.
I tend to not show how I truly feel because of bad experiences with showing my emotions. People are scary. Everytime I eat something I feel guilty, I feel like I dint deserve a single bit I ate. I want to go back where I thought lode would be fun.
I dont want to care anymore, I want to leave everything behind. it's not worth trying to succeed. I want to run away from life.
Maybe If I wasn't a piece of shit I am people wouldn't hate me. I dont know who I am anymore, I feel like a complete stranger to myself.
I'm in a need of happiness, and it's starting to show.
I'm hoping not to survive 2021.
I want someone to fix me. 
I dont belong nowhere. Nobody would like to have me in their arms. 
I've been so miserable lately that i cant even bother to do anything. Can someone just lower their expectations for people already, I'm tired of being expected to be perfect and beatiful, like come on people. Just throw me away, theres no hope for my future. 

if you read this thank you. 

I need to vent on the internet considering i have no one to talk to ðŸ¤¡

Anyways love u all bye â™¡
