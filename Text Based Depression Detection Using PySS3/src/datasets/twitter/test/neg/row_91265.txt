Just can't anymore.I just can't stand my life anymore. Nothing makes any sense, I been waiting forever for the things to get better and nothing happens. I tried, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried. I'm a disaster,can't properly take care of myself, and ruining other people lifes with my depression.
