Not sure what I'm looking for here...Hello. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just speaking a little will be all I need. Maybe by the time I hit submit I will be better off and realize that suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem, or what have you. I honestly don't know, but I figure if I can at least get some of this off of me, then maybe, just maybe it will lighten my load to press on, even if only for one more day.

I will give you some very, very quick back story. I am diagnosed BiPolar NOS w/ Moderate-Severe Depression, and Light-Moderate Environmentally Stimulated Anxiety. I am on Disability, yes, shame on me. Only 21 and I can't even keep it together.

Anyways, there, troll away as to how I abuse the system, it's fine. Take a shot. Everyone else I know either dodges the subject in awkward ways, or tries to find me jobs, or out right says "You seem too happy." So fuck it, you know you want to. Heh.

I don't even know where I was going to go with this post. I mean, I'm just sitting here, with a partially full box of ice cream left over from my Fiancee's birthday melting, fork protruding, because I was to lazy to wash a spoon.

Today I woke up crushed, and it is one of those days where I know I am feeling like I just want to end it all, but can't. I feel like I was doing so good.

Fuck it, I'm going to be honest. I was doing good. I was smoking pot. No I didn't use the Government's money to buy it, I'm not a fucking scumbag. Anyways. My fiancee doesn't know. She is absolutly against it, and it has been a running theme for our over six year relationship. Not specifically with pot, but everything. We were kids when we met and got together. It's a long story.

Anyways. Yes, I had weed, it helped me accept the things I couldn't change, and honestly, helped me change the things I could. It made me feel like a scientist about everything. I picked up hobbies, I started venturing out of the house (on foot) to explore and take in nature. I for once felt like I was getting better.

It's weird though. It's not like I'm addicted. I'm not going into convulsions, my mind just basically reset. Everything I had been coming to terms with has reverted, everything I had been coming to understand now feels like there is no meaning. And now here I sit, exactly how I was before I every tried it.

I don't know what to do because like any person who is suicidal, I want a reason to live. I want a reason to put the pills away, the blade down, but what is the fucking point? I am on meds, and they make me better than I was before them. Before them I would have constant Mixed States, and rapid swings (sometimes multiple in the same hour).

But where the fuck do I go from here? I don't want to go sit in a hospital I can't afford. I don't want to sit at my desk looking into a monitor watching everyone else live happy. Yes I know I have family I would hurt, a fiancee who may never truely get over it, but if the only thing keeping me here is the oppinions of other people, then I think I'm here for the wrong reasons. I don't want to live in my world, sad all the time, just so that others don't have to feel the pain of my passing. Torture myself to keep others happy? Sounds like a plan?

I don't know guys (broad terms, not based on sex) I think this is the worst morning I've had in a very long time.
