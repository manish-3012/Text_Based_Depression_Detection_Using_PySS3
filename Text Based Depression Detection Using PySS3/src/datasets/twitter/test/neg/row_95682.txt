My friend sent me a message about suicide and went offline. What can I do?My friend messaged me suicide related stuff and then went offline. I know he has considered it in the past and is not in a good place. I've tried every means I have to contact him but he isn't responding and is currently out of the country. I have no idea what I can do. I don't know what to do. He usually is never far from social media so this whole thing is screaming that something could be wrong.
