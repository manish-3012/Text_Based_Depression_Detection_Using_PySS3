My mom is upset that I told her that I want to kill myself. She says it's like I'm picking on her. I'm so depressed and angry right now.Long story short: I'm on disability, can't afford anything other than somewhere in the projects, trying to make it work at home for as long as possible.

Anyway, my mom is upset that I want to kill myself and I'm 99.99% sure she's drinking again, and she's an angry drunk. I don't know whether to actually go through with killing myself or stabbing her to death. I really feel like inflicting the maximum amount of pain on her as possible. I don't know what else to say. This is the most devastating thing that's ever happened to me. The worse part is that she doesn't get why a parent shouldn't be upset when hearing that their child (albeit an adult) wants to kill themselves. I mean seriously, wtf is wrong with her?
