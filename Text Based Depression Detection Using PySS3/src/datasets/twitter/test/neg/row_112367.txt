I have been in depression in years. I always think about killing myself. And I keep trying not to do it. And it's miserable.Life is miserable. I am doing Master Degree, got offer for PhD, got offer for a nice job, but I cant seem to be happy. Everything around me makes me feel so sad and suicidal even though it has nothing to do with it.

I once had a girlfriend who nearly pulled me out of the endless cycle of suicide, but one day she decided that she had had enough and given up, left me alone in fear and memoirs and regret. After that, everything is painful. So, I just keep on going without an actual goal in life, living like a zombie walking down the street with just the body.

There is this video on youtube that says the best thing I have been feeling.

"Everyone who kept their finger crossed for me has long quit as though they got tired of waiting. No wonder they left. I would too."

For years, I have been living, and working for someone else's goal. My parents sent me to the States just for their American Dream, and they want me to get the citizenship so they can be sponsored. Then, I met a girl, and I studied hard because she wants me to have a decent job that can take care of her in the future. Then the second girl also has this so-called American dream that because she tries so hard to stay in the US, I also need that to become my "dream" to live together with her. Then at the end, does it even matter? I got the job, got the citizenship, and everything fell apart. Some of their dreams are not that non-sense; however, it seems like I have lost my own ability to live for myself, for my own identity in this world, and instead, just have been living to achieve an end goal that is to be with someone else who can actually pull me out of darkness. Living for someone else's other than myself for 14 years has already killed my own identity. My therapist once asked me, "I have been knowing you for x years, and I realize that your life involves way too much around someone else's goal, not your goal. What are you? Who are you? Who do you want to be, for your own self and not for someone else?"

I'm suicidal. I'm scared of killing myself. I am trying to stay sane and not do stupid things but it keeps getting harder and I don't know if I can hold down the fort for so long.
