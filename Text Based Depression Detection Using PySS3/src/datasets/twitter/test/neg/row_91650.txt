Nobody cares. I guess this is it.2.4g Theophylline SR. Probably not enough to kill me but who knows.

Nobody cares I cried until 3 am last night. Nobody cares tens of people talked me out of suicide once and it's just all my fault. It's just me not wanting to visit the grave of my grandma and has nothing to do with me having bad diarrhea and also wanting to die. I'm just an unrespectful ass disrespecting my family. Mother talks about disowning me because I show no reverence and because I attended grave visits of my grandpa on my divorced father's side. Well since you really want me to go away how about I just die.

Auf Nimmerwiedersehen, ha. Germans have sayings for all things don't they.
