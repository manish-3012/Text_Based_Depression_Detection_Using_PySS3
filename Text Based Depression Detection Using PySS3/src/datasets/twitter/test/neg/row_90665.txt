I can't handle this anymore.When I was 4-7 my grandfather was sexually and physically abusive, even going as far as raping me twice. My grandma found out and told me never to tell anyone, that he only does it because he loves me and that nobody will believe me. I'm so stressed all the time and have flashbacks a lot. I've been struggling with untreated Dissociative Identity disorder and PTSD. I've tried to tell my mom about my anxiety and suicidal thoughts but she won't listen, she calls me an attention whore and a failure. I can't talk to my dad about it because I have a hard time talking to men especially in person due to my PTSD. Im so anxious I can hardily even function, I'm failing all my classes and I have literally no friends. I've not told anyone about the rape or abuse because nobody will believe me and it was years ago so there is no proof. Even if I do get help I don't think I can be fixed at this point. I just want to end it all. If I keep my secret I'm just gonna keep destroying myself but if I tell my secret my family will be destroyed and It will be my fault.
