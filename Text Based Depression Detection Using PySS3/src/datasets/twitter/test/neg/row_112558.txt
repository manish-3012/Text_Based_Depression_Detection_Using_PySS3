I just attempted to hang myself.I don't know what went through my mind when I attempted. Before, I was thinking about my mom. About how I felt like a failure in her eyes. Without a second thought, I nonchalantly picked up a belt and attempted to hang myself in my parents' room.

However, I stopped and thought about the absurdity of it all. Of how I care so little about my life, that I'm willing to just end it all, right on the spot.

I'm just lying in bed right now, and I feel nothing. I haven't broken down into tears, nor am I having a panic attack. I'm just shocked.
