oh i am emptyThere's no reason for me to feel so empty, but I do. I have a wonderful family, great friends, and a lovely boyfriend, but there is still this deep hole in me that I can't fill. My life is active and full - but I am empty.

I try and deal with it as self-destructively as I can. At the moment, I'm not self-injuring, but I try and deal with the way I feel by fucking up my appearance as much as I possibly can through piercing every inch of me that I possibly can, shaving my head, and doing anything I can to make me look as ugly on the outside as I feel on the inside.

I want to die, but I'm too scared to try. So I live, and I hurt, and I hurt, and I hurt. 

And it's hard. If I could close my eyes forever, tonight, I would.

Thank you for listening, I had to tell someone. It's too hard keeping this all inside myself.
