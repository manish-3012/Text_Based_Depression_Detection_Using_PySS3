How do I explain to my parents that I'm suicidal?I really struggle with talking about emotions and anything that makes me seem weak, especially with my mum. It's a mix of getting a lot of less than desirable responses to my opening up about emotions in the past and a severe lack of trust on my part. Problem is I'm quite dependent on them, both in terms of housing and in terms of finance, despite being 20 years old. In addition to that I have a history of depression and anxiety, and while I haven't been able to work up the courage to make the call to go see a psychologist yet (I've been meaning to for weeks, but I'm terrified they'll say I'm imagining or exaggerating things), I'm pretty sure I'm rapidly slipping back into depression. So what's happening right now is that they're seemingly very tired of providing for me. In fact, they seem very tired of me overall and it feels like everything that's wrong in the household is my fault. 

Now, they're not threatening to throw me out just yet, they just want me to move out to this guest cottage that's located on their lot and to have me pay rent and pretty much have nothing to do with them. The reason I don't really want for this to happen is that while I'm not exactly enjoying living with them very much, I am really, really scared I might hurt myself if I'm alone. Whenever they're out of the house for a couple of hours and I'm all alone I just get this overwhelming desire to hurt myself and I'm constantly thinking about suicide, which scares me a lot because I never struggled that much with suicidal thoughts before. In addition to that, I really don't have any way of paying for myself right now. I could probably solve that, but they want me to start paying *right now*. 

And all this is just adding up and making me even more suicidal. But I really don't want to die. I just feel like there is no other option. I feel like I can't cope with everything. I just don't know what to do.
