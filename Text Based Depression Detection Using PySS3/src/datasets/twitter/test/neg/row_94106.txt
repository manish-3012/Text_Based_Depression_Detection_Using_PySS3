Not suicidal but I donâ€™t want to exist sometimes...?I canâ€™t be the only one that feels this way. I sometimes wish I can start a new life, no one knows me just a fresh canvas. I see my family and I see them fit *but* without me in the picture. Somedays Iâ€™m grateful for my circumstances and other days I just have really really bad days. And I think to myself, why canâ€™t I just live off the grid in another land. I want to be alone sometimes and other days I feel so alone and want people who support me in arms reach. Itâ€™s such a conflicting feeling. Like if I can live a new life but keep those who are close to me. I know itâ€™s sillyâ€” 

I stress about the future tooâ€” Itâ€™s so stressful. I feel like I donâ€™t have enough time and other days I worry if where Iâ€™m gonna be in three decades. I worry Iâ€™m going to be a failure.
