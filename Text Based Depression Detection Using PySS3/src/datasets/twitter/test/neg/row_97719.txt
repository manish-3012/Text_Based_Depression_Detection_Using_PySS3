Goodbye.I wish my car accident yesterday killed me. Someone ran a red light and crashed into me. I saw it coming and prayed for death. Unfortunately I walked away completely unharmed with a totaled car. 

This is the last thing that needed to happen before making a suicide plan that I've considered for years.

TL;DR
I ruined my love life
I'm poor as fuck and can't afford a new car
I have a shitty job
I have no money left 
My mom passed away 4 years ago and my alcoholic dad eloped with his girlfriend
I've lost contact with all my friends

I have nothing to lose. My mom was the only one who loved me. Today would've been her 52nd birthday.

My 19 years in Hell are coming to an end tonight. I have a bottle of xanax, nyquil, muscle relaxers, and a fifth of vodka. 

Goodbye.
