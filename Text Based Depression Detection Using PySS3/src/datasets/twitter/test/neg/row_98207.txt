I have body dysmorphia and want to die because of itSince I was a child, it was deeply-rooted in me that I'm ugly because I'm not white. I have beige skin, dark hair, and brown eyes. No matter what anyone tells me, I'll never believe that I'm beautiful because men don't desire me because I'm not a white woman. I've been considering dying my hair either red or blonde to fix myself. Unfortunately I have astigmatism so I can't fix my eye color. I'll bleach my skin though. If a man can't like me after my changes, then I'll probably commit suicide when I'm 30 and single.
