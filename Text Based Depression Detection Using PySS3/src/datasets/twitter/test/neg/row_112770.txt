Intrusive suicidal thoughtsFor the past few months, I have been having very vivid and intrusive suicidal thoughts. I've felt suicidal before, but it used to come in waves. Now it just feels like torture. Every day that I wake up and have to get out of bed, it feels like a punch in the face. I'm in my last semester of undergrad and these thoughts are really affecting my grades. I just want to graduate, but I can't concentrate on my classes because I keep having these bad thoughts. I don't want to, but I do. I have talked to school counselors before, but it hasn't really helped me because I feel very awkward and uncomfortable talking about how I feel. Even writing this post feels a bit uncomfortable for me, but I just want these thoughts to go away...or at least become less debilitating. If anyone has any advice, please let me know.
