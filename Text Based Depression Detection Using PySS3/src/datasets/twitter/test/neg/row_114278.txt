Please someone help me dieI can't cope with this. Every morning I wake up screaming in mental anguish. I hate myself so much, there's nothing I can do to change. I can't talk to people because I don't know what to say. I wish I just didn't have to wake up any more. I can't answer the phone or reply to my emails, everything is just too difficult. I'm self employed and people want to book me to do jobs for them but I'm ignoring all their calls and messages because it's too stressful. Please can someone help me to end it? I can't do it by myself, I can't do anything right. I don't want to exist any more.
