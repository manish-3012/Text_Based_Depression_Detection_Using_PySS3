I can't get help fast enoughEveryday is a horrible day. I feel empty and idk why. I've been cutting just to feel something. I feel like I've let down everyone around me. I feel like a ghost. I broke down and got an appointment with a counselor, but it's weeks away. Idk how much longer I can keep this up and I don't have anywhere else to go. I keep fantasizing about ending it all and I have the means to.  I don't want to be here, I don't want to be me.
