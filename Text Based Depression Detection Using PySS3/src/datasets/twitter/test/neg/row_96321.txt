My cat died today. My best friend.Hey people. 

So as it says in title, I was fighting with depression for a few years now and I actually felt like I'm totally okay last few months. But today my cat died. My best friend, she would always wait by the door when I was about to arrive from work. 

She was always next to me when I was home, and now it's all so empty. I have trouble forming bonds. But the bond I formed with her was strong. I don't know how to keep on going. The worst thing is that I could be blamed for her death. I took her to vet because she lost weight. And she had some parasites that actually started a cancer in her body. Vet said that maybe she could have helped her if I'd brought her earlier. 

She always used to loose weight when she was in heat, so I tought that's why she lost some weight. But I was wrong and now she is dead. They had to put her to sleep forever. I can't stop thinking about how it would go if I took here to vet earlier. I only noticed she is getting worse a month ago. So since I'm living alone at 21 and paying for living and school while working I had to put some money together before going to vet's place. 

I can't stop blaming myself, and missing my little Tina. I always have this feeling that she is here. I look on my bed and see her, and a second later I realize it's just my imagination. She is gone. I love her so much, but I failed her. I really do hope she is at better place now. Waiting for me like she always used to when I was comming from work.
