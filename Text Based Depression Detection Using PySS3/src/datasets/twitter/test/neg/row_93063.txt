I want to end my life.I want to end my life. I don't know how to do it as I've never attempted, but I've had thoughts and I've come to the conclusion that I now want to make this a reality. I've never self harmed and I've never made plans. I can't do this life thing, it's just not worth it anymore.

I need help for quick ways to do it. Pain is not a factor I am worried about.

I've struggled with social acceptance, bullying, a dysfunctional family in addition to very few friends - even fewer who understand and accept what I'm going through in my life. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety and despite my own and others attempts to counteract their effects these conditions prevent me from functioning in society.

A year ago my dad died suddenly, and everything took a turn for the worst.
Just two weeks ago I was kicked out of home. I've never been able to find my feet.
People say I don't try hard enough, or I'm looking at situations wrong. I try as hard as I can handle. I may be looking at a situation 'wrong' in others opinions but for someone like me I can't see it any other way. If there's a bad situation I cannot forsee positives coming from it.

I'm so tired of trying to explain myself to people who question why I can't do things like a 'normal' person. I'm tired of arguing that when I don't want to do something I mean it. I'm tired of my heart being broken by people I thought I could trust but drag me through thorn bushes. I'm especially tired of the lack of respect in this world for peoples views.

I hate my life and I hate this world. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't care who I hurt, because finally they may understand the hurt that I've been through. I don't feel welcome here and nothing feels right.

I've always been told that suicide is not the way. But what if there's no other way out? A friend said I was being selfish for wanting to commit suicide... it's wrong to say that to someone because it usually makes them feel bad. But it made me feel angry and more compelled to die.

I have a guinea pig. He has probably a maximum of 3 years left in his innocent little life. If he dies before I do I will be even more alone than I am now. If I die before he does, he will surely die if I don't find somewhere for him to go.

If I am successful in my attempt and this post is found by anyone I know, I leave all of my belongings to my friend Petra, and thank her for doing her best when no one else would. Unfortunately my dear, there's only so much you can do, and you won't always be there for me... and that's what I need.
