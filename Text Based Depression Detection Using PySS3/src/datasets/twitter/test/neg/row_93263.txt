Does anyone like your own birthday?Birthday makes me think about why I am here. So I tend not to remember and celebrate it. But the more I despise it, the more the people around me think I am pathetic and want to make me happy by celebrating my birthday and wishing me happy birthday. And I can only make a happy face during the time... If only they asked me first, I may be able to refuse it but people like surprise too much...

Another painful aspect is I value fairness so much. But because I don't think birthday is worth celebrating, I will not do anything in return. People wish me happy festivals (Xmas, birthday, thanksgiving all the time) and they may give me some little gift/treat (card and candies). I am very tired of giving them back card and candies so I need to sleep through these days and pretend to forget the festivals...

Can people stop celebrating festivals with me?
