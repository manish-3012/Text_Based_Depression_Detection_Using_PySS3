I want to kill myself because I'm uglyI have never had a real friend. I was bullied in school for being quiet, no one paid any attention to me in college, and I was picked on at work by a couple coworkers. I have horrible social anxiety because of all this. Judgment and criticism cut me like a knife. I try to talk to people, but it never progresses beyond small talk. For whatever reason, I can't "click" with people. I don't know what is wrong with me.

But you know, I could take the judgment, the lack of friends, and the social ineptitude if I weren't so hideous.

I have a fat face, even when I'm starving myself thin. I have pictures of the days in high school when I'd only eat an apple a day, and my face is so fucking fat in all of them.

The tip of my nose is really fat. It's totally out of proportion to the rest of my face.

I have a butt chin, which makes me look like a man. Even the name, "butt chin," is gross.

My forehead is huge, so I have to cover it with dopey-looking bangs.

Then, to rub salt in the wound, recently my brain has been like "lol, have some feels for this practically perfect guy who'll never give you the time of day!" WHAT is wrong with me? If I could turn off these feelings like a light switch, I would do it. But I can't. So I am completely miserable.

I really want to die. But I'm a wimp and scared of the pain. So I live hoping that each night I go to sleep I won't wake up.

If you read all of this, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
