I donâ€™t see another way outI donâ€™t wanna focus on negatives but I feel trapped 
I have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me but I canâ€™t handle his female friends, any female in his life for that matter. I lack trust likely due to trauma from Being abused by my parents...so I have panic and anxiety
On top of that Iâ€™m stuck living with those parents who hurt me. Itâ€™s either them or in a crowded apt with my bf and his dad. Bad conditions.
I have like two friends and only see one....i canâ€™t afford a place to live because rent is an arm and a leg in CA
On top of that I lost my only child....I want us to be together again 
But besides my circumstances I canâ€™t escape my mind. The panic attacks. The self hatred. Iâ€™m mean and angry and resentful and have low self worth.....

I just donâ€™t see a way out besides ending it all. Iâ€™m not ready to give up but the pain is over taking me...
