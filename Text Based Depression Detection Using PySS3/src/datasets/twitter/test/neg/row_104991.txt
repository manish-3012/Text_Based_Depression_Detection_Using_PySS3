I wish I'd never been fucking born and I want this all to be fucking over.OCD, depression, and illness have taken my whole life from me. There's nothing left now. Even if everything got fixed tomorrow, it's too late. I will never have the life I wanted or be the person I wanted to be. My life is fucking over, and I can't fucking take it, and I don't even know why the fuck I'm posting this because it's pointless. So read this or don't, reply to it or don't, it doesn't matter.

FUCK EVERYTHING.
