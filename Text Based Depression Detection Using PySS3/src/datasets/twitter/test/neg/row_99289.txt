willpowerthose of you that say you have dealt with these feelings for years or decades you must have some kind of iron will in there.  I've only been like this for 2.5 months and pretty much near the end. 

I still go to work and play the part but when I'm alone it's just misery and sorrow thinking about what I'll probably  have to end up doing.
