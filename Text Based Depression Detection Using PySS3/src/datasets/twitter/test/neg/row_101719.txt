Everyday is just another day of suffering (19yo)Jealousy, ugliness, awkwardness, delusion... I can't live with it any longer. It also doesn't help that I'm living in a weird, confusing time. I miss the old days of my childhood.


I hate my body, I'm cursed because of my severe mouth breathing and genes, my face looks like it's melting off. The sound of my stupid voice, my ridiculous head shape, it makes me so fucking embarrased. 


I will always stand out on pictures because of how ugly and weird-looking I am, thus I hate being forced to go on a picture or people taking random photos of me. Yes, I know I'm ugly, but taking a picture of me randomly (which is super annoying but everyone does it these days cause privacy is dead) reminds me of it again.


As I mentioned already, I'm extremely jealous of people who have are successful at things I love and are really good-looking. My life will never be as good as theirs and I can't stop comparing my life. Life is indeed unfair, and you have to make do with what you have, but I know I can't, cause I'm weak and I already have so many flaws.


I miss when life was simpler for me. No smartphones, no adult responsibilities. I don't fit in this digital world at all. I'm just sick of having to deal with fake people and I succumb to my smartphone as well. I can't do anything else anymore than being on my phone, browsing reddit and listening to music. My passion and attention span for other things, like playing guitar, video games and reading are gone.


I would prefer to go back to a time where my appearance wasn't an issue to me, everyone seemed to live in the moment and I never had a moment of worry. But those times are not coming back.


I want to take the easy way out. No point in living this world. It sucks that my life will have been so short, but there's no way I can force myself to live longer, knowing it's not gonna be better.


Why do I bother writing this? I don't know. I guess until you're actually dead, you'll always have some sort of hope. That's what I call delusional hope.
