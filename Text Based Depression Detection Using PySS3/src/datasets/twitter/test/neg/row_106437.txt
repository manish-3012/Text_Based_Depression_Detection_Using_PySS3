All i see in the future is an abyss of nothingTheres nothing to look forward to, to me i feel like theres only death waiting for us all. It hurts, and then it doesnt. Then it hurts all over again, and then it doesnâ€™t. Why do I even have goals in life if they mean nothing. I mean nothing. Light years away, to another planet Iâ€™m already dead. I wouldnâ€™t survive another death in my life, and deep down I want to die because thereâ€™s no point. Why run a race that youâ€™ll never win, when you only finish with bruises and scars, and loose in the very end. im pushing everyone away. I donâ€™t even know who i am. I dont know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s so painful, and I no longer even want to be happy. It doesnâ€™t make sense to me. Why do I want to die?
