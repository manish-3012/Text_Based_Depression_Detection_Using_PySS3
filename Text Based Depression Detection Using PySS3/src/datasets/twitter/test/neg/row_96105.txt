I don't know what to do or what to thinkHello. These past few years I've been rather lonely and depressed and what has kept me going was the thought in my head of "It will eventually get better". But it didn't got any better, I continue feeling like shit, fewer friends, currently failling college and really low prospects for the future and what is scarying me is that what if it will never gets better? Is it really worth to keep going?
