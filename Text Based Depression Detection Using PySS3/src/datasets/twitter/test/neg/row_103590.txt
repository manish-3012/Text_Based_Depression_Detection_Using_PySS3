Being Safe for the Sake of OthersI have pretty much no will to live or any form of self preservation. But, I care about other people. This generally keeps me from doing stupid stuff, such as reckless driving, This has come up noe especially with COVID. I'm already required to wear a mask etc for my job (essential employee - grocery store), but even then I still wear PPE and keep safe the little of out and about I actually do for the sake of others. Just because I want to die doesn't mean I'm willing to cause undue suffering onto others.
