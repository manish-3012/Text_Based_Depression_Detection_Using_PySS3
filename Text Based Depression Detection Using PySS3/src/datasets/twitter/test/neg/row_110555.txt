I'm hurting so much tonight. I don't want to feel this.I love someone who has left me due to some relationship issues, but mostly due to other circumstances out of our control. They are now long distance, and dealing with a lot of things. I sincerely love this person with my whole heart, and I know deep down we can work. Our relationship was mostly good, and I feel like the issues are solvable. The relationship was non-toxic. To hear them say that they know the relationship was more good than bad kills me on the inside.

Night times are the worst. I'm missing, loving, and hurting so fucking bad thinking of them. I would do anything to have the ability to go back in time to do certain things differently. I hate being stupid sometimes. This fucking hurts. Time, space, and not being able to have direct contact with your soulmate fucking hurts. I have so many good memories with them, and I had SO MANY unfinished future trips, adventures, and more memories to create with them...

Some days I feel so numb. Some days I physically shake and feel the anxiety and depression creeping up over my neck and shoulders. I feel the pit of my stomach. Some nights I cry my fucking eyes out, and I kinda want the pain to go away.

God, I'm trying to endure it so badly. God, I would do anything to have another chance. God, I hope time and space can heal the both of us to give us a chance for another try.

Please.
