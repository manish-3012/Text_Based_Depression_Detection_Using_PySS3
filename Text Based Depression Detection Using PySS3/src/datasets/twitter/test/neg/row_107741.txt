Been more compelled to end it since I moved backHi /r/SuicideWatch,

I don't really know where to start with this but I've been depressed and having suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years. It was mostly manageable until the last 3-4 months, when I moved back home from college, where I felt even more compelled to go through with it.

5 years ago, I graduated high school and went off to college. My first year, I struggled to do well and ended taking summer courses the following summer. When my parents found out that I had done poorly, they got upset, confronted me about it and compared me to my older sister, who had never done poorly in her courses, based off the information she gave them. This left the feeling that I could never be the son they wanted, could never reach their expectations of me. I had written this feeling in a journal and put it away for some time.

The following year, things lighted up. My parents, as they did, forgot about the whole ordeal and were nicer...until they saw the journal. It wasn't uncommon for my parents to go thorough my sister's and my things, and back then, we just accepted this. My mom read the entry about how I felt and how I started having suicidal thoughts because of it and confronted me once more, stating that they have no expectations of me and never compare me to my sister. She then said that my sister never had these thoughts and that I was selfish for thinking these thoughts, that taking my life is selfish and inconsiderate to the rest of the family.

For the next 3 years, this sort of thing continues and I continue my cycle of depression and suicide and happiness and hope. At this point, my roommates notice it and do everything they can to get my mind off of everything.

Graduation comes and I leave my university, moving back home and starting work at a company that takes 2 hours for the commute in traffic. My schedule now is to wake up at 4:45 am, get to work at 7:30, work until 4:30 (with a lunch break), get home at 7:30 and sleep by 10. Since I've been home, I've been compared to, by my mom, my sister and my dad. ((So back story, my dad hasn't had a job since 2001 and hasn't been emotionally there since my sister was born, so I'm being compared to his failure as a father and as a person.))

These comparisons are having such a negative impact on me and its making the suicidal thoughts stronger and more compelling. I told my mom about this and she denies it, saying that it's "constructive criticism" and I shouldn't take it too seriously. 

I've honestly thought about throwing myself into moving traffic or into the subway transit to just end this pain.
