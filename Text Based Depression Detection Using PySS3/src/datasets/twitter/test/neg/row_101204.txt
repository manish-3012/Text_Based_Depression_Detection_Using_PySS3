I miss my ex. My best friend left.I want to text him and see if heâ€™ll take me back just so I can finally have a reason to end if for good when he says no. I honestly havenâ€™t had a reason to live since he left. Itâ€™s been a year and a half and we were together for a short period of time but he was the only one who I could ever see myself truly being in love with and I fucked it all up. My best friend also left me. Everyone leaves me. Why even try anymore? I should just die. Itâ€™s not worth it to be hurt anymore. Iâ€™m just scared.
