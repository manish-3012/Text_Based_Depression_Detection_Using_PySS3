When dying is all thats left.I have had suicidal thoughts now for longer than I can remember.  Its something I've had for years, probably decades.  The thought of ending it all has never been far away from my conscious mind and for that reason I've sorted accepted it like a shadow.

In the last few months these thoughts have become more pronounced, to the extent that I'm now planning the how and the when, where before it was just the general thought of ending it.

I'm not sure whether I will/would act but I feel I'm being pulled closer towards ending my life.  I've rationalised the impact this would have on other people to the extent I don't care what I'd be leaving behind anymore.

I'm not sad, tearful or outwardly depressed.  I just feel permanently tired of life, that I've given it a shot and its not for me.
