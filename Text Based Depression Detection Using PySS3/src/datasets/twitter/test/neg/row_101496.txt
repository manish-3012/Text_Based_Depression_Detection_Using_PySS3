The pain of loneliness is unbearableI've been lonely my entire life, all 20 years of it. I never had any friends as a child. My parents had me convinced I was better than the other kids at school, so I was incredibly unliked by everyone. I had a sick obsession with video games and would think about them all day before I went home and played them alone. I would eat alone at lunch in middle and high school and developed a terrible anxiety of social interactions. 

I spent most of my teen years alone on my computer playing video games for thousands of hours. I have no good memories at all. No adventures, good times. None of that. Just memories of anxiety and feeling like I wanted to die every second I was out in public. 

Despite trying to dress well and being physically fit I still feel incredibly ugly and uncomfortable wherever I go. I've never had a girlfriend, never even had a hug in my entire life. I've accepted I'm just objectively unattractive. I'm boring and have no talents or skills. I'm fucking worthless.

I'm crying uncontrollably more often than ever now and I don't know what I can do at this point. The sadness just builds and builds. Its hard to sleep. All I've known up until this point in my life is loneliness. 

Honestly... The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I don't want to go to hell. And if my belief in that wavers there's really nothing stopping me, I have no prospects, no light at the end of the tunnel. Just potentially decades of more loneliness.
