Nothing leftHit rock bottom again and I just keep coming back to the same old thing.

I like to think I'm a good person and that I don't deserve the things happening to me. But I'm probably not. And in the end it makes no difference, I still suffer.

I think I know how to do it now. Tried a couple times and got the hang of it. If I did it one more time maybe I'd finally do it right.

I'm just trying to think of reasons to keep living, there are so few of them now. And why should I care, if nobody cares about me.

Everything hurts.
