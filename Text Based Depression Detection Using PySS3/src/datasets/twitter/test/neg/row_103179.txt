My theory is everyone is depressedI'm sick of trying to convince people that I'm legitimately struggling. People get angry when you open up about your issues. They immediately combat your feelings with their trauma. I can't even get a sentence out with out someone immediately saying "well, my life is fucked because blah blah blah so you should be fucking over joyed!". Okay, I get it you're miserable. Why can't we *BOTH* be miserable? Why is it that they have this preconceived notion that I'm not allowed or capable of feeling as bad as they do or worse? I'm a firm believer in environmental factors being the cause of addiction and mental illness. Anyone who disagrees is most likely saving face so they don't have to confront the reality that they themselves may be ill or contributing to someone's illness. I would hate to leave my loved ones broken from my death, but at this point in my life I really feel like everyone is so absorbed in their own issues that they don't have the capacity to understand. I'm not asking for money or things. I'm asking for a genuine conversation where I can let out my fears and frustrations and have someone be able to listen with out immediately denying what I'm saying. I can't even finish my thought and they say they don't understand me. They wouldn't be better off if I was dead but they're not good with me here. I'm seriously stuck. I don't want anyone to say "oh I'm so sorry". I simply just want someone to be like "yeah this fucked, but we can relate on it being fucked". Instead people want to compete and keep everything separate. Were all humans and we a generally feel the same shit. So stop acting like so and so doesn't get you because they fucking do. I don't care how rich, poor, fat, skinny, young, old. We all feel heart break the same fucking way.
