i'm a person with a long history of mental health problems. all of my former friends think I have borderline personality disorder but i'm not so sure. I realise that that may be a symptom of my mental health problems in itself but I feel more like i'm a distinctly troubled person (extremely depressed, extremely anxious, prone to emotionally volatile outbursts) but not someone with a personality disorder. but also I just don't know. i'm on medication (venlafaxine, sometimes called Effexor) but that ran out a while ago while I've been switching doctors. i'm picking up my new prescription today so that might make things better in time but I don't think it will fix why I want to do this.

broadly I've lost everything. I mistreated my friends again and again to the point that none of them want anything to do with me again and apparently they all viscerally hate me. I can't blame them, I was brutal in my mistreatment of them. my closest friend (who I lived with up until all this went down) was also very emotionally vulnerable but I took advantage of that, manipulated her and basically tried to make her as bad as me. i claimed to be in love with her but the reality is that that's just a delusion, i don't know what love is because i'm not capable of feeling it. if I loved her (even platonically, as I had always claimed) then I wouldn't have done any of the things that i did. people don't treat people they love like that.   


my other friends, I blamed for my problems. I was nasty to them, tried to create division between them and basically just attacked them relentlessly. there was no reason for this, other than the fact that I always view other peoples' mistakes as being somehow worse than my deliberate misdeeds. that's my problem more than anything, i'm 100000x more critical of everyone else than I am of myself and I eventually make people believe that that's what's right.  


i only have two friends left now, my oldest friend and his girlfriend. but even though they've continued to support me even after everything that's happened, i know they must know everything that I've done wrong and that, as they're still very close with the group that has cut me off, they must at least partially resent me for the immense hurt I've caused. i in no way blame them for that, it's right that i should be judged for the awful awful things I've said and done. but it's hard that even the people who come closest to seeing any kind of good in me still know that i'm evil. i went to see them last night and my old friend kept making jokes about how hated i am amongst the original group and how i take things too far. i know he didn't mean any harm but it's an unfortunately timely reminder of exactly what i am.  


i had to give up my degree as i have nowhere to live near to my university now (technically i could've stayed but being in such close proximity to the person who i was previously closest with was just too painful and realistically i just want to allow all of them to get on with their lives without ever having to think of me again). i had to move home. my mental health fell apart and i was extremely imminently suicidal for a time and this caused my mum (who's home i had come back to) to have a mental break down. i basically blamed her for me being the way i am now. she then moved out of her own home to stay with her sister while she recovered so i'm just here on my own with her dog for company. it's just another example of how i cause immense hurt to EVERYONE close to me. without exception.  


i'm really growing more and more certain that suicide is where it ends for me. last night me and my old friend were talking about the future and i just couldn't picture it. i don't see myself growing old because i never see things getting better and i don't think i can do \*this\* for much longer. I've been suicidal before (even posted here before, even made a serious attempt once before) but it's usually been out of desperation rather than as a sensible plan. but i'm thinking that i genuinely can't cope with this much longer and i will surely kill myself within the next month. i ordered the components i would need for an exit bag device this morning, i want to be ready to go when i need to and i want to have a painless death (i'm a coward lol). basically, my life has fallen apart and it's never ever going to be fixed but not only that, i don't think i'm capable of moving on and finding new friends and a new purpose as i have done in the past. i think this is all i will ever have. and if that's the case then suicide is the only sensible option, not only because of the pain it will spare me but because of the pain it will spare everyone i care about and ever will care about.

tl;dr: have lost all but two of my closest friends, and the two that are left still think i'm evil. whole family has abandoned me. i'm unemployed, living in my mother's empty home, nothing to live for.
