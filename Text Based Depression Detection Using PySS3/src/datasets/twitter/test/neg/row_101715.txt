I am a lazy asshole and I now feel like I NEED to kill myself.Every problem I have comes from me being a bum. I have and never have had any ambition, and my mom's one of those moms that reads those stupid parenting books so she assumes I'm supposed to have tons of ambition because I'm the oldest kid, so to her I'm a titanic fucking disappointment. When I wake up in the morning I have no drive to go to class and 24/7 I just keep thinking about how much I suck and how much I don't want to be alive. I've been a Christian my whole life but now that I'm in college just keeping doubting that there even is a God. I've been told by Christians that if you commit suicide you automatically go to hell and that is the most painful thing for me to hear because I want to do it so bad. I masterbate at least 3 times every day, and that used to make me happy but now it doesn't and it's just an addiction. I get mad at people for random shit and I feel terrible for it. And today my mom found out from my adviser that I've been sleeping through classes, and she told me she's not gonna help me pay for college anymore and I feel like she would be so much better off and so much happier if I wasn't here. She and my dad DEPLETED THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS so they could help my pay tuition and I can't even fucking wake up in the morning. I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the entire fucking world and a waste of space and I just feel like if I kill myself I'll be correcting a mistake.
