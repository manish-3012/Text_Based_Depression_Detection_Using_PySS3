not sure what to doiâ€™ve been wanting to post here for a while but can never find the right words to express how iâ€™m feeling so here i go trying for the millionth time. 

iâ€™ve been suicidal numerous times. have attempted four times and been hospitalized because of it and here lately i am wishing that those attempts wouldâ€™ve worked. the entire situation that the world is in right now doesnâ€™t help. the coronavirus is fucking up so much. i have finally, after 3 years of being single, found a guy that is decent and treats me wonderfully and i havenâ€™t even been able to see him for 2 weeks because of the lockdown my state is in because of the coronavirus. i miss him. i miss my friends. having to be secluded is so depressing. i didnâ€™t mind it at first but now itâ€™s too much and i canâ€™t handle it. iâ€™m so depressed and just want to cease existing. i tried calling my psychiatrist yesterday to have him up my medication but he just insisted i go to the hospital but i donâ€™t want to do that because of the hospital bill i would receive plus the fear of the coronavirus. i have felt very suicidal the last few days and am just unsure of what to do and iâ€™m trying to use my coping skills iâ€™ve learned in therapy but theyâ€™re not doing the trick.
