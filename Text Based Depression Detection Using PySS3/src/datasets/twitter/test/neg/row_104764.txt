Do I have problems?Today I was hanging out with my friends and I was fine just a little tired, so then we got some 5-hour energy drinks and some redbull but not long after I began to think about how I have no plan for my life and how my life would continue on without significant achievement and how It would make my dead brother feel to know that his older sibling has done so little with the life he never got a shot at. It was these thoughts that made me begin to think of violently bashing my head into walls or cutting myself so once I got home I grabbed my dads pocket knife he left lying around and started cutting in my skin til I realized that perhaps this wasnt such a great idea and stopped myself, So I am here to ask whether or not I should be worried that this will reoccur and seek help or if this may simply be a one time incident
