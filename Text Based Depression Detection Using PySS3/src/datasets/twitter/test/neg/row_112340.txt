I'm ducking doneI'm done with being misunderstood
I'm done with being ignored, treated like crap, used, silenced, censored on stupid subs that are supposed to be safe places to talk, and with all this political bullshit cesspool that is reddit. I just fucking hate the world. I hate abusers. I hate my ex. I hate Covid. I hate being told I can't hate what fucked everything up. People are shit. 

I'm giving myself 12h to calm TF down. I already have paperwork and everything in order, JIC

wish me luck
