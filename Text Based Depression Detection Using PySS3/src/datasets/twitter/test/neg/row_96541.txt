Just a rantI'm so fucking suicidal that it's just become a daily occurrence for me and the thing is, I don't have a reason to be. Nothing bad has ever really happened to me, my family's doing good financially and emotionally, I've got friends, I 've got people who I could go to, doing ok in school, but I just cant stop having self harm thoughts and suicidal thoughts. What the fuck is wrong with me? Am I just attention seeking? Am I overreacting? There's no fucking reason for me to be suicidal, yet I am and I don't know why. I know there's people who have it way worse and have a reason to be  but I don't and I feel guilty. Like somehow I'm taking something from them? I know I should just stop being selfish and actually start doing stuff but I just physically and mentally can't and i dont understand why the fuck i cant do shit anymore.
