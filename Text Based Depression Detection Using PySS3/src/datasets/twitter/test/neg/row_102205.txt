I hate being micromanaged and told I'm lazySo today is the first day that course work and classes are available. So I wake up at 9am to read the materials and try some assignments. I give myself a break every 2 hours that last 15 min so I can grab a snack and washroom break. I decide at 4pm I'm mentally fatigued and need a longer break. So I go to my room to sleep because I have a headache and I'm feeling overwhelmed. 

My mom comes in yelling to do chores. I told her not now I need a nap. She says it's not good to sleep all day.  I tell her I need to listen to my body and I should be ready after an hour. But she wont have it. She tells me how useless I am and I'm fucking garbage. So I start screaming because I'm overwhelmed. She says why cant you act like an adult. She left the house and I've been cutting my arms and I took 8 advils for my headache and the pain.

I'm done I want to die. She says I'm supposed to be accountable for my life and now I am. I'm going to end it.
