Iâ€™m constantly in pain. I honestly want a hugIâ€™m on antidepressants. Iâ€™m trying so fucking hard not to feel bad all the time and bring everyone down. I just feel like Iâ€™m a useless failure and I wanna die so badly but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. Itâ€™s so scary, I just feel so confused and upset and in pain. I hate myself so much.  Iâ€™ve been dealing with this stuff and Iâ€™ve tried so much Iâ€™m just so so tired and I just want a break from it all and just feel like Iâ€™m worth anything
