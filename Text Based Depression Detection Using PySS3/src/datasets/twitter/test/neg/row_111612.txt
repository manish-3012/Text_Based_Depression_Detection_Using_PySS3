I know it's trite, but literally nobody likes me.This is difficult. Because either what I'm saying is true and I'm an abhorrent individual, or literally every person in my life is a narcissist using me as a step stool to feel taller. It's been happening so long I can't even figure out the cause and effect anymore. But even when I try to be kind, or communicate effectively, my efforts are very much rebuffed. I know when I get anxious I shut down, and then I short circuit when I'm being gaslit (I think? I don't know!!! The confusion is the worst part!!!) 

I just want to be gone so everyone isn't so bothered by me. My parents hate me, my boyfriend hates me, the rest of my family hates me. Anyone I've ever been friends with, without exception, have taken advantage of me, backstabbed me, stolen from me, or destroyed things I loved out of spite, just for me being me, in one instance, standing up for my daughter, in another, someone ELSE'S daughter. These are not exaggerations, and these are not ideas or impressions I have drawn upon in my own head. These are verifiable facts and real words and actions that have been witnessed. 

All of the people I say hate me have said as much, repeatedly. But when I ask for reasons why I get vague things like "you're a bitch" or projections of the problems I've brought up with them in the past. Depression and PPD have also wreaked havoc with me this past year, which means lately I get called gross, lazy, unfit mother (and this is just from my mom- she hates that I'm ok with clutter, and showering is my impossible thing sometimes) 

I have also not been an angel in my life. I have retaliated at times. I have a mouth like a sailor. When hurt or cornered I can be like a bear. I speak my mind to my own detriment at times. Socially I'm pretty retarded. But whenever I know I have caused pain all I want to do is fix it. 

I'm not sure if I'm crazy, they're crazy, we're ALL crazy, or if I'm just broken and need to disappear, amputating the broken limb from the healthy whole. Because I don't see any other way out. I can't keep a job, because I put out instant hate me vibes everywhere I go, so I don't have any money, I just want to curl up and give up. I've got nothing left. I'm so tired.
