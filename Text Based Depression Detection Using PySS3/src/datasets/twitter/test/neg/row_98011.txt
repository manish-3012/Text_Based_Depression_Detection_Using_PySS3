FiancÃ© of 2 years left meLast night I (m/29) found out that my fiancÃ© (f/23) of 2 years and partner of 5 total was leaving me. She calmly told me that sheâ€™s been unhappy for a while but I had no real idea that this was the case as she never told me anything was really wrong. Over 3 hours she told me that she felt trapped and that she just didnâ€™t love me anymore. I asked her repeatedly if there was another person and she said no, it was just my flaws and she occasionally told me that she didnâ€™t deserve me. 

She finally told me that she was going to bed and I broke down. I donâ€™t cry a lot usually and I havenâ€™t in several years but I just broke. Shortly after this I realized her MacBook was on the counter and I snooped (I know I shouldnâ€™t have). Of course I found a message pretty quickly from a guy that said that he has just told his wife that he wanted a divorce and for my fiancÃ© not to text him back immediately. Of course I talked to my fiancÃ© about this since it seemed too coincidental and she confirmed after several minutes of lying that she is leaving me for her District Boss! 

She just started this new job last month and sheâ€™s already convinced heâ€™s her soul mate. Heâ€™s much older and from what she has told me he had put her on a pedestal at work and given her a lot of praise so far. I feel like heâ€™s preying on her because she showed no signs that she was unhappy. In fact, just last week she was overjoyed to find her wedding dress. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I love her so much and we share a house together. I want to be with her and I donâ€™t want her to make this mistake of being used by her boss or get out in a position where she could be sexually harassed if she wants to leave a relationship with him. Iâ€™m close to her family and all of our friends are shared but theyâ€™re mostly hers. 

I feel all alone now and Iâ€™m sitting in my bed overhearing her giggle from another bedroom on the phone with him. I know itâ€™s not worth it but I canâ€™t stop thinking about hanging myself. Iâ€™m trying to put it out of my mind but I just donâ€™t know how to deal with this. I lost my best friend and what feels like my whole life.
