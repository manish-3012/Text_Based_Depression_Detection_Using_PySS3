Getting better in some ways but still dealing with this idea....So I had a plan form in my head way back in March and despite things getting overall better through regular therapy and medication....I'm still thinking about it. Hell, I'm still having suicidal thoughts with regularity (which has been concerning to my psychiatrist and if I breathed a word about having a plan I'd probably be in a hospital instead of writing this right now) but not daily as they were before. Even as I'm getting better...and physically that's happening a lot faster than my mood is coming up...I'm feeling more energetic and having an easier time with eating and sleeping and such...I'm still pretty obsessed with this plan. It feels like a one shot deal because it's something I had planned to do on vacation and well....someone just died (accidentally presumably) doing the sort of thing I wanted to do on purpose. At this point I don't know what to do because I feel like this thought is going to keep coming back this whole coming week. Doesn't help at all that I'm still struggling with anhedonia and asking myself all the wrong questions and essentially having an existential crisis (I mean, why am I here? My life seems purposeless.) 

The only thing I can think to do short of canceling my vacation and just telling someone that I'm really thinking about this is going and drugging myself into oblivion at night (when I think I can slip away and do it with no one being the wiser until I'm gone).
