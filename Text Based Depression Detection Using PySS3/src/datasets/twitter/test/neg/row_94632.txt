I donâ€™t want to â€œsuck it upâ€Just had a fun argument with my mother as I explained how living a life of working 40 hours a week with no room to do anything I enjoy on shit wages is not a life I want to live. That I think itâ€™s bullshit to just accept this fucked up capitalist system and that people suffer just so the rich can get richer. Why do they get to be the only ones who get to have the money and free time do what they enjoy? I hate it. I donâ€™t want to spend my life sitting in an office chair just to barely afford anything that makes me happy.

But, no. Instead, mom thinks I just need to â€œsuck it up, buttercup.â€ Thatâ€™s life! Thatâ€™s just how it is! Well, how about screw life, then? Told her thatâ€™s not a very convincing way to want to stay alive. She ignored this.

I hate that Iâ€™m too weak to ever actually go through with it. It would feel so good to prove a point and say, yeah, fuck you. You never listened, you told me to suck it up, and now Iâ€™m gone. 

I wasnâ€™t made for this life.
