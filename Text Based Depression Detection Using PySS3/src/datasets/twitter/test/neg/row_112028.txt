My online girlfriend might commit suicide tonight and I don't know what to do. (UPDATE 2)So she said is talking with me. She tried to do it last night but her mom caught her mid way. Thank god! She was taken to the hospital. Now she's pissed. She says she just wants to disappear. I am at a loss of words right now. It's in a realm of profession that I can't really reach at this age. It's good tho that now more people know. I am not sure how  I can help anymore though.
