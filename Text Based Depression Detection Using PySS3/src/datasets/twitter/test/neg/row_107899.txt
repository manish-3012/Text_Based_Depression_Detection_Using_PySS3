I want to die because of money.Need around $5K exactly 10 months from now so I can pay for my final year college fees. And I'm at my wit's end. Really need this degree for better future and can't afford any more gap years.

I live in a developing country and because of overpopulation, it's so hard to find any job without a degree. Online is even harder, I had a good part-time online job earlier and lost it cuz of pandemic. Can't get help from parents cuz of complicated reasons.

My depression and suicidal thoughts doesn't help, I was so much happier before I had to worry about paying this tuition fees for college. And moreover I have to balance classes/projects along with worrying about money. 

And nowadays it's all I stress about, day and night. It's also made me more bitter person towards everything because I see rich people casually spending so much money, and even just a small one-off amount of that would be so life changing for me and would reduce my stress by 90%. It's made me think of how unfair this world is, and why the fuck was I born into circumstances like these. I don't even want to die because there are things I'm looking forward to, but this is gonna make me kill myself :(
