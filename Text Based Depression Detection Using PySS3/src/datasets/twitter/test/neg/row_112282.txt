I'm doing it soonI can't take this anymore, I'm being abused at home and it sucks.

I also have dental issues that bring me pain daily. I got braces at a foreign place cause my parents insisted and they did a mess job, I developed tmj and I had tooth ache due to clenching and I got a root canal that failed. It hurts and I feel a burning sensation daily in this tooth and I'm too scared to get it removed cause I'm only 20 (I got it done at 18) and it's a front tooth.

My life is a hell.
