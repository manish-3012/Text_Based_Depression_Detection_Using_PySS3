How did I mess up so badI had it all. I got good grades, and I had an interesting set of hobbies in college. I graduated in a bad time, with a degree which is generally useless (econ). I got a random job at a retail store and kept with it. Moved to different positions. I left, took another job, and eventually came back.

The money sucks. The work sucks more. Its dirty. Unloading trucks begins to hurt after a while. Stocking products and dealing with customers is terrible.

I apply to more jobs, but my resume isn't ideal. I dont have much to show. I recently got a decent job, but I have to undergo a thorough background check to keep it. I dont know if I will pass. I got fired in the past for my skillset not matching up with the applied for position at a different company. Other than that, no arrests/tickets/defaulted debts.

I just want to move out of my parents place. I want a place of my own. I had to come back after a dispute with my roommate. The rent was an insane deal, and I cant afford another room with my current financial situation (without the new job). 

In that turn, I just want to be loved. I dont really try to find a girlfriend ever since I had to move back in at my age. I did have a girl who was the world to me, I never felt that way before. It was crazy how much we had in common with each other as soon as we met. I figured out it was all a lie. She had a disorder called BPD, which makes it seem you met your soulmate, but instead you are just dating a mirror. I know this, and am still waking up wanting her. I am essentially chasing a different version of her, the bar is set high even though I know it is a artificial.

I am nearing 26. I just want a life of my own. I struggled with OCD and anxiety in the past, and I was diagnosed with it. My past OCD med made me a bit paranoid, and after changing it I am a completely different person. That medicine made my anxiety peak over the past few years. It is like I have to atone for past actions of a completely different person.

It is like I am trying to make up for the time I lost from OCD, and yet keep trying to move forward. I wish I was back as a freshman in college. I would have all the confidence in the world. I could put my entire mind into my studies, and move forward. I would actually have a real social life too. I want to go back, possibly for a second bachelors. I am not sure if its for the social aspects, or the academic. I could possibly go for both. But the cost aspect is holding me back.

I am not sure what I am asking. I am not suicidal now, I would rather drop it all and run first. I just want to know how to turn this ship around. It was like I was walking with handcuffs on for the past few years. I am ready to make changes.
