i canâ€™t even tell if iâ€™m actually miserable anymore or if iâ€™m just lying to myselfi feel so fucking hopeless. everything feels like a lie. i rarely cry. i donâ€™t even get sad. i just feel so fog headed and all i have is fucked up thoughts that scare the shit out of me.

every time i think to myself â€œgod iâ€™m so miserableâ€ iâ€™ll start thinking that iâ€™m lying to myself and that iâ€™m not actually miserable and iâ€™m a psychopath trying to rationalize with myself.
