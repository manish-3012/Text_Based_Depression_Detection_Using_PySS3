I've been doing "controlled" hanging for a few months nowWhen I was 16 I promised myself I would hang myself on my 20th if nothing gets better. I turned 17 yesterday. Although I won't kill myself right now, I've been practicing hanging I guess you could say. When everyone's out of the house I'll tie myself up to the staircase railing and see how far I can go. The first time I did it I was just gagging before I stopped. The second time I did it I was coughing gagging and gasping for breath rapidly. The 3rd time which was just now, my vision got blurry, all my rapid breathing became raspy, my stomache was hurting, I had a weird sound in my ears where I couldn't hear much else through it, and I could hear my heartbeat really loudly. When you do it for real is it worse than this? Or is this the extent of what it feels like? After experiencing an overdose, hanging myself only is a slight discomfort and panic compared to the agony if an overdose.
