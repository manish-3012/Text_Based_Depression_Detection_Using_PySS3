Help...One of my two brothers died last year. He was my younger brother. My older brother just died two weeks ago. I'm lost without him. (RIP Gabriel) He took care of us, our parents never really cared. Now that he's gone, I feel so helpless. He kept me from killing myself several times, and even got me to stop cutting myself. But I relapsed after he died, and now I'm suicidal again, and now that he's not there to help me, I have no one...
