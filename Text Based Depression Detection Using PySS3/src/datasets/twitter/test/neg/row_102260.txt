fucking pissed i cant commit suicide now that a family member already didgod damnit to hell.  

that was always my out.  if shit hit the fan, id just kill myself.  if i get too lonely, spend all my money..etc... i could always just kill myself and be done.  that was my thought for the last 15years or so.

Well a close family member committed suicide, out of the fucking blue with no signs.  The pain that caused to everyone around us. 24/7, 365.  it doesnt go away.  you think about the person daily.  i feel so bad for their mom, my sister, to deal with this all.  fuck.  its like they were an angel for me, doing what i always thought about, so it could play out in my reality that i experience, to teach me and to show me that i can never do that.  And now my way out can never be.  I couldnt do it to send all my family into that spiral of emotions again.  and im fucking pissed that they commited suicide and im pissed that now i cant.  

god damnit to hell.
