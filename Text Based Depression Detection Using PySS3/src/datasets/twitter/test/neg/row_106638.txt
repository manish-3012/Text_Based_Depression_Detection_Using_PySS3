i'm tired.some shit happened and it's really just one more thing that sucks about living in this plane of reality. i called a warmline (or maybe it was a hotline? i can't remember) for the first time just a couple of hours ago. i love psychology- i've studied it for years and am a massive supporter of making professional resources more readily available to everyone, as well as improving what's currently available for those who need it. like... i'm not one to trash talk the profession, and i just wanted to get that out of the way.

it was weird calling a hotline; i felt like i didn't deserve it- like i was wasting resources. the fact that the lines were busy didn't help- and i know that shouldn't be surprising, but it felt ironic for obvious reasons. in the end, i got ahold of someone, but the advice didn't jive with me- it was more of the same "a lot of people would carry your death for the rest of their lives" as if i don't KNOW that already. that's the fucking shot that's keeping me here outside of being afraid of coming up with a plan for something like that. being told about how much people i care about would suffer just makes me feel like the scum of the fucking earth, man. it makes me feel like i shouldn't have said anything, because i don't want to hurt anyone.

i don't know. i'm rambling and my mind is thoroughly frayed. i don't know what else to do. i sympathize with hotline speakers- i really fucking do. i know it has to be fucking stressful and depressing and overwhelming to constantly be exposed to people who are in a headspace where they feel like they're a danger to themselves- to have to somehow try to find the right things to say to someone turning to a complete stranger for help. i totally get that. it still sucks though, and it's frustrating. i'm just tired of feeling like this. it sucks, man. it just sucks.
