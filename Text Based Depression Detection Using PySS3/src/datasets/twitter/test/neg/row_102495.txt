How can I help a young child expressing suicidal thoughts and plans.Trying to be anonymous. 

A friends young child (6-7 YO) is expressing some very aggressive suicidal thoughts and plans. Child is already in therapy but progress seems very very slow. 

Are there any resources I can give my friend that can help? Iâ€™m at a loss on what to do. 

Thank you for reading.
