Cant do it but want to.I cant do anything stupid cuz of my job. But in 2 years I can right when I go home. I'm divorced with really no friends anymore cuz of my ex and us moving around. If I knew it wouldnt be a hassle to more people then it had to I'd go tomorrow. It just hurts being like this for years. I feel like I'm a terrible person anyway so what's the point. I cant do this for another two years. I just need to get everything in order and I should be good to go. I dont know how to not feel like my chest is going to cave in. I make jokes about killing myself every day but people just think I'm playing and the ones I'm serious about it dont care they have there own lives to live. One 3 people on earth will care I'm gone but I know they will get over it.
