Got any advice? I don't think I want to die anymore.Hello, I've been very depressed and suicidal for the past 2 years. The worst it's ever been. I meant to kill myself this month but I'm not so sure anymore. I've been feeling more hopeful and I think I want to keep living. I want to experience the good in life. 

&amp;nbsp;

I live in NY state and I want to move to Arizona. I don't have a job but I do have a couple thousand dollars and a couple credit cards. I'm turning 25 soon and I want to get a Nursing A.S. Maybe then do a B.S. I don't know anyone in AZ. I have a car that's in decent shape. I'll be driving there with all my things. I think I'll find a place through Airbnb until I can get a job and find something more permanent. If I do this, I have to do it this week. Maybe Wednesday or Thursday. My lies are about to come crashing down. 

&amp;nbsp;

Do you have any advice or comments? God, I'm not sure what I'm doing. Will moving to AZ just make me even more suicidal? Will I fail and end up homeless? I'm so scared. I'm afraid this might turn out to be the final nail in the coffin.
