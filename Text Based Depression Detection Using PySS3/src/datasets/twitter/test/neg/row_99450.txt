I'm getting helpI posted sunday night right before I attempted to cut my wrists and my wife came home and stopped me. I made an appointment with a psychologist for tomorrow for the 1st time in my life to see if I can actually get help. I hope I can because I'm tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of being a piece of shit, I'm tired of always letting people down and hurting them even when I don't mean to. I just want to be happy again
