I can't stop seeing him.Hello,

I created an account just to post this. 

I found out recently that my mother was raped and became pregnant with me. I am 23 years old and have always thought that my dad was my biological father. He is a great man and will always be my dad.

I support my mom 100&amp;#37; and do not blame her for any of this. She has been so strong. 

But, I cannot stop seeing the rapist when I look in the mirror.  

What features are his?  Am I sick like he is? Does my mom see him when she looks at me?

I feel like I should have been aborted.

I can't stop seeing him when I look in the mirror and I can't take it much more...
