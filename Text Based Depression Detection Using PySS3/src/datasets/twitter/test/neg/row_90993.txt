just suicidal rn, nbdI wanted to ask for help. Personal help. That's all. Not karma-seeking or attention either. Just sitting in a dark room mentally listing who cares about me and realizing with each name - no one really cares. They just want me to stop being problematic. Stop interfering, callng, texting, having "negative thoughts" - and.. i carried a noose in my backpack and sometimes look at beams and wonder if I had enough time... But i dont want to suffer or fail. What I want is someone who can wrap her body around me and say "You're home" but no one can save a suicidal person... Maybe I was just meant to get drunk, stay drunk, and have a short life. I'll shut up. Just wanted to reach out. See ya
