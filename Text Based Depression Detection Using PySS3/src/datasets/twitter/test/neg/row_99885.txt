I'm TiredI am suicidal and have been for the past year now, although I've suffered from suicidal ideation for the past several years. Both my mom and my dad have explicitly stated that if I were to die, they would kill themselves immediately. I wish I could go, but I don't want to indirectly kill my parents. I don't want to go inpatient. I'M FUCKING SCARED. This year I was supposed to start my freshman year of college, but in November I took a medical leave of absence for the next year. I did a partial hospitalization program, or PHP, and just got out maybe two-four weeks ago. I have since relapsed. I have been to two PHP programs this year alone, as well as one in 2016. I was inpatient in 2016 but haven't gone inpatient since. I've been in counseling for the past ten years consistently, but my condition's only worsened. I'm low-functioning depressed, meaning that I struggle to do basic tasks like go outside, change my clothes, take my medication, and even bathe. My mental functioning has significantly decreased in the past few months; I struggle to concentrate and my memory has gotten so bad that I often forget what I'm thinking about or saying mid-sentence. I'm 18. I've been taking medication under the guidance of a psychiatrist since 2016, but I've recently become-treatment resistant, meaning that no matter what medications we try and how much we increase the dosage, I don't change. I'm running out of time. Please, someone do something. Kill me. Please just kill me. I might need to go inpatient and then go PHP and do more intensive counseling, but if I can't make it back to college next year, I'm out of school. I'm thinking of doing a long-term mental health facility, where I'd be inpatient in a group home or a similar setting, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to go back to college. I want to go back to college, but I'm not sure how to get ready. I need to maintain a 3.5 GPA to keep my scholarship, and the course load at my college is VERY heavy, I'd be taking too many classes a semester. However, my scholarship is only good for eight semesters, so if I lighten my course load I might not be able to keep my scholarship long enough to graduate. I really want to die. I don't want hope, I don't want help. I just want it all to go away. I think I'm terminal. Like a person who's been very sick and declining for several years, who needs to be medically euthanized or taken off of life support, I need to die too. I need to die.
