I'm worried about myselfSorry if this doesn't belong here I don't post on reddit often but I just posted a thing on my situation on r/depression and I just wanted to post here too because at this point I'm imagining harming myself often throughout the day and if things get any worst I'm just afraid of what might happen and I don't know what to do about it.
Here's a link to the other post https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3ht37a/hello_im_here_because_i_dont_know_what_to_do/
