My parents hate me and rightfully soAll I ever do is get angry and punch stuff. Iâ€™m of no use to my family. Thereâ€™s nothing to live for. I have nothing special about me. No one would miss me if I died. I donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. All I ever feel is anger and I want it gone. Iâ€™m the black sheep of the family. My parents scream at me all the time. Iâ€™m want  it all to end. Iâ€™ve been to so many therapists and been on so many meds Iâ€™ve lost count. I used to hope there was an afterlife, but I donâ€™t want there to be one. I want to be able to feel nothing.
