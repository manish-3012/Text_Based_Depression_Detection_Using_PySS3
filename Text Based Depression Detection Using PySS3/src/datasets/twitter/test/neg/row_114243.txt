God doesn't fucking exist. And if he is, he's just a stupid selfish cunt who only cares about himself.I've been unable to sleep for 3 hours straight now because of my teeth hurting. I tried to help it out, but then my check started to hurt. Then I tried to help that out, and my teeth started to hurt again. Every time I get one thing better, the other thing starts to hurt again! This is just another curse God has put on me, like he has for the last few days. I learned over the last few days that if there is a God, he wants to make me suffer, apparently. I don't want to go through this year again next year and for the next few years of my life. I have had enough being cursed and treated like shit because God fucking hates me. Life will never get better. It would had gotten better if COVID never started and fucked up my life for me. I wanna end this tonight. Am I scared? Yes. But if I don't do it, this curse will continue on me, and I'm not fucking letting that happen anymore anytime soon. PS: This isn't the first time I've posted on this subreddit. I've posted here before on other deleted accounts. I'm just so done with life. I had enough of this pain.
