Maybe today, maybe tomorrowI looped my belt around my neck today, i was ready to tie it to the garage roof and kick the chair out from under me when my roommate got home with his young daughter. Luckily I managed to get the belt off before they saw me but their arrival was the one thing that stopped me. This is the second time I've been 'saved' in this manner and I honestly hope it doesn't happen next time. My life has been a waste so far and any hope of reaching my life goals has long since passed. The choice of whether to start moving goal posts or quit the game altogether came surprisingly easy. I now accept that my suicide is an inevitability and all thats left between life and death is a short matter of time. I'll never know what it feels like to be valued or respected, to be loved and wanted. My family seems to know I'm a lost cause too. I've seen therapists, taken meds, seen more therapists and through it all nothing has worked, nothing has changed. Let's be real I'm only posting this because nobody who knows me in the real world gives enough of a fuck to sit through this rant and I don't blame them. I'm alone in a world I don't belong in and will never belong in. A world full of people who see me as weird, sad and broken. Pity is the closest thing to warmth and intimacy that I've ever known, pity from people who know that my life is doomed to be lonely and miserable just as I know it myself. This world isn't cruel, I'm just not good enough to do anything more than trudge along in abject mediocrity and social isolation and that's no fault of anybody else.
