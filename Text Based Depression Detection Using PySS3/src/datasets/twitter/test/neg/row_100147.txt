I want to thank you all for reaching out and commenting.I have had a difficult struggle. My depression and suicidal thoughts have led me to a dark place. One of my best friends killed himself right before Christmas. His death really hit me hard. He was one of my best friends. My gym buddy. My confidante. I am sad that he didnâ€™t reach out to me. I would do anything to have him back. He was family to me. I am so hurt from what he did that i decided not to kill myself. I could not put through my loved ones like he did. It fucking sucked. I have felt desired to do the same but reading this sub makes me feel that maybe... just maybe someone cares about me. Because of that I will not do the same. I owe it to everyone I know to give it a second chance.
