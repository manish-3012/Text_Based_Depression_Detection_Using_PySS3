Problems that cannot be fixedWhen I was a kid, I kept questioning the meaning of life. I couldn't find any reason why people endure the suffering that life is. The more I seeked an answer the more I found that life is futile and people around me are insane living a life that they do not know what for. As an adult, all these thoughts has made me a nihilist and I am suffering from suicidal ideation. I am also suffering from gender dysphoria since my age of fourteen. I have extreme anxiety that I avoid talking to anyone or leave home. I have never earned a penny in my life and I dont know how to drive. I spend whole day and night thinking what a waste my life has become. All these problems cannot be fixed and if it can be, it could take a lifetime to resolve. I am stuck between living and not wanting to live. I can't live neither die. What do you suggest for people like me?
