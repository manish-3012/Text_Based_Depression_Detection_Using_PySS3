I don't think I can do it anymoreBeen suicidal on an off for 4 years now but I think I'm ready to just give up 
I'm always going from one distraction to the next now with this lockdown I have nothing to do.
Made me realise how horrible if a person I really am, no aspersions, no drive, not contributing to anything.
I'm just here existing and consuming being a waste of space, it really isn't worth it anymore.

I'm 21 with no proper friends, never had a girlfriend always been incredibly lonely to the point where it hurts. There is literally no point for me to be here.
