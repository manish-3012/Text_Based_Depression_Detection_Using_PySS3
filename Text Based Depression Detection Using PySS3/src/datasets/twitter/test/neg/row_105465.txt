Iâ€™m seriously considering itMaybe tomorrow or next week. I canâ€™t see myself living to the end of high school. Iâ€™m only 16. I have a life â€œplanâ€, I know where I want to go to post-secondary, I know my future career. I have things to look forward to, but I just donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m not excited by any of it at this point. I donâ€™t think I wanna wait this out.
