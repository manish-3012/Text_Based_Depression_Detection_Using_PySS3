Never ending guilt cycle.Iâ€™m at the end of a crisis situation. SO got drunk, which made them get really sad and wanted me to kill them. Begging me, telling me they were losing their mind. I tried to just let them get it all out and got them to bed. Used a crisis line to stay level headed and removed firearms from the house. I was suicidal in the past,so it was a bit more difficult going through all this. But my suicide attempts are kinda the reason for all this. They feel guilty because they are stuck thinking they caused my suicide attempts. Theyâ€™re stuck in one moment in time unable to let go. They tried therapy, we had several family sessions talking about what happened, and weâ€™re in a place right now that they canâ€™t get the same kinda help I got. Weâ€™d kinda lose everything if they went away for any serious form of treatment. Their sadness honestly happens every time they drink (which is like once a month) and I try my best to keep them from going overboard but always fail and get left in positions like Iâ€™m currently in. Theyâ€™re partially right, their actions did trigger a mental break, but it only brought childhood trauma, anxiety and depression to the surface. But I dealt with all that when I was in treatment, moved on. So they feels guilty for the past they canâ€™t let go of, Iâ€™ve forgiven them and moved on, but every time they break down after drinking, I feel guilty for making them go through me being suicidal and causing their pain. I suggest getting help, talking to other people if they canâ€™t talk to me about it, but theyâ€™re stuck not wanting help and holding onto pain that has pushed them to the â€œI canâ€™t do it anymoreâ€ point. Everyone is safe for now, but I have no idea whatâ€™ll happen in the light of day.
