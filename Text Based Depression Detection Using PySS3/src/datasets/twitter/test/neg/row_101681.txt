I'm don't know what I wantI feel like I'm drowning, sometimes I feel empty, broken, determined to commit suicide and in the other hand I feel this huge guilty because I don't want to hurt anyone, my family, my boyfriend. I'm trying but it's so hard this emotions have been inside of me as long as I can remember right now I have something to hurt me or maybe kill me I don't even know this has happen all my life, moments that I come back here in this same position and don't know what to do. I have reach for help to psychologist but they haven't been able to help me for real, I just feel I'm trash. I'm sorry I don't know what I am even doing
