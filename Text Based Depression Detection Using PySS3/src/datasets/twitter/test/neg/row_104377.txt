Iâ€™m done with my Paranoia. I believe I am going to kill myself sometime this weekIt is painful.

About a year ago, I sent a pic of me in my boxers to an  ex. Her mother texted me stating how it gave her daughter a panic attack, and then said I had pressured my ex into acts, despite the fact that I didnâ€™t. They then threatened to involve the police if I contacted her daughter, and said theyâ€™d make me a sex offender despite me being completely consensual. They said this because I was 17 and their daughter was 16.

This threat has been haunting me for my entire life. It has not gotten better and has in fact gotten worse in the past month. Iâ€™m done with it. Itâ€™ll never go away. The idea of it will never go away.

Someone could tell her I told her about our relationship.

Someone could tell her I told her about the sexual things that we did in our relationship

She could get angry at any of the things above and decide she wants revenge and then will try and ruin my life.

I canâ€™t predict the future, and I donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to live in the future. Itâ€™s a pain to keep living like thereâ€™s a target on my back.

My friends have tried to dissuade me from my paranoia but it has not helped, Iâ€™m sick of living a life of fear.
