Tempting to never wake up again.My father left me at a very young age, and i cry every night thinking about him. I got took away from my mother. My stepdad and my mother both have an alcohol addiction and when they arenâ€™t sober itâ€™s like I donâ€™t know them. I feel like everyone is staring at me in school. I have a girlfriend but i get more attention from my (3) friends than from her. I told her iâ€™m in a depression and she said: â€œoh donâ€™t beâ€. Iâ€™m lost and iâ€™ve been suicidal since i was about 9 years old. I donâ€™t know, I just wanted to let my emotions out. I canâ€™t talk with anyone and iâ€™m so damn lonely. Not even hiding the fact that Iâ€™m 15, but i feel like I have life experience of 60 years. I have no talents. I canâ€™t cook, Iâ€™m not fit, Iâ€™m really bad at sports. Only thing that I can do is rhyme. I can rap and Iâ€™m very proud of it. My dream is to make a carreer out of it but I just know itâ€™s not going to happen. Iâ€™m dead inside. and the inside is what matters the most.
