I feel emptySorry in advance if this thread is a mess Iâ€™m not really sure what to write.

First some information about me, I have a girlfriend of 4 months that I have known for 4 years and love dearly, I have probably 6ish good friends, my family is fairly well off and Iâ€™m 17 years old.

Now, for about a year I have felt empty, I go through days not paying attention to anything around me, I ignore and push away the people that care about me, I go to school get home and sit in my room not interacting with anyone else. 
Since Iâ€™ve started dating my girlfriend life was good, I felt happy again and thought Iâ€™d shaken the whole suicide depression thing, I was talking to my friends and classmates more and being a lot more sociable in general.
Iâ€™ve always had times when Iâ€™m feeling good but slip back into a deep depression, and over the last month thatâ€™s happened again.
I donâ€™t see the point in living, I donâ€™t see a future for myself, I feel that Iâ€™m just a burden to everyone around me. 
I donâ€™t know why I feel this way and I donâ€™t know what I have to be depressed about since I have a fairly good life, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m trying to get out of posting this thread, maybe I just want to know it gets better, or maybe I want to seek help, maybe I just want to rant before I finally decide to end it.

Thanks for reading.
