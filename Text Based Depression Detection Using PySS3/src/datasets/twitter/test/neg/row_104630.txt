Do people actually enjoy life? I donâ€™t understand how other people arenâ€™t suicidal. I donâ€™t remember a time when I enjoyed being alive, my life was always either bearable or bad. Do other people actually enjoy life? Seriously, I canâ€™t wrap my head around it and I want to know if people truly enjoy being alive.
