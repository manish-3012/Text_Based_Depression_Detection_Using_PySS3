Hesitant about inpatientI honestly would prefer to off myself at this point, but I have a sister and mother that love me very much. So I can't. They have dealt with too much, and I can't do that to them, as much as I want to escape. I worry that I will slip and impulsively do it. Has anyone dealt with putting up a front and then trying to do this?
