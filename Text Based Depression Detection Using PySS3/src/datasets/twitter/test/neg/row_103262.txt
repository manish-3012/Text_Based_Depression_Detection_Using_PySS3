I can't take it anymore. I have to die.There's this constant fear in my stomach, like a fear of living that won't go away as long as I'm alive. I can't do this anymore. I'm sick of pretending to be able to cope, like I can keep on pretending to live life. I just want it to end soon.

They always say "Think about your friends and family. How would they feel?" Fuck them. I never thought about what effects my decisions would have on others and I don't plan to anytime soon. I guess being incredibly selfish makes this easier.

There is nothing worth staying for. The little things mean jackshit and all I could possibly do in life means nothing. College, university, a well paying job, a wife, children - It all means nothing to me. Like a bribe just to keep me here.

I just want to die, and I refuse to stay here anymore. That's all I can say.
