Feeling suicidal even when â€œthings get betterâ€.Hey reddit, Iâ€™m really depressed and feeling suicidal. If you can take a moment to read this and might suggest anything it might help a lot.. thank you otherwise. 

I was diagnosed when I was 12 years old with clinical depression and later on in life with PTSD too since of traumatic events in my military serving years which stopped around 3-4 years ago, Iâ€™m a F/ 25. 
Iâ€™m in a condition which I canâ€™t work, and I canâ€™t contribute financially (at least not anytime soon..) because of my mental health problems, which Iâ€™m taking care of today. My boyfriend, the person I see a future with, take care of us. I used to hold my feelings until I met him and heâ€™s the one I stayed here still until today. Iâ€™ve tried to suicidal a couple of times in the past, and today I just try to contribute in our relationship in any other way I can and I think he knows it too. Heâ€™s the love of my life and always been there for me taking care of us. Recently he told me Iâ€™m smothering him too much. I didnâ€™t saw it coming since I know I give him a lot of a time to himself, but he told me that even if he with heâ€™s phone next to me for an hour itâ€™s still feels like he â€œwith meâ€ so he donâ€™t ever feel like he have enough time for heâ€™s own. He likes the affection but needs time alone a lot more since heâ€™s introvert. Iâ€™ve always felt like Iâ€™ve been an introvert too so I know and understand this feeling. Iâ€™m drawing a lot giving him plenty of time alone but itâ€™s not enough for him and we didnâ€™t had sex in days at this point.. we both moved to a new place and he donâ€™t have friends and I feel like he feel depressed because of it, I want to help but I donâ€™t know how. For me, both of us is enough since heâ€™s my best friend and thatâ€™s all I need. I actually prefer just us since I donâ€™t trust people anyways besides him and I feel like everything else is a lot of work and I just prefer to focus on us because this is what matters.

I was fighting with depression all my life and can get really over dramatic and feeling immediately on the edge over anything. a year ago a friend of mine which used to be my best friend for 3 years made a suicide. I live right now in a different place completely disconnected from everyone I knew including my family. Iâ€™m trying to feel belong here as much as I can. I only recently started to grief since I got more time with myself. Iâ€™ve dealt with huge grief a year before too when I had to put my dog down since of old age and I had him for 14 years, heâ€™s been with me during all the difficult years. I cope with everything I can, but I feel really suicidal still and I feel guilty for it too. I donâ€™t want to do anything â€œstupidâ€ to not make my boyfriend worried. Iâ€™m afraid to lose him even tho he says that he is always going to be here no matter what. I try to put a lot of effort in our relationship and know itâ€™s a constant work. 

I do see a future finally in my life since I have him, so I work on myself for it trying to not ever give up anymore. But the thoughts always come back and itâ€™s almost feels â€œbiggerâ€ than me, almost like Iâ€™m sick and canâ€™t get better. Overcoming my self esteem feels impossible, since I hate what I see in a mirror and I have this problem since I remember myself honestly. I always was doing crazy water fast diets in the past and canâ€™t wear dresses or short sleeves clothes since I hate how I look in it. I wear mostly black sport clothes. I was dealing with anorexia and bulimia in my teen years and my boyfriend convinced I have body dysmorphia still.. But what he doesnâ€™t know is that I just want to be in the best version of myself for him so he will never go away.. well at least I hope so. I know how stupid and childish it sounds.. he truly brings me happiness and I donâ€™t want to lose him.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this and I feel like Iâ€™m loosing my mind. I feel out of energy a lot and I just thinking really suicidal. Iâ€™m just tired. Maybe he will be better off without my crazy mind..

I recently started to feel good vibes too, I know Iâ€™m talented enough to follow my dreams and accomplish them (and this knowledge only came recently) so thatâ€™s what I do now, and I would never been able to admit I was talented before. Now seeing people offering to actually pay me way more than I ever thought for my artworks is such a good feeling. I feel like I can do it. All of sudden concept art doesnâ€™t feel so far. So I feel like I go forward and there can be a great future. Life seems like it can be very manageable, yet still anything can bring me to the edge and will immediately feel like I want to commit suicide and I canâ€™t deal anymore. 


Will the suicidal thoughts go away eventually, even if â€œthings gets better?â€ Did someone â€œwonâ€ and overcome this for the long run? Itâ€™s been years and itâ€™s always comes back somehow and I feel guilty for the people who cares about me. I do fight each day tho. I feel confused, and everything triggers me and makes me feel real dark when it happens. I canâ€™t control it. Just feeling really on the edge a lot and Iâ€™m tired of this.
