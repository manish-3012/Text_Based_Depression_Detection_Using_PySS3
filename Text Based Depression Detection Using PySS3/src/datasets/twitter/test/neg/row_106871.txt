I need some adviceI've been struggling with depression for a long time and lately I've been having constant suicidal thoughts.  I'm seeing one of my best friends on Saturday and I want to talk with her about it. I feel like I'm all alone and I think sharing it with her would help me, but I'm terrified that she'll start treating me differently if I tell her. Her friendship is really really important to me and I don't want to ruin it or have her treat me differently. She is also pretty stressed about school and some things going on in her life, and I don't want to throw all of this on top of that...

I have no idea what I should do
