serious: the carousel of depression...so, I posted my first post last night. erased it since, because of the shame I felt after having re-read it. I'm 59 years old, married for 36 years to a man who is a very good person, just not at all emotional or demonstrative. I have two grown kids; one transgender daughter in her 30's who lives with us, a married son who just turned 27. My niece, whom I was not at all close to, committed suicide last year. My mom, (we were more like sisters), died 2 years ago this january. I called the suicide hotline last night, not expecting that I would carry out any action, just looking for some empathy, and was told to call back today when the computers were up. I had one very kind person on reddit post and ask me to pm for encouragement (sorry, but I did not have the courage to contact you). I am bipolar 2, recently diagnosed after suffering from depression since my teens. I am having a really difficult time giving a shit. 50 mg of zoloft weaned from 100 because I'm tired of feeling nothing; worthless, scared to death of the side effects of other meds. (was on Lamorogine (sp?) and practically hallucinated for a month - re-prescribed abilify, not touching that crap). Today, I slept about 16 hours...just to give my brain a break. Those of you who have managed to carry on, please share how. right now, the only thing keeping me from checking out is my kids; it would either destroy them, or, maybe they'd be better off than having an off-the-rails mother.  i don't know. I cannot talk to family about this - it makes for an uncomfortable evening. I have no friends. I do know im in some real trouble here, or I would not be reaching out to strangers...btw, the suicide hotline is fucking worthless to me. been there several times. Getting a good drunk on and passing out would be more helpful...any thoughts, encouragement, etc would be greatly appreciated right now...I could use a friend. It's getting VERY hard to be a semi-functional depressed person...
TL:DR old, tired, depressed, beaten down...etc., etc...
