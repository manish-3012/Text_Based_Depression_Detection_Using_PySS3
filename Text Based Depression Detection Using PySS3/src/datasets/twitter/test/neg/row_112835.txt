I'm at the end of rope. How do I cry for help without seeming like an attention whore?I'm so tempted to post something on Facebook announcing my want to kill myself, but I feel like it wouldn't be taken seriously, or I'd just put a bad taste in everyone's mouth and nobody would actually do anything. Idk, the day is getting closer and I just want to let people know. I just want someone to call the cops on me and have me institutionalized against my will because that's probsbly the only chance I have at the moment.
