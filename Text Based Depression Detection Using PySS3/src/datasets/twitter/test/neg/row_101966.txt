I just tried calling two different hotlines and they both were uselessThe first line I called was recommended by my counselor and was some sort of local line. I had to wait for so long to talk to a person that wasnâ€™t even one of the counselors. All they asked for was basic info then decided I should speak to a counselor. Then I had to wait again for a counselor. I understand theyâ€™re helping other people and I would have been fine with waiting if the counselor wasnâ€™t so awful. It felt like I was on a conveyer belt and they were rushing me to finish. â€œHave you tried these coping skills.â€ â€œYes.â€ â€œOk well then try again and call back if you still feel bad.â€ Of course after that I felt even fucking worse so I decided to give the national hotline a try, which was a mistake. This guy was an asshole. Imagine fucking disagreeing with the person whoâ€™s suicidal about how theyâ€™re feeling. He was so fucking bad that he mightâ€™ve actually helped me by turning my mindset from sadness to anger.
