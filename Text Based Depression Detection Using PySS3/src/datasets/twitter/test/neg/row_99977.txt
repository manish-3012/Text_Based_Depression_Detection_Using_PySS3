My friend witnessed a suicide. How to help?My friend witnessed a suicide yesterday and had to make the 911 call. He is pretty badly shaken. We are in Maryland. Where can he call to seek some comfort? Is it the suicide prevention hotline? He could really use some healing from the experience. Thank you for your time.
