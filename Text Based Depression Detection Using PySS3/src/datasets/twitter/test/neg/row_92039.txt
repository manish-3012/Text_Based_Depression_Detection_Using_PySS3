i feel emptyI just can't bring myself to be a human. I just feel like im here to repeat the same old things and whatever I do is pointless. Im too afraid to talk to my loved ones about it because I already know and have tried that it doesnt end up well. I feel like there's a weight in my chest dragging me down, and the only thing that stops me from ending it all is the people that love mes sadness.
