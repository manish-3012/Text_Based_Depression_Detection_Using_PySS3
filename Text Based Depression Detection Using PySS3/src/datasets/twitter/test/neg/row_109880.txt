If I end up like my mom, it will be worse than dyingMost people have a great mom who loves them. My mom isn't like that. She gave up her career and independence to raise a family and she was so bitter and angry about it that she put all that anger on me and abused me while I was growing up. Now I'm bitter and sad too. The only good thing is I haven't made the mistake of having kids of my own. 

I once had grand ambitions of starting a new career. It was something I always wanted to do. I went to school, gave up my shitty customer service job and finally graduated this summer. Only to find out I can't stand networking. I had social anxiety to begin with so I don't even know why I tried to do this. Every event I went to made me feel worse.  I'm so stupid. I absolutely loved the field so I thought that was enough. But it isn't. Now I can barely go outside. I feel like if anyone looks at me they'll know that I haven't showered in weeks,. They'll know that I spend most of my time in bed just hoping I'll randomly quit breathing. I try to act normal for my husband because he deserves to be happy at least. I come up with excuses. I've 'caught the flu' a couple times the last couple months so I can stay in bed and try and forget everything. I find myself wishing we never met so he won't be so sad when I finally get the guts to end all this.

I know I'm depressed. I should get meds or therapy, but I'm just so tired. I've done that dance so many times, and I always end up here. I'm sick of trying.

So, stupid enough I'm going to try and write a book. The only other thing I always wanted to do with my life is [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/). So I'm going to do that. It'll be shit I'm sure. I've never taken any writing classes beyond the basics. And if I still feel like shit after.....idk.
