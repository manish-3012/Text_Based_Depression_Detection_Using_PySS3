Sky King's death has me thinking.Beebo Russell, who hijacked and crashed Air Q400, was a martyr and a legend. 

Life is pointless. Society and government keep us from living life to its fullest. The best way to live is with reckless abandon.

And if it kills me?

Well, that's the point. I've hit the fourth wall. I know what life is. And I don't want to live it the way I'm told.

No, I'm going out with a bang.
