Is suicide the option?I know my problems my not seem as bad as most people on this sub. But Iâ€™ve never had such intense thoughts and dreams of ending myself. Some information Iâ€™d rather not disclose to people for personal issues. 

Well Iâ€™m 22 a male and Iâ€™ve had a great life Iâ€™ve grown up in a good home around loving people. At around the age of 14 i noticed that Iâ€™ve had a pretty serious mental issue about myself that i thought was normal and would go away as time passed. But Iâ€™ll get into that a little later. 

Recently Iâ€™ve had a bad breakup with what feels like the love of my life we were together 3 years and i had plans to purpose, but after me and her not really moving anywhere in life together she started seeing more successful men behind my back and met a guy in the army that convinced her to join the army. Long story short she left me and ships out in a week and is going active for four years, but that guy is no longer in the picture, she ended up back with me and ended up breaking up with me yesterday and no matter how much love i showed her it was as if she didnâ€™t care. I offered getting a better job and moving somewhere to make her happier which worked at first but she decided to stay in the army so now sheâ€™s acting as if she doesnâ€™t care and ontop of all of it memories of my mental issues have been haunting me my whole life and i hate myself for it and just wanted to end myself for that reason only and the only thing that has kept me happy since i discovered my mental issue wasnâ€™t going to go away was her. And now Iâ€™m sitting at a counter with a bottle of multiple pills thinking if itâ€™s really worth it or not. Iâ€™m just not mentally ready to go through the pain thatâ€™s about to come and Iâ€™m afraid what my mental condition is going to get me into. 

(Iâ€™ve never discussed having this mental issue with anyone nor have i ever brought it up to anyone)
