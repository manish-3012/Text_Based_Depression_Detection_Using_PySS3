Would like to make things as easy on my parents as possible.I intend to kill myself soon. I know this will really, really suck for a bunch of people in my life, but it feels essentially unavoidable. My family - I have no SO or children, but I do have parents - is nowhere nearby, but I worry that they will wind up having to get involved in sorting out the belongings I leave behind, and that this will inevitably add extra trauma.

I live in Scotland, in the UK, and I'm wondering how best to minimise the amount of shit I inflict on my parents in particular when I go. I don't have a lot of energy, but so far my best idea is to at least box up my belongings as if I were moving flat.

I have already donated most of my things to charity shops, like unused clothes and shoes, it's just there's a bunch of stuff I'm not sure what to do with - like textbooks, that are kind of specialized - or things that I will need until the end - like my kitchen utensils, my bedding, and my computer. Is boxing these things the best option I have? I don't have the energy to sell the textbooks, or to find anyone willing to take them, really.

I am also not sure what happens with all my recurring bills/direct debits when I die, or what would be best to arrange beforehand. I have basically zero assets and savings, and so any kind of will seems unnecessary (?), but I still don't want to have to make anyone sort things out on my behalf, if I can avoid it. I had wanted to go to a Citizens Advice Bureau to ask this but can only imagine how awkward/awful that conversation would be.

In general I want to make it as "easy" on my (relatively distant) relatives as possible. I know it won't be, but, for example, tidying my flat would just be an extra awful burden that I'd like if possible to avoid causing, so I will take care of that. I'd also like to know any other ideas for things I might not have thought of.

I am obviously sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. This seemed the most appropriate subreddit I could find.
