My problemI work with this girl I have been in love with for almost 2 years. We hang out everyday and watch movies, smoke bud and whatnot. She has a boyfriend in California but Everytime she gets hit on it makes me want to die. I will never look like that guy that she wants,  and it just sucks. A constant type of disappointment. Makes me want to die. Not sure want I want from you? Permission? I just hate myself. It's growing, and I don't know if I can stop.
