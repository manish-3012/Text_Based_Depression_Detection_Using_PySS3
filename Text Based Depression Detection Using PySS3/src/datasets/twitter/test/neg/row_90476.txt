Brother is suicidal.My half brother (late 20s) is a functional autistic; graduated with a degree in chemistry, can interact in society but you'd know he's "off" but the sad is, is that he knows something is wrong with him but not sure what and he knows that cause he has no friends and no one wants to be around him. It's a long story but I just found out he was suicidal because he's trying to join the Air Force (can't find a job) and he told me it's pending an evaluation from his school and when I asked what it was he reluctantly told me it's his therapy sessions for suicide. My step mom is a old school Korean mom who doesn't take it seriously and thinks anyone needs to make it through life is an education, she's deluded to the fact he has needs and the Air Force might be a death sentence for a guy who is isolated alone and depressed. He lives in Virginia and I live in California so I'm not around enough to hang with him. What's some stuff I can do to help him? Any advice would be appreciated.
