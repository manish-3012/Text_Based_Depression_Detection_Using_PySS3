hi, i'm thinking about leavinghi i'm a 22 year old male. i don't care for my job. i don't care about my family. i don't have any interests, so i have no passion. nothing to major in. nothing on earth interests me. 

i've been in therapy and on many drugs for 4 years. nothing will bring me happiness. everything is so trivial. i simply don't care and am not interested. eternal nothingness is a dream. 

i've been diagnosed bipolar2 but he[my psychiatrist] admits he isn't sure. If he is right, i'll be manically depressed for the rest of my life. and the many medications i've been on just don't do anything. how can they honestly? you can't just dope some one up enough to make them forget about concepts like value.

 any way i'm going to go the helium route. a route of suicide i'd recommend to anyone who seriously desires to die. i just need to order a oxygen mask online. they are cheap. [Just ordered one]

 i've attempted suicide once before. failed, it was poorly planed, just plain dumb idea. i tried to suffocate myself, in a sauna. while on tons of anti-anxiety and alcohol and generic sleeping pills.  i've been on the brink of suicide about 15 times. i've had 3 different guns in my mouth, a noose around my neck, 2 exit bags+helium, 1 car full of tanks of helium. I'm afraid i won't be able to do it like i did those times. but i'll get drunk and abuse my meds like i did when i attempted suicide the first time. but this time i shouldn't fail cause it's actually a doable job. i'm so tired. but i'm so afraid, i won't let myself do it. please some one help me kill myself?

Or for you righteous people, why should i live?
