Iâ€™m done. Goodbye.Iâ€™m going to drive my car off the bridge in the middle of town at midnight. I donâ€™t care. I cant do this anymore. 

I hate myself, I have for a decade, and I donâ€™t give a fuck if I have a â€œbright futureâ€ ahead of my bc in the end it isnâ€™t worth it.

I relapsed last night and my partner found out and this is the last straw. They are so heartbroken, so upset, and it is once again my fault. â€œThis relationship feels one-sidedâ€ and they are right. I do nothing for them. 

Iâ€™m not making anyone deal with me anymore. 3 Â½ hours until the end. Iâ€™m ready. My note is written, even have a draft of my will. Iâ€™m done. No more. 

Goodbye.
