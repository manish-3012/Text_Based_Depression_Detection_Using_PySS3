I need to ventI feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. I had no energy to do anything yesterday (Christmas) and I cried myself to sleep at 6 pm. lately everything has been worsen don't even feel like myself anymore. its the weirdest and worst feeling ever, when I look at old photos it doesn't feel like im looking at myself. its like I lost the connection to everything overnight. I don't even feel like hiding my sadness anymore. im going to see my Grandma the 4th and im worried it will be obvious that im unhappy. I used to get distracted and I would forget about my problems but now all I can think about is my problems. I dont think ive ever been this anxious in my life. I wanna tell someone so bad but I dont know what to say. ive lost myself and everyone around me. im so lonely I don't feel like I can go on much longer.
