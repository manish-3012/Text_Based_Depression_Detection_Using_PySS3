I need a reason to stay in this worldI have been pushing my self for too long. My country has a civil war for a decade now. I have been moving around for the same period losing friends, relatives and my home to it but I kept pushing through all the poverty, danger and all this shit. in short I pushed my self to the very limit both physically and mentally.
All this just trying to get a life that many people take it for granted. However, every time I push, it feels like the whole world pushes back. I still have dreams about the people who died infront of me and recently I developed tinnitus which increased my suffering even more. At this point I honestly don't feel like I want anything from this world anymore. 

I just want to stop existing.
