idki wish there was a tattoo or a symbol somehow to indicate that a person was suicidal. like every single suicidal person being identifiable. and then people would see us and know to treat us more gently no matter the circumstances. i think it would be nice to be seen and told those affirmations i only get when confessing how i feel. people checking in on you and saying theyâ€™re glad youâ€™re still here and that youâ€™re strong as an every day thing. weâ€™re mentally ill arenâ€™t we? and yet we rarely get any form of compassion. anyways, itâ€™s just a thought i had. if u disagree thatâ€™s fine. iâ€™m just tired of no one caring about anyone unless theyâ€™ve already died
