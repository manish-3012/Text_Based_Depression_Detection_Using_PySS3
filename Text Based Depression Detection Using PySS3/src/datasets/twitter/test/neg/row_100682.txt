I don't want to go on but I'm too afraid to dieI'm too much of a coward to die, but I really wish I wasn't. There seems to be no way for me to succeed in dying or in life. All i do is waste people's time by constantly complaining and being an absolute mess. I don't work on myself and just lash out.
 
Nobody cares about me really and I dont blame them. Nobody is going to care about this post either, but why would they? I'm too afraid to actually run in front of a train. I really hope one day I get the courage to at least attempt something...
