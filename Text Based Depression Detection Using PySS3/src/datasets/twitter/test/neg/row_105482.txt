defeatim so tired of this world, anytime i get something good it takes it away from me. I always tried to be good, do the right thing, be polite and kind to others and treat everyone with dignity and respect, hoping that one day id be rewarded for my endeavors. But the only thing that came of all my efforts was being taken advantage of and abandoned by others at every turn. No matter how much effort i put into anything i was always second rate, overshadowed by my peers or others and discarded like a used napkin. I was always there for others, always first to lend out a hand when someone was in need of help, but when im at my lowest i look around and find nobody in my corner. what was the point of it all? 

im so tired of being kicked around my this world, i dont want to fuckin be here anymore. i gave it my all i really did i swear, sorry everyone, i let yall down again.
