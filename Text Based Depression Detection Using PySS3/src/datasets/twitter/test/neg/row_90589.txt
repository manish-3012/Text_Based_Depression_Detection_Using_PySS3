Young and ConfusedI'm in college, have a girlfriend of about a year, and have done well in the past with school. I do, however, feel a deep sense of sadness because I constantly feel like an outcast. It's not that I don't get alone with people, it's that I'm afraid to, and afraid of what they may think of me. I have about 0% self confidence, and when I am boosted for a small amount of time, I get knocked by down by the realization that it doesn't seem like anyone sincerely cares. My girlfriend isn't responding to pretty much 95% of my texts, despite us having a month's anniversary only a few days ago. I don't think we're happy together, and there's nothing either of us can do about it. It's become meaningless, and when she does respond, she apologizes each time that she's been busy, despite the day being a Friday or a Saturday. I experienced the decline of my grandfather firsthand as I took care of him for more than 4 years as he was in the very final stages of Alzheimer's, and I feel like such experiences desensitized me or made me unable to handle my emotions correctly, as well as a bad breakup from the years before. Although I know no one really is judging me, I feel as though I am constantly being watched, and the slightest mistake I make can ruin an entire day for me. 

Simply, I'm not very happy, I'm making only a few friends here at university, but I know that no matter what I do, I'll always feel insecure and unimportant, that nobody sincerely cares, and that I'm just something they can use in their life for meaningless entertainment, considering I try to mask my emotions with jokes and other forms of such.
