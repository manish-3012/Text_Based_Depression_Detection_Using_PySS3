Intense suicidal/hopeless feelingsI don't know how to articulate what I'm feeling, because what's going on in my head isn't due to feelings like loneliness or sadness. They aren't particular thoughts it just feels like I'm having an acute or intense depressive episode only it's been lasting almost a week. Every morning I've been waking up with this feeling in my head and it feels completely hopeless, does anyone know what to do? I'm on medication and just got prescribed supplemental meds but I'm afraid they won't change anything or take too long. It feels like a permanent development in my head and I'm feeling extremely hopeless. Is there any hope?
