my best friend killed himself last weekand i donâ€™t think i can do it anymore. he was my rock. i have other support. but i need his. he was such a light in this world and now it feels so dark. all i can do is get heavily fucked up on drugs that we did together and would do together and be like wow weâ€™re fucked up and depressed but have each other. i have no one. i am so alone. i canâ€™t do this. i am so self destructive. i miss him so much.
