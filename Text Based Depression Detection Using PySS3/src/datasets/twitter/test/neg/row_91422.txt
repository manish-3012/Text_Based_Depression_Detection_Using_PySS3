help me help someoneMy girlfriend told me that if it wasn't for me, she would've killed herself.

She's been suicidal for most of her life now, with other mental health problems. We've been dating for over a year now, and she told me this quite recently. She knows how she's going to do it. It breaks my heart that she's suffering so much.

I know things have been going really badly for her, her home life isn't great and neither is school. Everytime I ask her if she's ok she'd say "Am I ever?" and she gets major mood swings. I'm so worried about her. She's tried therapy and seeing a psychiatrist and counselling multiple times but she says none of it works so she's given up. She tells me that she's so sad it hurts and shes constantly exhausted and that death would be like coming home to her. I'm so worried about her. I've been trying to get her to some excersize with me in the morning, to keep her from waking up at 11 and I've heard that it helps(?). I don't know.  I don't know what helps and what doesn't but I figured you guys could help me help her? 

All I want is to make her life a little bit easier for her. Anything will help. I'm grasping at straws here. 

What's something you'd love someone else to do for you? something that might make you feel a bit better? I don't know if this is the right sub but if anyone knows something about wanting to die itd be you guys right? I don't know a thing about it.
