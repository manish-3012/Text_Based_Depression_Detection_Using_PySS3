I canâ€™t keep going like thisEveryday I wake up and feel dull. I feel empty and it feels as if there was a weight on my chest holding me down. I have nothing left to live for, no ambition, nobody, not one thing i can think of that would be worth staying in this fucked up world for. Even if it isnâ€™t within this week I will keep trying until I finally pass. I dont belong in this world and i canâ€™t keep going on. I am scared of everyone and everything I canâ€™t talk to anyone without being scared or hurt. My whole life has been hurt and the world has been taking from me until I have nothing left.
