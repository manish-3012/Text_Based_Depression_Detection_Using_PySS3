Count Down To Death Date: 2I had a dream last night. A dream that maybe there was hope. A dream that I had millions of subscribers on youtube and I was with the girl of my dreams. I was friends with people I once looked up to. I had a lot of money, I was so happy..

..Until I woke up

Then the depression and hatred for myself hit my like a truck, it was 7:35am

Still ignored by girl of dreams, channel that isnâ€™t growing at all on youtube, no guarantee that Iâ€™ll even graduate from high school.. I was clearly back in reality

Last week I had emailed some Youtubers (I wonâ€™t say which ones but theyâ€™re big) about my channel, even sending some scripts I made with me in them and hoped maybe theyâ€™d be interested in them

Collaborations were my last hope in my plan actually working

I didnâ€™t expect a reply within a day obviously since they probably get emails all the time

I tried as hard as I could to make the emails professional. I put â€œDear (insert name here)â€ so it didnâ€™t seem spammy, I made sure I linked my social media and YouTube channel, and I even asked for prices just in case they wouldnâ€™t reply if I didnâ€™t get money involved. I was more than willing to pay

After about a week I started to wonder why I still havenâ€™t gotten anything yet. I added read receipts to the emails from this extension called boomerang so I know if it was read and ignored or they just didnâ€™t see it yet

They were opened, but I never got any replies

One of them were opened like 16 times and I was excited because I figured maybe they were really interested, although it didnâ€™t make any sense why I havenâ€™t gotten a reply yet

I decided to test that theory by using my anonymous email to send fan messages and what do you know, they responded within a day

So they never responded, not even to say they werenâ€™t interested, but I was simply ignored

Isnâ€™t it business etiquette to respond to business emails, I know there are spam and all but my email wasnâ€™t spammy at all. I reread it like 4 times to make sure there werenâ€™t any misspelled words

I worked hard on those scripts too.. I wrote them in script format with google docs because I donâ€™t have final draft. Which was stressful. They couldâ€™ve at least told me their opinion on it, like I said in the email

Itâ€™s one thing to get ignored by your friends, but by people you once thought were your idols, I guess that hurts in a whole different way. But what can I do? â€œtheyâ€™re not obligated to replyâ€

The only little piece of hope I have left of my plan working is just posting my animated movie and hoping the youtube algorithm picks it up, which obviously isnâ€™t going to happen

I knew this idea was never going to work. But Iâ€™m so used to taking ignored messages personally it still hurts knowing it backfired

Suicide still sounds like a great idea. I only managed to submit one incomplete assignment last night

I guess Iâ€™m going to summer school.. AGAIN

I go to summer school every fucking year. From the 3rd grade, to this year. The only years where I didnâ€™t go to summer school were 7th grade, 8th grade, and 10th grade. But I did have to take extra classes in 8th grade. This year I had to take Algebra 2 again because I failed during my junior year and summer school following that; And I failed AGAIN because of the fucking coronavirus

As a matter of fact I pretty much failed every class because of covid 19

So whatâ€™s the point of living? I get ignored all the time, my plan to be successful my way has gone to shit, and I canâ€™t even graduate high school

I stressed for 2 months this year finding a job. Getting rejected back and forth, getting ignored, Then when I finally get an interview I feel like the stress was worth it and I can move towards my plan. Then Iâ€™d make the money to go to vid con and actually meet them and show them my channel instead of just emailing them. But thanks to covid 19 they paused applications

I then thought I lucked out when I got an interview for Kroger. But thanks to my stupid parents I couldnâ€™t go. It was no use trying to contact the hiring manager

Yesterday morning I got 2 emails from other Krogers I applied to telling me they werenâ€™t interested in hiring me so that was another kick to my already mangled body

I know most of you idiots will try to tell me to wait it out â€œitâ€™ll end eventually, then you can continue with your planâ€ SHUT THE FUCK UP

Are you reading this list right now? Are you reading it? Then donâ€™t tell me that bullshit

I probably would wait but the point is getting a job was to move out of my parents house so I didnâ€™t have to go to college because they have the â€œcollege is everythingâ€ mentality

But since I canâ€™t now I have no choice but to apply or else my life will be hell thanks to them

Yesterday I left the house for the first time this month with my mom to get my refund for my senior trip ticket I bought. I saw other kids coming through in their cars by themselves, I know most of them still have jobs

Here I am back to square 1. I lost everything I worked for

I used to drive around the city to relax. Now I canâ€™t drive anywhere because Iâ€™m not covered by the insurance on their shitty Toyota rental and they think Iâ€™m going to crash even after I proved to them multiple times Iâ€™m good at driving

I almost got hired twice. I couldâ€™ve been making $2,000 a month, but instead I only get $150 dollars from my mom every month because she thinks that somehow makes up for the plans SHE ruined

What the fuck is $150 supposed to get me? I canâ€™t fucking go anywhere anymore. I canâ€™t afford the things I truly want, itâ€™s not enough to help me move out. All that shit is going to get me is pity items in an attempt to help me deal with this. But I donâ€™t see myself doing that for the rest of my life because I had to give up my dreams

Once again Iâ€™ve been defeated by my parents. This year I was supposed to get the upper hand. But they won.. again

Iâ€™ve accepted my loss; and Iâ€™m officially killing myself. Next time the fucking leave to Louisiana Iâ€™m going to be dead. I know how Iâ€™m doing it. Iâ€™ve done my research, because Iâ€™m scrawny with hypertension it should kill me instantly with no pain

The blood is in their hands and I couldnâ€™t give a fuck if they cry. If anyone cries. Thinking about how much I â€œimpacted their livesâ€. How? How did I impact your life at all? Me existing or me writing this isnâ€™t a valid reason. Give me a genuine reason. Even if you manage to think of a reason other than those Iâ€™m still killing myself

Iâ€™m doing it for me. Iâ€™m getting rid of the pain

The revenge that happens to come with it is not writing any notes and having these losers think itâ€™s their fault I died

Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ll care, I wonâ€™t feel anything, or think anything, at all because Iâ€™ll be dead. There is NOTHING after death; And thatâ€™s how I like it. I felt nothing before I was born, I wonâ€™t feel anything when Iâ€™m dead

Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™ll write more of these tomorrow. Until the inevitable finale
