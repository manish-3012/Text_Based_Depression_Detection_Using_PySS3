A gentle reminder, nothing I do matters Part IIWell, for some incalculable reason I'm still in this thing. Of course I blew the interview. Lack of preparation. It seems the things I don't do matter more than the things I do do. Of course when they discussed with me the lack of preparation and mentioned specific things I was not prepared for I felt like a fool. Of course I should have done those things, read that thing, sent that email. And it's at least partially because they went dark for a time. The original position they were thinking is still open, but I was told they were filling it with a contractor, and those other positions they were thinking of never hit the job board. So after their goal date came and went I threw my hands up and convinced myself it wasn't going to happen.

They must really want me because they're giving me a writing assignment to redeem myself. This makes no sense and I'm tempted to tell them that. They are over looking a massive pool of well qualified individuals. The opportunity cost here is huge.
