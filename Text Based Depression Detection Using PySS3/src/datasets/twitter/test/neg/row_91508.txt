-I'm not sure why do I even write this, I'll regret it the second I post it and I might as well delete it but then I know I'll repost it. And again. And again.
I just can't handle shit anymore and tonight I wish I were dead, I don't care how. I'm just so fucking done. In the middle of another borderline breakdown and I can't do it anymore
I feel like deleting all my social media again but then I know people will seem worried and will call me or whatever and I don't know what do I even expect. I don't know what do I expect from posting anywhere. What the fuck do I want, bpd? Just let me die already.
I can't even do it. I would've almost attempted twice two years ago when I was in the same state as now and I'm still alive. I have so many regrets. Everything is just awful. Even when I get back on the right dose of meds it won't be ok. Nothing is ok. It's only getting covered up with temporary mental stability. Why can't I be ok?
I could just do it but my girlfriend would be worried. But why should I care, she didn't cat a hint when I sent suicide relating lyrics and she knows me well enough. Everything is wrong
And when I wake up again I'll either want to die just as much or I'll laugh at myself for having been in such a horrible state.
The only thing going through my head now is twenty one pilots lyrics (as always these days) oh god my fucking boss is texting me. What the fuck does she want. Fuck off
All I can think of is song Anathema and it's so fucking depressing. "You'll never know what's under my skull so won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye?"
I'm a goner, that's it
And when this episode is over, I'll fucking laugh at this shit
It's never ok
I wonder if I'll delete this or let it stay
