so i think i want to kill myselfill try and keep this brief and to the point. 

i am very sad all of the time for either no reason or the smallest of reasons. some days i dont get out of bed because i dont want to even have my roommates look at me and be forced to interact with them, so i just say in bed in the dark.

im lonely. i have people in my life that love me, but im lonely. i have a canine companion and he means the world to me, but his love is not enough for me to feel like i am not completely alone. i even have a girl who loves me dearly and im convinced she would marry me if i only asked her, but she lives across the country and even when we shared a bedroom i was still sad and lonely. 

i dont have a job. i have to ask my parents for money weekly. im old enough to where i should (and do) feel ashamed and embarrassed for this. i spend my days either applying for jobs or in my room alone. every now and then my roommates will drag me out on the town and by the end of it im exhausted pretending that im fine and making them laugh. its almost disgusting how good i am at pretending everything is alright.

today when i pulled my car into my garage i sat there and thought about leaving the engine running. 

i know my life isnt supposed to be all easy, and i dont think that i should expect any part of it to be, but i just dont know what to do anymore. 

i dont want to seek help because i cant let my parents (who im still on their health plan) know about this. my sister tried to kill herself when i was younger and is still very unstable. they have enough to worry about with her and i dont want to jump into the mix.

im not sleeping well. ive also begun to notice that i will always be wincing or tense with my posture. particularly my shoulders. they are constantly sore from me doing this. 

im not sure what this post is about. this is the first time i have every told anyone about any of this. its been going on for years. almost a decade even, but ive never let anyone in on this. i guess i just wanted to write it all down.
