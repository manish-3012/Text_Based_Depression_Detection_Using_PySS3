i sometimes just think that im cursed to be unlovablepeople keep telling me im the most caring person they know, im the most talented, im the smartest

yadda yadda.

i care for people so much, but it's like im investing all my time and effort into nothing when i realize that im just another expendable asset, just another guy to everyone else

no one bloody cares to message me to ask me how am i. its like only my parents would notice if im gone, and even then people wouldn't bat an eye. just another evanescent memory 

i thought i had something to look forward to â€” going to a prestigious music college â€” as i love music

who knows, my father invested my college fund into his startup, claiming that it'll be 100% successful, and my mom was retrenched

i feel like ive got no more life to live, im just a mask of the "never complain, never explain" ideology

i did the DASS thing and have 35/42 D, severe depression. i let my mom know â€” i trust her â€” but she waved it aside, saying that as long as i had God i don't need to be worried

just wtf man, i am a theist but somethings are just so nonsensical in life that im questioning my existence lmao, i just wanna die but then im worried that that may not be the right thing to do lol
