These long postsI cant even read or focus. How are you all so able? 

I'm so overwhelmed with losing everything I've basically given up. 

The only ones I care about, thinking of them after, is holding me back somewhat.

Everything else and everyone else doesn't matter. It doesn't get better no matter what they say. It just doesn't. 

Losing your home, your job of 6.5 years, your sense of purpose, your ability to think straight and do tasks - your best strength all lost.

Every day just seems like a trauma to the eventual abrupt end.

I hate waking up, its the worst part of my day, making it hard to even go to sleep.

I've never wished more for death in my sleep or for a tree to fall on me or lightning to strike me. 

Mental illness is a fucking joke in this country. No one cares. They just dope you up and talk to you and hope for the best. How does that help anyone????

People with no support system are worse off than me and I cant take it so I can only imagine their pain and suffering.

38 to the cord seems to be my way of going, just going to do it somewhere remote, possibly in my car, so I won't be found for a while. Everyone can pick up their lives and move on, ive become nothing but a burden.

Human history is littered with war and struggle. To what end?

They can figure it out. I know i cant.
