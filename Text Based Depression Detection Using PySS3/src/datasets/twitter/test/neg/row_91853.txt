Possibly my final noteIâ€™ve been writing suicide notes but Iâ€™ve been too much of a coward to go through with it and I feel like my friends have been there more than my family who is supposed to be with you but in my situation that is completely bullshit. 3 years is when I reached out for help to my parent but not had happened. I was promised to talk to a therapist but it was just something to make feel better at the moment. After realising promises are made to be broke Iâ€™ve developed trust issues like I am afraid to love to the person I love best but I am afraid that she sees this side of me that Iâ€™ve keep to myself I love her but she deserves more. My first suicide note I tried to go through with it but I fucking failed that like I fucked up everyone and everything tonight Iâ€™ve come to realise I should end it, like cutting the chain Iâ€™ve attached to everyone in my life because I am just dead weight
