Existential crisis made me afraid of wanting to kill myself.In the past month, I've been going through an existential crisis that made me not only question everything about life, but made me think that my own feelings aren't legit.

By "not legit", I mean that they are just an ilusion given by biology to keep me alive. I DON'T want to believe that it's just it, but I can't help stopping to see the world that way. Everytime I have a good feeling, I remember those facts I've put in my mind and feel depressed.

How can I have a happy life, if it's nonsense? Im not sure if I'm in the right place to talk about it, but I need help to stop those neurotic ideas before it's too late...
