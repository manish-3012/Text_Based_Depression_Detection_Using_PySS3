i'm content with the fact that i will inevitably kill myselfwhenever i'm talking to friends or family all i can think about is "theyll probably think of this memory when i'm gone and wonder what went wrong." i harm myself daily and have been for months, and i have no more ways to afford a fourth hospitalization.

it feels like being terminally ill and knowing you'll die. i know it's my decision and my choice but at the same time i just feel like it's how things have to be. the knowledge that i will die soon is always looming over my head. it hurts but at the same time i know i'm done fighting. maybe it's tragic. i'm just not sure.

this is the time of year where i start to get really bad again and after years in a row of doing this i don't know if i'll survive this year. i'm not sure if i want to.

i know i will die. and i think im okay with it.
