I deserve to die but my family won't let me.I genuinely think that the world would be better without me and I hate myself so much, but I still can't kill myself because my family would be sad. Even though having a useless failure around is a complete waste, they won't let me go. It makes me feel sad and guilty because I can't think of any reason to keep me around. Sorry for making you read this, I just needed to vent.
