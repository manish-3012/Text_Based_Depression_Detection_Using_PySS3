I dont care anymoreI don't understand why I was born or even why I'm still alive.  My grades are shit, I have no friends, and my family just downright doesn't care.  I've told my parents I'm depressed numerous times and they said, "happens to all of us."  And everyday when they are going through my grades, they make sure their disappointment gets through to me.  I've been bullied since 5th grande and wanting to kill myself ever since.  I really just want to die but I don't have the balls to kill myself.
