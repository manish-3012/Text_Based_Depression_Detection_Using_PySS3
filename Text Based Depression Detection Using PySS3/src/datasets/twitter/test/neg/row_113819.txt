They days are ticking down, can't tell if I'm relieved or scared. Just waiting.My plans have been coming along beautifully. My emotions range from numb to scared back to numb.

I plan to jump and I don't know how I feel about it. I just have to close my eyes and fall forward and gravity will take my choice from me.

Mostly I move forward robotically. Check another item off the list, another step closer to completion. And then the day will come and it won't matter, because I can fall a few short seconds and be done with it.

I can't make myself feel bad for my family or my friends, because time passes swiftly and soon they'll be dead and they'll be memories themselves.

Ok I feel sort of bad for my parents but like I said, time will pass and it'll be over and done with and irrevocable by the time they find out.

I just wish I felt something, but I just feel empty. Everything feels hollow. I think I won't do it, yet somehow my list is over half complete and everything I planned is on schedule.
