I just want to stop existingI have no desire to kill myself, but if I could just suddenly and painlessly stop existing now, I would. I have nothing to live for anymore. No reason to go on. My long-distance boyfriend died, and he was the center of my world. We were supposed to get married, start a family, and grow old together. I don't fucking want anyone else, and I don't think I'll HAVE anyone else. He was perfect. I'm so fucking sick of all these useless platitudes and cliches like a broken record. They only make me feel worse. He wasn't just the love of my life, he was my only friend. The one person who truly understood me. I'll never have that again with anyone else.
