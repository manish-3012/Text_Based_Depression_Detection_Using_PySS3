Reddit, I need your help. My friend thinks she's too broken to be fixed.Alright, this time it's not about me, but I still could use your input. I have a friend who's really depressed right now. She hasn't really been in the mood to talk these past couple of days and I already got worried, but today she reached out to me saying that she is broken and can't function anymore.

She says she feels overwhelmed with work and her kids. That it's all just too much.

This all happened quite suddenly. However, she has a history of burn-out and depression, being to clinics and on medication, also she always said that she had a slight death wish since she was little (she's 41 now). But this current episode started on Saturday, I think.

I already told her that she is a great person and that I admire her for what she has achieved in her life. That she is a great person and and a good mother. That I respect her.

I'm trying to put zero pressure on her or to make her feel like I blame her for her current state. But I need your support as well if I should get at my wits' end. But I hope I'm on the right track with her.

I really don't want to lose her. I like her way too much for that.

EDIT: we've chatted for a couple of hours now and she went to bed now. I think she is a bit more stable now. I'll leave my phone on for the night and told her she can reach me if necessary.
