15M hereReally pains me to see all the poor kids that have found there way here. Really pains me to read about all the thoughts so much more worse then mine. The less fortunate struggling with thier own demons, the children posting here, go damn it I feel y'all. All y'all fighting this shit. The depression hits us all different. When I see people on this sub, I love to try to help them in any way I can in any way to stall because honestly there is no straight textbook reason to live. We all here doing our own things. Destiny is bullshit we use either positively or negatively. I try to stay away from posting on this sub cause i don't wanna believe I want to kill myself I'm not trying to convince myself death is the answer but it creeps up on us. Life hates u and me all the same. Please rock on. No matter how fucked your parents are gonna be u just gotta tune them out somehow. I love y'all but rock on. Most of the people on this sub are here to help. We can never truly understand what we have. I just wanna help. People are out there that you've never met that love you. I love you. Do not die. Talk to anyone.
