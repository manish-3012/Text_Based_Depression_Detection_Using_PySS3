Mental effects after overdose on antipsychotics/antidepressants?New here. I hope this is okay to post. I dont really want to die right now, i also dont really want to make my currently not severe psychosis worse. Depression sucks, mostly asking because i want a little relief somehow even for a day or two.

Referring to seroquel mostly:

Ive heard its difficult to die from overdosing on most antipsychotics. But i was wondering, if you do overdose, does it worsen your mental illnesses long term? Or would it just make you sleepy that day and feel kind of off for a while? Would it cause your tolerance to change and probably need a med increase? Would it make psychosis worse as well as depression?

Any facts or experiences about the mental effects after an antipsychotic or antidepressant overdose are appreciated if thats allowed.
