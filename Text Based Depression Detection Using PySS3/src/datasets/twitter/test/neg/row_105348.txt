Is there anything else I can do?The first time I ever had the urge to kill myself I think I was 11.  Not much has changed for me since then.  I've done therapy before, with a couple different people.  I also tried leaning on illicit drugs, lots of different stuff.  Nothing helps.  I'm not happy.  I'm a waste of resources.  I'm useless to those around me.  I'm about to graduate college without a job or any skills to speak of and I can't keep coming up with reasons not to do it.  Nothing works, nothing helps for more than a few hours at a time.  Nothing is ever going to get better.  I'm tired of therapists repeating my own points back to me and say in g they're just my opinion, and I can't think of anything else I could try to change my situation.
