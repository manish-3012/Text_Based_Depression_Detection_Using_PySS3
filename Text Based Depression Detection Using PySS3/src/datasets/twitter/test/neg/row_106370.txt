I think Iâ€™m done with it allI guess I just made this post as more of a rant to finally just get all of this pain out of my mind and heart. Iâ€™m in a toxic relationship where my gf does nothing but ridicule and mock me while picking every fight she can to berate me. Iâ€™ve lost contact with friends and family all of which I used to be extremely close to, and Iâ€™m regretting ever coming to college in the first place

Iâ€™m sick of this constant feeling for dread and sadness that washes over me every ten seconds. Iâ€™m tired of having to fake fucking smile everyday so that others can be happy

Fuck the world and fuck life Iâ€™m done
