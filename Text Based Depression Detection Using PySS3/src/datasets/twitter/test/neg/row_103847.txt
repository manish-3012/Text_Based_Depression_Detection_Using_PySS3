Can anyone help me?I don't know what to do anymore. I've been depressed and suicidal for so long... I don't know what else to do. My best friend ignores me when I go to him for help. I don't have many people. Literally almost all of my friends stopped talking to me over the past year. I just want a reason to stay. I just want to feel loved.
