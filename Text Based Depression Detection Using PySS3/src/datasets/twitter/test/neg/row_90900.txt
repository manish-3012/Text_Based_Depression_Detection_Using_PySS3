Do you think people use this subreddit as a way to clear their conscience?Do you think a lot of people get things off their chest anonymously just so they can write the thoughts and suffering down. So they kind of have to clear their thoughts before they go ahead with it? 
They obviously canâ€™t send it to a friend or family member as they will probably try to do something to prevent them doing. 

It makes sense to me. Thereâ€™s no right answer. Either live and experience some form of intense pain or die without knowing what will happen to you and leaving behind everything youâ€™ve ever known. The thing people donâ€™t seem to realise is that you can be intense pain and still miss your friends and family and some aspects of life. But the bad aspects are too bad. 

And yeah I agree that the whole suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is flawed and annoying. As long as you have an active mind and brain some problems will either never be temporary or they will worsen then get slightly better then worsen etc because some peoples mind and personalityâ€™s will never change enough that they can be happy. The depression, the anxiety and various other illnesses will always be there draining them of energy reminding them that they canâ€™t break out. 

I strongly despise the law we have in the UK and people know it will have to change eventually but donâ€™t give a fuck. No assisted dying at all- really??
Youâ€™re basically containing people to a life of pain and misery so that they have to commit suicide in horrible isolating ways. Do it on a case by case basis even if itâ€™s lengthy. Fuck this culture. Why are the people making these decisions not being consulted on cases where peopleâ€™s mental illnesses are not reversible. Itâ€™s almost like they are only listening to what they want to hear and ignoring other things??
