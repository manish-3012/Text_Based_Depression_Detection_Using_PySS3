Canâ€™t do anything rightRecently my mother had medical emergency that makes her pretty much disabled.Im basically her full time care taker I cook for her, empty her potty, wipe her poop, and do her laundry.Recently sheâ€™s been making statements that basically makes it seem like I want her to die or that I donâ€™t care about her.Which is far from the truth because  I love my mom.Her words are vulgar and they hurt me really bad to the point where I cry. I have thought about suicide multiple times.Im beyond depressed because itâ€™s my freshman year of college and I have no friends and Iâ€™m not doing so well academically on top of that Im flat broke. I understand that my mom is going through a lot I just wished she would see my of things and understand that I have a lot of stress too.Thanks for listening.
