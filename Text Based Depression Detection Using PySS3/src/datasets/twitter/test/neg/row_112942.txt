What do i do now?I've been telling myself for over 4 years now "It gets better", but that's not cutting it anymore. It's not getting better, it's only getting worse. I don't know how much longer i can last, i'm really on the breaking point. What do i do? I don't know how the actual fuck i'm going to last another day.
