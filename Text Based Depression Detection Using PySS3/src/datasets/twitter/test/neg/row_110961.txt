I'm desperate and don't really see a point of continuing anymore.I know how this is gonna sound but my boyfriend of 2 years just dumped me out of the blue and I'm so lost. He is asking for a break from me for just a few days but he also wants to be single. We have arguments often and I have threatened to leave a few times but god I never really ever wanted to leave. I've been depressed and on edge about things for a very long time. I have depression and anxiety to the point my own mind makes up things just to be upset or mad about and I feel so stupid for not putting my fears to the side and just being there for him like I want to be so badly right now. We have, or..had, a house together and a dog of over a year and a kitten of only a week. We have so many shows to continue watching together and so many important things as well that we had planned.
He's been working with a new girl who's a lot like me but she's in a relationship and older than him but I've still been really paranoid about him around her because she's everything he could want. He kicked me out of our home the other night over an argument while telling everyone at work that he's single now and they all had a party while him and I were trying to stay sober so I could get a job. He volunteered, I didn't force him, but we only had maybe a week or two left before I would have a job and he could smoke again. He says he likes this new girl now and whenever I asked more questions regarding her he would avoid saying anything. I begged for my place in his life back and he changed his mind from having a break for a few days to a week now and he made me give him my key and everything. Everyone just wants to tell me we can't get over this and it's a lost cause. My own mom says that I'm just gonna be his side piece now and while I'm gone this week he will be fucking her and the thought of it alltogther kills me so deeply. I haven't been the greatest partner lately but I didn't see this coming at all.. He's my whole world and I always feared the day we wouldn't be together anymore just because our lives are so intertwined. His house is right across the street from my grandma's, which is okay I guess because i can check for her car.. But I want to make him see me again. Not for my depression but for the person he fell in love with.. I just don't know what to do.
