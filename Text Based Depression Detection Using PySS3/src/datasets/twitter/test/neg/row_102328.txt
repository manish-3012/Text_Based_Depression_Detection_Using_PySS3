My friend wants to kill herselfShe'a texting me about how she's super depressed and she doesn't care about anything, and like how the tv remote was sitting on her lap and she didn't change the channel because picking it up would be too much effort. She just texted me about how she wants to "just get the fuck out of here". What do I say? What do I do?
