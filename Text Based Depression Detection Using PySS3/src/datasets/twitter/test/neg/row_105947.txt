I really really want to end it all somehowHello. My name is Benji, Iâ€™m 15 turning 16 in a month or so. I have this incredible urge to end it all, Iâ€™ve just been super uninterested in my passions lately, and kinda depressed. The main thing is, I suffer from severe anxiety, I canâ€™t stop getting the feeling that my boyfriend doesnâ€™t love me like I love him. I try to make sure that he does and I constantly say how much I appreciate him but when I say it too much it annoys him. He assures me that my paranoias are untrue but I Just really feel inside that he wishes he werenâ€™t with me. We been dating on and off since mid last year, and only for the past month weâ€™ve officially been together but I love him so so so much, probably because weâ€™ve known eachother for much longer. I donâ€™t know what to do. It just feels so satisfying to somehow choke myself. As I type this out, maybe itâ€™s not such a good idea. But idk what to do. Another factor is that Iâ€™m very vocally anti racist on Twitter, this is a stance that I love having and I still feel the need to post against the oppression of black people but on this side of Twitter, so much I hear â€œMayo monkeysâ€ â€œI hate all white peopleâ€ and even though it is supposedly a joke it really hurts me and makes me want to end it all. Please read all this, idk what Iâ€™m even posting this here for, idk what Iâ€™m hoping to get. I desperately hope nobody in my real life finds out Iâ€™m feeling this way.
