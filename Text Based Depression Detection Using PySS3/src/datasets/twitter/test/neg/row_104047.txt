I donâ€™t have any reason to stick aroundWhenever I get like this and itâ€™s usually over stupid stuff I obviously try to talk myself out of it because I havenâ€™t been in therapy for 8 years or stopped self harming without developing the knee jerk reaction of telling myself Iâ€™m a fucking idiot and to not be such a self centred pile of shit when I want to die


But when it comes down to it I donâ€™t have anything to live for or look forward to. 


I canâ€™t leave my pets but theyâ€™re mostly rats and they donâ€™t live very long anyway. At most it delays me a couple years. My puppy would be ok with a different home, my mum can look after my cat. I have no friends. I have no future. Why do I stay when there is nothing to look forward to. Whatâ€™s the point in living if itâ€™s shit


Eveb if I got better Iâ€™d still have to deal with my anxiety forever, Iâ€™d still have to relearn how to be a fucking human Iâ€™d still have to do so many things to get me to be a useful part of society that would be so fucking difficult emotionally to get to that even when Iâ€™m not feeling really bad it doesnâ€™t seem worth it.


Like, I get better and get a job that I may or may not enjoy so I can barely scrape by until I die naturally and alone anyway? Why? What about that is something I should want to do. Whatâ€™s the point of that. 



I donâ€™t see myself having a nice future and that makes it so hard in times when Iâ€™m feeling like ass to pull through it to get back to my normal baseline of being apathetic towards my existence


And I will. I always do. But life is still bullshit and not worth it. I just wish I never existed in the first place.
