I attempted a suicide about 20 minutes ago and I failedI tried to hang myself. The tie wasn't done correctly, it came open, and I just didn't have energy to retry. I don't know what to do. I almost made an attempt only five days ago, when the only things that stopped me were that 1. The razor wouldn't cut through my skin, no matter what and 2. I was in my room and the rope was in living room, where I couldn't have taken it from without raising suspicions.

Everything has gotten so much worse. I used to have a group of very close friends, but over the last few weeks, I've lost them all due to my own lashing outs. Today, the last one blocked me on social media site we used for communicating due to an argument we had, where I ended it with basically saying that I'm tired of arguing with her. 

I feel like I'm nothing but a burden. Losing my last close friend ruined even the fact that I had won an archery competition. I don't know what to do. I'm selfish, disgusting human being. It feels as if the only way to make it feel better is self harming, sometimes while listening to music. I keep having suicidal thoughts, but I always get scared just before an attempt. I don't know how many attempts I have altogether, everything mostly seems like just a blur that melts together. My mom was right five days ago when she told me that everyone will get tired of me. I don't deserve to live. I hate myself. I keep having anger fits that I can barely control at best and being a selfish piece of shit who can't feel empathy towards others. I don't know what to do. I want to die, but I'm also scared. Help.
