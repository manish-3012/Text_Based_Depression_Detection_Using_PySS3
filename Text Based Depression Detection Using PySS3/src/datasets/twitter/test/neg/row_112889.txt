I feel like a failure bc all my friends are graduating college next yearAnd I took off a year from school due to sickness and depression and corona. 
Iâ€™m 21 and I have no major I want to do or any goals or ambitions 
I think of dying every day 
I feel like a failure because I used to be a good student but academic pressure and bullying made me depressed and suicidal
I stopped studying and caring about school
Then I experienced PTSD and it makes me more suicidal
And I still struggle with a disease every day 
I also have acne and skin problems and gender dsyphoria
