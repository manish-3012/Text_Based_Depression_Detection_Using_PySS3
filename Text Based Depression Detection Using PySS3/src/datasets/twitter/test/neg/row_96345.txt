The world is cruel.I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I look like a different person on the outside, and it's hard for me to keep up with the world. I know that no one wants me to exist, because I've had people tell me they hate me. I'm at the point where I feel like people will appreciate me more when I'm gone.
