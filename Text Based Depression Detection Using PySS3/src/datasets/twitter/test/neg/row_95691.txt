My friend got engaged, and all I can think about is how much I want to die/kill myselfWe're just platonic friends. I don't feel anything romantic/sexual for her.

I think it's more that I just don't foresee anything like that happening in my life ever. I have only ever had one boyfriend (I'm 27) and have not been on a date or had anything that might lead to that in 5 years.

I know part of this is that I forgot to take my meds this morning. (I thought I had and didn't want to double dose, but these feelings are indicating that I didn't.) But that doesn't help me now, as I'm at work, away from my meds. 

Work is going OK when there's actually work to do. But my job involves a lot of downtime, which means more time to think. Ugh. 

I don't think I'm actually going to do anything, but I just wanted to let these thoughts out. 

Alt because some irl people know my main username.

Edit to add: it doesn't help that no one is responding to me on the social subreddit I frequent on my main. Not that I have posted anything quite this drastic, but still. I feel alone.
