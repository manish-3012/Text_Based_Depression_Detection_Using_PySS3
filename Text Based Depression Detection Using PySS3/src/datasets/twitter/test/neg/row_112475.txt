I hate everything about myselfIâ€™m 14f and Iâ€™ve already been to 2 mental hospitals in the past 8 months due to suicide attempts. See, my long distance boyfriend has gone back to school (his starts way earlier then mine) and itâ€™s really been affecting me since Iâ€™m so used to spending all day with him. Not to mention his ex that he shares a class with asked him if he was still dating me while referring to me as a bitch. To give some context early on in the relationship I was being an idiot and dmed her kinda trying to befriend her but obviously failed so I left her alone. Then she said I was annoying, and since 5th grade, all my closest friends have ended up bullying me and saying shit like that, it triggered something in me. Basically I started crying like a maniac when I was home alone and bit myself a couple times to avoid cutting. Everyone hates me, Iâ€™m annoying, toxic, ugly, and downright unpleasant to be around. Frankly, I just want to die but I have absolutely no energy to attempt. I want to sleep and never wake up. I want to change my personality, my breasts, my butt, my hair, my jaw, my teeth, my forehead, my facial symmetry. I want so many things about me to change that if I listed them all, It would look like a tragic poetry book about self hatred in teenage girls. Iâ€™m tired of hearing it will get better when Iâ€™m older, people think that fucking helps but I want a fix now. I donâ€™t want to wait 20 fucking years to actually feel somewhat comfortable in my own skin. Iâ€™m sorry if this post was ranty and didnâ€™t make any sense I just need to get this off my chest.
