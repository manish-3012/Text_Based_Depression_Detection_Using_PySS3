My best friend punches me and i will do nothing about itThere is my friend who insults me and hits me in the face. He's always laughing about me. But i won't do anything about it, i'm scared of losing him because he is the only person that doesn't see me as invisible. I started hitting myself and having the thoughts. My family doesn't care about me and i just want everything to be over. My life is a mess and i can't do something
