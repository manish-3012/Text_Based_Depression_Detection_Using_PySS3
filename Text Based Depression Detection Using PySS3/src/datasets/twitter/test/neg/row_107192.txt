The older I get the more likely it feels that Iâ€™ll take my own lifeEver since I was a kid Iâ€™ve obsessed over the idea of suicide and always just daydreamed about doing it in many different ways. As a teen I thought I would kill myself in my 20s, Iâ€™m almost 30 now and although I clearly havenâ€™t done it it seems less drastic and extreme as I get older. The desire for self destruction has always been there and it always will be. My biggest fantasy is to just disappear without a trace, I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, I guess for now I have to wait at least until my pets are gone so they donâ€™t have to be taken in by strangers. I just really want to violently rip myself apart. I am nothing. I am incompatible with society. Iâ€™m a burden to the taxpayer. I look at my items Iâ€™ve accumulated and almost cringe that I exist, Iâ€™m sure that probably doesnâ€™t make much sense but my hats that are hung up in front of me, I see them as items that belong to someone worthless, I see this in all my stuff. I shouldnâ€™t be here. Why am I here? I hope something happens that will just instantly and painlessly take me away or even better remove me from life so itâ€™s as if I never existed, like a stain remover. Iâ€™m just pointless. Iâ€™m a shitty person. I have no skills or talents, no desire to fit in with society at all anymore, Iâ€™ve basically all but given up my art and music. What is the point. All this on top of that primal omnipresent urge to destroy myself... It really feels like my entire life is me talking myself into it and itâ€™s inevitable. I guess this is to just get my thoughts out, Iâ€™m not planning on doing it any time soon although Iâ€™ve been playing with the idea of planning something for my birthday this year on New Yearâ€™s Eve, but Iâ€™m not sure in serious or just testing/preparing myself like I have in the past. Sorry for the formatting I really donâ€™t care right now. There we go though. Thatâ€™s it.
