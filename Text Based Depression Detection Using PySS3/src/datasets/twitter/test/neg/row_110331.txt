Stuck in unhappiness and worthlessnessI am a bad person. I wish I would die in my sleep. I wish anyone who has ever cared for me realizes that I am just going to drag them down with my lies hiding my distaste for life or the suicidal feelings themselves. Actually "fixing" it takes an eternity and anyone who tries for that long is wasting their time on a worthless cause.  I will never escape, I will only feel worthless and unhappy or feeling nothing. My life doesn't have a happy ending. It is the result of the entropy of happiness. Every day I will still taste happiness, but a sliver compared to the day before it and an invisible speck compared to two days before. Is living really worth it? I am probably not going to die right now, but I am going to sleep soon and hopefully die and get replaced with someone worth other people's time and care.
