I just can't stop and I don't know whyI've just turned 29 about a month ago, and my wife turned 31 today. Our son is 2. I have no access to any of my money because all I do is compulsively spend it before it goes to bills. My wife and I just bought a house, and we had to get the help of her parents because we just can't seem to be able to get a handle on our money. We bring in a decent amount in income, and our expenses are quite low - on paper, that is. I know why - because every single chance i get, i go out and buy some meaningless bullshit. It isn't even on permanent things, like clothes or video games or something; it's on food and drink - specifically energy drinks. It used to be codeine but that's not the case anymore simply because it was too hard to lie about. I can spin bullshit about where $3 went, or I can at least hide it in a larger purchase (e.g. get sundries from the supermarket for ~$20, and slip the drink in there without bringing home the receipt). The good thing is that she knows that this is a hole for this sort of shit, and tries to prevent it as much as possible. But I find other ways - i'll steal her card and use a different account, putting the card back without her knowing. She has told me time and time again that she absolutely *will not* stick around with some thieving liar, and i know subjectively that she should leave me. If I was just her friend, and she was telling me this, i'd tell her to go. There's a big part of me, though, that subconsciously must think "she won't leave, she's not going anywhere". This is the same part of me that feels the compulsion to take money or cards, or buy that extra energy drink. I hate that part of me. Like, proper hate. I *fucking despise* myself, because this is the major part of me. The smaller part that knows everything I do is wrong, he is too weak to contribute. He is equally worthless because he isn't pulling his weight. So this dominant part of me has got to go. If I have to go with it, then so be it.

It might be worth noting that i'm on a variety of medications, one of which is ritalin. The anti-depressants etc have made a world of difference, but basically they just took me from a furious rage machine to something more docile. The ritalin is such a life saver at this point, because i can resist being a gigantic piece of garbage when i've taken my ritalin. Thing is, this lasts, like, 2 hours. 3 tops. Then I have to redose. I've taken over 60mg over the course of a whole day since I got my last prescription filled, which was a week ago, and now i have like 7 tablets left out of 60. I'm meant to take 2 per day, thereby making the 60 last a whole month, but now im almost all out. This is just making me feel worse, though - for two reasons: I can't just hold off and follow my psychiatrists fucking instructions properly, and that even if i were to somehow drop down to 1 tablet a day (this would be a fucking miraculous transformation) then i've only got a weeks worth of medication left, and i don't see my psychiatrist until the 19th oct, thus a minimum of 9 days of useless me.

I've had enough. I'm tired of betraying everyone around me. I know someone (if this post doesn't get buried) will probably say something about my wife or son, but what the fuck kind of life is that? I'm a father and i'm essentially taking food off my son's plate just so that i can have a fizzy drink. I'm sick of this shit, and I really don't see the point in going on.

I don't know how to close one of these off. I hope i've given enough information, but i'm probably going to wait until my wife goes to sleep and then take care of this gigantic waste of a human being.
