I need helpI quit heroin recently and Iâ€™d rather die than go back to it, but ever since I quit Iâ€™ve been anxious ever second of every day, and I get hit with these times when I feel so lost that all I can think about it killing myself. My life was looking pretty decent before I quit, I have all sorts of connections in the drug buisness because I used to be a dealer so the dope was never expensive, and I spent so much time numb that I forgot why I even started in the first place. Right before I quit I managed to get a girl that had her shit together and I started making lots more meaningful connections with friends. However, I wasnâ€™t really going anywhere with my life. Iâ€™m 17 and live with my parents right now and Iâ€™ve never got a legitamate legal job, and my parents arnâ€™t going to let me live under their roof forever. So in an effort to better myself, I went out and joined the army, and got one of the most exclusive contracts there is that would set me up for life. Iâ€™m scheduled to ship out in 37 days to become an army diver. I seriously canâ€™t think of any other job I would want besides that. The dilema was that I had to quit doing drugs because they drug test, so in an effort to get an early start I dumped about $300 worth of heroin and other opiates down the toilet. Ever since then its just been a downward spiral. I canâ€™t control my emotions, and every night I just want to end it all. Iâ€™m on edge all the time because Iâ€™m not ready to let go of everyone back at home, but I know I have to take this opprotunity. This will not only give me a job I love for the next 5 years, but it will set me up for a commercial diving carrear for life, if I can survive the next 37 days without doing anything stupid. When Iâ€™m laying in bed at night feeling like I have no chance at being happy, I know that if I were to call my girlfriend she would know exactly what to say, and she would just help it all go away, but Iâ€™m too scared. I havnâ€™t asked for help like that in years, and I donâ€™t want to dump all my shit on her and strain tf out of the relationship, but at the same time I feel like I need to bring it up or else this is gonna be the thing that causes me either to relapse or self harm or end it. What do I do? Should I ask her for help, and if so how tf do I go about that without destroying the relationship and making myself look like a needy bitch?
