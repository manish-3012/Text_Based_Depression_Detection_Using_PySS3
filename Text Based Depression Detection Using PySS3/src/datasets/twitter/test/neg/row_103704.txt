I feel invisibleIt was my birthday the other week and I am not a big birthday person. I don't have it on social media etc. But not even my closest friends, some I've known for more than 13 years, remembered my birthday other than one person and my immediate family. Am I selfish for thinking they should remember? Or is it okay to be upset? I can name more than a dozen of my friends birthdays and I often send cards and so on. But am I being selfish?

It got me thinking back to a couple of years ago when I tried to hurt myself and I didn't want to tell anyone because I thought that everyone has their own problems. People say that those who self-harm are attention seeking and everyone now gets tainted with that brush. So I didn't want to give the wrong impression because I guess I care what people think. But I did it because it made me feel a sense of calm and relief in a strange way that nothing else did. 

I often think I could take my own life but I just could never follow through. I also think that very few people would actually notice. Do you ever feel you're there for other people but they are never there for you? I always feel like a friend but never the best friend, you know? Sorry to ramble. 

Can anyone tell me, does this come across as someone with a selfish mindset?
