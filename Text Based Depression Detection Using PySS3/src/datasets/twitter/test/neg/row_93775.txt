every single night i think about killing myselfeveryday i wish i was dead but i told myself iâ€™d never hurt myself intentionally and i would just rather die from something out my control like a drunk driver or some kind of freak accident. lately i have these intrusive thoughts and think about intentionally dying. i used to be good at recognizing them and stop them but honestly whatâ€™s the point anymore. thereâ€™s absolutely nothing to look forward to anymore and i donâ€™t care how my death will effect others. thereâ€™s nothing holding me back anymore. iâ€™ve had several different plans for a few years and theyâ€™re all spiraling in my brain nonstop. it doesnâ€™t matter how happy i feel, it will always be on the back of my mind. i feel so dissociated that the only things that really stand out to me is the ways in which i could kill myself. i have all the tools, i just donâ€™t know what iâ€™m so afraid of. i genuinely donâ€™t know why iâ€™m still alive. i have the power to shoot myself in the head at any time or overdose on a bunch of random pills i have but i never do it.  sometimes i even wish to hang myself with a rope in my garage or get carbon monoxide poisoning from leaving my car running (even though i donâ€™t truly understand the process). i just want it to be over, theres nothing left for me anymore. iâ€™m just used to the thought of killing myself that it doesnâ€™t even upset anymore. nothing left to consider anymore, just wasnâ€™t made for this life. nothing stopping me. iâ€™ll try again if i have to. thereâ€™s no point to fix something thatâ€™s already severely damaged
