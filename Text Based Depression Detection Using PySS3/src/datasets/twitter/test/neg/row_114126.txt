i tried and i can't try again16f- I attempted suicide on the 29th of May. I overdosed on my medication. This was my third or fourth attempt, i'm not sure. It's been a little over a month and I've had ups and downs but I've felt empty inside the whole time. 2 days after my attempt i gave my final exams for the 11th grade, I failed chemistry and did badly in everything else. I won't get into any colleges next year. I desperately, desperately don't want to be here. I won't attempt again because I can't do that to my mother. But I can barely function. I have been in a daze of sleeping and waking for 24 hours. I finally got up now because i have tutions for the next 4 hours. I know it sounds like i'm faking and not that depressed but i need help. i want to go to an inpatient treatment facility but i can't because i live in India and there aren't any good ones here. most hospitals don't have programs like this. I need to be somewhere else i feel terrible and i needed to get it out. my sister (21f) also has depression and i feel terrible for being this way because she's as sad as me but I don't know i want to leave i just i feel terrible and i want to leave i'm sorry
