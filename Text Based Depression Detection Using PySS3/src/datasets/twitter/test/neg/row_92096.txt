Thinking about sending a message.My life is a mixed bag. I have good things and bad things happening in my life, but the bad things have taken over more and more. The only human beings that seem to truly support me are my mother and girlfriend. I have problems with them too though. I'm a piece of shit. My paranoia and jealousy keep making me think my girlfriend will smarten up and leave me, despite the fact that she's loyal if nothing else. My mom might see me differently if I tell her what's really going on with my external life. I wanted to visit her but my father ripped it away from me. I'm failing school badly and I can't bring myself to catch up. I'm hopeless. My obesity puts me four months away from a surgery that I really don't want to have. And I've been showing signs of depression. My doctor offered me to see a therapist, and I agreed. But my father has tiptoed around it, I haven't seen a therapist. Everyone in my family treats me like I'm some sort of genius, destined for greatness. If only they knew the real me, what is truly going on. It's not unfounded either. I know I'm intelligent. I just don't have the tools to show it in school. My dad hates me for it. Every time I've spoken to him for the past few months, it has been nothing but verbal beatings, and reminders that I'm sub par. I don't know what's going on in his head. I don't know if he knows how impactful his words are to me. I don't know if he knows how serious I'm taking everything. I'm to blame as well. I'm a compulsive liar, I have no drive for some reason, and I'm a serious burden to be around. I don't think people around me fully understand my feelings. Maybe they'll understand if I end it.
