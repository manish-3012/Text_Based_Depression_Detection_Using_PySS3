Iâ€™ve accepted itIâ€™ve had thoughts about suicide since I was about 11 years old, Iâ€™m 24 now and have really been thru too much to handle for my mental health. My dad died, my mom abandoned me 2 months after and I bounced around different family member homes with the feeling of Iâ€™m not good enough because no one wanted to keep me. Iâ€™ve gone thru a lot and dealt with a lot of death and have always contemplated suicide but could never think of a way to actually go through with it.. until today. Iâ€™ve lost all hope completely, a girl who told me she loved me and wanted to be with me forever/I was her soul mate told me today she wasnâ€™t sure if she meant it. Iâ€™m so sick of the feeling of being alone and that no one actually cares for me. After many failed relationships and my own mother abandoning me Iâ€™ve convinced myself that Iâ€™m unlovable and Iâ€™ll be alone forever. I canâ€™t do that. I decided today that Iâ€™m gonna buy a gun this week, work my last shift on Friday, enjoy time with friends this weekend and on Sunday June 23rd Iâ€™m going to take myself to a peaceful place, get some drugs, drink and finally shoot myself in the head to finally end the pain. I canâ€™t handle anymore pain. Itâ€™s been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember and Iâ€™m past my breaking point. Thanks for giving me a place to put my thoughts of this into existence. I hope I can go thru with it
