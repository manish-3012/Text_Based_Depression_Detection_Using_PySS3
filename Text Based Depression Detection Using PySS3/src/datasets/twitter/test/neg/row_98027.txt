I tried to commit again last nightI was having severe suicidal thoughts all day yesterday, and then last night I just wanted them to end so I tried commiting suicide again. I felt that if I did all the pain I felt would go away, but I couldn't do it as  much as I wanted to. I want to die, but I know it will hurt a lot of people if I go, at least I think it will. After I tried I ended up crying for 3 hours straight, not knowing what I should do. The thoughts get worse every day but I can't tell anyone I care about that because I don't want them to worry about me, so when they ask I just say I'm fine.
