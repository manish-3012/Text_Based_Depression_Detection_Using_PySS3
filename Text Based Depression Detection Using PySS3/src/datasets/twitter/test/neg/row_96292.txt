Loosing all hopeSoo Iâ€™m beyond stressed. My husband and I were in quarantine for three months, then I went back to work for two weeks, and got covid. Heâ€™s been on unemployment and I got a measly paycheck but we have a little savings goingâ€™s and since I havenâ€™t been back to work because Iâ€™ve been sick, weâ€™ve lost so much money..Iâ€™m panicking and Iâ€™ve been so stressed that my hair is falling out, Iâ€™ve been having intense nightmares, insane heartburn, Iâ€™ve fainted twice this week and honestly.. the thought about ending it all, just wonâ€™t stop. It would be so much easier if I just stopped living.. not for anyone around me but for myself. I know it would break my husbands heart and our families hearts but I just donâ€™t know how to handle this much stress, panic, worry and pain. Something horrible happens everyday and shit just keeps adding up..we can move out of my mothers house because we donâ€™t have a dependable income, I canâ€™t work because Iâ€™m sick, he is searching for a job but everything in our state is shut down..plus my car took a shit so I need to get a new one and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna begin to afford it. Iâ€™m mentally done and emotionally so exhausted I canâ€™t see straight. A bunch of my friends told me to start a go fund me but I feel so selfish doing that. I know we arenâ€™t the only ones hurting right now. But maybe I should? I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. All Iâ€™ve been able to do is cry and sit in bed, while trying to keep from relapsing into self harm again. Iâ€™m trying.. Iâ€™m really trying because I love my husband so much and I donâ€™t want to hurt him but I need help..I need a miracle and a I need a way out of this deep hole Iâ€™m in.
