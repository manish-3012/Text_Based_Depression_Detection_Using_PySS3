Self loating, inner void, no friends and the pressure is unbearableI turned 21 last month and just got one birthday wish from one of my coworkers. People would assume that I'm happy and that I'm doing fine but I'm really not. The pressure is unbearable I fight everyday it feels like life keeps on pulling me from each side. I struggle financially and mentally and I'm so tired of carrying all the weight on my shoulder like a "man" I just wanna break down and cry till I pass out. I'm not suicidal i dont think about killing myself every night but I got nothing to live for. My mom lived her life trying to provide me with the life that she never had and it FUCKING KILLS ME to see her struggle till this day. Sometimes i wish she would just die so that i could blow my head off and finally get the rest that we deserve.
