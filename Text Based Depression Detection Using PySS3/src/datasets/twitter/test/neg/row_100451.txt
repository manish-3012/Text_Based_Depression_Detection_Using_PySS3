I want help and I need a break from things.I'm in highschool and suicide is a daily thought. I really want help and I want to get better, but I can't come through and tell my mom how I feel. I get so anxious thinking about telling someone that I actually feel scared and get emotional. Whenever I think about telling my mom I end up crying in my room and I when my mom asks me why I'm crying I have no response. I'm diabetic so I thought if I gave myself enough insulin I'd be gone overnight, but I just woke up feeling terrible. This has been going on for years.
EDIT, because I feel it's important: I've never been to a therapist or anything of the sort.
