Another dayUnemployed (lost a job I loved in March) and home alone since then, living off a very meager employment insurance. Boyfriend is off to a work contract across the country next week, and I sincerely want to build up my life again, but nothing seems to be working out.
I've applied at almost two dozen places for work, with only one call back that didn't go very well because of my anxiety. I've been through counselling and it's beyond both my financial capability and my ability to sucessfully leave the house to get to appointments.
I feel so worthless.
