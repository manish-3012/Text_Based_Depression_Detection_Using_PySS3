Set a dateI set a date for September of next year. If Iâ€™m not where I want to be romantically or emotionally, Iâ€™m going through with it. Iâ€™m at an age where all of my friends are starting families and donâ€™t have time for me and all of my romantic prospects end up negatively blowing up in my face. Iâ€™m tired of being lonely, and if Iâ€™m going to be that way for the rest of my life I might as well end my life early.
