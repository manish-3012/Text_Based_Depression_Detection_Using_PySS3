I think i'm finally doneI'm 24 and I just really feel like I've had enough. I've been having some serious money trouble for a bit now and since the beginning of September i've been living out of a coworking space. Unable to find a permanent residence when i had the money and now i can't even afford my monthly fee for the space.

I've been trading cryptocurrency and living off the profits only withdrawing when i needed it to eat and what not. It wasn't that much to start with and now it's only dwindled further. I'm estranged from my family, and i don't have the energy to keep fighting anymore.

I have terrible anxiety and i can't take the constant discomfort anymore. I'm broke, homeless, and now even out of clean clothes. I've been wearing the same t shirt/hoodie for over 2 weeks now and i feel like a complete dirtbag.

I've always kept myself going by telling myself that i can always end it if it gets worse... just push a little harder. I just don't think i can anymore. I'm not really sure why i'm posting here, i guess i just want to tell someone but i don't want to put the weight of this information on anyone who i know in person.
