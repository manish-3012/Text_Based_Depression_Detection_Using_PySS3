It's like a light switch, isn't it?One minute I'm enjoying something, laughing at jokes or a video....and the next I have very violent explicit thoughts (only toward myself). I want to bash my fucking head in. I want to break each finger on my hand. I want to run myself through something sharp. Then for no reason at all, I can push those thoughts into the back of my mind again and laugh and pretend nothing ever crossed my mind. I wonder if I really am just crazy.

tldr; I flip-flop between wanting to violently hurt myself and pretending everything is okay
