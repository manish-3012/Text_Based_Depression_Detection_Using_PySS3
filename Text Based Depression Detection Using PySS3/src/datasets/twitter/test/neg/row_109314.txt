Bad turn. 2 AM tearing my room apart. I fucked up. It's unrepairable. I don't know why it hit me like this. I'm so fucking scared.I'm in tears and can't think straight. i hate these thoughts. i always think myself stronger, but the more the thoughts come, the more i think i don't know what i'm capable of. I just wish someone would understand. i wish i knew why it has to come out of nowhere. Why do i hear in my head that i'm the one that fucked it all up. i can't stop thinking. A huge black spiral and i keep spinning and spinning. The wire in my head. The pounding in my chest. The grinding in my gut. It starts, and i usually shrug these thoughts off and move on, but recently within the past month. it plays like a broken record. i can't think like this. it scares me.
