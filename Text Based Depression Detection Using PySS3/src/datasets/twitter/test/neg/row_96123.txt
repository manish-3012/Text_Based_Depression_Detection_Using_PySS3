Can someone suggest an online suicide help site that isn't US only ?I am feeling so bad. So I decided to try the Lifeline Chat that is I think the official Suicide Preventation Line. But it is US only. And there isn't any online depression help in my country. So if you know one, I would appriciate it if you told me.
