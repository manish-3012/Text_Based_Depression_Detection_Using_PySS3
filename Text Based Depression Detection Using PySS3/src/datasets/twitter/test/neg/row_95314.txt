Everything's gone wrong in the past monthI'd consider myself a relatively average person; 20 year old white male college student starting his 3rd year in college pretty soon. This past month or so, it feels as though my foundation was pulled out from under me. I'm living with my parents, as student loans are bad enough without having to also stack on dorm costs, and I recently learned that my father has been cheating on my mother for the past year+. On-top of that, they both lost their jobs about 2 months ago, and are applying almost constantly, but no luck so far. In the mean-time, my father's been out of the house for weeks at a time, "visiting friends/family", and my mother obviously knows what's going on. We're currently financially dependent on my father for paying the rent, mainly from his brother/my uncle, though I don't want to go into too much detail with that. Basically it adds up to not knowing whether I'll even have a roof above my head in the coming months.


Roughly 3 weeks ago, my girlfriend of almost 3 years ended it between us. Our relationship had been rocky for a few months, and we nearly broke up a few times before-hand, mainly because she was figuring things out in her life. Being a week from my birthday and a month before our 3rd anniversary, getting a refund on the gift I had bought for her in preparation sucked. On-top of that, I recently texted her asking if she'd be willing to meet and talk sometime, and got a cold "I have nothing more to say to you", even though our actual "break-up" was over a 5 minute skype IM conversation. I'm left wondering a lot of things, even if I have to remind myself constantly that there's no chance of us ending up back together. I have no one to really turn to, to vent, as I did the classic bad relationship of alienating friends by having your life revolve around your SO. 


To top it off, yesterday I got a letter from the college I was transferring to, stating I was denied the transfer. After calling them up apparently they changed some of the requirements, so I'll have to go back to the college I was attending last year for 2 classes, paying it all out of pocket and basically zeroing out my account. This is coupled with the fact that I feel as though I've lost my passion for my hobby(gaming) and my major(computer game design).


All-in-all, I've been trying to keep myself occupied by reading, working out, gaming, and browsing reddit. Even with that though, the thought of how easy it'd be to walk up to the roof of my apartment at any time and jump from the 10 story height keeps popping into my mind. I stay up late at night trying to fall asleep, just thinking about everything, and wondering why I haven't given in yet and taken the easy way out.

Sorry for the long read.
