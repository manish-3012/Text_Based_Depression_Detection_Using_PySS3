I find it so annoying that I wake up every morning wanting to die and go to bed each night crying, fantasizing over death but when I do reach out for help it tends to get ignored or my plight is faked because I force myself to be half functional around people or throughout the day. I'm a wreck.There hasn't been a day in the last 8ish months I have not wanted to be dead but my friends never offer help because I seem fine. It's because I hide it. Really well. But sometimes I can't take anymore.
