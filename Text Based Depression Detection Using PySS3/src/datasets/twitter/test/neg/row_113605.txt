I have been thinking about calling it quitsI am 22 and was born with a condition called NF Type 1, essentially this causes me to have spots and bumps all over my body and face. Having said that, this condition has socially handi-capped me. I have never had a girlfriend due to my condition no matter how hard I try I get shot down. Furthermore this issue is progressive and my future is basically unknown, I just don't feel like doing it anymore. As I type this I'm looking at my balcony and wondering if now is just the right time.
