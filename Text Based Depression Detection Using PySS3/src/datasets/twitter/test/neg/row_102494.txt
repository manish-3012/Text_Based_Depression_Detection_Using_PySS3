My teacher rold me that he couldn't believe that i had problems because i am always helping others and happyI was very overdue at some important papers to school, so a wrote to the school counseling about my struggles and thoughts.( the message was shared to everyone in school and my parents)
Later I had an oral exam for French and it had to be done in person( we a have online lessons) and my teacher was like how are you? And I was like I  find ( I just want to get back home and not talk to people).
And he was like I am really sorry to hear about your mental health problems, it was hard to believe about it, all the teachers were like where did this come from, because you always seem so happy, and helping others with their problems around the school. 
We even noticed that you are the only one that talks to the foundation students.
And I was like I don't really talk about me when I talk to people, I let them talk about their problems and they just get lost on their little world that I don't have to really say anything about myself.
And if I present myself as sad around people they will try to help me, or give me their fake empathy and that is kinda my role.
Then we just started the exam
