Can't continueThis may seem self centred, but I really do think I need to killl myself. I'm at university, i am constantly panicky and anxious all the time. My dog died  about two months ago and I'm still feeling the grief now. I have a lot of medical conditions also and feel like  there is no point in suffering anymore. I just dont see the point in living anymore
