Shaken UpThis is a bit of a train wreck.

My town was the epicenter of a 6.4 and 7.1 earthquake. Homes were destroyed by gas fires, floods, and the earthquake. People lost power, water, and food. Our movie theater was destroyed. Weâ€™re still dealing with the aftershocks, which has everyone on edge.

My family and I were the lucky ones. Our house is still standing, and we got our power back the same day we lost it.

But so much has changed in so little time, Iâ€™ve been living in a daze since July 4th. Itâ€™s all disappeared from the news, but nobody in my town has forgotten or let go of what happened, because we have no choice.

Weâ€™re a bubble of anxiety, and I have no control over whatâ€™s happening.

Before all of this started, I was in one of the biggest lows Iâ€™ve ever had, but everythingâ€™s become so alien, this all feels like a fever dream. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m in a low anymore, because itâ€™s like Iâ€™m not here at all. 

We were used for advertising and jokes, and then - everybody moved on. What am I still upset for? It happened, and I should be getting over it, but I canâ€™t find a way to hook myself back into the real world. Iâ€™m a bout of getting upset over the littlest things, stress, and anger.

Before all this went down, I had plans to pull myself out of the hole I dug for myself, but the exit disappeared entirely. Thereâ€™s nowhere to run, and no escape.

Iâ€™m still questioning how the days are still going by, when Iâ€™m still stuck in July 4th. How do I wake up?

I donâ€™t even know if I want to wake up at all. I just want this dream to end.

Why do I want to disappear completely?
