I've been told to kill myself, should I just do it ?So I'm being under attacked online cause of something that I did. I have a group of haters from this photography community and they were trying to meet up with my best friend. I didn't want them to meet up with him and so I lied to my best friend and said that the guy named Jim who was wanting to meet him got one of our other mutual friends fired and arrested. My best friend believed me and deleted everyone else from the community off of his facebook and is going to stop uploading pics and videos to youtube saying he doesn't want to associate with others in the community. I felt guilty and depressed cause he called me today, crying. I decided to reach online for help and people bashed me and called me a terrible person, an inconsiderate selfish liar. Some people even told me to just kill myself. Should I just do it ???
