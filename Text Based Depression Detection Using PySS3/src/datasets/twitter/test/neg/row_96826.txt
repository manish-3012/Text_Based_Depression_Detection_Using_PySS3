I've been dealing with a lot problem in past years of my childhood and the present years.Ever since I was little, My father died when I was 2 years old, when I was at elementary school I've been bullied a lot for my speech disorder and for my weight, I've to repeat the kindergarten for my speech disorder and Failed the 3rd grade, then middle school I've developed anxiety I never talk to anyone because of my speech disorder, I've never had any friends until my high school year it's been great until my step-father died when I was 17, that's when I was feeling depressed, I couldn't sleep thinking about how much shit I've been through. Now I'm 21, I haven't done anything of my life with my anxiety and depression. I can't get into a relationship maybe I'm not that interested or not attractive. I couldn't trust people now since they only want to use me. I've had it throughout my life, I keep thinking negative stupid thoughts to myself like "kill myself" or "run away". people keep telling "think positive" that shit doesn't work though is like putting your happy mask and forgot all of it.
