Fucking debtI fucked up university in UK as an abroad student and now I came back with a shit ton of debt. My job isn't satisfactory for SLC, since it's zero-hour contract and I'm getting paid by the hour, s they cannot calculate my monthly repayments. They are going to charge me a fuck ton of money soon and with that, I won't be able to survive.

I don't know what to do, they just demand more evidence that I work, even though I fucking do. I sent them my information, everything that I had on me yet it's still not enough for those fuckers. 

For my country that payment would be Â£80.40 per month, which is like 1/4 of my current salary. I can't change my job, I've been here for like a month. 

 I have Â£4550 debt and I'm thinking of ending it all, since I cannot live like this. It will take ages to fucking pay up.

I have no future, this is it. I'm so fucking scared. Why did I have to come to UK...? Why did I take that loan...? I regret every fiber of my existence right now.
