im sorry!! It feels like it'll never get betterive been trying to find things to look forward to but after a day they start to lose meaning and i don't care if I'll be alive to expierience it or not. it's so hard like so so hard for me to get up and go to school or get up and take a shower and therapy isnt helping me. I feel like my therapist hates me and my family only likes me when I have something to offer. I feel so disgusted with myself because of sexual trauma and it feels like I'll never be at peace with myself. I feel so so ugly and undesirable I just want to cut,, I genuinely just don't want to live anymore it's so so painful and sleeping doesn't help anymore :( I don't have enough motivation to watch a tv show i love. Everything feels so pointless, I hate clinging to and waiting for every almost fun advent, nothing makes me happy anymore :( i just want to cut and cry but I just feel so tense and it feels like dying would be the only thing that sets me free. I hate this. I tried to kill myself fricking 2 times this month and every single time I wake up in the morning I just feel so helpless and stupid and I hate that every little thing I do is wrong I just want to die i want to die,, I'm so embarrassing I don't want to live anymore. People say it gets better but it's been years and years and every up is followed by a down. I just can't take it anymore
