i canâ€™t even cryi just feel emotionless all the time. iâ€™ve  spent the last decade sad all the time, but at least then i had some hope. i had something to look forward to. now it just feels like iâ€™ve hit a wall. iâ€™ve pushed all my friends away. iâ€™m not sure why. actually i push everyone away. is there something wrong with me? i donâ€™t want to be alone, but for some reason i do everything to end up alone again. iâ€™m not even sure why i typing this. iâ€™ve started drinking. it helps me feel like iâ€™m dreaming. when iâ€™m dreaming i get to just experience life. no obtrusive thoughts. i wish i live my life like that all the time. with my brain shut off like a zombie. carelessly going through life. what the fuck is this. can i just cry and get over this. maybe even wake up? iâ€™m hoping that i gain the courage to kill myself sometime within the next few days. i tried around this time last year, but i was too scared. i think i would drink myself to near blackout then hang myself. sorry if thereâ€™s typos in this and for it being so long. iâ€™m not sure why iâ€™m posting this.
