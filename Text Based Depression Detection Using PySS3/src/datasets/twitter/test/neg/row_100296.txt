I want to die.Iâ€™ll be 21 in 3 months. Not sure how Iâ€™m feeling about life right now or if Iâ€™m even looking forward to it anymore. I struggle with substances and Iâ€™m going homeless. I just got kicked out of where Iâ€™m staying. I have a job.  Barely any friends. I struggle with weed and adderall addiction. I donâ€™t have a guitar with me. I just feel so low. Iâ€™m just in my car waiting for the guy to let me get my stuff. Life just feels like nothing right now. Empty. I know I could make it so much better but it still is awful. I want to give up. Iâ€™m tired of being homeless. Iâ€™m tired of working jobs that I hate. I have no interest in college unless it was for music. I know Iâ€™m gonna always hate my life doing anything besides music. Im homeless though right now, and donâ€™t know where to go. Iâ€™m confused and lost in so many ways. I wish I could give up or things could be better right now
