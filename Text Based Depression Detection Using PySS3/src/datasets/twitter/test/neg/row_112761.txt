Fuck it allWhat's the point? I don't see things going anywhere. I'll never get the things in life I want and it won't even matter anyway if I do, since we are all dust eventually. I am so close to just putting a plastic bag over my head and speeding up the process. Not sure why I am even posting this, maybe just hoping someone will push me over the edge. I'm not close to anyone so I doubt it would even really matter in the long run once the few people who even know me get over it. After my cousin offed himself I said I would never follow in his footsteps, but often I'm convinced it doesn't even matter. And the worst part? I feel like such a fucking pussy for not even following through with it right away.
