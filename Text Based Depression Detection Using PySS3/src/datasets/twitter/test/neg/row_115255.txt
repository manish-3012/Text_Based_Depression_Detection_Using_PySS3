I canâ€™t do this anymoreMy life was finally getting better- I was in therapy, going to the gym, trying to get back on track with school. Then my boyfriend who I dated for a really long time dumped me. I seriously thought we would get married, and now Iâ€™m alone and sad. The happiest moments of my life were with him, and I just think whatâ€™s the point of going on if I will never have that again?
