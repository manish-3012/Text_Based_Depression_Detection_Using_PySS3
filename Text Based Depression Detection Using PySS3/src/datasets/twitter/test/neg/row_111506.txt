I've always avoided the thoughts by never fully forming a plan on how to do it... Untill tonight.I've always avoided thinking about it by just not fully thinking of the way I do it. Or by thinking about all the things I need to put in order before it's done. But those things don't matter if I'm dead right.  I mean I'm still not going to do it... I think... I just... It's never felt like so much of an option before. 


I just. I keep thinking about how some cancerous cells know that their cancerus so they kill themselves off before hurting the the rest of the body... What if my desire to do this is just a social safety mechanism to stop me from just going crazy and bringing down people with me more then I already have.
