For D.I'm sure you won't see this, since this is one of my throwaways. But if I won't see tomorrow, maybe one day you'll venture here and maybe recognise yourself.
I lied to you. Yesterday was a suicide attempt. Sure, it was an accident, but at first I had no intentions to save myself. I thought I should finally do the right thing. I'm sorry I was such a chicken. I should've just let it be and sleep away.

I'm sorry I always made you so angry. I'm sorry I was always so selfish. I'm sorry you always suffered alone, while having to listen to me. I don't know why you did it, sacrificed yourself all the time. I'm sorry I never gave you any good memories. I've realised it now, through your indirect but direct words. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry to everyone.

You let me in your life, I got to know about you, your funny family and your cat. You inspired me, I saw I had options in life. I loved drawing your cat. I'm sorry I quit art, my scribbles never were worth anything. You always listened, even now when my condition worsened and I've been going absolutely mental. Approaching death changes a person, I learnt that in school. I guess it changed me as well. I'm sorry I turned so mean. 

I wasn't meant to live. I'm exhausting, I'm exhausted. I knew my head would take me one day. Maybe not tonight, tomorrow...But I don't think I'll be here too much longer. But it's a good thing, right? Death will always seem sad at first, but before you know it, me passing away actually made everything better. You'll begin to see some light in your life. I bow down to all of you, my family, friends, strangers. Thanks for letting me have a chance at life as well, but I'm sorry I always made it hellish. 

Mad respect,
