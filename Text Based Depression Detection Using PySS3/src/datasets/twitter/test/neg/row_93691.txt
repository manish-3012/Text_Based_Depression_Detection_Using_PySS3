I can't get over my exI just really want to die. Two weeks ago I split up with my girlfriend, because she kissed another guy while being drunk. I was very angry, but I still had feelings for her. So, the week after the incident, I contacted her and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened. I told her I forgive her and that I still love her... She responded with: I've been thinking, and I think it's best if we just not got together again... She already moved on... I loved her so much, she was my everything. We were together for 2,5+ years and wanted to live together after the summer break. So I thought... Apparently she already has a new boyfriend and they have already kissed and stuff... I'm 18 btw, she is 17, her new boyfriend is 22. I just cannot bear the pain, it's too much. I gave her so much love and attention, she was literally the only thing that mattered, she was a part of me... I know it probably sounds fucking insane, giving the fact we are so young. I just had a meeting with friends, she was there too. It was really nice until she told me she already has a new boyfriend and has already kissed him... I just don't know what to do... Right now I'm at home, but I'm planning to maybe just leave it all behind, even though I have the best family and friends in the world... I just can't handle the pain. I've had quite some issues in my childhood and teenage years... She was always there for me... She is the only reason I'm still alive. I'm done, and I'm typing this as a last resort, I just don't know what to do... I'm panicking and crying and I'm just lost... I'm not alive anymore, a part of me died when we split up, and I need that part to live the rest of my life. Goodbye cruel world.... I love all of you, but this live is not for me. ~S
