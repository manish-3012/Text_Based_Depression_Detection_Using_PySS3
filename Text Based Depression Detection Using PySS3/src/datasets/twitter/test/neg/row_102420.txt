I think i'm gonna do it if i don't graduate on timeI'm defending my thesis thursday and idk if i can do it. public speaking is my worst nightmare. Shoot me? cool. Put me in front of a group of people to judge me and everything I've done for the past 2 years? please shoot me instead.

And i'm terrified i've missed something in this process. There was some information buried on the school website that really wasn't clear, so I'm scared there's something else.

I'm also going out for drinks after my defense with people who know me by different sets of pronouns (I'm not out to some people). I'm fine with being out to those people, but I don't want it to be a "thing" where attention gets paid to me because heyyyy avoidant PD.

I've been safe from self harm for like 570 days or something like that. But right now it feels like I'm gonna crack. And if I hold it in any longer, I'm worried that that cracking will turn into a suicide attempt.

I feel like I'm actually dying apart from wanting to kms. I'm drowning in anxiety and I can't see the surface even with ativan.
