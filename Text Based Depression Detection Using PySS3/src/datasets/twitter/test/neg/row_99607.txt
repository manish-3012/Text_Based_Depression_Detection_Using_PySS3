Lost it allMaybe at one point I was happy maybe at one point my life was okay. Before I met my bestfriend/love of my life... Now all I do is annoy them. Because I was depressed about a lot and didn't talk enough. I didn't realize or mean to. I realize I hurt them but now I'm pretty much worthless. And annoying. And my life is a joke. I don't have a friend in the world. I miss the one person I stay alive for. That isn't fair to them I agree. But it doesn't matter they don't need me anymore. I don't need me. People think I'm a joke. I'm a college drop out. Because when I went it stressed me out to the point I wanted to die. Any time somebody brings up how I do nothing my anxiety drops a deathly feeling all throughout my body. I can't get a job I will have a panic attack just filling out the application. I'm worthless. And scared. And I don't have the one thing that I'm on this earth for anymore. Because they have issues of their own and all I am is annoying to them. It's bullshit but. I just can't do this anymore. I can't keep forcing food down my throat. I can't gain weight. I stress so hard my stomach always hurts. I can't keep being so miserable. My life has never been fair or normal. I have the biggest heart in the world but only one person really truly understands that but they just don't want to be with me anymore. It wasn't a one way street I helped them with everything. My hearts been broken so many times in my life. It doesn't make me stronger it brings me one step closer to just giving up. I want to drive as fast as I can into a wall and just die. I know people will cry I know it will leave a sadness upon my family forever. But the sadness I am left with the sadness I put up with. I can't think for everybody else anymore I can't care. Because it's literally killing me. My heart rate hasn't slowed down all night I'm just so numb yet so fucking scared and sad. I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up. If I died people would be hurt. But their lives would be so much better. I'm in so much pain and death is all over me I feel rotten inside out. Why does God punish me. I realize I have working water, food, shelter,... But nobody understands how physical anxiety is unless they have it... How tormenting it eats away at your very soul. I am a failure in evolution. I love so many I care so much but all I get is pain and betrayal. I don't know why I'm here. All I ever wanted was to have kids but I'm a guy. I'm young. And I'm pretty sure I lost the person I love more than anything. Even if they calm down. They'll get mad again. And I'll just feel this way. To be clear. I'm not alive for me I wouldn't kill myself for getting dumped. I'm alive for my bestfriend but they no longer need me. My purpose is purposeless.
