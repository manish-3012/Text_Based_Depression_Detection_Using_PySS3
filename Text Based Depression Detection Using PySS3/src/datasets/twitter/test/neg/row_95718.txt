I'm a terrible personI can't get motivated to do anything. Even when I'm given extensions on deadlines I never meet them. My family has been trying to help me, but I always end up letting them down and they've given up on me. I'm fat, disgusting, and ugly, so no girl would ever want to be seen with me. My friends avoid me whenever possibly and ignore me when they can't. I'm doing poorly in all of my classes and I'm not prepared at all for college. Everyone points out that I could work out to be less fat, or study to get smarter, but I can't get motivated for my own benefit. I can't even get motivated to kill myself, but with all of my problems converging I feel like I have no choice. I've never had a choice in anything in life because I was too apathetic and let myself get pushed around, and now I'm going to get pushed off the edge. I don't deserve help because I'm a worthless pile of trash. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe it's just a waste of time, like everything else. Sorry if you wasted your time reading this.
