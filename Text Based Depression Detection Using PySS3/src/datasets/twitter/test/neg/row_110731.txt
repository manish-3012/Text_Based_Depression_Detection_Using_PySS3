What's there to life anyway?I often ponder about this question. Like, everything doesn't make sense at all. Even if I feel happy, it's a very very temporary feeling and it's very superficial. I don't know what to do. It's an emotional turmoil everyday, but mostly about sadness and being suicidal. I tried talking to new people, old relatives etc, got a new hobby but everything sucks. It doesn't create a spark. Life has no meaning at all.
