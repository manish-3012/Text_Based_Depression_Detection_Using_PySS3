If I check into a hospital or a facility will they contact my family?Iâ€™ve realized I need help, Iâ€™ve been on the verge of committing scuicide and honestly, Iâ€™ve Been very scared lately. If I ever get help Iâ€™m hoping they wonâ€™t contact my family because I feel like theyâ€™d get mad at me or itâ€™ll be humiliating. Does anyone have any experience with this?
