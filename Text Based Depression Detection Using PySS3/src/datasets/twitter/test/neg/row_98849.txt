equal parts bitter rant/unsent letter.today is November 3rd. the day that for many reasons, i had planned on for my suicide. 

this decision was made 3 months ago to the date. on September 3rd. 
i was in an incredible amount of pain &amp; needed a plan. 

i decided that Iâ€™d find time to go to the beach. then return to my motherâ€™s home where Iâ€™d do it. 

there was pain. at that time. 
over time the pain changed into vague apathy &amp; a general dissociation from this existence. 

early September was also the time i went into a deep isolation. stopped talking to everyone. in an attempt to protect myself. 

i donâ€™t really have anything to say.
if i cared more, i would articulate all the ways i felt aggrieved. &amp; maybe demand some kind of ramifications but. that doesnâ€™t matter. 
iâ€™m not looking for sympathy. no one owes me anything. 

i think that i want to communicate that there isnâ€™t going to be a â€œbetterâ€ me. thereâ€™s some hopes that maybe if i go to therapy. something. 

sometime in September i wrote, â€˜something inside me has diedâ€™
&amp; it isnâ€™t coming back. 

thereâ€™s nothing i am willing to work towards/to fix. 

i am just patiently waiting for my next November 3rd. 

i wonâ€™t set a date. so i feel flexible enough. 
but i know itâ€™s coming. i do not plan to live any longer than i already have - only to experience more pain. 

i am wildly miserable now &amp; i just cannot imagine things getting worse. &amp; yet i know they will. 

i am building up to the day that i will finally have the courage that sneakily eluded me today.
