Floundering.I'm trying, I really am. I just don't know what I'm trying for anymore. I keep telling myself that a permanent solution to a "temporary" problem isn't the answer, but I'm not so sure it's temporary anymore. I'd write out my "story" if I felt like it was worth putting anyone through reading it. I guess I'm just looking - hoping - for a light to reach for, anything to keep me trying because I... I can't even word it, I'm scared to, because then I'm exposing myself, showing my inner thoughts. 

I'm sorry if this makes no sense, I just feel so.. Worthless, I guess. 

I lost my best friend last month. She had four legs and lots of fur, but she was always there, reminding me that I'm not alone and keeping me afloat. She died, she fought so bravely, but in the end I couldn't let her suffer any longer. People keep telling me to "get another " or that I will do, "down the line". But the truth is, I don't want to because I don't want to leave a dog without an owner one day/leave someone with the burden of "my" dog... And that thought scares me. 

I won't treat myself, because I don't want it to be some more "rubbish" I'd have left behind. Everything I do, I've always got that thought of not wanting to be restricted to a time frame and I'm scared to let anyone know that. 
I don't have anything to offer anyone, I don't contribute to lives. I'm just here, trying to tread water and slowly swallowing more of it the longer I try. 

I know this probably makes next to no sense, I guess it isn't supposed to, I just wanted to tell someone/anyone that I really have tried.
