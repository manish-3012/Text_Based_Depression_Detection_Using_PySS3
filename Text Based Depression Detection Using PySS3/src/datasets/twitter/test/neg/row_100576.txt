I'm going to do it the next chance I getMy thoughts have been getting increasingly violent, I no longer care about the pain I just want it to stop.  This isn't living you know.  There won't be any turning back.  I feel like I've given each person a part of my soul, and then it's been crushed.  Broken.  I can't get those pieces of me back and I'm just an empty husk.  The light never reaches my eyes.  I'm queen of the trash sitting in a throne of shit, nothing can fix me.  It's like I'm on autopilot to self destruct, and I don't mind.  I feel like the only thing left for me to say to my loved ones is that I'm sorry.
