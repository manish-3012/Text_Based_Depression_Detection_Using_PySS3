I wonder what's gonna finally tick me offI've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I remember. Lately a lot of shitty things have been happening, but I still manage to keep myself from dying.

 I wonder if there's going to be a particular thing that ticks me off enough so that I'd kill myself.

I don't know why I posted this.
