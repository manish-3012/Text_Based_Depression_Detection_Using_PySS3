I dreamt of taking my lifei seldom have new dreams, they're mostly recurring or different spins on the same one. but last night i dreamt about killing myself, right nearing the time i woke up.

it was dead silent, unsaturated and felt like suffocating. i felt my body and mind kind of drift away. the only thing i remember feeling is a strange mix of fear and relief. 

i don't remember how i did it, but i knew right before i "died" that when i woke up things were going to suck. things sucked more than usual.

everyone i know (quite literally all the people i talk to on a regular basis) completely hated me today and basically told me why i'm such a big piece of shit. and for totally valid reasons.

my birthday is this friday. thinking it would be too melodramatic to end it then, but it's fairly fitting, i feel. is it worth the suffocating and the dissociation and the fear? it isn't, but i can't help but ask.

**TL;DR:** dreamt of killing myself. it sucked, but waking up sucked too. thinking the day is getting pretty close.
