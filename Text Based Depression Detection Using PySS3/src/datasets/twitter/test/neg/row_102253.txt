Time to goThis is my plan. I work where I can easily get access to barium carbonate, I want to take 20g of it. Before I take it I am going to take four Maxolon tablets to prevent vomiting and also four Mersyndol to lessen the pain of dying. I will then drink a lot of alcohol, straight vodka, to help me forget everything. Then I'm going to go to the beach at night and swim out as far as I can before it happens, I'll probably drown because the barium carbonate by now will have prevented all my limb muscles from operating. Anyone see a problem with this?
