i cant drop her and it makes me suicidalmy best friend of like 13 years hates me. she doesnt like me but she wont admit it. she likes me for the friends i bring. i have to drop her, i know and everyones told me, but i know if i eventually drop her, my life would be made hell. i'd be to blame for her losing all of her friends beside her boyfriend. but i can't stand to be around someone who's continually mean to me. if i drop her, my life will be made hell, and if i stay her friend, i'll wanna kill myself more than i currently do. i just wanna go to sleep and never wake up so that i dont have to deal with this. i don't know how to be a person right now.
