For once, I am afraid I am dying.I haven't taken care of myself lately. Some things I've done, just stupid on all counts.

I'm worried, because I see signs of serious sickness. 

It would be a cruel joke, if I wind up only learning that I want to live, and me being suicidal wasn't true enough, by facing death. I don't know what else I expected to happen. I don't know how I feel about things now.

I would have to let go of everything I have ever known. Everything. That is what suicide is. I don't want to let go. But I am truly afraid, just a tad too late. Everything. Everything I have ever known. Gone.

I feel sadness again, for the first time in a while.
