I have never felt so low.I am a twenty-something alcoholic who occasionally uses recreational drugs. I live alone. I have no friends here. I tried to sort my life out by quitting my job and going back to University and now I sit here, unemployed, with no money to my name whatsoever. 

I suffer from Bipolar and BPD and I can't even afford medication. 

I don't really know for how much longer I can 'keep on, keeping on'.
