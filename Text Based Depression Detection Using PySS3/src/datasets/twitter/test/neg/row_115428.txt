My dog is the only thing keeping me from killing myselfI've been dealing with bipolar disorder since adolescence. It was well-managed for over two years (since my last institutionalization for suicidal ideation in 2014). My dad and I were as close as any father and son could ever be. He died of nasopharyngeal cancer in august. It was fucking horrific. He gradually lost his vision and his ability to talk. His weight was down to about 80 pounds. Hardly a day goes by without remembering him fondly, and then thinking about holding his hand as his heart rate and oxygen levels dropped to zero and the monitor displayed "alarm discretely activated."

I moved to a new city and adopted a rescue puppy, who quickly became my best friend. At first, things were good, but recently some events transpired that could greatly reduce my quality of life for years to come. I'm shitty about this, and now I'm off the wagon (yeah, I'm also an alchy and I'm wasted rn). As of now, my dog is the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. He's happy and healthy, but if for some reason he's taken away from me before his time like my dad was, I'll send myself to see my dad and my dog on the back of a hollowpoint. My Ruger p-95 is cocked and locked.
