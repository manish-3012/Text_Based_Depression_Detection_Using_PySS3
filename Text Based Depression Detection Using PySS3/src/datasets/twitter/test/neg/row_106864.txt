tonight i find out grades which will make or break my entire future and iâ€™ve never felt more anxious or not okay in my life. iâ€™m almost positive i failed and idk how to come back from thisif i failed either one of the classes iâ€™m going to find out my grades from ill be put on academic probation at my uni and as iâ€™m in my 3rd year already that would pretty much guarantee i donâ€™t graduate on time or get accepted to any grad school

iâ€™m almost positive i failed at least one of the classes. iâ€™ve never felt so anxious or unstable in my life. i donâ€™t even want to be alive to find out how i did 

i feel like such a disappointment to everyone, to my parents paying for my school, and all the people that believe in me, and even myself. i hate the person i am and i have no idea how iâ€™m going to come back from this and ever have any chance of being anything but a failure. i donâ€™t want to exist in this world anymore
