I've decided on a date.Come September 1st, I'll be ending it all. To be completely honest, I'm kind of scared, although I suppose that's natural. It really is such an odd mix of emotions knowing that I'm going to die soon. Some days, I feel at peace with it and just go about my day, while others I can hardly function because I'm crying so much.

Man, I really don't know what else to say about this. I suppose I just wanted to vent this.
