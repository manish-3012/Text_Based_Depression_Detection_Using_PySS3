I've confirmed my decision. I'm going to do it in the morning. I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for everyone who tried to help in my previous posts but I wasn't ever cut out for life. I'm weak. I'm an easy target. I can't take all my bad experiences with a smile like everyone else can. I just can't do it. I can't.
