I just don't see my life passing the next weekSo, where week I think that I don't gonna pass it, everything in my life has lost interest, nothing matters or make me feel good.
Sometimes I just wish that I have the will to end my life, i'm 25, live in Brasil, i'm in my 3Â° college(don't know how it is in others countries) and haven't finished the others 2, just got a job, but nothing makez me happy, trying my max to live but have depression and anxiety do not help much.

Sorry for the poor english, just trying to put it out of my chest...
