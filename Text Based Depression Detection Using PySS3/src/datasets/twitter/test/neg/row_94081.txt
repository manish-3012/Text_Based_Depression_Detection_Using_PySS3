I wish I had died in my house fire.Yep. That's the title. My house burned down a few weeks ago, although the cause of it hasn't been determined yet. The only info I know is that the fire started upstairs. So, me and my family have been airbnb and hotel hopping for a little bit. Now that we've got the context out of the way, I'd like to say why exactly I wanna die. There's a lot of reasons. I'll bore people saying them all, so I'll only say the big ones. 

Me and my partner of almost 3 years had to break up with each other, because we did something we shouldn't have. We wore forbidden to speak to each other for a while, but we disobeyed, feeling that the punishment was unfit for the stupid thing we did. Now, we are unable to contact each other in any form, most likely forever.

As I said previously, my house pretty much burned down. Most everything was water damaged or smoke damaged from the water the firemen used to put out the fire (little did I know, that shit's poisonous, cuz of chemistry and shit). Our cookbooks, any art on the walls, our beds, our documents.. anything that wasn't perfectly safe was either damaged, or garunteed gone.

Both of my cats are dead, one from old age, and the other from a tumor, and internal bleeding.

As hard as I try, I still can't completely recover from my childhood trauma involving my school. It haunts me, triggering me in ways that seem like huge symptoms of CPTSD. 

I grew up in a shitty neighborhood that people think is great from the outside, not knowing that it's not all rainbows and sunshine.

I still have to deal with my transphobic mom, who still doesn't fully accept me after I began to transition almost a year ago.

I have no friends here, and no nearby family aside from my parents where I live. All my friends, family, and pretty much my life are back in Cali.

The only way I can feel any emotion (aside from emptyness) now is either when I hear my parents arguing or fighting, or when I'm listening to music. 

I feel like no one takes my problems seriously, I feel extremely lonely. I feel that no one would really put in the effort to stop me before things get worse, before I finally kill myself. If I do, it will be fucking beautiful. 

I find beauty in the wrong things, happiness in places that aren't correct. I feel like a fractured piece of glass, but at the same time it feels like nothingness or maybe my position in hell as a demon would suit me better.

The world is fucked.
But, everyone already knows that.

What no one seems to notice is that people sometimes need a fuck ton more help than they seem to. They try once, and then give up if it doesn't work. 

"Well, I tried."

Enough of that rambling though, I guess.


I am constantly considering offing myself when I feel crushed, when I feel emotions again. I always need someone to scream to, to cry on their shoulder, to vent nonsense words to, and have them still care about me at all, to still have them not be freaked out by the thoughts I spit out.

I don't trust people anymore. I still look over my shoulder. I still freeze up or tremble when I hear anything resembling gunshots. I can't speak, I go mute when adults yell or shout at each other or at kids. 



I'm a Kedamono.
I'm a Akuma.

I call myself these things not because I really belive I physically am these things, but I call myself them because I associate myself with the terrible nature that they are commonly made up to be. I hate myself that much.

I don't really know why I'm writing this post.. But I hope that at least someone will listen. People might care about my mental issues for once.

I know that I'm not totally alone. I've got my dad and grandma, and I've got my Internet friends. But things can only feel happy for so long, being so far away from 95% of what I am. 

I feel like I should have walked upstairs, and burnt to my name. I wish I had burnt to ash, right then and there.

I wish I had died in my burning home.
