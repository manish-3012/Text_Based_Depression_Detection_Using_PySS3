I got kicked out of school.I was academically dismissed from law school yesterday. I passed all my classes but my GPA was below what my school requires. It both is and isn't a surprise. I was on academic probation so I was at least somewhat prepared, but then again I really wasn't because I worked my ass off this semester and I was really proud of what I did and how much I learned and I *barely* passed all my classes, in addition to, well, you know. 

In some ways I'm relieved because I really hated law school. But I'm so utterly overwhelmed and out of my depth now that I don't know what to do. I've been so paralyzed all day I've barely moved. I know my family will be understanding and supportive. But I'm so totally unprepared for how to pick a career, find a short term job, decide whether I want to keep living in the same town, how to tell people, how to begin paying back the money my dad has poured into my illbegotten education. It's all so damn much and I just don't want to deal with myself. I've tried to kill myself a few times and I've thought about it for a long time on and off. I just don't want to deal with any of this, let alone have to live with myself when I'm the one who did this to myself.
