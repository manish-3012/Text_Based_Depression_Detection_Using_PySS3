not really surei have no reason to live anymore. I have disappointined everyonewho loves me too many time for it too matter anymore. I am a drug addict who graduated high school without going for the last three years. so i basically have no social experience or desire to talk to other people. I feel like i have no other options at this point. I have been to every doctor to help me etc, the only reason i am hesitating is my parent's would be devastate. Can anyone relate at all?
