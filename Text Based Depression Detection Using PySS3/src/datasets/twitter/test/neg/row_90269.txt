If I wasnâ€™t such an overthinker I would be deadI fucking hate myself for this. I keep thinking about the distant future and of a possibility that Iâ€™ll be happy. If I was impulsive I could be dead. In the psych ward there were a lot of people that were more mentally stable than me which fucking pissed me off, because most of them had attempted suicide but I hadnâ€™t, then I realized itâ€™s because I think it through so much. I wish I didnâ€™t, I really just wish I ran away and jumped off a cliff
