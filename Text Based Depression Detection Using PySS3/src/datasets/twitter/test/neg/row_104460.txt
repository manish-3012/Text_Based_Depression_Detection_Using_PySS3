"Minor Inconveniences" as a suicidal person and how people don't understand why you get so upset at daily life.People always tell you that there are good things in life. And most of the time they focus on the little things. The day to day things that can keep us going. Like movie night. Or waiting for the next season of a show to release. Cooking. Certain moments with people. We're told to appreciate that stuff. But then when things don't go your way, and you have the nerve to be upset about it, suddenly you are sensitive and stupid. And when I say upset, I don't mean kicking or screaming or blaming anyone. I mean laying in bed and not wanting to do anything or just being unhappy. I feel like as someone who doesn't have a lot to live for, I have the right to frown when I'm told a negative comment. It's so humiliating to be seen as sensitive or unmasculine for taking things personally. But who cares what I think, apparently I'm just a depressed maniac.
