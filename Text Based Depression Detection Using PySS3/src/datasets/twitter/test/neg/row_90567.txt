Life is too empty without work/romance/family/social contactI wish I had gone through with my plan to hang myself on NYE. It just feels like there is not enough in life to make it worth the effort.

I am on disability pension and nearly every day just consists of trying to get my own laundry and cooking and cleaning done. My medical problems are getting worse and it probably won't be long before I need outside help to do those things. There is virtually no chance I will be able to do a worthwhile or fulfilling job.

I have only ever had one partner, she was violent and emotionally and financially abusive but having a companion made it worthwhile, given how lonely I was before (and since). I doubt I will be able to find someone willing to date a disabled and unemployed man but even then my trauma from being beaten by my ex-wife wouldn't let it work.

I only have social contact about 3-4 times a month - mostly through my disability support group, occasionally there is a meetup I can go to. I don't have many friends and none of them see me regularly. Some of them disassociated from me because when my wife was abusive they took me for the abuser because gender. Some of them live far away, mostly they are just too busy to care.

I've been trying to immerse myself in things I find fun and interesting but it's not enough to deal with the loneliness. Hobbies like gaming and reading are fun diversions but it doesn't meet my need to be with others. It feels like I'm living out my retirement at 35. Without a partner or a career or a real social life it isn't worth living.
