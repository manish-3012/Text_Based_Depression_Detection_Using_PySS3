I Can't Feel This Way AnymoreI've been suicidal for years but these past few weeks have been brutal, and I think it's my time. I've known for awhile it was going to end this way. My life was never worth much, I've never been happy, I've never had a chance. There's no point to anything, no hope things will get better, nothing to look forward to. I don't know how everyone doesn't feel this way. The world is getting worse and worse, people are cruel and uncaring, and my life is worthless. Maybe there's something wrong with me or maybe there's something wrong with the world, but either way it's the same conclusion: I can't continue on like this. I just hope my family get over this quickly, I feel guilty doing this to them but there's no other choice. I honestly don't know why I'm writing this. I guess I just felt I had to leave something for somebody. Goodbye.
