Praying for cancerSo, i guess im partly here because some small voice of mine is telling me to get help, beneath the constant whining of suicidal idealization. Im on mobile so forgive the formatting.
Ill explain. Im a mid 20s adult. I feel like ive lived enough life. Ive fallen in love, had my adventures, ive done recreational drugs, ive worked for a living and ive lived in a time where i could count on a meal every night. Paraphrasing, but these are the words my mother told me when i first attempted suicide.  She told me i had so much life to live before i could die. 
Now, it feels like ive done all i can do in one life. It feels like its time to go. Like a game thats ran its course. 
Ive been praying for a terminal illness. Suicide would be too painful for those im close to, as few as they are.

That said, i wouldnt be doing my due diligence nor respecting my values if i didnt give that little voice a platform to speak.
So here i am.

In my youth we were deeply impoverished. We would move from house to house until kicked out from lack of payment. My mom had her own struggles, of which i dont fault her for. She was caring and understanding, or as best can be for someone dealing with what she has been. 
Depression has always been close to me, minus the few year instances when ive been close and in love with a partner. In those few instances we've grown apart and moved on, to which im not upset and i understand. 
Despite thar, it just feels like ive experienced all there is for me on this earth. I cant simply out myself. Something about  the headlines changing from  "a child has committed suicide" to "an adult has comitted suicide" doesnt sit well with me. Despite the suicidal tendences, i have a sense of pride that wont simply allow that.
 Instead, i beg for cancer. I wish to die of something terminal. Atleast this way they wont think of me with the pity of someone who gave up, but rather just a young man dealt a bad hand. I want them to look back upon me and think that i did figure it all out, and enjoyed this bounty of life while it lasted, no matter how brief.
Im patient enough to wait it out, and i can deal with the grueling pain of a terminal illness. Maybe part of me is just too tired to move forward, maybe the idea of death being the rest i need is whats appealing. 
I try to read these cries for help on this subreddit in an attempt to find identity, but it feels like theyre the cries of a younger me who hasnt figured it out.
Though i suppose, with the suicidal idealization i feel, maybe i havent figured it out.
I guess I'm lost in a strange gray area. I yearn for a final conversation with those i feel close to, with both of us knowing what comes next.
I hope what im trying to say comes off coherent, i understand it might be difficult to understand what i mean.
