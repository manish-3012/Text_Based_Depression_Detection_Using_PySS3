OthersHonestly the only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I know how it will impact my family and friends who care. Iâ€™m getting to the point where Iâ€™m so tired and exhausted with living every day though. Every single night I just drink myself into oblivion. Iâ€™m trying to quit but it feels impossible. I just want it to end.
