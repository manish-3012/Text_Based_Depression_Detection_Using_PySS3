It's actually really sad that suicide would be understandable in my situationI'm the kind of guy people would look at and think of my suicide as completely reasonable. I'm too fucked up. Too far gone down the rabbit hole that is depression and anxiety. There is no religion or belief system that can make my everyday life feel worth it, nor is there any activity or person on this earth that could do the same. I feel no pride in my work. I feel no passion. No motivation. No vision of a brighter future. No desire to get there even if the notion existed in my head. I feel no shame in my unproductive lifestyle or in the fact that I'm a waste of resources. I don't care what kind of a footprint I leave on this Earth. I struggle horribly with social interraction. I'm lazy. I'm willfully unintelligent (or maybe I was just born stupid). I have no goals. I don't see the point in trying to get better if I'm just going to die anyways. Then people say "but what if you worked to change all that? It could be better if you let it!" But my life doesn't matter to me anymore, and I'm not going to give a shit that it might to someone else. I don't eveb remember most of it, just because of how little the past matters to me, even the good parts. I'm cynical as hell when it comes to people. I can't help but project my insecurities onto them. I come back to the sad reality of my life, and there is no more will to make it better. Just barely a will to live at all. Suicidal fantasies plague my mind. I want to enter a populated space and blow my brains out. Fuck your hospital. Fuck your medicine. Fuck your God. And most of all, fuck me, the inevitable failure, the asshole, the moron. I hope I burn in hell. Oh, and fuck my parents for brainwashing me into thinking hell even exists. Idk what I want out of this. I'm not looking for a savior. I just want to vent on a public forum. It's all I have. I can't just bottle this shit up.
