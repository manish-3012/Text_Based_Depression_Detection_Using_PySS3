Everything ImplodedMy relationship died because I got depressed, my job is shit, my medication barely works, and I'm stuck in an apartment that I thought would work out but instead is just a mental jail cell.

I spent three goddamn years being the best I could and when my depression got worse I was the bad guy for ignoring my SO on and off. Now they want space and I'm never going to hear from them again because why would anyone speak to me about anything if I've hurt them.

I should've killed myself then for being an inhuman piece of shit for ignoring them and not having a job and being so escapist.

In a few months, when things will obviously get worse, because of course they will, I'm gonna lie in the floor of my 'living room' and bleed out because that's what I get for being a fucking idiot piece of shit.
