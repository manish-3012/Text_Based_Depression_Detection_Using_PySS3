here is my plan, how can i improve itThe only way you can guarantee organ donation is being braindead or being close to a hospital when you die. id liquidate everything i had that was worth something, donate the rest. get into a nice squabble with my parents so i could "move out" and get rid of all my shit. bring the car to a expensive car wash place, empty it out and get it cleaned. then id go out and buy a nice suit and brand new shoes. id put the dry cleaned suit and new shoes in the car so they'd be ready. then id go to a funeral home and see how much a funeral costs, leave that amount in the car too. if any money was left over, id donate it to a charity. after that, drive to St-Mary's hospital and park in the back right behind the urgence sante garage. From there, phone the security desk or triage and make them aware of what I was about to do and that i wanted to donate my organs. Then I would turn on my hazards and tie down the steering wheel so the horn is blaring. i would tie a thick black plastic bag over my head so some kid walking by doesn't get ptsd by watching me kill myself. then I would use a flare gun with a 22LR conversion kit (metal piece that adapts from flares to 22LR) to shoot myself in the head from inside my mouth. the 22LR has just enought power to break through your skull but not enought to come out the other end, so no danger to anyone else. if you hold it to your temple you can miss and fuck up your corneas for donation. that way 1) family doesnt have to go through my shit 2) i have whatever is necessary to be buried 3) im legit 20 meters away from the emergency room and have a high chance of being able to donate all my organs to someone else who actually wants to live
