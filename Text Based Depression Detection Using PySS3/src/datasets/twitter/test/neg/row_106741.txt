no one believes I'm not okay. I guess they'll realize too late.I was in the hospital recently. Just got out a week ago. So I have a really intensive care team and I'm supposed to be going to an intensive day program. I've told all the staff there, the psychiatrist, and my personal therapist that I don't feel I'm coping well at all, and that I'm having thoughts of hurting and killing myself. I told them I can't do the program anymore; they didn't believe me. I called a hotline and was even sent to the ER last night. They just said the same thing, to take it "one day at a time", and sent me home feeling worse than before.

I feel invalidated by all the professionals in my life. I feel as though I've failed the system and therefore I'm weak and deserve to die. I can't function. I can't sleep or eat. I've started cutting myself again and it doesn't feel like enough. I'm torn between feeling like they don't get it and like it's all my fault. I don't have a set plan to die, but I have lots of ideas and impulses floating around in my brain and it's only a matter of implementing them - I'm not going to make a "plan". I'm going out of town tonight because if I don't I'll probably take all my prescription sleeping pills and I want to put that off until I get away and see if there's anything left in life for me. But I'm feeling so impulsive I may just do it anyway.
