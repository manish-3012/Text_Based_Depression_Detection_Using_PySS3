I need someone to talk to... As the train was approaching today, I thought about hiding in the bush and then jumping in front of it.First of all, I would NEVER do that.  I thought about how quick and easy to would be, but I could not do that to the train operator.  That has to fuck with them in unimaginable ways.  Anyway... today especially I am feeling extremely isolated and all week death has been seeming better and better.
