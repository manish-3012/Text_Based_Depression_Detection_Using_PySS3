I kept fightingMaybe it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I will never forget the moment I found about this community. It was the first time in 18 years that I saw a glimmer of hope. It was the first time in 18 years that I didn't feel alone. It was the first time in f###ing 18 years that I felt understood. Reading your stories, listening to your sorrow, seeing your views about this miserable existence, trying to cope as you do...  Everything just empowered me, kept me away from letting all end. 

You have no idea how much you have been helping me to go through the insanity I had to go deal with. Maybe it's hard to believe, but some simple sentence you utter in this subreddit may tremendously help a stranger on the opposite side of the Globe to face his/her own demons.   
The last month was literally a roller-coaster. I finally managed to get out of the slaughterhouse prison I had been growing up in, to finally say "F### you!" to my abusive "father", to escape the extreme poverty I had to face all my life, to be able to look someone in the eyes regardless of what vulgaris acne has done to my face, and to pursue a career in Computer Science.

Even though my whole childhood put a toll on my being that I don't think I will be ever able to heal, both physically and mentally, even though I may live and die as the quirky ugly lone guy in the corner of the room, I will continue to be my friend, I will continue to search for joy on my own terms.

Thank you!
