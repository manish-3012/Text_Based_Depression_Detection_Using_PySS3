I HATE MY LIFEFor a guy m22 who seemingly has it as all together. Attending university for what I find meaningful, very healthy and good friends and family. Still I find myself so often, especially late at night in grueling despair. It is as everything is an uphill battle. I feel tired as hell but even trying to sleep seems like too much of an effort. Especially since going to sleep means waking up and trying again tomorrow. Trying to make sense of it all and doing well. Other than my mum I feel so completely let down by the world. I feel supported by friends and gfs but it is as they dont truly care. When I'm the most down the only one who is around is my mom. I feel so endlessly alone. As a particle in vast space. Nothing. And to go to sleep knowing I could face this again seems like the worst thing I could possibly do to my self. And it's not that I dont believe that things could be better, it just seems I've given up on trying. What more is there to try? In the end we eventually end up here, contemplating life. Trying to make sense of it all. What else can we do?
