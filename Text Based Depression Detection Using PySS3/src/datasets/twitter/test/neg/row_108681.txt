It seems to me that suicide is the only optionIâ€™m so tired of feeling like i am being thrashed around inside a turbo cycle washing machine. For a moment, Iâ€™m at idle and i think everything will be fine, only to be tossed around again. Iâ€™m so tired of being bipolar and having to hide the fact that i am two separate entities in one body. I am tired of constantly thinking of mutilating myself in any way possible and going through with it, only to hate myself more due to being covered in ugly scars. Im tired of feeling unlovable. Im tired of being worthless. I look in the mirror and cry because i see this disgusting face looking back at me, and i canâ€™t help but think of how exhausted i look. Iâ€™m tired of running 50 miles a week in order to look â€œskinnierâ€, when i still look overweight. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling everything all at once. I think Iâ€™m going to break up with my boyfriend because i canâ€™t get over the thought in my mind that he hates me. I donâ€™t want him to be hurt when i kill myself, so Iâ€™d rather he be angry with me after i have broken up with him. Iâ€™m so fucking exhausted and i have no where to go. I want so badly for someone to save me but itâ€™s not possible.
