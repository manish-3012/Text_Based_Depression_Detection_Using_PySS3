Does this count as feeling suicidal?I have no desire to *actually* kill myself. By that I mean that I cannot (and will not) end my own life. The primary reason for this is I know just how devastating it would be for my family and, as I care for them deeply, that's not something I feel I could ever put them through. They've done too much and loved me too much for me to hurt them in that way.

With that said, I have frequent thoughts of how I could die through no fault of my own. Say I am on plane that crashes, an oncoming car slamming into my car and/or person, or just some random occurrence that results in my death. And the thing about these situations is, I generally don't feel bad thinking about them. Sometimes I think it'd be preferable to how I feel now. Just a thought I wanted to express, I appreciate anyone who gives this a read.
