I don't find any purpose in my lifeI can remember vividly being depressed from a decade and a half ago. Now I'm 24. I don't see much progress in life from there. I have no idea what to do in life. Everytime I try something new, things backfire on me and I end up quitting that thing. It happens every god damn time. I got rejected all through my lives ( maybe more than 100 rejections; yes, I've had many crushes and tried my best to see if I could find "The one". ). Right now, I don't see a point in existing, although I'm too scared to kill myself fearing survival (and being handicapped). My social life sucks big time. The only thing that keeps me going is my family and sometimes the good Samaritans on Omegle and Reddit who help me overcome depression. 

Is this how life will be through out? If so, I'd love to bail out. Nothing makes sense. :)
