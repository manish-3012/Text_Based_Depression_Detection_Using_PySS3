Five years of agonizing employment; Animal ResearchI hate to have this linked to my reddit account but I guess I've gone down the spiral too far and this community is the only one I know that actually gives genuine care and support to those in need.

I've been working in the animal research field for about five years. My first year on the job I had an injury that effected my back yet I pushed through, continuing my work regardless of the pain. I filled out accident reports, contacted L&amp;I, went to doctors, physical therapy, changed my habits... the works... Nothing helped the pain.

Every day at this job has been hell, this is no exaggeration. When I started working there I was young, full of passion and dreams. Now I am an empty shell. I think of suicide daily; before I get to work, throughout the work day, when I am at home. My friends, family and co-workers have distanced themselves from me, and those who didn't... I have become emotionally detached from.

I specifically asked for help from immediate family, friends and staff and find that they all just disregard my sorrow as a "bad mood" or something, even when I have expressed my feelings in a direct and clear way. I saw therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists and went to meditation groups, nothing has helped with the suffering.

I have looked into finding work in a new field, put out applications, resumes, cover letters and made phone calls. Countless hours trying to get out. No responses, no job offers, no luck.

I don't drive anymore after my last car, a 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with under 60k miles was stolen and stripped to the bone, the insurance never covered the cost. Since I've been unable to afford a car, rent is too high, expenses are more than I can afford, I'm barely able to afford rent for my shitty apartment and spend days without food since the social security tax increase has taken the small amount of money I had to survive on after bills.

I do not want to die, I don't want to cause anyone else to suffer because of my seemingly only solution.

What do I do? When nobody can help? Nobody will hire me (Would you buy a car without an engine?) No friends, no family, no support. 

I'm looking for ideas to help me get out of this life sucking job so I can get back to a healthy lifestyle. If I continue doing what I do, it's only a matter of time before I perish.

Thanks for reading.
