Don't really know what to say.I'm not very good at writing these sorts of things, or well, generally. Just feels like I've been going downhill for a very long time, nowadays I'm not really any good at anything, most of all I'm no good at making other people happy. I don't really have anything going for me, but I guess I haven't done anything terrible either. I wasn't able to live-up to people's expectations and I don't even seem to be useful for the basic stuff. 

Maybe I've been following the idea that if I do next-to-nothing to begin with, it's impossible for me to have a negative impact, at least. I'm pretty toxic, I constantly let people down when they really needed me, even though in every other instance they and others'd have my back. I don't want to be that again, but it always ends up being the case from me whether I say it will or it won't. People don't really have patience with me any more and I get that, honestly it wasn't just deserved, it was overdue. My memory's pretty fucked, but I can't see myself going anywhere or even being around in a few months. High time for a bit of junk to be swept up and forgotten about, I guess.
