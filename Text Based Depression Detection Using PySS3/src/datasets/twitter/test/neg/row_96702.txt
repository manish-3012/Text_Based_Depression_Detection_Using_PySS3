I'm ready to end this.I really am. I cant go through all this anymore. I havent enjoyed life for so long. I havent had anyone care for me in my life for so long. I have no family or friends.i think its time to say goodbye.

But i have nobody to say goodbye to. So thank you for reading.

I hope you all excel in life. Its all i ever wanted.
