Im at a wallIm 16, ive never had much money, recently i was living semi comfortable, a fight between my mom and her ex happened and we were told we had to get out by the end of the year, that changed and he wanted us out as quick as we financial could, we were living there for a month or so and suddenly today i was forced out of the house by my mom and am now staying at a family friends in a small shitty camper with my 2yr old sister and my mom. I have been completely mind fucked over the past 10 years of men coming and going out of my life that i dont know how to react. Im incredibly worried about the dogs i had, the one has extreme separation anxiety,, and i was the only one that cared for them. The only thing i had to cope with what happend was gaming but we aren't financially capable of finding a place to live and having wifi, which eliminates that. I have been suicidal before and have been in those psyche wards which make it so much worse so i dont tell anyone how i feel, i just cant take it anymore, ive almost completely given up.
