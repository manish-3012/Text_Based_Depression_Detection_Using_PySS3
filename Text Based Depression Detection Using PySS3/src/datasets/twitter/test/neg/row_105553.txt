No plot, no peak, no meaningHave been having suicidal thoughts for 2 weeks now. I've had them off and on for decades, they're just bad again lately. Thing is, my life is fine - good even. Aside from work stress, I don't have any kind of real struggle : I'm fine financially, have a job, a few friends. There's just no point to me being alive. Sure, i work and pay taxes, but I'm not really contributing anything of real worth to society. I'm selfish, and though my friends wouldn't say they agree, I take from them more than I give. I just fake it through most days. I have no dream job or goals to strive for. I've tried any number of hobbies to find something I love, but there's nothing. At most I'm interested in something for a week before I'm done with it. 

I love my cats, so that has kept me from doing anything so far, that, and I know my mother would think it was somehow her fault.but it doesn't stop me picturing it or planning in every spare moment. I just... don't see any point to existing.
