Today is my 19th Birthday. Will I make it to 20?Ive been off my medication for 2 months now? 3 ? Iâ€™m not really sure. Since I finished school and my exams, Iâ€™ve felt better but I think the buzz of not being classed as a kid anymore has worn off and Iâ€™m not settling into the idea of living the rest of my life. This is something that has been on my mind for a year or two now. The problem now is that itâ€™s real, Iâ€™m coming to terms with the fact that Iâ€™m not a kid anymore, and  I understand there is bigger problems in the world than this. I am thinking of myself here, my mental health and my situation. 

Iâ€™ve always thought with a positive mindset , 
â€œThink of your parents, your family, of everyone that will miss you when youâ€™re goneâ€ 
Would my parents know why I killed myself if I went through with it? Iâ€™m not sure, to be honest I canâ€™t even pinpoint where it all started going wrong. 

Around Transition Year (4th year), I found things rough, I did have friends and I still have them friends thankfully but I always felt like the outsider, the person they wouldnâ€™t notice if I wasnâ€™t there, the person who would be forced to walk behind the group cause there wasnâ€™t enough space, that sort of thing. Anyways Transition Year (TY for short) was my first experience into life outside of school and in a work place, I didnâ€™t get paid but I worked same hours as my co-workers and gained â€œexperienceâ€, the only thing I gained from TY was I found out I hate a lot of things. 

I despise talking to people, making conversation, being fake happy, I would rather sit on my own in my room and watch Netflix all day than spend time conversing with people about topics I have no interest in. 

Iâ€™ve just realized I am just using this as a way to vent about my feelings and avoid my family that are downstairs. Iâ€™ve also got sidetracked so Iâ€™ll get back to the point. 

I am, as of today, nineteen years old and I simply do not want to make it to twenty, I know Iâ€™m gonna die this year, Iâ€™ve seen it in my dreams and I find myself subconsciously saying it everyday. I donâ€™t know when, where or how yet, I donâ€™t know if I wanna find out. Does anyone know why I am thinking I will die this year, is it some form of indication or is it just nonsense ?
Either way it has made me think and if I was to die this year, would it be all that bad ? I donâ€™t know. 

I donâ€™t think I got my message across properly, I donâ€™t know what message I was trying to say but no one will ever know whatâ€™s going on inside my head and Iâ€™ll never know whatâ€™s going on inside someone elseâ€™s. Maybe Iâ€™m just at a low point in life or maybe Iâ€™m right to think this way. I donâ€™t know if this is the right sub reddit to be posting this on, Ive never done this before.
