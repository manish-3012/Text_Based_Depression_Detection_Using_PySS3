You say you're here to help, but you don't know me.You say it will all get better, well... then why don't you show me?

Have you ever stepped back and thought some lives are not worth living?

When you aren't going forward, back, not progressing, not thriving?

It may be the people around me.

But that doesn't mean it's not me.

My heart, my arms, my legs, my brain.

Drugs, sex, alchohol, this and more just lead to pain.

Why would I stay awake in a world of nightmares,

when I could sleep unstirring, not dreaming, without a care?

It doesn't matter how I lived, because none of you will know unless I decide to share my story.

Leaving the good is a fair trade for leaving the bad, why should I be sorry?

To end this post, I am asked by the computer if I am human?

Would I know, any better than you can, 

about the life I wish to end?

It doesn't matter, keep your arms crossed, I need not your hand my lend.
