I can't do this.Sitting here, listening to the never ending resentment, I wish I had a trigger to pull. Constant failure, I mean nothing to anyone. I am constantly told I'm beautiful inside and out but the only reason I'm wanted is bullshit slave work and sex. I can't afford to run but I refuse to stay so there's only one option. I don't care how much it hurts... I'm done.

Edit* Goodbye.
