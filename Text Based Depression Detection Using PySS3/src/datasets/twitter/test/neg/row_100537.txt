I just want it to end.I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation for a long time now. I've lost all connection with friends and family over the past two years. My mother kicked me out nearly a year ago and I currently live with my girlfriend on the other side of the country who supports me fully. I can't leave the house without freaking out and breaking down unless I'm with her. I'm so useless I can't use the phone. I spend most of the day listening to the same song on repeat in my head looking at the ceiling thinking about the past and all the regret, shame, and guilt I've accumulated over the years. My best friend cut me off a month ago because I depended on her too much and I was straining her relationship. My depression is getting worse and I'm also having intrusive daydreams or visual images in my mind of violence towards myself and my sleep is plagued by nightmares. Despite my girlfriend supporting me fully the guilt associated with the idea of killing myself is fading. I'm having to cut deeper and deeper for it to help anymore. I'm so alone. I hate myself and I want to die.
