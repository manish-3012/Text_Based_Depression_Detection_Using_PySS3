Did I messed up something?Hi,
so apparently my most important person commited suicide few days ago. They never been any signals or something. She was a very happy and kind person. On the 2nd of January she got hacked and was paranoid. Her friends left her behind and betrayed her. My family and I did everything for her. Did she focus on the bad things that happened that she didn't even think about the family? Or did someone forced her to do so? I have so many questions, maybe here are some experts. I can really tell that she never could do that. She was not that type of person. So my theory is that someone forced her to do so for whatever reason.
I really need help, guys.
