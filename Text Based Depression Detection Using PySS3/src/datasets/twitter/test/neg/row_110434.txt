U/maybemark is in troubleHe plans on killing himself tonight. I tried to get him to stop, and I promised not to doxx him, but he stopped talking to me, so I guess I have no choice if I want him to be okay. If heâ€™s reading this, Iâ€™m sorry. All I want is for you to get better.

That being said, please try to keep this post out of his knowledge, it might drive him over the edge. I donâ€™t know how to help him anymore. Please, help him.

If youâ€™re going to message him, leave a comment, so not too many people message him and make him think I betrayed him. I donâ€™t want anything bad to happen.
