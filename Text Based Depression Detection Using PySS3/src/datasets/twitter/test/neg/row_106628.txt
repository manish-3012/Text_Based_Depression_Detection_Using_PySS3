I can't face my family again..I just flunked out of college for the second time. I can't see myself recovering from this. Everyone from high school has already graduated and are finding jobs while I can't even pass first year. My family will no doubt kick me out of the house with this. I'm looking at methods but can't help but feel extremely sad at leaving my little brother behind. He loves me and I love him. :'(
