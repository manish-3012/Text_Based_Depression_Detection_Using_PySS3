I found my pillsI just want to say thank you to everybody that said those kind words to me on this subreddit and on r/advice. Your kind words have meant a lot to me but I know that Iâ€™m not supposed to be here, no amount of the therapy or pills will change that and Iâ€™ve accepted that. If I could ask you all to do one thing whether your someone thatâ€™s depressed or your helping the depressed. Please check up on the people around you even if itâ€™s a â€œhey how are you?â€ It can go a long way. Even those friends that seem like they have it all together just check on them because everyone is going through there own shit and could probably use a friend. Good luck to you all ðŸ–¤
