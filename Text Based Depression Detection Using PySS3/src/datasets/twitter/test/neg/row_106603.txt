Anxiety, depressed and stressedLast week i was going to just end it but for some reason I held on, I hate myself because I think I only held on because i was a chicken


This week I find more proof of my soon to be ex husbands cheating and I'm so damn tired of him and his lies and the other women he talks to and it's causing physical health issues with me now.

I go on auto pilot each day..
Watch mindless tv..
Hardly eat
Sometimes I don't eat at all

I'm physically crippled with a disability so I'm feeling more and more useless each day I'm around 

I don't know what to do anymore
