I already fucked up my chances at a good future (x-post from r/college)I'm feeling really, really deflated this summer watching all of my friends go through their abroad work and internships and I'm not sure what to do, or if it's even too late.


This summer, I am working part-time in a deli. That's it. I fucked myself up here-- I have a job throughout the schoolyear working in a lab, and they offered to pay me to work there full-time, but I had a really horrible semester mental health wise and at the time I just wanted to go home. I decided to do so after breaking down to my roommate in the middle of the night after almost overdosing.


I developed depression after last summer and I've sought therapy, medication, you name it. Nothing had helped. My grades have suffered-- I went down to a 3.1 gpa when I used to get mostly As and Bs, I've gotten 2 Cs in the past year and dropped two classes (one was because I switched my major). I got into my schools chemical engineering program, but I hated it and I knew that I loved chemistry, so I switched into Chemistry. But now my gpa is way too low for graduate school and I don't even know what I'm going to do after I graduate.


I haven't always been a loser. I have lab experience back to high school. I worked in a chemistry lab and and engineering lab in high school, worked in undergraduate research on campus my freshman year, had an internship at a Fortune 500 my freshman summer, and this Spring semester worked in a lab as well (which I will be continuing). But I'm the only one of my friends doing nothing this summer. Working in the deli is so degrading. None of the people I work with ever have any thoughts of going to college, certainly not internships, and some barely graduated high school. I just wanted to do something so I could occupy my mind and make a bit of money. But I feel horrible every single day.


How much did I screw myself? I promise, I applied to so many internships and I even got a few interviews, but no bites. Even worse, this is when I had a good gpa-- good gpa, experience in academia and industry... but nothing.
My depression has been made even worse this summer despite finally having a break. I'm honestly on the verge. It takes a lot of willpower right now to not move forward with my original plan. I like to think that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, but it doesn't seem like it. I'm a failure. Nowadays, you can't take breaks. You can't have idle time. I've lost my edge and then some. I feel absolutely cornered.


The only silver lining is that I still have my full-ride scholarship. Yeah, I used to be a worthy enough individual to get that. So even if I end up graduating and no one gives a shit about my or wants to hire me, my debt will be low. But I don't want to live the rest of my life in survival mode. I want to live. But I'm afraid I already fucked up that possibility, so I don't really see the point anymore.
