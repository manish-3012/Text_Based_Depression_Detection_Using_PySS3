Today I feel so blahI don't know what it is.Maybe its the fact that my state has a short winter &amp; the humidity is already rising.Maybe its the fact that I'm 30 yrs old &amp; have no house,no rich husband &amp; no savings in the bank.At least I haven't had kids I can't afford.Maybe its the fact that if I'm not successful in my lawsuit against SAG AFTRA concerning a fradulent application in my name,I can't be Taft Hartley-ed into the union.Maybe its the fact that If I can't become SAG I can't work as a professional actor with a living wage.

Its a lot of things but today I woke up,took my anti-anxiety &amp; anti-depressant medications &amp; realized that I fell so cold inside.I didn't want to get out of bed.That is the first sign of deep depression,I think.But its not the weather.Its the fact that its 2018 &amp; I'm still a lifetime loser.My mother is blind in one eye &amp; a narcissist.My mother wants me to live with her until she dies.My father has never worked because of paranoid schizophrenia &amp; talks endlessly about religion....nothing.One brother has been in prison for 10 yrs on an armed robbery charge.I send him money because noone else will.That includes my Aunt who sees my father as trash &amp; his childrena s an extension of him.My youngest brother caused so much hell in 2017 with his girlfriend at my parents place that my Mother's landlord refused to renew her lease.My mother moved to NC partly because of cheaper rent &amp; to get away from my violent youngest brother.

I do not have a handout mentality.I know nothing is free in this world.I just want to be a starving artist &amp; enjoy life.I don't care about much because my parents raised me in poverty.I never had the option of choice.Well now I do but I still am not SAG eligible &amp; if I can't join SAG AFTRA my life is over.My local Superior Court gave me a 2019 court date!I can't afford an attorney to help me with this so I don't know if I should mediate or let it go to trial.

The learning disability lady at my community college wont test anyone until FALL 2018!Guess I won't get testing this year.No.....I can't afford to pay for it.No.......the Regional Center doesn't test for that,only developmental (Autism,Aspergers).I've been screwed all my life so this isn't anything new.

Maybe I'm experiencing a high fructose corn syrup withdrawal.I ran out of food a few days ago.I should be getting my SNAP benefits in a few days.


Right now I just feel so blah....like it wouldn't bother me much if I died today.At least my mother would stop all that nagging.
