Tired of Constant FailureYesterday, my mom asked me how I keep going. I just looked at her with my normal emotionless face and shrugged. She thinks itâ€™s therapy but I donâ€™t have the heart to tell her that therapy doesnâ€™t help me. That Iâ€™ve started cutting again to cope with constant failure (tbh itâ€™s been on and off since early high school and I canâ€™t talk about it due to my culture and being a male). I canâ€™t tell her that Iâ€™ve found comfort in alcohol and Iâ€™m trying to keep myself from binging but itâ€™s becoming harder not to just drink a bottle with medication.

Iâ€™m tired of always failing. Iâ€™ve worked so hard for so many years and sacrificed so much only to have it slip between my fingers like water. The last several years have comprised of financial hardship, rejections from Med schools, deaths, and a breakup. I literally havenâ€™t even taken the time to mourn any of these losses/failures. I donâ€™t know how to mourn. I just feel nothing. Itâ€™s a void in space where nothing exists, yet it widens everyday and consumes me.

I think the loneliness is whatâ€™s getting to me the most. My relationship lasted a few months and Iâ€™m grateful for that first experience but it was not healthy. I left craving affection and I donâ€™t get much attention from women, so these just eat away at me. It feeds suicidal thoughts and feelings of inadequacy. 

I just want this to end. I just canâ€™t find any ways to end myself peacefully. I canâ€™t share these thoughts with anyone since my friends run or ignore me while acknowledging how others feel. Iâ€™m a failure and worthless. Perhaps itâ€™s better to let the void consume me.
