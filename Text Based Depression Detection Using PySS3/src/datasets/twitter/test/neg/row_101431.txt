How do I say goodbye and close things outI (25/F) have made up my mind so please don't waste any time trying to convince me otherwise. I will not acknowledge anyone who tries.

I'm planning on taking my life within the next 2 months. Things have gotten progressively worse, overall for me and to put it simply, I'm just tired. The last few months have been just one ordeal after another with seemingly no end in sight. With each day that passes by, the world becomes a worse place and there is only so much a living being can take so I'm done.

I have a wonderful girlfriend who has made life bearable that I just moved in with and I know she's going to be destroyed by this. I love her so much and I can't accept how much damage this is going to do. I'm so sorry, but I can't keep going.

There's so many people in my life who will be crushed, and I love all of them more than there are stars in the universe.

What I'm asking for is this:

How to I say goodbye? I don't want to ghost anyone, though I've been slowly pulling away from people over the last few weeks and after just moving cross-country to be with my girlfriend, that has given me an excuse to talk less. I went drinking with my best friend that week I moved out here from my home state, and told him that I loved him.

TLDR: What can I do so the people in my life move on easier?
