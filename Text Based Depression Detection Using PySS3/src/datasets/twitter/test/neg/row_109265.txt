I really don't like this anymoreI really don't want to live anymore. I don't like anything and I don't care about anything.

I can't force myself to care for things and I don't want to live. I fantasize about killing myself multiple times throughout the day. I've told my mother that I want to kill myself and she told me that she would cry if I killed myself. She told me that the rest of my family would also cry. I feel guilty for this but I can't help but feel any other way and feel like I am living just to make my family happy. I've tried thinking about other things but it always seems to come back to this and I can't get my mind off it. I've felt this way for a long time. I visited my doctor last year and my doctor prescribed me celexa which I took for a month. My mother found it and threw it in the bin and told me not to take any medication for this and that it would get better. It's been more than a year since I last took my medication and I have felt like this since 2012.

I really don't want to live anymore and I don't want to be here but I can't help but feel like killing myself. I feel like I make choices in my life that are destructive. I have no friends and have never told anyone other than my mother and my doctor about this I'm not sure talking will help but I don't feel like talking I don't feel like anything anymore.

There is nothing inherently wrong with my life I just really don't want it. I wish someone else could have had my life instead of me.

sorry for the blog
