depressed and suicidal thoughtsHi, i'm a 21 years old men my life is "great", my family doesn't struggle with money and are very supportive and love me, yet I feel depressed, and i can't do anything about it, my grandma, whom i was very close of, has passed away last year, next year my girlfriend whom I have been with for now 4 years will move away for her studies, I don't see my bestfriend much anymore because of his own studies too and I myself have failed my first year of studies and on the way to fail the re-do of my first year, again, i don't know what to do with my life and have suicidal thoughts because i kind of don't see the point of living, but I don't do it because I don't want to hurt my family, I can't talk to anyone about this and I blame myself and feel kind of selfish to feel that way because many people suffer much more than I do and I shouldn't feel that way for such " little issues " moreover nobody around me have the slightest idea of how i'm feeling and i don't really express my feelings and I don't want to, I really don't know what to do and how to deal with this, but I know for sure that it will be more and more difficult to deal with everything when my girlfriend will be away and i'll be alone.
