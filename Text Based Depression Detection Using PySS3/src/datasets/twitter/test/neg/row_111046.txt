I am a British NEETHonestly, the fact that I don't work or go to university makes me subhuman.  A user on my local coronavirus sub accused everyone of being NEETs and wanting the lockdown to last a few more weeks.  I have low functioning autism and if I am lucky to get a job after the lockdown, it will be stacking shelves at a cheap supermarket or wiping the floor at McDonald's.  And even I don't think I will be good enough for those jobs.

I feel subhuman for not wanting lockdown to end right now.  My low functioning autism means I do not like going out because seeing people who are richer and better looking than me makes me have a screaming meltdown and my LFA causes me to hate change so seeing social distancing in public will make me have another meltdown.  I am such a weak subhuman.  On top of that, if I catch coronavirus, I have a literal 100% chance of needing a ventilator and eventually dying.  So I hope to pluck up the courage to kill myself now instead of going the painful route of catching the virus (which can lead to spreading it to decent people), being rushed to the hospital, being denied a ventilator due to my frailty  (low functioning autism combined with obesity), and slowly dying on my deathbed gasping for air.

I also think I will the economy will have a faster recovery once I am gone, for obvious reasons.
