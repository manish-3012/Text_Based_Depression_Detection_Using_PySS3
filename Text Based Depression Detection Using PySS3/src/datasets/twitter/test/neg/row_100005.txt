To be with him.Hi, in about a half hour it will be two days ago exactly that I found my boyfriend on our bathroom floor dead from an opiate overdose. He was 1.5 years clean, I am 10 years clean. I've never felt love like that before, I don't know if it really exists besides him. I miss him. People offer support but I only want him. I keep having this overwhelming feeling that there is something I can do to fix this, turn back time, and get him back. It just can't be real. The only thing that brings me into reality is seeing his body on the floor and hearing myself scream his name and feeling the strange sensation when I was smacking his bad as hard as I could, and nothing... I want to go be with him, and if it weren't for my parents and my dog, I would, but I just can't do that to them, not an option. I don't want to get high which is everyone's concern, I just want to go be with him.
