If you're willing to talk I'm willing to listenI've been having a rough time lately and feel very alone or alienated by those around me. I've had some bad things happen in the past that never really left me and it's really hard to feel so helpless but at the same time I know that a lot of you feel the same, like it would be easier to just end it all. It makes me really sad to know how many of us get ignored or not taken seriously. If any of you need to talk or vent please message me. I'll listen and take the time to read and reply to you and if I can help in any way I will try my hardest to do so. I hated feeling alone but I don't want any of you to have to feel that. My inbox is always open to any and all of you guys and maybe just maybe we can end up helping each other â™¡ you're not alone lovelies.
