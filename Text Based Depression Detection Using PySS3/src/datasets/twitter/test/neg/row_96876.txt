whats the pointIm not sure Im going to make it all the way through today. Im tired of being a failure and tired of being alone. My only achievements are floating through life on a wave of mediocrity my only friends get sick of me and shut me out of their lives regularly. I cant think of anyone who I could call that wouldnt just end up being annoyed. I have the bullet here and I just keep looking at it and thinking maybe it would just be better to fade away. I dont feel like theres that many paths left in my life that will take me somewhere happier and the probability of finding one of those is small. I just dont know what to do. Im struggling to find a good reason to wake up tomorrow.
