I finally told my husband how Iâ€™ve been struggling recently and......he said, â€œWell, just go find something else to do.  I mean, Iâ€™ve watched you become more and more withdrawn and isolating yourself from the outside world.  Just go find a group of people to be around.  Maybe thatâ€™ll help.â€

Jesus fucking Christ.  I wish it was that easy.
