Questioning is driving me INSANE, so much I am ready to go any minute nowâ€œYouâ€™ll figure it outâ€ â€œyouâ€™ll know when the time is rightâ€ 
I canâ€™t stand these answers anymore, because I have intrusive thoughts OCD and Itâ€™s not cureable which means I will NEVER FIGURE IT OUT. 
People get sick and tired of my pain and just leave. I feel like I am a quick venting stop for them and as soon as I try to talk about my issues  and reciprocate they loose interest. I donâ€™t blame them because I feel like a burden on myself let alone others.
I wake up everyday and set a date to die, I canâ€™t go on like this. I canâ€™t eat, I canâ€™t sleep, Itâ€™s even hard for me to breathe.
