Just done with it.I have zero reason to continue living. There is NOTHING anyone can say to convince me otherwise.

I made a pros and cons list of committing suicide and it was 22 pros to 3 cons.

The one girl i loved more than anything committed suicide earlier this year.

The girl I have/had now doesnâ€™t want to talk to me.

Iâ€™m not appreciated at my job.

Iâ€™ve grown farther apart from my friends.

I hate my parents.

I was bullied mercilessly as a child, and I now realize had major lasting damage.

Iâ€™m constantly struggling with money, and was homeless for a time earlier this year.

I need to die.
