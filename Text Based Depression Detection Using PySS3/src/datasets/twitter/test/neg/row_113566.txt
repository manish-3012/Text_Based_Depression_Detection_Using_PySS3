ReeeeeeeeOk so first my friend finds my reddit account with all my suicide posts, and then he tells other people, and then Iâ€™m supposed to feel comfortable opening up to them, like whaaat? Idk why I ever try to have friends like one of the symptoms of my diagnosis is literally â€œlong history of unstable relationshipsâ€ but my dumbass keeps trying to form relationships so lol. Idk what to do anymore, Iâ€™m hoping that Iâ€™ll grow a pair and actually attempt to kill myself again, but thatâ€™s never gonna happen, but if anyone has any tips on how to think positive or something like that itâ€™d be helpful.
