I'm scared and I need helpI'm done. I can't take life anymore. My boyfriend hates me, and probably never wants to be with me again, no one else will want to either because I'm ugly and crazy. He won't even let me talk to him, all I want to do is go home with him and have everything be like it was, but he won't believe me. I just can't go on like this.
