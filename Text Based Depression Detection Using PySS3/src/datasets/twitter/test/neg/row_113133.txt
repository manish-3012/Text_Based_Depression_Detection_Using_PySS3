I am going to kill myself tomorrowAll hope is gone, pain is unbearable.

It's kind of a pain you can't describe. Here I am, laying in my warm bed, satiated, have no responsiblities tomorrow. I am mostly alone but I have few groups of friends.  But still I am in so much pain. So what's so painful, you have everything?

I have tried to answer this questions for around 15 years now and  I really don't know the answer. I know what's bothering me but I don't know why does it hurt so much and how can't I handle the pain like other people?

My last straw was going to the psychiatrist. Tried it 2 years ago. Was on Brintelix and Seroxat. Honestly, sometimes you feel like the meds help, but suicidal thoughts always come back.Even on meds. I've had suicidal thoughts since my primary school, but I always thought things would be different. I continued living for my parents and my grandfather. My grandfather was not a good person overall, but he was the only person that liked me no matter what. He was so proud of me. He died of cancer 2 months ago. I think he is in a better place now because he wasn't happy with his life either.

Whole my life I have tried being nice to people and tried improving myself. But I am not satisfied with whom I become.  I have never been satisfied with myself. Honestly there are so many things that are wrong about me that I will not even bother writing them. I mostly feel like people like me, but don't love me. It's nice having me as a friend because I will always do everything to help anyone. Not because I want something from people, but because it makes me feel so good about myself and gives me a purpose to live. That and being a good student in primary school and highschool are the only things I like about myself.

I know that this will hurt my parents, but I can't stand the pain anymore, I am sorry.

I don't enjoy doing things, I don't enjoy waking up in the morning, i don't like the faculty I am enrolled, I can't find satisfaction in most things and even when I do I am just not good enough for those things. For example, when I was little I really enjoyed playing soccer. I tried playing it, but since I wasn't that good other kids and people would be angry at me. I liked playing video games and was quite good at them, but I just lost interest in them after i cut them out of my life cuz of school responsibilites. I had a few crushes in my life, but they never liked me back. I go out sometimes with friends and that is sometimes fun, but it isn't that fun to hold me around.

The last thing that really broke me is my last crush. I had 3 crushes in my life but I've never though about them that much. I never loved them and never spent that much time with them. But with the last one was different.

The first time I saw her I wasn't attracted to her looks or anything. I wasn't even thinking about her, but after a year of hanging out we started studying together and spending much more time with each other. As I got to know her better I realised I liked her looks also. I don't know how, but it happend. I just liked spending time with her. She was the exact opposite of me and she is kind of like a role model for me. She is good with people, she always finds positive things in everyone and you can tell her everything that you think. I tried suppresing my love but after 2 years of hanging out I told her I liked her romanticaly. She wanted to stay friends, which we are to this day. But its just so hard because I would like to be around her all the time and even though she likes me she likes other people more. I know that everyone goes through unrequited love, but this just hurts me so much and I can't deal with it. She also saw how hard it is on me so she told me that I need to find someone else. I don't like the others as much as her but I tried to find somebody else just because everyone, including her, told me that was the right thing to do. I found a few girls I chatted for a while and I also saw that they liked spending time with me, but they also didn't like me romanticaly. Which is fine, that doesn't hurt me as much. I even felt good about myself because I tried something and I saw that they atleast liked me as a friend because the girls I asked out always come to me and chat whenever they see me. Every day I find myself hating myself for not being good enough for my crush.

I also have nightmares every night. I don't sleep well at all. I also read that physical activity helps with problems I have so I try to run every day before bed. But it doesn't help.

I was thinking of throwing myself off the building, high builidng are really hard to access in my town so even when I went I couldn't do it. Now, I bought myself a gun. Will probably shoot myself in the head.

Life is just too much for me. I know that I have to change in my head, but I dont have the the strenght anymore. I just can't go on. I just can't stop thinking about her. I just can't stop thinking about bad things.

I am sorry.
