I don't think I have much longer.My depression has gotten to the point where it's physical. I can feel this deep pit in all of my limbs and my stomach, a lump in my throat, and it's oppressive. I feel like burying my head in my arms and laying in bed the entire day. It's even difficult to type here. Neither of my parents care about me or like me so I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel like I'm isolated in this terrible little corner. I should just waste away and die. I'm not worth continuing. I'm so fucking tired. I just wanna end it. My parents, despite being cruel and awful towards me are the only thing keeping me alive because for some reason I dno't want to hurt them, but that's even wasting away. I don't think I have much longer left. I don't imagine myself making it another couple months.
