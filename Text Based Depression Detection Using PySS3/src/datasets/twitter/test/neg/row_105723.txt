Gonna die any day now in a painful way, I'm terrified, wake up every morning shaking uncontrollably and nauseous even on 4+ medsI DO NOT advocate suicide nor do I want to die, I don't hate my life, yet I am suicidal out of crippling doubt,fear,paranoia, epistemological insecurity, anxiety, nausea. I'm terrified to exist at all. I have mental health support and medicine already but it's not gonna save me. I need philosophical HELP because I believe my arguments are wrong but can't see how. Please get this cry out to someone who could show me how wrong I am philosophically. I've asked everywhere not a single response, am I to die without even a single word of advice? If anyone reads this you can help save my life by forwarding this doc or reddit to a professional philosopher who can guide me out of it. If you suspect I'm doing this for attention, consider what kind of person would pretend to argue for suicide anonymously and beg for help? Even if that were me, the rebuttal itself could help anyone else who thinks this way.
PLEASE HELP HOW ELSE CAN I ASK I'M GONNA DIE AND I FEEL LIKE I'LL BE TORTURED ANY SECOND Please share this with someone who could show me how misguided I am or else what can I do but act out my beliefs, been begging everywhere not a single engaged response, and getting blocked by mods...
