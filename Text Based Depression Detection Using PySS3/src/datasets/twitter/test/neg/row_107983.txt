Why do i have to live if im alone constantly?Im not happy in florida. Im finding no girls to talk to and covid is making everything a little harder. Havenâ€™t felt anything since high school, and that true feeling is beneath a thick layer of heartbreak. I shouldnâ€™t have to claw my way at something in order to feel. Getting tired.
