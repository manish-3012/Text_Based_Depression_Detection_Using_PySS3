My friend was killed recently. I feel so guilty.i wish it was me and i feel so fucking selfish for saying that. ever since his death a couple of days ago iâ€™ve just, dropped. i just feel so selfish and so frustrated. i donâ€™t get the point of living if itâ€™s just so cruel. originally, before this, i did see the light- i viewed life as something that changes, something that you have to live in the moment for. but damn, living in the moment is great, it is- but why is life so damn ridiculous?

one of the few people i viewed as ultimately a great, moral, and basically the model person- was killed. fucking killed, in an instant. whatâ€™s the point of me trying to continue, or strive to be like that, if life could just cease, or be diluted like that?

i just, i donâ€™t know. i left my house just to feel less frustrated and angry. just to breath. i wish i took some medicine with me, so maybe i could die too. so i could leave too. so when i was driving i could be killed too. thereâ€™s not much left stopping me from thinking about it tonight, or tomorrow night. or if
thereâ€™ll be a night after that.
