I wrote a note tonightMy plan has always been to do tons of preparation before killing myself to make things a little better for my family. Audio, pictures, videos, individual notes, paying for my own funeral, and so much more.  
  
But I have been at an 11/10 of depression the last few days and I'm not sure that I can make it much longer. My method of choice is not something I can do impulsively and I don't have the materials for it yet, but I don't trust myself not to use... messier methods. The note I wrote is simple but it's all I have the capacity to write right now.
