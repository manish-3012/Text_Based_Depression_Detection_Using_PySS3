I'm becoming content with suicide and this post is an experiment to see if voicing that changes my intention.I won't go in to the reasons why I'm considering ending my life, but it's been something that I've battled on and off with for about 15 years. I'm not an angsty teen struggling with mountable teen problems, I'm an adult who's deciding to go, due to a life full of confusion, bad decisions and sadness.  

I've found a technique that won't be too difficult to do and I feel a sense of relief knowing that I can finally exit. My main fear is, well, saying goodbye to human consciousness. 

I'll miss breathing, I'll miss the sense of touch, I'll miss contemplating things of wonder, I'll miss those little things that make me nose chuckle. 

I know there's nothing after death, that scares me and comforts me, but I think I'm done. That's okay isn't it?

I can't function in this world, exiting seems to be the best, if saddest, solution. And I think I'm becoming content with that idea.
