I'm turning 28 on SaturdayI just recently got kicked out of school because I couldn't afford the final payment on tuition. I had to move back home, where I'm jobless, have no money, no education beyond Community College and no prospects. I used to think I wanted to write for a living, but even taking on projects on Upwork has started to feel like too much. 

I don't want to be going nowhere anymore. I want some modicum of control over my life and the only bit I have is whether or not I am alive or not. I hate this.
