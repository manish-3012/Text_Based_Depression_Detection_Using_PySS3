Iâ€™ve given up hope completelyI have posted several timed, here in the past. I am now completely at my wits end. I cannot go on any longer. I am 33, a virgin, and the most difficult part is dying without ever experiencing the most basic, and human of acts. I am a victim, and that is the way I hope others view my death, however I hope the mourning period for my family is easy, and short. I cannot go on any longer.
