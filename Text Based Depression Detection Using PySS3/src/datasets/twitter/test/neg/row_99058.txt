I have 3 modesI'm either on the verge of crying and breaking down again, so incredibly pissed off that I flip and do stupid stuff before calming down and seeing what I did making it worse, or I'm super happy with no real reason to be is that normal to be that happy and it's to much and I get (for lack of a better word) overjoyed and crash back to normal or am I actually over-happy and crashing again. I dont know what else to say to be completely honest I needing to say something so there it is.
