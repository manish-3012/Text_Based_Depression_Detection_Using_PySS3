I'll never pass as female and I have no support from my family and too depressed to help myself anymoreIt would be easier to kill myself than to keep fooling myself that I'll be feminine enough to pass as female one day, and that my family will ever love or support me. I'm in a relationship that feels empty and I don't have the energy to help myself anymore. I'd not wake up to see the next day than keep hoping that it gets better. I've been in this position before and everyone says it gets better, but it really doesn't. As soon as I deal with one thing another huge issue comes up and things just keep getting worse and worse and I have no support or love from anyone to keep me going.
