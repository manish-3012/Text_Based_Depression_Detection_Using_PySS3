In my 26 years of life, exactly 3 non-relatives have actually cared about me1) a girl, I lost contact with (entirely my fault) when we graduated from high school and moved to attend different colleges
2) a guy, who was shot and killed on what was supposed to be one of the best days of my life
and
3) a girl, who was probably the sweetest and most caring person I've ever met, but who eventually realized I was far too troubled of a person to be in a relationship with.

I used to be able to convince myself that I just hadn't met the right people yet, and that one day I'd meet the right group of friends and things would all be well and good.  #3, however, has helped me to realize that I'm just not a good person.  It hurts like hell to admit it, but I'm just a bad person, and I honestly don't think I'll ever find someone who loves me and who I will love.  I'm the youngest of three kids, and probably the most common thought that I have each day is the thought of how much better off my family would have been without me.  I honestly think that my family would act sad for about a week after I was gone, but in the long run they would be so much happier.  I'm almost certain I'd be doing every single person I know a huge favor.
