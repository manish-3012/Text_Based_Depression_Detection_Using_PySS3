What's the point? I woke up this morning and had to take the dog my grandma was given a week after my birthday to the vet to be put down she gave him to me and my dad. My grandma died of stage 4 brain cancer the December of 2017. I was given an Australian shepherd puppy as a gift it got creamed by a car. My dad is bipolar and spent the whole day yelling or crying because the dog was the last thing my grandma gave us.My dad works two jobs so I only see him 2 days every 2 weeks. My mother works double shifts and sleeps on the weekends so I only see her 1 day a week(My parents are divorced btw).My brother is overseas in the military and I fear I may never see him again.I'm 15 years old, 255 pounds, 6 foot 3 inches, and I dont talk about my emotions because I bottle them up. My friends only hang out with me during school and even then noone knows how sad I am because I am known as the funny happy guy but only because I dont want other people to be as sad as me. I dont self harm,I dont like pain,everyone in class does because they're "depressed", I'm not gonna be another fuckin fool and cut myself for attention, noone in the class has ever actually attempted suicide nor or they sad, most of them admit they "do it for clout". I have guns in my house my family used to hunt now they're for self defense if needed. 3 rifles,4 shotguns,2 pistols,1 revolver, 1 semi automatic AR-15, and one magnum. All loaded and unlocked. When I get to the dark place in my mind where I contemplate suicide, I play a game called " give yourself reasons to live". I play the game by putting a loaded shotgun with a slug in it on the floor, then I give myself reasons to live. On good days I have hundreds of reasons to live but on bad days the number has gotten below 5. I fear the day I run out of reasons and the slug completes its purpose.*Bang*. No one knows how I feel. Just you guys and gals, and even then I might delete this later if I feel I shared to much. I live a good life but I feel trapped and angry and empty. I'm sorry I bothered you people and wasted your time.
