...Itâ€™s sickening me to not write. My mind is growing sick, as is the rest of my body. Unemployed by my own choosing for several months, without even graduate work to conduct. It was never a passion, and I did not know so much about what I was getting into; I simply thought I must do something rather than nothing up on my return to America from Korea. Now I am completely broke financially, and must depend on family until I get on my own two feet again, if that is possible. I have been living in a self-created prison. I have been repeating past mistakes. I have been very self-destructive. My behavior harms no one but myself. No one could treat me worse than I treat myself. No words inflicted or actions taken could treat me worse than I presently treat myself. A failed engagement; failed and disqualified from graduate school for simply ceasing to attend; memories of a good life tormenting my mind under present circumstances. It is all too much for an individual to bear, and I bear it alone. I ceased counseling months ago. Medication intake is periodic. The mind wants to die, while the body continues functioning in itâ€™s most basic tasks. Dark, painful nights alone followed by sleep in the day to avoid people. The body sends minor signals of pain; the mind refuses to allow the body to exercise, or seek better food. Very soon, the body will have to be transported to his parents home. It is referred to as a body, because that is all it is at this point: a lifeless body, the â€œwalking deadâ€ as they say. Next to nothing in life interests it. Institutionalized for life at 32 soon to be 33? Possibly. The exit always lurks around the corner of the mindâ€™s eye. It is always there, and it will come. But when? As much as the mind desires, not today. Another day, another fantasy of death. The mind feeds on it. It keeps this major depression alive. It keeps the suffering intact.
