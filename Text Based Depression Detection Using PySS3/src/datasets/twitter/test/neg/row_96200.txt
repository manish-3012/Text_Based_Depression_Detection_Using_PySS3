I donâ€™t want to die but feel so hopelessLast year I almost killed myself; I was about to jump but did not do it, it still baffles me that Iâ€™m here, since than I havenâ€™t told anyone even tho Iâ€™ve been going to therapy, I canâ€™t seem to be able to share it and wanted to scream it at someone, I feel like a weird, crazy, ungrateful idiot that is uncable of getting through her normal life like all others
