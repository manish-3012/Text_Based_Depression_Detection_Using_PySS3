I'm going to do it soonThis isn't a cry for help...I don't want help. Help only prolongs this awfulness. I just wanted to write this and maybe one day someone I care about will see it.

I've tried so hard. I swear. I've tried to work on ways to better myself, find things that make me happy, imagine 100s of different futures I could have. And there are so many things in this world that make me feel good and happy. So many things or lives I could have that I'd be objectively happy with. Boring ones, exciting ones, easy ones, hard ones. It doesn't matter; I'm pretty easy-going. But nothing sinks inside. Nothing good sticks. My chest hurts constantly; my head hurts. And I want it to stop hurting. I don't know why I can't truly be happy, but it feels like every other emotion is constantly storming through me.

Some people help quiet the storm, and let me feel the good things, just by being around them. And some of those people help more than others, just by existing. I won't list them or describe them in case anyone does find this. But these bright points in my life are getting smothered by this fucking tornado of dark that just keeps growing inside of me.

I'm tired of fighting. I know I could find more lights, I could try to make the one I produce for myself brighter. But what's the use? It's too hard. It's just a constant battle and I'm exhausted. I can't keep fighting for much longer, and even if my friends could fight it for me, I don't want to put that responsibility on them.

This fight has been happening for years, usually in waves. I'll have a couple months where I'm winning, and then a couple weeks where im struggling again. But this time... I haven't been okay since January started. I kept thinking I'd get a new wave of hope, and I've searched for it and tried to generate it myself, but I don't think there's an upswing coming this time. Everything just keeps getting worse.

For awhile I was trying. I was reading new books, trying new hobbies, looking to spend time with good friends. But even if any of those things worked, why bother? It never stops.

I love my boyfriend more than anything. And the last thing I want to do is hurt him. But I don't think I can be strong enough anymore. I know this will hurt him and I want to spare him the pain but he's stronger than I am; he can be okay. I don't believe I can anymore.

I wish things were better, but they aren't. And I don't think they can be ever again.
