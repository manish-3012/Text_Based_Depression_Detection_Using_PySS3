My heart's been acting strange the last 12 hours I feel a strong distinct heartbeat every 15 s or so on avg. Feels like an adrenaline rush. If it's nothing serious I guess I'll keep living life for now. I dont think Ill go to a doctor though if it ends up being serious, happy to get out of this disgusting world dying peacefully like this
