It's my birthday, today.First, some backstory.

As of a week ago, we discovered I either have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or Purely Obsessive OCD.

My, um...girlfriend? Woman I love? Whatever. She's bipolar, and she entered her first really big manic phase about three weeks ago. She's confused about everything, has no idea if she still loves me, thinks she has feelings for other people, the whole shebang.

About two weeks ago, we went on what's supposed to be a break. She actually hasn't been single in about five years, and she says needs time to figure her own disorder out. 

As of right now, she has no idea if this is "break" permanent or not. One day she's sure she loves me, the next she can barely stand to be around me. The only thing she's sure of is that she needs at least until fall, apparently.

Needless to say, I was, and still am to some degree, scared absolutely shitless. I have no idea how to handle this situation, and my mind will not just let me relax. As such, in my flailing to fix things, I kept pushing her further away. 

I've finally managed to gather myself together, but I feel like it's already too late. I'm getting the help I need for my own disorder, but I can't tell if her frustrations with me are her manic phase, or legitimate frustrations. I feel like I've already fucked things up beyond repair, and the only things that keeps me going is that she agreed to go on a date this week, and that maybe we'll be back together in the future.

I hate what I am. I hate that I couldn't just calm down, and give her the space she needs.  I'm afraid of what I'll do if this turns out to be completely over. Hell, I'm afraid of what I'll do if I botch this date up.

Edit: It just occurred to me that this date is actually today. I didn't even realize it when I asked her out.
