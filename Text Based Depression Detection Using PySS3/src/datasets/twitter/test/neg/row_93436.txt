No hopeIm so fucking depressed. 23 years old, no friends, disowned by family, no education, working a shitty job, and am a super ugly non-passing trans person. Iâ€™m coming up on the anniversary of my suicide attempt and nothing has gotten better. Everything is worse... I wish I would have died then... this time I think Iâ€™ll shoot myself...
