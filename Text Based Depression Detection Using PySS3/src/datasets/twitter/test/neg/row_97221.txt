Are there some people who the world is truly better off without?Iâ€™m bipolar. And an alcoholic. And a dropout. Iâ€™m badly in debt. I have no goals. No ambition. I literally have no desire to do anything but sleep, drink, and get high. My whole life literally revolves around when and where I can get my next drink. I risk my relationships, my job, my already shitty finances - everything to continue drinking. Or using coke when thatâ€™s not enough. 

I do care about people. I recognize that I am an absolute low life and I want to improve so I can do better by people. 

I just donâ€™t have the energy to change and I donâ€™t know how to muster it. 

Would it not be less selfish of me to just take myself and stop using up resources? I could donate my organs to someone worthy.
