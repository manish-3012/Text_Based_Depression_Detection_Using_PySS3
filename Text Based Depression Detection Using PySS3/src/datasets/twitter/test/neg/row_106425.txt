Dad doesn't care anymore, don't see why I should.My mother died summer 2013, and I've had diagnosed depression since 2011. My dad was super supportive afterwards, especially after being absent for most of my childhood because he also deals with depression. Our relationship improved ten fold, and things were doing well. 

He cold turkey stopped a decade of anti-depressants in september, and started dating. Now, he's never home and if he is, his girlfriend is here. He's always yelling, and I refuse to get in a car with him after I told him to get off his phone and he proceeded to yell at me for the entire ride home while not letting me get out, especially worse since I have claustrophobia. He thinks he's justified in this because he says I'm constantly picking at/attacking him (eg. by asking why the garage door was open,  results in him yelling if I think he's stupid). 

He knows because I let my psychologist tell him that I'm suicidal, and he locked the medicine up a while ago. I have a lot of medical issues, along with anti-depressants, so once a week he'd take it out for me. Now, he's too busy and when I ask for meds he just lets me have the entire bottle. Two full bottles of tylenol/ibuprofen, my medicine, etc - he no longer even cares about locking it up.

This, along with university applications and exams and projects and a general decline of my mental state, with little to no support anymore (a psych appoinment once every 2 weeks isnt enough) is just making everything worse. 

I've tried reaching out to my family, but they all live in Europe; they all just make up excuses, saying he's busy and dismissing things he does. They came to visit for winter break, and I was so hopeful; hopeful that they'd talk to him, that we'd all bond as a family. He barely spent time with us unless his girlfriend was there, and nothing changed.

I don't see a point anymore.
