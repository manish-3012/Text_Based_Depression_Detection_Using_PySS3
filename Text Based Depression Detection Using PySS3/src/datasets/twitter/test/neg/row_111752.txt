you win lifeI litteraly can't go on, everything has started to blur, I didn't see how bad it had become until now, when I'm trying to get better and man I actually thought I was. I thought I was getting so much better, being braver, laughing stronger, but I wasn't. I was slipping further down by the second and I can no longer move. I'm numb and finished. My legs been trampling water since before I can remember and as I'm now slowly telling them it's okay to stop my breath starts to get heavier. The day that my demons win, is no longer a distant possibility, but has become an inevitable future. 

Don't misunderstand me I do not want to die, I just feel it's the only option left to something as fucked up as me.

But "the sad part about suicide is it doesnâ€™t end the pain it just passes it to someone elseâ€
I promise you that's what keeping me.
