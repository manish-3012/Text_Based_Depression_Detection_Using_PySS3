Getting worse at hiding itBreaking down more often, like some shitty car you can't afford to take in for repairs and you just keep hoping it takes you from point A to point B again.

Also considering that maybe I was never good at hiding it and was only good at running away when it got bad.

Do they put a catheter in you at the hospital if you go in for poisoning?
