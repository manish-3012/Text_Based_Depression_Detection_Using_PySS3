what do i have to lose?nobody cares for me and nobody ever has. nobody ever tells me that they value me unless i ask them to. i know it's a selfish thing to expect, but i can't take it. i don't want to live anymore. i've gone through so much loss that i can't be alive anymore. i always lose the people in my life. i'm getting that itch to self harm again. i don't want to do this. i don't want to keep on existing. i would just be better off dead
