Killing myself next weekNot really sure what to write in my note. I donâ€™t even feel like writing one honestly. Iâ€™ve said what I said. Iâ€™m hurting badly and want to die. I just feel like it would be helpful to have something for my niece and nephew when they get older. 

Please donâ€™t tell me to wait longer, to hold on, etc. I know this is what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™ve planned this date for months. Iâ€™ve planned suicide for nearly a decade.

Iâ€™m excited to go to heaven because God will not leave me like everyone else.
