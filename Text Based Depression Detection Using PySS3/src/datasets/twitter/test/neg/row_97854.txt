Feeling hate towards my family because i am a failureDoes anyone feel anger at cousins because they are more happy and successful than you are? i didn't want to feel this way but every time some cousin of mine comes to stay here for a while i don't even talk to him, because i feel envy towards him, just because they are more happy and successful than i am, and it sucks, and this not only apply to family, friends as well, sometimes i go on facebook and see old friends just to get depressed and remember how a failure i am and it makes me fucking sad.  


anyone here feel the same?
