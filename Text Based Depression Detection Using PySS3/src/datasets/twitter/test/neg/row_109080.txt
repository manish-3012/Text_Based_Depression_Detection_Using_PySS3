I just donâ€˜t know what to doIâ€™m a 21yo male using a throwaway of course. 
Sorry I donâ€˜t know if this fits in this sub but I donâ€˜t know if talking about suicide is a thing in r/relationship_advice.
TL;DR at bottom.
Iâ€˜ve always had a hard time in live but somehow I managed to get a good job at an it company right after my vocational training.
My family is very proud of me and helped me buy my own apartment in a big city near work.
About a year ago I read something on twitter about sexuality and got to know demisexuality. Thatâ€˜s the start of me getting really confused and  it hasnâ€™t changed since.
I think I am demisexual.

I got to know a girl on a dating app, we got along pretty well in the beginning. We both deleted the app but later I found out that she used an alt account and was still on there (Friend that is mentioned later matched with her). I ghosted her for 4 months because I didnâ€˜t know how to react properly. 
Recently I contact her again but things were different and she isnâ€˜t interested in what I say anymore and ignores most things I write. I told her that I developed feelings but she said she doesnâ€™t want a relationship. I had no problem with it at first but every time I write a message it just hurts so bad. I stopped texting her again 2 weeks ago and just donâ€˜t know what to do anymore.

But thing get more complicated. I think I developed feeling for a male friend. I never was attracted to males before but now I strangely am. He asks me how things are and is interested in what I think and say. The girl is not and I really hate that.
I donâ€˜t know what to do with both of them. I think I have feeling for both. But she doesnâ€™t want a relationship and is less interested in me then before I ghosted her. He seems to be straight. But when I â€žjokeâ€œ and say to him that itâ€˜s sad he is not gay, he says he might be bi but doesnâ€˜t know yet.
Iâ€˜m very much confused and donâ€˜t know what to do. The only solution that I always get to is suicide but I donâ€˜t want to hurt my family.
I just donâ€˜t know how to cope my feelings. I want to end it all soon.

Sorry if this is unreadable Iâ€˜m on mobile and English is not my first language.

TL;DR: Got a nice job and apartment. Really 
confused feeling for a girl and my friend. Think Iâ€˜m in love with both. Donâ€˜t know what to do. Only solution I get to is suicide. Wanting to end it soon.
