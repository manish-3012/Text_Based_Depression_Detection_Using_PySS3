Only way out is death.I have been depressed almost all of my life and I just cannot take it anymore, I am completely useless when it comes to nearly everything.  Always would get terrible grades in school, and have not yet found one thing that I am good at, just feel like I suck at everything, even life itself.  I feel like I have finally reached my tipping point, the point where I either send myself to a mental institution of just end it.  My family cares about me so much, even though I know how disappointed they are with me.  I don't want them to know that I committed suicide when I am gone, so I will drive off somewhere secluded, like an abandoned coal mine I have heard about, where I will probably hang myself.  This post is my last will to be alive, I am just looking for some sort of hope.  Please, try to convince me why life is worth living.
