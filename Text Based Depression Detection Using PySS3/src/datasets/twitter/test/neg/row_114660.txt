I don't know if I really want to kill myselfI've thought about how I want to do it and stuff, obviously I won't go into detail about it. I have it planned in my head.

It's not that I want things to end, it's that I want to do something so people can see that my problems are real. That this is serious. I want my situation to be taken seriously and I honestly feel like nobody cares.

Mom, we've talked about my cutting and you asked so many questions. Maybe I didn't fucking answer correctly because after that day you haven't said another word. Maybe you're in denial. We do have problems with each other, but I wish you'd take me more seriously. 

I don't know how trying this will make me feel better, but I don't necessarily know if doing anything else will change anything. Living my life normally is draining.

Fuck 

I feel stupid.
