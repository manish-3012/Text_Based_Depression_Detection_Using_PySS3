Dropped out of school.It was hard for me to do but now there's no going back from my plan now because of this. I now have Ws on my academic record as a result of dropping classes. I've been crying for the past hour (not sobbing/sniffling but tears rolling down my face) due to the disappointment I feel in myself. My family expected me to transfer to UC Berkeley engineering but I can't do this anymore. I'm trying to make the most out of this and next week. Probably also going to make one last visit at the clinic I visit monthly this week. 

I'm going to take a personal visit to San Francisco this weekend. I've never been there and I always wanted to go there.
