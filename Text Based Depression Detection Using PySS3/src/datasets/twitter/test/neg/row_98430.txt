i can't do this anymoreI've tried to kill myself twice. I wish I'd succeeded last summer.

A few months ago, I was hospitalized before I could do anything. I can't say it really helped me.

I told my pdoc and my therapist that I was doing well just two weeks ago. And maybe I was. But now I'm not so sure.

I've been telling people I'm okay. That I won't do anything to myself. 

I don't know if I can keep that promise.

Last night I started writing a note to say goodbye to everyone I love.

It feels more and more like a relief to decide to do it. 

People tell me that I've been through a lot in the past couple of years, that I'm stronger for having survived. 

Honestly, all I feel is tiredness. I can't fight this anymore. 

There isn't anything keeping me here. I've tried to think of things that will tether me to this life, but I've come up with nothing. 

I'm tired of this cycle. I was in a bad place last year, too. It never ends. I've tried every kind of medication cocktail imaginable, I've even tried vitamin supplements.

I'm just so tired. I can't do this.
