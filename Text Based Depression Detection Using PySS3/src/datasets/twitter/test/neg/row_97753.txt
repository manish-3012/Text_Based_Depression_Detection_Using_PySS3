I am considering overdosing myself using my medication.Im in a bad state of mind, my meds fail me, and i struggle to get money for a psychologist, he is the only true emotional human interaction i get, i feel unattractive and ugly 
I know i have some meds left, i plan on hoarding it for few months say...4 or 5 and then swallow them all at once, it should be an easy way out, and no one will miss me, not to mention i wont be a dissapointment anymore
