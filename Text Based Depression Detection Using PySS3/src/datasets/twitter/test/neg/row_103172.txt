Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself??I literally have nothing to live for. I donâ€™t have friends or a family. No one in my life truly cares about me. I am always alone. I have absolutely no future ahead of me because of my social anxiety, and I am too depressed and tired to fix that. Thereâ€™s no reason to continue living.
