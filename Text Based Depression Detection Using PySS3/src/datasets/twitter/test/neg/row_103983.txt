why try?i'm gonna get straight to the point:, i really don't understand the purpose of living. i can't shake the thought that, one day, we'll all cease to exist, so why should anyone even try to delay the inevitable? i've had my fun, but i'm not strong enough to handle life's many twists and turns. i never have been and i never will be. i suppose i'm mainly just asking for a reason to stay since i can't really think of any.

also, i just want to point out that the argument about other people's feelings don't really make sense to me. i know that it'd be hard for friends and/or relatives to cope with loss, but i know they'd recover. i know they'd grow and become better people without me in their lives and i want that for them. if anything, maybe i could help the world by leaving. 

(sorry if some of that didn't make sense, my 3am thoughts are making my thoughts erratic)
