Continuing to live is a painful drag.There's no melodrama about my response, anymore. I simply want to end myself because I feel a lot of negativity for no good reason.

My only life goal is to work hard and make my parents' efforts in raising me worth it, but I'm selfish and lazy so I'm just going to fall back into the hole and land for once. 

I hate explaining my emotions to people because I examine how deeply stupid they are, and I hate myself so much more. I'm not going to drink any alcohol to numb the pain, or anything like that. I figure, if I want to face the true consequences of my actions, I should be fully conscious and present for every moment until the end.
