I plan on dying if I fail my classesfor the past few months, I've been really depressed. I've moved across the country in the middle of high school and it turns out that the school here that is much worse than my previous one. teachers aren't as nice or understanding, students are pushy and rude, the school is much smaller, and the work is much harder. I'm typically a student that gets A's and B's but now I'm failing most of my classes. most of the time I just cry in class because everything is too much. I am too depressed to do much more than sleep when I get home. I haven't been talking to my friends as much as I usually do. my parents blame me for failing and they yell at me a lot. my mom is the worst, it feels like she hates me. I've given up. if I don't get decent grades soon, I'm going to fail my classes. I don't think I'll be able to pass. plus, I have midterms soon and I'm 90% sure I'm going to fail those as well. I cant do this anymore. I'm nothing but a disappointment and a failure.
