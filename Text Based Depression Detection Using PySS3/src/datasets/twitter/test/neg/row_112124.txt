Lets not sugarcoat it, we live in a chaotic world"Life just punches you in your already beaten face again and again till you fall to the ground, bleeding and wondering why you?

Your blood spills and your wounds itch while your bones shatter and skin peals... its pain wich you cant even describe in a way wich someone who doesnt feel it would understand it. 

Still... for some reason... we fail to die. Not even a noose was enough to end it. Here you are, slowly wondering among other ghosts and empty spirits... why?"
