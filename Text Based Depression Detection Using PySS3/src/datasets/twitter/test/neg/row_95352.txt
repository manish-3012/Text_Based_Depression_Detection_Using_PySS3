It's really coming to an endI have always wanted it all to end. I want the pain. I want to feel everything and simultaneously feel nothing. My best dream is the silence of blackness. I want nothing. I cant do anything. Ive become a drone. A slave everywhere i go. I cant look people in the eye when im trying to express anything important. I dont even tell anyone im so close to jumping because im afraid of being committed. I dont think about myself at all. I hate talking about myself. Maybe one day soon, after burning my traces, ill look up and everything will be just the perfect time to head out.
