God I fucking hate myselfI'm so fucking tempted to steal my brothers unused disposable shaving razor heads. I can't stop thinking of how it would feel to have new blades, and how much I need this.
I can't live with myself anymore, I can't be the kind of person who lies and steals for my own gain. I'm tired of needing to hurt myself more then I need to live. I need to die or I need those razors.
