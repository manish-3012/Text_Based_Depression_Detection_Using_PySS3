I feel so old.How can a twenty year old have so many regrets? I can't seem to do anything right. I was alone and miserable for so long, because I didn't fit in. In high school I only had online friends because I was gay and socially awkward, then I lost them all. Sometimes I still miss them.

I went to university last year thinking that surely, if I don't fit in in a small town I'll fit in a an urban area. But I didn't. The first few months were terrible. And then I met a guy through Facebook. He was friends with some of the girls in my class. He decided to be friends with me, just because. We had no mutual friends and didn't move in the same circles.

Yet, he was my friend and introduced me to people, and made me feel good and encouraged me. Without him, I might have even killed myself. Then a few months ago, I decided I don't want to be friends with him anymore, and I told him so. So now we're not friends.

I left university and went back home. I still keep in touch with some friends from uni, we both cling to the idea I'll back next year. I won't. It's too late now. And the economy is bad. And I am not college material. I feel pathetic, like I should just delete them from facebook and stop contact.
I am supposed to go there for New Years, but no one's talking to me right now. I don't think it's gonna happen. 

It's not a big tragedy. My only two remaining friends now that he is gone, are a shut in loser and a emotionally stunted punk girl. And they only wanted to spend New Year's with me because other plans fell through. So whatever. I'll just sleep like every year.

Sleeping is my favorite part of the day now. I can forget I shouldn't have came back home, even though sometimes I dream about staying in uni.

This is the biggest mistake I made in my life. My days now consist of working and sleeping. And I don't have a crazy work week, I work less than 40 hours a week. Yet when I come home I just mindlessly browse the internet. I don't even have the attention span for video games anymore.
I thought that I could work out and find a hobby at home. That I would have more time. But I don't. I only have time to sleep.

I wish I was dead. I think about suicide every day. I'm twenty, never had a significant other, only had sex one time. I'm ugly, I have seborrhea so my skin is often red and flaky, I'm already balding... no one will ever find me attractive.
I have no talent, I have no ambition. I live in a really small town where there is nothing to do. People don't like me because I'm gay and because I'm different, I don't listen to the kind of music they do. We don't watch the same TV or read the same books. Nothing in common with anyone.

Nothing would be lost if I died. I suffocated already. I go through my days on autopilot. I am thinking overdose.
