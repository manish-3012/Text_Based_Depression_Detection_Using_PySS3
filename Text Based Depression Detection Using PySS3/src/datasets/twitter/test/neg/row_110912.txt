I think iâ€™m ready to die, rather than wanting to just wanting to escape my lifeIt has been a long time since i properly considered this and i think i donâ€™t want to be around anymore. I have been sorting things out, i didnâ€™t want to have regrets but honestly does it matter anymore? I believe, after the pain, it will be like falling asleep. I wonâ€™t even know iâ€™m dead because iâ€™m dead. As a trans-masculine person who lives in an abusive household after trying for years to get my shit together this is much preferable to living. My body already feels like like a coffin, iâ€™m unloved, and too weak to face the things i need to change.
