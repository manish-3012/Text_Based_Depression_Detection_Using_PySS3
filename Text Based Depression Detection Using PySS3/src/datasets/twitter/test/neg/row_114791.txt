When Iâ€™m dead maybe the suffering will all come to an end.Sorry for poor grammar. I have a plan this plan is to hang myself in my wooded area of my property. I donâ€™t feel safe not even at my school, my parents locked all of the knives away and that doesnâ€™t matter. I found a new way glass. It cuts much deeper and I bleed more. 
      
        For more background information I live with my parents and two other siblings Iâ€™m the youngest and am a freshmen in school. I have been sad since 6th grade and suicidal since 7th grade. Iâ€™ve tried taking my life once by suffocation with an extension cord and I lived. Ever since my depression and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse. I now know how to kill myself and will do before Christmas. I havenâ€™t set a date but the next day when I get too low my parents and siblings wonâ€™t see me. When they go searching in the woods all theyâ€™ll see is my body hanging from a tree. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m too late to fix and Iâ€™m sorry.
