I wholeheartedly regret not killing myself when I was fifteen.I think about this all the time. About how I USED to have friends, best friends even... I didn't realize how lucky I was. How valuable what I had was. And of course I had to go and fuck it up. I fuck everything up. Everything is my fault. But my entire life I've thought that having a good legacy was very important. I would've had that if I had died then. Now, I have none of that. No friends, no positive legacy. I would hate to see how much worse it could possibly get, because I know it will get worse if I stay alive. My parents will start to hate me, so will the rest of my family. I'm just an alienating machine, I alienate everyone around me. That's what makes me so utterly unlovable and easy to hate. It's just my nature, I guess.

Kill me please.
