Exam tomorrow...I have a university exam tomorrow afternoon and I don't know anything. I've been trying to go over my notes (which are a mess and full of holes) and cram last minute and I just don't know anything. I'm 95% sure I'm going to fail.

I haven't been able to study properly in the first place because I've been ill and when I DO try to study nothing goes in and I start crying and having panic attacks. Every time I try to look at my notes all I can do is cry. I can't stay calm long enough to actually memorise anything. How am I supposed to sit in an exam for hours tomorrow and write about stuff I don't know?

I genuinely feel like I'm going mad and that I'm going to do something irrational or stupid - I don't know what but I don't feel in control anymore. I'm shaking and I can't think straight and I've been like this for days - and it's getting worse and worse. I feel like I'm inches away from breaking point.
