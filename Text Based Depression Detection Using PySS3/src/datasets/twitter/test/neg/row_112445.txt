I get a strange sense of euphoria when I start thinking seriously about committing suicide.I have dealt with suicidal thoughts on and off since before I was a teenager with a couple of failed attempts. I'm 27 now and I have been doing so well lately, but I have been feeling myself fall back into my old habits of wanting to be dead. I hope I pull through this time too, but it is always hard to tell. I noticed myself losing interest in my studies and avoiding people. This is fairly normal behavior for me when I start to descend into depression. Now the fake memories are back. 

I don't know if I'm strong enough to make it this time. I thought I had found the cure for my depression when I started hrt. But now it is back. I have this deep overwhelming desire to start transitioning socially, but I cant do that. I just cant. I thought if I could just use hrt as a way to make dysphoria a little less dangerous I could do this life, but I can't. 

I'm not going to give up. I'm going to try and fight this urge. I don't know though. It will probably depend on how long this 'rut' I guess last for.
