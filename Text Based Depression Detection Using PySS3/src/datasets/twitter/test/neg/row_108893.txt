I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll even live to be a teenagerMy parents are divorced (which I know is pretty common but it still sucks), my mom made me want to die when I was around 10 because we were in a terrible place and didnâ€™t have a house and she yelled at me a lot, my dads girlfriend made me want to kill myself because I felt like I would always get in trouble around her and I know she hated/hates me. 

Almost every time I get something to eat I feel fat and I feel like everyone is judging me. I canâ€™t go more than 2 hours max without calling myself fat and ugly and hating every part of my body.

I feel like Iâ€™m just a waste of money, time, food, space, and oxygen, because Iâ€™m smart but Iâ€™m so lazy and never do anything and my grades are literally in the garbage, and I could do something, but instead Iâ€™m just sitting in my room wasting my life away on my phone or laptop.

I always feel like a disappointment to everyone around me.

If I was dead then my mom could spend money on her important, not-broken, daughter that actually has a potential. If I was dead then my dad and his girlfriend would finally have their stupid little dumb family with light any idiot depressed children that canâ€™t do anything right.

And life is just too stupid and broken and I hate it so much. I do not want to be alive.
