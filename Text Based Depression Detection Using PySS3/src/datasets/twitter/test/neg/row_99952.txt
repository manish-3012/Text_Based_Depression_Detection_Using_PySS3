Me, and everybody else, are dots.i have no problem at all with personal life at all, everything there is doing fine, but what is the meaning of life? i will most likely have no purpose on this planet, but even if i would, so what? i would only live for a few decades. if the timeline of everything was put in a straight line, i, and everything ever to exist on this planet, would be a small, pointless, small dot on the long, long line. we are dots. all life on this planet will eventually die out, our sun will die, everything will keep on going like nothing ever happened. why was i cursed with the brain capacity to know about our insignifigantness? i should've been born a dog, damn it! i might as well make that "dot" of my 70 years or so shorter. It's pictures like these: http://www.co-intelligence.org/newsletter/comparisons.html         that make me think this way.
