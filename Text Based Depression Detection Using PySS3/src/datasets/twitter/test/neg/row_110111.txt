I tried drowning myself in the bath.The first week of November, probably the fifth, I was in the bath and I was holding a razor blade for sometime and I kept dropping it on the floor every time someone knocked on the door and eventually I tried just staying underwater staring at the ceiling. I was very close to drowning until a there was a bang on the door and my cousin said â€œ Are you pulling a hannah baker in there?â€ I got up and out and got dressed and just sat outside for a few hours, doing nothing. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I havenâ€™t told anyone. I donâ€™t think anyone will care because I didnâ€™t do anything to cause long term damage and it wasnâ€™t a very good method. Theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m just being dramatic.
