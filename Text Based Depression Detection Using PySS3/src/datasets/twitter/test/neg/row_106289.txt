Everything just seems to be spiraling downward mentally.If any of the people who know my reddit account sees this, hi. I want to kill myself, yes. Couldnâ€™t care less anymore if they do see this, but Iâ€™ve already disconnected from most of them enough that theyâ€™ll never see this. 

With that out of the way, I donâ€™t even know what to say. Iâ€™ve been to three separate mental hospitals, all in the span of 5 months, with one having me stay there for two months straight. It actually helped, yâ€™know? Came back invigorated and ready to fight the good fight.

But, of course, my home life had to kick me right back down. Iâ€™ve gotten back up, yes, each and every time, but with each passing day itâ€™s simply harder and harder to stay positive. 

My parents have always told me that Iâ€™ve had a â€œmagicalâ€ childhood. 

Whatâ€™s magical about depression? 

Whatâ€™s magical about being told youâ€™re a brainwashed cultist for believing that climate change *isnâ€™it* a conspiracy created by the Chinese in order to kill billions of people?

Whatâ€™s magical about sobbing into the arms of the father who five minutes previous blamed every one of his problems on you and that you were â€œholding him hostageâ€ with your mental illness, and shouting into his arms about how much you want to slash your neck open? 

Whatâ€™s magical about attempting suicide twice, with a third almost happening due to your parents making you feel like a worthless piece of shit, screaming and cursing you out at 3 in the morning while youâ€™re sobbing into your pillow?

If thatâ€™s magical, Iâ€™m fucking Merlin.

Iâ€™ve written to my parents because I couldnâ€™t verbally explain what was going on with me.

Of course they told me they understood. Of course.

They didnâ€™t. It was just a continual cycle of blaming and punishing the kid for his mental illness that he couldnâ€™t control.

I only have a few reasons to keep going, and goddamnit theyâ€™re getting less and less important.

I run campaigns for D&amp;D, I have a girlfriend, I have supportive friends, I have pets who would miss me, but it just all seems more and more *unimportant.* 

Iâ€™ve talked to my therapist, of course, but it was simply addressed with â€œwell are you gonna act on it? no? okâ€ and that was that. No comfort. No support. No advice. Just handle it all on your fuckinâ€™ own, I guess. 

With each passing day I hate myself more and more, and eventually thatâ€™s gonna boil over and I know it. But fuck, I donâ€™t wanna go back to inpatient. I donâ€™t wanna have to wear scrubs and wait for three days to get into the same place and have my parents ask what they did wrong again and again.

Everythingâ€™s starting to lose itself, and Iâ€™m dissociating more and more.

Fuck me.
