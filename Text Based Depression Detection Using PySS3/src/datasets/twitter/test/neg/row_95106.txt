I feel like Iâ€™m not supposed to be hereI genuinely thought I wouldnâ€™t make it to the age 16. But Iâ€™m almost 20 now. And Iâ€™m laying here just thinking like why am I here. Whatâ€™s the point. Am I supposed to be here. I donâ€™t feel like I belong anywhere, or with anyone. I just feel like I should go. You know what I mean? Like I need constant validation for some reason otherwise I feel drained and broken and just empty and I donâ€™t get it why canâ€™t I just be happy
