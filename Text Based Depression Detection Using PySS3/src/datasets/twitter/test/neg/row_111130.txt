some days...Some days, the loneliness is amplified and intensified so much, that its physically painful.

Some days things just reach a new all time low.

Some days its unequivocally clear that regardless of anyone's well-wishing, hope, love, etc., that my life doesn't have a happy ending.

Some days I surprise myself in realizing I still haven't completely hit rock bottom, but continue to fall even lower.

Some days I just can't deal with the self-serving, religious bullshit about every life being sacred because 'God' made you. Fuck that. If God made me, then I hate him for it.

And some days... I actually understand, COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, the depth of how I'm a genetic mistake...

And that just makes everything even worse.
