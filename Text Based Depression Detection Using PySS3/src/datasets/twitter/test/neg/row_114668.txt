I've given up so much I can't even feel depressedI really don't give a shit anymore. I can't feel anything. even when friends, and family try and instill something in my mind, knowing doesn't help. if things don't improve by the end of this month I'm selling my possessions so people I don't trust will get it, then i'm going to jump.
