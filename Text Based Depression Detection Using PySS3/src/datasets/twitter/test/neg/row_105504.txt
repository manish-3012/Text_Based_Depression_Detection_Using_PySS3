It doesn't feel great when you're suicidal qnd peopel you know or around you dieOctober my fav singer killed herself. 

November her best friend (a singer too) committed suicide. 

December one of my coworker (I didn't know him directly) died because of heart attack when he was working at late night, no one knew until next morning. 

January a son of my mom's friend died in his sleep because some disease that he tried to hide from his mom. 

I want to die nearly every single day of my life. But I'm still alive and watching people around me dying.
