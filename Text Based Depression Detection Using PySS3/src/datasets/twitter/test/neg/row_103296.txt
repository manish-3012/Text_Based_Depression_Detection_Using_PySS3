Iâ€™m nobody and I donâ€™t fit into the worldI keep messing up. I end up frustrating those around me. I overthink every interaction, and I feel the universe working against me.

I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™m cursed. No matter what I do Iâ€™m always the one on the outskirts. I feel everyone around me connecting and having close relationships and being a part of the world, and then thereâ€™s me.

Iâ€™m so alone in my physical world. I donâ€™t know why I had to be born to be alone like this. I donâ€™t know why I had to exist. I keep on hearing from those around me who say they love me that Iâ€™m important and Iâ€™ve made lives better, but what else do you say to a depressed pathetic loser who has nothing going for them?

I just want to end it all. Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself on Friday. I go back to University tomorrow as Iâ€™m at my parentsâ€™ house lamenting over how shitty I am and feeing like my friends are slipping away.

I donâ€™t have a future. I feel like Iâ€™ve created this evil force in the world. I feel like Iâ€™m cursed. And the only way to break it is to finally be brave enough to kill myself.

I feel it following me wherever I go. The weight of others. I just canâ€™t do this. I canâ€™t keep living like this.

I donâ€™t want to live til next year, when Iâ€™m 21 and likely still a traumatized, pathetic, piece of shit.

I just want to kill myself. I just want to cry. I just want to punish myself and rid the world of my evil.
