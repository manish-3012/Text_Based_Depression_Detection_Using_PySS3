I feel like I'm losing myself.23 year old male.

Losing friends at a rapid pace to various things, and losing touch with... everything, just about.

I don't like where I'm at in life, especially knowing that I basically do it to myself.

I can't deal with people. I'm nice to them, sure, but I hate them. I hate the way most people act, how they speak, how they walk. They disgust me. I don't want to hurt anyone, I'm just becoming more and more aware that I am alone. And I will be, probably forever.

I have a girlfriend, and I love her dearly. But even that has it's issues that are entirely in my head.

I can't seem to stop thinking, and I find myself getting completely absorbed in my own thoughts to the point where my mood changes drastically, or I start to cry.

I can't afford therapy, which would be the ideal situation. I don't have anyone I can completely honestly talk to.

I'd love to have a person to just rant to and get feedback. But I don't have that at all.

I feel like I'm slowly losing grip of myself and... well, reality, almost.

I feel completely doomed. Wholly and utterly fucked.
