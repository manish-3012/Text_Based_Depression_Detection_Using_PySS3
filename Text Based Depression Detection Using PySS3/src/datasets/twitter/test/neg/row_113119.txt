My life has no purpose, I am broke, lonely and miserable. I'm so done.I'm not going into too many details mainly because from experience people will take one factoid, make up a whole bunch of stuff in their head and judge you harshly for it, or assume things due to lack of context.

But my life is a sack of shit. 

My family legitimately hate me
I am poor
I have some friends, but don't hear from them unless I get in touch first
I have been single for almost a decade. Generally I am ok with being single but some dates wouldn't go amiss.

I literally care about nothing any more. My dreams and goals seem like stupid things that I am not good enough to achieve. I've tried, but depression grinds my world to a halt.

Doctors don't help me
Nobody around me seems to understand

This has gone on for 30+ years. I am tired. cant do it any more.

I just want to lay down and die quietly. All I want in life is to disappear.
