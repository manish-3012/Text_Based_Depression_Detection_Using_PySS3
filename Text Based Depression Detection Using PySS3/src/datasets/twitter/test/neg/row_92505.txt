Basically given up. I've pretty much given up on my life and everything in it.

I've sold most of my belongings, and my car is the only thing left.

I don't even know why i'm posting here, to be honest, why would total strangers care about one person's problems? Someone they have no clue about, what they've done, look like or what they've been through


And I expect you to care? Sort of selfish if you ask me. Sorry for wastin' your time.
