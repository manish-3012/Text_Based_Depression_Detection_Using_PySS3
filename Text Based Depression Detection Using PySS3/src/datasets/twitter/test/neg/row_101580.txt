I have tried for years. It doesn't get better.I have tried so hard for 5 years. I escaped an abusive enviroment, i got into a relationship, i graduated, i have lost 20 kilos.

But I can't get a job. I don't have a license, and i can't afford to get one, but i can't get a job without it. i have the skills to function well enough to get a job, but no job history either.

i can't afford mental health treatment, which makes it harder to get a job/work, but i need to work to get treatment.

Therapy (when i could get it) has made it possible for me to make a phone call.. but even 4 years later, my guts curl up so tight, and i can't breathe, and i want to vomit.

i literally can't even afford a vacuum or a drying rack for my dishes.

I have to be responsible for EVERYTHING in my relationship.

I am constantly ill. my list of chronic illness grows and grows, and on top of it, i have tonsilitis.


there is no one i can rely to help me get out of this hole. no services can help. whats the fucking point?  

kill myself now, or end up homeless when something goes wrong.
