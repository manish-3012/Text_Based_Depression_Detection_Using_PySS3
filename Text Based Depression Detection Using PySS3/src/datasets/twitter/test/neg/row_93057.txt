"The talk."My boyfriend's father killed himself and he feels guilty for it. We are dating for over a year now and just started to feel comfortable to talk about it (his dad did it 2 months before we met) and I'm struggling. It's so hard to deal with two mental health. He says that he feel guilty because he should have done something and saw the "signs", and spoke to him one last time. Please, help me. I really want to help but I don't know  what to say. I don't know if I should sympathize or say like "what's done is done." When I was in *those* moments and people just sympathized, it made me so mad. And too, should I bring it up to him, or keep waiting to when he's ready? Should I ask more about how was his dad ?
