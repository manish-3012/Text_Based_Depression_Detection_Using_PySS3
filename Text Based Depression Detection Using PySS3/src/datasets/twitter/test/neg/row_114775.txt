I've fucked up my life and I just feel like a worthless piece of dirtI know what I did sounds terrible and it is.

I've been mostly happy and content with my life, until I set off to university. I'm studying a medical degree, and I really do want to be a doctor but I felt lonely during everyday life. I'm pretty fat (losing weight though) but even if I lost all my weight, I'd still be pretty ugly so I doubt any guy (I'm gay) would ever be attracted to me. I like to think I'm funny and sometimes I can be but mostly I just say things for attention and I just get rightfully ignored. I find it hard to motivate myself and I just think I'm not going to be a good doctor which means I'll have to quit then I have nothing because my father spent all his life savings on a worthless idiot like me and he's struggling just to hold his job from day to day and i won't have the means to get a job.

But anyway, i met this guy on an online game and he was awesome to be around. But instead of being honest I made up a fictional sex life (yeah, sad I know) and gave him fake pictures of some prettier guy so he would talk to me. Even though it was fake, he fell in love with "me" and I guess I kinda lost myself in this fantasy. We talked every day played games .etc and i even made up that I had a brain injury, that I was stupid and that I would die soon and needed surgery (like I'm just so fucked up, I was trying to emotionally blackmail someone) in order to feel pity and he'd be so nice. So i pretended to be on surgery while I went on holiday with my family but when i came back he had told me he discovered that they were fake pics.

I wanted to come clean then but I just couldn't. So i just went with another set of pictures instead and lied to him again. That was about a year ago and we were friends for that time, but he stopped "loving" the fake person I made. 

He discovered that I lied to him again like at 3am on the day of the Paris attacks, he discovered my true identity, and he said we can't be friends anymore which i could understand, I pretty much did something illegal and it was a douchebag thing to do.

But for some fucked up reason i feel lonely and depressed now that hes gone, I feel like he was the only person ive beeen talking to for 2 years, and that my life was basically a lie during that time. I failed year 2 of med school and im retaking it and I feel like ive just ruined every aspect of my life as well as ruining his. I've spent a collective 300Â£ on gifts to him and I dont understand why, if my father knew he'd disown me for good reason

So I wrote a long letter of apology to him which took me all day today and he wont read it (understandable) and now he's told me that he knows everything about me and that he'll sue me and ruin my life and im scared he'll tell the person i took the photos from (he somehow found his facebook profile and hes a guy from uni so he'll tell everyone about it).

Just everything is ruined, got no more money in the bank, got no friends, catfished someone and ruined his life, now hes threatening me and I dont think anyone would trust me as their doctor. 

I've never felt like killing myself before (well when i was a teenager I had exagerrated strops) but I'm seriously considering it now, what is there to lose? My brothers miles ahead of me both in school (hes a doctor now) and in life as he as lots of friends and I have nothing to lose. And I don't want anyone to find out that I catfished to such an extent before I die.

just dont know what to do
