Tired of fightingIâ€™m so behind everyone at my age in life.
Iâ€™m too quiet
Iâ€™m ugly 
Iâ€™m anxious 
Iâ€™m angry
Iâ€™m depressed
Iâ€™m worthless 
I have no skills
Iâ€™m a bad person
Iâ€™m a failure
Iâ€™m always exhausted 
I say the wrong things
I cry myself to sleep
I feel too much or Iâ€™m numb
I have bad thoughts all the time

I canâ€™t fix myself 
Iâ€™ve tried
I canâ€™t rely on others to help me
In the end Iâ€™m all alone, if I canâ€™t cope with that now, I donâ€™t think I ever will. 

I stay alive for others but all I seem to do is disappoint them.
