Im just sad and have never wamted to die more than everI was with my girlfriend today and she doesnt have a great situation going on and i asked to help and she didnt open up and was stubborn so I just bought her some food and let her be because i thought it was what she wanted and i felt like she needed food so i bought her some and went home. Im stressing about college and having to pay books monday. Im just stressing and dont open up to people at my house because they arent going to help me with any words. I come home and my dad complained about my mom watching the news every night. I ask what his deal is and he proceeds to mimic me as a twelve year old and my dad really wasnt there emotionally for me growing up and just about anything hurtful he says really gets to me so it made me think i was some pievlce of shit. He then "talked" to my dog and asked him if he was happy unlike me and i know this is retarded but that really fucking hurt because they never ever fucking ask how im doing at all and its just all i need sometimes. I try to be so nice to everyone and i get shit on in return by my family. I wanted to tell him that hes been such a great fucking role model and that hes been there so much like a dad. Sarcastically obviously and instead im here now crying in my room with my cat who hugged me and made me feel a bit better but honestly i wanna run away and not come back. I wanna get in my car and drive into a pole on the expressway and call it a day. Im so tired of always taking everyones shit. Nothing i do thats good is seen its always the little mistakes i make that im reprimanded for. I feel like a piece of shit who is a waste of life. I wasnt supposed to be born anyway i wish i hadnt been and i wish my moms lost kids wouldve been born instead. They wouldve been better off than me. I dont think ill kill myself tonight but i dont know anymore. It isnt the first time and thats the strongest ive ever felt it ive almost driven into poles before or a barrier but i dont. I dont know what keeps me here. I wish i was dead.
