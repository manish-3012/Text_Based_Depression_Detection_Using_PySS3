Is there any fail-safe way to make your suicide seem an accident? As not to hurt family and friendsI'm not suicidal at this point but I am bored. If whatever I'm doing in school these next few semesters doesn't work out the way I want them to, then I think the only thing I'd rather really do is commit suicide. I know it's this terrible thing to want but, aside from hurting close ones, I can't reason my way out of it. I have hardly any friends, literally close to zero. The one thing that has always kept my self-esteem above zero has been my supposed intelligence and if that turns out to be a farce then all this life has been for shit. 

I feel so unintelligible all the time anymore. It is what I had relied on my entire life and now I'm slowly coming to realize that I am on the fringes of that society. I can't be accepted into the high-iq circles because my iq's not there and likewise with my own because my social skills aren't there. I'm on my own with practically nothing to take solace in. No way to enjoy my solitude. I try to read fiction and am annoyed at not understanding it. I try to watch shows, movies and it happens again. 

So it's not exactly that my life is terrible, it's more that it's not anything special at all. I would prefer nothing to the highs that I'm constantly in pursuit of and the lows that I'm only ever given. It's shitty and I want out. But I want to be nice about how I go. I don't want to be talked out of anything, I just want to be given the nicest way out for all those involved.
