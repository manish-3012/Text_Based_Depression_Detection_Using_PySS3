I want to but I can'tI have no one with me. No one cares about what would happen. Everyone just replaces me at the first chance they get. I'm a disposable person and no one would care anyway. If I try to talk to anyone about how I feel they'll just use it against me or say that I'm being dramatic. My family hates me, my brother hits me and my parents blame me for it. I have no friends and I know everyone that is stuck with me would be relieved that I am gone. I have thought about it so many times. Its the only way to not feel sad anymore but it scares me. It feels me with so much dread I can't sleep at night. My head says I should but then the idea of it scares me so much. I want to die but death scares me.
