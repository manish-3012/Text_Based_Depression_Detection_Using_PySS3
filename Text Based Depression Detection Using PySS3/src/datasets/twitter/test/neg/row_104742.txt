Please help meI think everyone would be happier without me and Iâ€™m afraid this would later lead to an attempt which is the lst thing I want. I think if I died in my sleep Iâ€™d be happier knowing everyone was tired of me and now they donâ€™t have to be. Iâ€™ve gone through about 9 years of constant bullying, being left out, false sexual assault accusations, and multiple attempts at ruining my life. Iâ€™ve attempted to change my personality to be a more likeable person but thereâ€™s people blocking me on Snapchat before I even add them because of what people say about me. This life is getting very tough to get through and Iâ€™m trying to fight to at least 80. You know the Earth is cruel to you when youâ€™re nothing but nice to people but because you canâ€™t fight back, they turn your life to ashes. Of everyone Iâ€™ve met in my entire life, I only trust 1 or 2 depending on if theyâ€™re against me that week or not.
