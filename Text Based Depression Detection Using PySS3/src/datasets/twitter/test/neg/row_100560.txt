An endless roller coaster of suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ll be fine for a few weeks then boom! A wave of death obsession rolls in. It goes away and Iâ€™m back to normal. I canâ€™t trust anyone enough to talk to them because of the immense fear that they will freak out, report me, and Iâ€™ll go to the psych ward. If I go back there I will most likely be hit with a $10k charge and be bankrupt. Itâ€™s really hard every time because I know that is probably what will happen. I want to call a hotline just to talk to someone, but I also donâ€™t want to waste anyoneâ€™s time with my nonstop rambling. I think about how to die, where to die, when to die, what happens if it doesnâ€™t work, how to make it work, how to deal with the pain... The current thought is that if I donâ€™t get rid of my debt and save some money this year I will kill myself. I canâ€™t stop spending money. I canâ€™t stop eating junk food and sleeping all day *really really embarrassing to talk about* My physical health is declining. There is just no reason to go on living other than seeing my friends. Sorry to post this rant/meaningless post. I just need to clear my head.
