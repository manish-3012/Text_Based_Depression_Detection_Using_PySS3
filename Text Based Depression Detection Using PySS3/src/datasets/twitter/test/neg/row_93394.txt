HopelessI think this is the end. I either dont do anything or die. I think i wont do anything for a while than decide. 

I can never get a job. Im so unstable. I dun wanna try to fix it anymore. I just will stay home. I give up on life. Im just gonna exist until im ready. 

Im so disappointed in myself. Im so useless. Even if i got a jlb. I would quit so fast. I am sk unstable. I cry easy. Panic is getting super common now. 

Im a goner.  Nobody would ever hire or keep me. I wish i can get food stamps or something. And never leave home. Ever again.
