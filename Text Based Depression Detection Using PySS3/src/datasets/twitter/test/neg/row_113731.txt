vent? idki've thought about suicide in the past. i've always dismissed it due to the fact that there's no easy painless methods available to me, so i've never really considered it a big problem. i'd say i've started having thoughts about 1-2 years back, although in the past few months they've really started to pick up.

not sure why i have these thoughts. i have some great friends, loving parents, etc. maybe the way i am as a human. i've never shared any of my personal thoughts and feelings, only once when i shared something a month back. compared to my friends who are vaguely open about their feelings, i've always just been the silent type. it's really because i just don't want anyone to worry about me, especially since they've got their own personal struggles to deal with. right now a major factor to why i'm alive is the friends and family that care about me. i feel like ending it all would be a selfish choice. i view death as not something to fear, more as a release to all the pain and stress and responsibilities life hurls at you. to end your own life is to have that release early, but at the expense of the pain your friends and family would go through following your death.

not sure why i felt compelled to post here, if i had to guess its to maybe release some of the emotion i've been closing off for all my life. sorry you had to read this, but thanks. i don't need any help.
