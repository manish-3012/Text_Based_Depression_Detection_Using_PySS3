family member wont take help. (x-post r/advice, r/self)Here's the situation. I have a family member. At the age of 18ish, he went to jail for shooting someone who stabbed him. He got out 2 years ago. Since then, he has struggled terribly to re-acclimate to life on the outside. It hasn't gone well. Jobs are impossible to find, the house he lives in (also the house i live in) is filled with insane and negative people. And of course, he's still on parole. A few months ago, the poor guy finally caught a break; he found a girl who could see beyond his past, and they started dating. But recently things got really bad. One stupid drunken night, he slept with her best friend, and the girl dumped him. He went into a serious depression, and attempted to end his own life with an overdose of heroine, xanax, and valium. We found him before it was too late, and managed to get him to the hospital, and later into a psychiatric ward. They released him on the promise that he would take the medication they prescribed.
He did not. Last night we found a helium tank, and a bag and cord set up in his room, along with plans on how to use it to kill himself again. We took it, but he found out, bought another one and attempted to barricade himself in his room. We managed to stop him, but he threatened physical violence if we tried again, against us, and especially against police officers, in the hope that they would shoot him. Suicide attempts are also a violation of parole, so even if the cops managed to take him without incident, he would go to jail, where he would most certainly succeed. We don't know what to do. Please guys, things are really bad.
tl;dr family member wants to commit suicide, and we can't stop him. help.
