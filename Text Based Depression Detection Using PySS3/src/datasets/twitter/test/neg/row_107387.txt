i was so fucking closestopped talking to my 2 best internet friends because i didnt want them to know that ive killed myself 3 months passed and when i decided to do it on the next day one of them texted me if i want to play gta with them like it was some kind of plan

i was so fucking close and although it was back in like february i think and i told everyone im okay i lied because shit is not okay

everynight i would lay down on bed thinking that it would be better if i did it then if i didnt respond to him fuck everything would be so great they wouldnt know i did it and now i just dont know what to do i dont want them to suffer or think bad of me

i dont want to disappoint anybody ill be 18 soon and i dont want to live till my next birthday im scared what will they think that it could be theirs fault that they didnt see me suffering

but they did before the 3 month break they saw me breaking but all of us were suffering then and i did my best to keep a good face but im just tired after doing so this long

i dont want them to feel bad they are the only people i could care about because if not them i wouldnt have anybody and i lied to them multiple times big time and they always forgive me i dont know what to do

i want to leave but i cant because of them

it would be so simple but now its fucked up and i cant figure out whether to kill myself which i see as selfish in this position or not

sorry for the long post ive just been writing and writing whats on my heart.
