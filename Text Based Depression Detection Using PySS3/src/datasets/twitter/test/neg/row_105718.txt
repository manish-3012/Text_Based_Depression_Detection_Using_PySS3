I just don't want to try any more.Two weeks ago, I was sent to the local hospital because I was preparing to take my own life, and my roommate caught me. 
When I got to the hospital, I was completely honest with them on how I felt. The way they responded just made me feel so much worse. They asked, if they sent me home with some kind of counseling appointment, what I would do. And I told them, I would try to kill myself again. They sent me home anyways. I was dead tired when I got home, so I just ended up falling asleep.

The counseling appointment they set for me, is for tomorrow. I'm really anxious, and nervous, and scared about it. The doctors at the hospital didn't seem to care at all if I live or die. What if this doctor is like that?  I've already decided that if the doctor just prescribes me medication, that I'm just going to take it all, and hope it kills me. 

I just really do not see a point in trying any more. Everything feels pointless, and honestly, if my razor wasn't so dull, I'd slice my arms open. I'm scared, I'm tired of feeling alone, and I just don't want to try any more.  And honestly, I don't know why I'm wasting any of your alls time with this.
