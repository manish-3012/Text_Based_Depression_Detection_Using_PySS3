NaNo2 is my way outItâ€™s my time. Sitting outside in 68 degree weather in may and my face is swelling and burning. This will be my third summer of hiding inside from the sun and heat. 

I lost it all. My family/wife/kids. Most of my monthly income, and my face was disfigured 

I donâ€™t hate life, life is beautiful, I just canâ€™t live with these permanent, awful circumstances.
