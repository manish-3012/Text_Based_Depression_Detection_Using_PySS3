I don't know what to put here.Years and years I've been with my "husband," except we're not married, which is fine. It's just what we tell people. It's easier. 

He's had this dream that is a great dream, more or less helping disadvantaged populations. It's such a long story, but we've endured so much together - deaths and heartaches and now, I literally am in foreclosure and on the verge of bankruptcy. It's a fucking mess, getting a dream off the ground. Like, have you ever seen movies about crazy artists or entrepreneurs who put everything on the line because they just *believe* and in the end, they were right. That's been our life. 

He's working out of town, he finally cracked into what he wants to do - meaningful work in a meaningful way and the end is in sight. He's getting fantastic pay, and he's going to be starting the project he's always wanted. Always believed in.

And last night, he's asks why I haven't been aggressive about finding a place to live so we can move permanently. Part of it was just waiting for a final contract, but a lot of it is being afraid of the future. He's been so distant since he started working out of town - not like an affair - like he got *busy* so all of his problems melted away. I put up with his alcoholism for years, and now that's gone. But I'm still here and depressed. 

And so we talked and I figured it out. He still loves me, but he's not in love with me. I stood by him for so long. So fucking long. And right now, I'm so scared. I can't even get a legit hug out of him. It's a big move, a move I want to do, but I want to do it with someone who's in love with me. 

In these years, I've managed to alienate all my friends. I was always the strong one, and I just couldn't do it, handle all their problems when I was going through all this. And I literally have no family. No parents, no aunts or uncles, no siblings, no fucking where to go. My family tree makes Charlie Brown's look like a stately old oak. 

I have these books you know. And I've got a plan, but I've got these fucking dogs. I love my dogs, but they're old. No one wants them. So do you take the dogs with you. I don't know. I look at them and think horrible things and I just don't know.
