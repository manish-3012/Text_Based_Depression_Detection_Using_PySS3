Living feels emptyFor years now I've felt empty. I have no drive, no passion, no love, no will to do anything. My future is grim given my circumstances with not much to look foward to and my current home state is terrible on a good day. I don't feel a need or a want to keep living. When I'm not at work which is where I can barely muster up enough fake happiness to persevere through the day I'm either asleep, crying, or doing nothing. It feels as if I have no soul to fuel me. No fire to drive me. I don't want to live. I'm 18 and haven't done anything stupid until this point because I thought the years of feeling this way were just something teens go through. I've been in love, held jobs, been on my own, finished school, etc. It feels like my life has been standard in terms of what a young adult should have been or is currently doing. On good weeks I eat a meal about two times if not less. I don't enjoy living. I feel completely void and empty.
