I'm not sure I want to transition anymore.I made a post a while ago about my mom denying hormones, because my dad doesn't feel comfortable about my transition. To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about it anymore either. Ever since I figured out I was trans, I've been dreaming about hormones (estrogen and an antiandrogen), but now I'm not sure if I want them anymore. I'm not sure anymore if I want to live as a transgirl anymore, but I don't want to live as a cisboy either. This whole thing with my parents made me realize my doubts and my dysphoria and depression has doubled.  I'm not sure if I want to live at all anymore. I've realized how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. How my whole life will be dictated by being trans. I'm not sure if that's what I really want. I don't want to see any posts about how awful my parents are, because they aren't. In less than a week, I've turned against them. I've built them up as these horrible people who don't want me to transition, but stay as a boy in agony. I've really turned against my mom and to a greater extent my dad. I know they want what's best for me, but I'm not sure I do. I can't live day to day hating everyone, myself included, crying myself to sleep, and blaming my parents after all they've done for me just because they didn't honor one request. I feel so spoiled and childish. I would probably be dead if not for how selfless I am. I can't bare to force my parents to lose their youngest child. Everyone always says, how no parent should have to bury their child. I can't do that to my parents. To my friends. To my younger cousins who love me so much. I fucking hate myself and my life and I'm not sure what to do anymore.
