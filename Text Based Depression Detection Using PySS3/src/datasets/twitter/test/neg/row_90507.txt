Relatable amirite?That moment when you have done nothing in your life and wasted it and know that things will never get better and that you'll never actually do anything with your life or take care of yourself because throughout your whole life everything was just handed to you, and you also hate yourself because you're a pretentious self absorbed asshole who only ever cares and wants to talk about themselves and you feel like a selfish prick for being suicidal because you know that there are other people with much bigger problems, which in the end creates a viscous cycle of constant self hatred and pain because the more you hate yourself, the more you want to die, but the more you want to die, the more you end up hating yourself, and the only way that you can even somewhat put all of this at ease is by uploading meaningless shitposts to the internet rather than getting help or talking about your problems.

Y'know what I mean?
