Suicide because of tattoosI canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t eat, my hands are shaking. When i turned 18, I got 2 extensively large tattoos on my torso thinking it was cool. I was DJ, influenced by people around, who were really accepting &amp; I felt good around them. I didnâ€™t realise that time that the people around are temporary but tattoos not. I graduated with straight As, got to the faculty of law at my university. But then it started. Even though my tattoos are not visible at all when I wear a top, the fatalistic pressure from the people around now got inside my head and keeps eating my brain cells. What if they see it? What would they think? Theyâ€™ll definitely think Iâ€™m a junkie or a criminal. Iâ€™ve been single-minded all my life and wanted to do great things. Those tattoos were an absolute error and I donâ€™t understand my past-self. I keep scrolling chats with my parents crying and repeating out loud I shouldâ€™ve asked them. I stigmatised myself thinking it was cool and now I just hate my body, hate my tattoos and I feel dissociated from it. Thereâ€™s no way of this getting better. Iâ€™ll vanish and my body will too
