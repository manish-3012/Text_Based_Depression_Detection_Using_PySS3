My stepfather just killed himself and now I'm concerned about my motherFirst of all, sorry if it's the wrong place to post this, if so feel free to remove it.

I was just informed by the police an hour ago that my stepfather killed himself. I am currently waiting for my sister to get here so I can go to the police station and answer their questions. My mother won't stop crying and the reason I am concerned about her is because years ago she went through a serious depression and attempted suicide several times. She has always been the type to try to do it on impulse and I'm terrified if I leave her for just a moment she will do something.

She keeps saying it's her fault because they had a fight, that she doesn't know how she will survive and that she's alone now. They had just bought a new car which she can't pay on her own so there's money concerns as well.

I don't know what to do. I have work and so does my sister, we can't be watching her 24/7 and my grandpa is too old to be babysitting her all the time. She's on sick leave and feels old and I am terrified this is becoming a perfect storm.
