im sick and tired of even attempting to try anything anymore.Everytime I try to do something good it never works for me. For years I have been trying to get work and had a chance recently only to be told recently That again for the 400th time ( probably ) unsuccesful again. it does not help considering I recently tried to commit suicide for a number of reasons that I wont get into here. Im always tired, not really hungry, always in pain ( I have sciatica and am scheduled for surgery but not until 2020 ), Have no ambition at all. I have no friends I can talk too and have never been in a relationship before and is one of the things I desperatly want. I have multiple Diplomas and still nobody is even interested in helping me. As I am sitting here writing this letter, the Crisis response team are going to be meeting me later on today to help me but at the moment I just dont want to be here or do anything now considering whats going on. My family don't care about me. I was suppose to help my dad at his Resthome with taking people out in the van for drives etc but I stopped doing that recently because of 2 reasons. One being I had the flu and did not want to spread it ( was 2 weeks ago and usually need to stay away from resthome for a week anyhow ) and the second reason was I wanted to go and see dad in hospital and I had taken a couple staff who asked to see him too so went to take them only to be told when I arrived "The staff want to see dad privately so you can't see him today." I expressed that I wanted to go only to be laughed at and told "we don't care about your personal life, Just shut up and drive us." That got me down in the dumps pretty bad ( as im writing this I am crying about it ). I got a text from dad saying I was a Disapointment for not going to RH which I have not responded to yet as I dont know how to respond to that
