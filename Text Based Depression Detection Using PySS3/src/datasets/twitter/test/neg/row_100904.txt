What am I supposed to do?I'm not happy. I don't enjoy anything. I've suffered with depression for 6 years but never been treated for it. I constantly think about suicide and the fact that no one will miss me, or probably even realize I'm gone. I don't see a point anymore, honestly this is just useless.
