I don't know what to do...I'm only 18. I know I still have my whole life ahead of me, but I can't get over my depression. It's an overwhelming existential depression and I can't shake it. I give myself little goals to help occupy my mind and prevent myself from realizing that there really is no purpose to living other than what I give it, but it doesn't help. I'm just going to post half of what I wrote down a few nights ago to help maybe understand my situation.

" 	Hedonism and escapism are the only ways to deal with knowing that nothing I, you, or anyone else will ever do, can prevent them or me from dying. We all come to an end and the only pleasure we receive in life is tainted with knowing it is all fleeting and there will be an opposite, but equal, lack of pleasure. Why save the planet when it will eventually be engulfed by the Sun anyways? Iâ€™m not alone, but feel that way. Iâ€™m burdened intellectually and force myself every night to ponder why I am so obsessed with thinking about the impossible and the things I cannot change. Ignorance is a blissful gift I would choose if given the chance again because life is truly a fleeting experience that is hard to cherish when there is always the lingering and none too subtle questioning of â€œwhyâ€. 
Purpose is only meaningful in the individualâ€™s terms. You give yourself a purpose or allow another to do so for you. However, when everything comes to an end, the only two reasons you did anything was to avoid death (which is inevitable) and for pleasure (which never lasts). Pointless comes nowhere close to accurate in my conveyance of how I feel on the subject of living. It seems almost transcendental to want to die. We are creatures of purpose, but given none other than what we as a species create. There is no plan, no God, just life as energy. 
The brain is only a machine that processes signals and converts them to sight, sound, thought, taste, and touch. We are physical constructs made solely to fuck, reproduce, and keep going on, creating our own purpose. But what happens when one begins to question if there is an overall purpose? What happens when one strips away societyâ€™s purposes and realizes that there may be no meaning nor purpose? "

My brain is always racing, always wondering why, always looking for a solution and I fucking hate it. I don't even think I could bring myself to end it all because I know that logically it's pointless, but so is living. This is all topped off with failing grades even though my IQ is around 146. Turning in assignments are futile to me. And my current relationship has hit a huge wall. We're both graduating this year and going separate ways. I love her to death but I need my freedom. She is willing to get married but I know realistically we're young for that to work out, short of a miracle. She really is the most amazing girl I've ever dated and it seems the majority of times a relationship ends it's because of how difficult I am and that makes me wonder if I really will be able to find another girl as suited to me as she is. I don't know what to do anymore...I over-think fucking everything and can't do anything to stop thinking so every night I either get stoned, or drink half a fifth, or take my Clonidine just to shallow my thinking and eventually get to sleep.
