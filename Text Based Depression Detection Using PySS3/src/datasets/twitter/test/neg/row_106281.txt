Every single time it gets better, it drops down to so much worse than before. 18.fI'm tired of hearing it gets better. It does. And then it gets so, so much worse.

I'm so sick of feeling okay, feeling human for once, feeling like *maybe* I can actually do this, maybe I've overcome this. But give it a week, maybe a few months, and I'm shrouded in darkness once more, only now it hurts so fucking much more than it did before.

I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of getting better. I'm tired of suffering again, this time so much more painful than the last.

I'm tired of feeling comfortable. I'm tired of feeling fucking human. Just to wake up and have it all stripped away from me again.

It's been almost four years since my first suicide attempt. Sometimes I look back and think "wow, I've come so far".

But when the agonizing sadness comes back, I realized I've just sunk further and further in.

And I'm so exhausted. I'm so tired of fighting this. I've been in therapy for four years and nothing has helped. 

I'm begging for help. I'd do anything to make this go away.

But I know that help doesn't exist for people like me. This sadness is utterly consuming. Throw pills at it, try CBT, DBT, interpersonal, residentials, psych wards, inpatient, outpatient. It's resilient.

I wonder if I should stop trying to mend these cracks and wounds. Maybe I was just born broken, unfixable, and truly, truly wretched.

I just don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to live. I don't want to fight. I've given up.
