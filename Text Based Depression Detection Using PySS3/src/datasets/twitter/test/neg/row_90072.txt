I need adviceTrigger warning: rape 

I was raped on Wednesday night. I was at the bar playing trivia and the next thing I remember I come to at 5 oâ€™clock in the morning on the side of the road trying to walk home. I know who did it and he told me that We had sex. He doesnâ€™t seem to think anything was wrong. But I know that I would never have sex with him. Not willingly.

I have a boyfriend that Iâ€™ve been dating for years and I know that I would never try to fuck someone else. I donâ€™t really know what to do. 

I feel like if it happens once itâ€™s legitimate but this is the second time Iâ€™ve been raped in my life. Iâ€™m not trying to be the girl who cried Wolf. I feel like I canâ€™t tell anyone I know or they would just think that I was a whore cheating on my boyfriend. What do I do?
