My body is grossI have really bad eczema. My skin is wrinkly, bumpy, and blotchy, and it's very obvious to anyone with eyes. It's affected my self-esteem my entire life. I am not comfortable in my body like a lot of other girls, who can just wear whatever they want. I don't even compare to them. I watch them from the sidelines and am in awe of how they can move so freely in the world. I have always had an inhibited and restrained personality and a major fear of risk-taking, and I feel it stems from this disease. I am so desperate for affection but it's not accessible to me because I am too withdrawn to let anybody in, not that anybody wants to be with someone who looks like me. I am so tired of being let down by life over and over again. I'm sitting by my computer and trying so hard not to scratch myself until I bleed. It's really fucking hard not to. I have a huge exam coming up and I am completely unprepared since I can't focus on anything but how I look and how lonely I am. I want to just end it all and not have to deal with any of this anymore.
