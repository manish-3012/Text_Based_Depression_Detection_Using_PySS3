Failed opportunities and a rancid jobI've attracted so many beautiful girls but am so awkward I can't maintain a relationship with any of them. Furthermore, I can't even maintain a relationship with my friends and family because I'm too nervous. My job makes me realize my own faults even more. Hard to be personal and objective, and I see my own interpersonal failures even more. Maybe I'm just a spoiled shit now but fuck it.
