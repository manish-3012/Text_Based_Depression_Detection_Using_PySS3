For all those who find New Year a hard timeI certainly do. Brings home how much Iâ€™ve failed in the past year(s) and certainly how, even with every effort, Iâ€™m still making the exact same promises and hoping for the same changes for another year, again. Again. 

But again it is, I might be here next year. Same time, same place, same thoughts. But Iâ€™m still here. Just. And maybe, maybe this year something, someone will be on my side and things will improve.

Stay strong, stay here with me, letâ€™s just see what we can do. Letâ€™s just give ourselves the small chance we owe ourselves to experience happiness. Please do this with me, Iâ€™m tired of feeling alone.
