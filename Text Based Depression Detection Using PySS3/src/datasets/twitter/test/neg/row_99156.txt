I've been dead for a majority of my life.As I draw ever closer to my twenty-sixth year on this planet, I've felt the vibration of a familiar hum rising inside of my very essence.

I've craved the release of death for more than half of my life. I have tried many medications and therapies within my economic range and sustained the will to continue them, but as the pandemic rages on and the funds dry up, I am really starting to feel the futility of life. Why continue in a place where I feel unwelcome- in my own skin, my own home or the small city that I've always called home? Why continue feeling the pain of a body destroying itself piloted by a mind that's been in a similar state of decline?

&amp;#x200B;

There is no hope in life for me. Everyone left the boy behind to feel a man's wounds, then chastised that very boy for not being able to have the fortitude to deal with pain in a constructive manner. I've long since abandoned hope for greater societal restoration, or the idea that my life will contain anything but a variety of Skinner Boxes that dispense existential horror and brief hits of dopamine centered around fucking games.

I don't believe in a diety, and I don't believe in any sort of greater concept. I am an animal in pain, and for so long wanting to end that pain has frayed my sanity and alienated family members who were hoping for an easier, patchwork solution that wasn't so fucking horrible to deal with. Yet, whenenver I've gotten this close to the precipice all I hear is about how much my death would hurt them- and how the transferral of my pain was not justifiable.

Fuck them. Fuck all of them. They'd rather let me rot away and show up as a performative socialite from time to time than actually let me express my own will and desire. I don't want to be this suffering beast any more- I want the humane ending that I deserve.

I thought I wanted to create and leave some indelible mark but even that seems like a fruitless endeavor in an oversaturated marketplace of stressed apes. I just want out. I want to get off of Mr. Bones' Wild Ride. I'm done. To that end, I bought a shotgun for 'home defense,' and it will soon defend me from having to deal with the collapse of human civilization and scatter the home of my wretched consciousness into a nearby body of water.
