Iâ€™m a cowardMy moods are unpredictable, I can be happy and elated one second then... this...
I just self harmed again for the first time in.. I donâ€™t know how long itâ€™s been, months? A year even? I hit a low point that was lower than I thought I could even go

Iâ€™m lonely, sexually frustrated, I couldnâ€™t find anything much that made me laugh today.
I turned to porn to help me feel better but, surprise! It didnâ€™t. I really need to quit watching that stuff

My last attempt at the dating app thing failed miserably, adding to my stress.
I couldnâ€™t even make a deep enough cut to bleed much this time... itâ€™s so superficial and shallow but I couldnâ€™t cut any deeper, why? 

Because it stings and Iâ€™m a pussy coward little bitch and I canâ€™t even cut myself properly... as Iâ€™m writing this somehow I have a neutral expression on my face and thereâ€™s no tears... I thought there might be. I donâ€™t know what this emotion is.. not numb, but close to.
I feel absolutely pathetic and I really just want to get a good sleep so I donâ€™t have to stay awake and fall apart... 

But even in my dreams Iâ€™m haunted sometimes... one night I dreamed I was performing an autopsy on my own rotting corpse, in a coffin in my backyard... another dream I sawed off my legs, skinned them and stored them in tanks of fluid...  I donâ€™t know what the fuck is wrong with me, the psychiatrist told me Iâ€™d get vivid dreams with this medication but I wish I could have PLEASANT vivid dreams for once... they all felt and looked so real... my life feels fucked right now, but the other day I was thinking â€œyou know lifeâ€™s not that badâ€. Now Iâ€™m back to this, but worse, because I wimpily tried to cut myself... and no release because I couldnâ€™t bleed enough because Iâ€™m a coward! I could hear them... whispering in my conscious, youâ€™re not good enough, youâ€™re a hopeless coward, you canâ€™t even draw blood, youâ€™re just doing it for attention, superficial. I want to shut them up. When Iâ€™m cutting I switch to this weird mode where thereâ€™s not much facial expression and I kind of just do it... but I still wince when itâ€™s painful. I donâ€™t know anymore 
at this point Iâ€™m just rambling and Iâ€™ve lost my train of thought
