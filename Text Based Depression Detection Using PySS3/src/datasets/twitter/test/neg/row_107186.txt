i am not suicidal but i do not know where to goI have been living in a hostile living situation while suffering from unspecified chronic illnesses for over ten years. Every time I try to get medical help and get seen by a doctor, the physician tells me there is really nothing they can do for me until I cut out the stress. So I haven't been able to get treatment at all. My dad has abused me throughout my childhood and beats me to this day. I'm over 18 so there's really nothing no one can do for me. 

My illness has gotten to the point I'm bleeding from my butt. Tonight I had a really bad episode when I got very woozy. I asked my mom if she could take me to the hospital because I'm scared of hospitals. I had someone attack me once while I was in the room and have been scared of hospitals ever since. I try to explain my mom that I was bleeding really bad and she said it could wait till she could get some sleep. It's been three hours since it happened so I guess that could wait, but I now know my mom will never care about me.

Really, no one cares about me. I tried to go to therapists and they told me I should move out. But I don't have any substantial income. I have nothing but a phone. I can't afford the payments for it as it is because I'm going to need the $50/mo even more than ever. I have to pay for over the counter medicine that Medicaid won't cover I need to live. The stress is giving me more health problems so I've had to go to more appointments. I started developing sudden severe allergies. And my mom is giving me shit about having to go to medically necessary appointments.

I just don't know what to do to get better. I don't want to end up in a lockdowned crisis intervention center with no one to talk to. I've gone to my psychiatrist and she suggested I live in a house with primarily mentally retarded adults. I don't know how any of this is helpful. I don't know why my dad can't leave for a while until I can get well enough to have a job and move out. I don't know why my mom continues to enable my father. He's done more than this actually. He has neglected the upkeep of the house that the floorboard is rotting away. Now roof tiles are coming off. The only bathtub in the house is covered in mildew.

I'm just angry because I've been wanting to move out years ago, but I can't afford it. My extended family's motto is "to each its own". Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I've been physically disabled since I was born so I can't do a normal job. I can't get on a normal sleep schedule because my dad yells at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night for no particular reason. I can't stand it.
