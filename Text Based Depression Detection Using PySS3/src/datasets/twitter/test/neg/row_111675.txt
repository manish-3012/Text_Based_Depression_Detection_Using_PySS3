finally have a psych appointmentmy fiance, who kept telling me that they would leave me if i didnâ€™t get back on medication, is so thrilled, so â€œrelieved,â€ so â€œhappyâ€ that im â€œback on trackâ€ and im just like????? nothing has changed???? im still so miserable, i still totally humiliated myself having a panic attack at work today, im about to put myself in a financial situation i canâ€™t afford, which certainly wonâ€™t improve my mental health, so that my fiancÃ© can be relieved and i can continue living a life that i get nothing out of? i want to kill myself more than ever, completely out of spite. they could have at least waited until after the fucking appointment to act like they have nothing to worry about anymore, which literally isnâ€™t until next month. my depression doesnâ€™t feel any less real and present because some guy is gonna give me 30 days worth of tranquilizers in a month. Fuck this.
