Is it suicidal to want to not exist anymore?Just as the question says, if it considered suicidal to want to just not exist anymore? 

Like Iâ€™m not realy thinking of ending my life myself but at the same time my mentality is like â€œif I die today, I die today.â€ Like Iâ€™m not necessarily hoping to die, and Iâ€™m not exactly putting myself in harms way such as driving recklessly or like mixing drugs or whatever, but at the same time I donâ€™t care. 

Like Iâ€™m not scared of dying, I kinda donâ€™t take care of myself like I honestly donâ€™t care. 
I forget to eat and end up not eating until like really late, and then cuz itâ€™s late I donâ€™t want to eat but when I do it not healthy. Like I donâ€™t know. 
Like in terms of my life I think Iâ€™m okay, I do have some things I enjoy but for the most part Iâ€™m kinda just â€œmehâ€ about life. 

Iâ€™m not too sure if that makes sense, but yea thatâ€™s my question.
