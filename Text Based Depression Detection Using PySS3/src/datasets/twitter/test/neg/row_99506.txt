I'm going to kill myself in 30 minutesI've tried so hard these past 5 years to get better but nothing works. I didn't care what happened to me because I felt like if anything bad happened, I would've deserved it. I ended up being raped because I was careless around people I thought would care about me. My boyfriend broke up with me and he was my only support. My world is crumbling around me and I can't do anything to fix it. Therapy doesn't help. I'm so sick and tired of trying, I'm in no better position than when I started. Everything I've tried to do just left me back at square 1. I'm done. I don't care if I'm young or if I have a whole life ahead of me. 70 more years of this pain is not worth it. I'm tired of living for other people and I'm tired of being miserable all the time. I never talk about my issues because it always never helps and I end up feeling like I burden all my friemds.

Thank you for reading the story of my pathetic life. I hope things go differently for you all.
