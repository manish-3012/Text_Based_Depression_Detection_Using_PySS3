My mess of an existenceIm not sure if anything in my life will get better. Im still not over my ex partner who was abusive. 2 years post breakup now and i think about her daily.

My life is also very lonely right now. Currently i have no friends or anyone close to me exept for my mum. I have  gone out only 4 times in the last 2 years and that was to meet old school friends who live far away from me. 

On top of that. I messed up university. And im still dealing with various things that happened at that time. (Family member died, got mugged, cheated on, falsly arrested, watched someone die and failed to resuscitate them) and since i messed up it means im stuck and dont know where to go. I haven't got great qualifications and i cant find a good job. Every hope and dream i had for my life got stripped away when my ex left and university failed. 

My life at the moment is working at a shop by myself every day. Then coming home alone everyday.

Im far past the point where im tired of existing. The thought of even another month of this makes me want to end it all. I have tried and failed at it multiple times on the last two years. 

I feel trapped and alone. I just want a friend, a life. A job i enjoy. I have dreams but im not talented enough to follow them. And ive resided myself to the fact that no one could ever love me or like me as a friend.
