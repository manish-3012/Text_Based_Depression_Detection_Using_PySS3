no moreOne of my last posts, some time ago, I was looking for a therapist. I never found one. I don't like phones, they give me anxiety and most the answers were "telehealth". I can't trust a person who's body language I can't see. 

I gave up then and tried again today. Same story. No one wants to help. Everyone is full. Despite the insurance website or their own site saying taking new clients. 

So I sat tonight, with the news of RBG, knowing this country is heading to civil war, and didn't have the energy to weep. Two things have stopped me from doing it. My dad and my cats. My dad died recently. My cats are 16 or 17. Close to that age where health starts to go. I haven't been happy in years. I don't remember joy.   


If I take them with me, I'm doing a kindness. They won't suffer illness and long death. They won't fear the pain. And I won't worry about how they are cared for when I'm gone. I have no one. I moved thinking it would help, but it hasn't. Because I'm still me. And I don't see the future getting better. And I can't leave to another country for since borders are closed. I don't want to watch my home burn from far away anyway. I just want it to be done. I want that peace so much. I've always known how I'd do it. Just not when.   


Don't bother replying. Nothing anyone says helps. You don't know me, you don't know what all has happened in my life, you don't have the right words. It's not your fault. It's just reality. I am tired of trite nonsense, and "it gets better" Yeah? Been hearing that for decades. When? Tired of "try this nonsense thing to help". It doesn't. I tried.
