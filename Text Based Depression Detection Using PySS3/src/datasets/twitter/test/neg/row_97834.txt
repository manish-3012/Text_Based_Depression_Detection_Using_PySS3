Dear mom and dadAs Iâ€™m writing this, I donâ€™t really know where to start.  I wanna first say that Iâ€™m really fucking sorry everyone.  I know that I just fucking ruined your life, but itâ€™s honestly not worth faking it anymore.  I try and I try to be happy and better myself so I can be successful in the future, but Iâ€™m fucking tired.  I feel like a 90 year old in that all I want to do is sleep my life away.  Iâ€™ve actually written a few suicide letter when Iâ€™ve been drunk but they are always really sloppy and donâ€™t make sense so I end up deleting them.  Basically I feel as though my life has reached its entirety.  There really isnâ€™t anything more that I strive for, and Iâ€™ve even lost my basic will to live.  I fail to see the point of continuing my sad pathetic existence.  All I do is fucking pretend care about anything until I can get hammered and forget about it. That is all my life consists of; waiting for the next time I can binge drink and forget how much of a piece of shit I am.  But even that is losing its luster.  You know youâ€™re fucked when you canâ€™t even look forward to getting drunk.  Literally nothing matters to me anymore and I honestly donâ€™t even know why.  Ever since I was a child I have just had this urge to kill myself and end the pain.  I donâ€™t get it.  Itâ€™s like I was born without the ability to be truly happy.  Iâ€™m not even good at fucking pretending.  Everyone can see my sadness, and it really pisses me off when they bring it up.  I honestly donâ€™t even know where Iâ€™m going with this letter.  I guess it doesnâ€™t mean much anyways.  Itâ€™s not gonna help you guys.  Iâ€™m just gonna be remembered as that druggie fuckup who killed himself when his life sucked due to his own choices.  Honestly though, I couldnâ€™t care less.  Fuck other people.  I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m always pissed off.  People just suck.  All anyone gives a fuck about is being successful.  As if thatâ€™s all there is to life.  Hell maybe that is all it is.  I was never gonna amount to much anyways.  All I have ever done is the bare amount.  Just a fucking shitty little shitstain on society.  I can see the look of frustration in your eyes, dad.  I can see how fucking embarrassed you are of me.  Fuck Iâ€™ve never even had a girlfriend. Iâ€™d be embarrassed too.  Iâ€™m sorry I was such a disappointment.  I honestly wish that you could have had the son you always wanted, a fucking star athlete who is a good person and gets good grades and loves to help out with anything.  A son who worked as hard as you did for everything and grew up to be successful with a wife and kids.  I donâ€™t know where I went wrong, and Iâ€™m truly sorry for it.  I donâ€™t want you to feel guilty for anything.  You always wanted the best for me.  All I ever wanted was to escape.  Escape reality with drugs and alcohol, or escape life as I have if you are reading this.  I really wish I could have amounted to your expectations and I feel fucking terrible for being such a let down.


I love you dad








To mom.  

I am sorry for always being such an asshole to you.  You never deserved For me to yell at you whenever you would say something to me, but I was always in a dark place.  I was always pissed off, lonely, depressed and feeling like shit.  All I ever wanted to do was die.  I donâ€™t know what else to say.
