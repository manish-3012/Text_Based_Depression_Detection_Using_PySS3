just needed someone to talk toI found the resources page here, I went to www.crisischat.org and read the faq and terms and conditions. I sat and waited for almost an hour. They asked if I was doing it right now. I panicked, I told them I didn't know. I'm not currently in the act or anything. they told me chat is only for people committing suicide right now ?? 

is there a place I can just talk to someone?
