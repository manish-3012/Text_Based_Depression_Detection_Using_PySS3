My ex(28m) committed suicide because of me(25F)? Is it really my fault?Hi everyone, I am just wondering if it is really my(25) fault that my ex boyfriend(28) committed suicide. Well long and short, I tried hard to fix his ptsd because apparently I gave him the ptsd. I used him once without letting him know to make another guy jealous and get attention from that guy. I got refused by the guy again, and in the end made out with my ex. My ex found it really difficult to get over it, so we both tried. But later on he became quite obsessive with it and emotionally abused me. He was extremely unstable. We dated for five months and we broke up in the end because of his ptsd. Then after we broke up, I began to date that guy who I once used my ex to get attention from and had sex with him. But the problem is my ex found it out and committed suicide after four months because of the stress from that. Is it really my fault??
