I can't do thisBeing FA and having an arousal disorder is like being hungry for something that is not available and you can't eat anything else. I'm in a lot of pain. I can't live like this anymore. The anxiety and insomnia are intensifying. 

I can't do the things I enjoyed. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Food doesn't taste good. Nothing is good. I'm just in pain and I know it's just always going to be there. I don't want to live like this. I can't. I'm miserable and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's necessary to live like this just to live.
