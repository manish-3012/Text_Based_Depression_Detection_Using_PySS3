Medication thoughtsSome background. I was on adderal since I was very very young and was put on depression meds when I was 15. Depression, anxiety and feelings of worthlessness have always been a part of my life whether I was actively thinking it or not. It can be hard to explain. Iâ€™ve been off and on my adderal and depression meds for about six years. Some times I stop taking them because of money reasons but itâ€™s usually because of some of the side effects. I know the adderal is very bad for me and additive. This Covid business is really getting to me. Iâ€™m not one who usually goes out a lot or is super social but right now I feel like I canâ€™t do a lot of the things that weâ€™re keeping me alive and happy. Itâ€™s been hard to find alternatives. Iâ€™m going through one of my cycles right of wanting to get back on my meds. I never know how to feel about the meds I use to be on. I know the adderal really fucked me up but idk how to feel about my depression meds. I mostly just want to put something in my mouth and have everything feel ok again. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s ok to feel that way or not.
