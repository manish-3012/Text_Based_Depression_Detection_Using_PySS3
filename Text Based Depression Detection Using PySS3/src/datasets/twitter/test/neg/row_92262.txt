All I can think about is a rope around my neckIt's become less of a thought and more of an urge, again. How it would feel to hang from a rafter, to plunge a 5 inch knife into my neck, just above the jugular, and cut from ear to ear (that one's my favorite), to feel the trail of a bullet trace it's way from my forehead, through my brain, and pop right out the back. 

They're urges that yield results. How do I mean? When I take my fist and push it against my neck, as if I'm holding a knife, and imagine the blade sliding through my flesh, I feel a real sense of relief and satisfaction.

I feel it most every day. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. It makes my legs weak, my chest sink, and creates a sensation as though someone is tuggung on my esophagus. I'm going to puke.

The anxiety hangs behind my eyes, engulfing my senses in a numbness I can't quite push away. It has triggers. Triggers I've taken the time to distinguish, but I have no idea how to deal with them. 

I'm living a good life. Full time student, a good internship, an accomplished and loved local DJ. What the fuck do I have to be depressed about anymore? I guess the last 5 years of my life I spent numb and alone really made a lasting impact.

I don't sleep. I don't relax. I'm stressed 100% of the time.

I thought I was okay. I thought I was getting better, but it's all falling apart again, worse than last time. I don't know what to do.
