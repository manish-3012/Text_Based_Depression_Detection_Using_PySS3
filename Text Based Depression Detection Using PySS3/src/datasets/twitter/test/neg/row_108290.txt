Middle aged woman who can't stop endless browsingI am nearly 50 years old and depressed. I can't stop using my computer or phone.  I can't even tell you what I do all day. My children are in school all day and I can't work due to a disability but I don't have money to go out and do things. I tried finding free or cheap things but there aren't many during the weekdays and what little is out there I don't find fun, which could be do to the depression.

I have a wonderful husband but I'm no longer very interested in sex.  My children suffer because I'm so zoned out from using the computer all day, and I even use it often at night, to the point it's taking over all or at least most of my waking hours.

I am seeing a therapist about it but it's not helping.  I don't know what to do. I've never had thoughts of ending it all until lately because I feel guilty about not taking care of my husband and children.   Plus I'm almost 50 ffs, and have no reason to be so unhappy and I should know better.
