How to stop being scared of death (hell)?(I posted it here because most of you are not scared of death) One night I thought I'm dying and I was hyperventilating and acting like a suffocating seal and my mother was there and I feel like crying because it's so embarrassing to look back at it. She asked me if I saw something and I didn't saw anything, it's just that I'm very scared of going to hell so when my heart hurts or anything like that I get very scared. I think I will continue being scared of it until science proves that it doesn't exist. But NO ONE alive knows what's after.
