please help me i want to dieI am crying writing this. I canâ€™t stand anything anymore. Iâ€™ve been suicidal before but now i want to disappear so bad. My mother got so ill yesterday night, she said that she wants me to learn living alone from now on. I canâ€™t eat for a month, iâ€™ve been to hospital many times, i lost 4 kilos in 2 days. I am so skinny right now, i donâ€™t have strength to prepare myself breakfast. I only drink water. I think am dying slowly, and painfully. Itâ€™s really hard to write without being able to see. I want to make my death quick, i canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™m in an online class right now, my camera and mic is off. We canâ€™t find a psychiatrist to help me. I am writing this ti keep myself busy.
Please god, please i only want a healthy, happy life please god please hear me please please please please
