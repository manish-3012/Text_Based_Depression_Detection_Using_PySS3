Someone I met recently is threatening suicideI recently met and hooked up with a person who I later found out had borderline personality disorder/emotionally unstable personality disorder. We hung out a few times before the person had a severe nervous breakdown while I was with them because of a fight they were having with a friend.

After that night, I told them that I no longer feel comfortable doing anything sexual but that I would still like to be their friend and support them. They tried over and over to convince me to change my mind, but I cannot handle that level of emotional commitment and responsibility, especially not with someone I just met. 

They did not take this well, and they are having another breakdown. They have yelled at me and blamed me, insulted me, and so on. Iâ€™m not taking it personally because I understand that these are coping mechanisms, but they have repeatedly expressed suicidal ideation and refuse to seek help. They wonâ€™t call a suicide prevention hotline, and they are essentially blaming me for their suicidal feelings. This does not feel good.

I donâ€™t feel comfortable going to meet this person anymore, but they donâ€™t seem to have anyone else to support them and I donâ€™t want to cause them more pain. I donâ€™t know what I can do in this situation. Obviously I have made some mistakes, but short of promising that I will be with them out of fear that theyâ€™ll kill themselves I donâ€™t know what to do. Any help and advice is appreciated.
