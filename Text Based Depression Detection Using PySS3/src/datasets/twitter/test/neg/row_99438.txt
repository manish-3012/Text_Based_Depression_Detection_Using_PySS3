I was gifted the opportunity to be socially competent and talk to girls this week but Iâ€™m such a coward I blew itIâ€™m 21 and for the first time ever I got invited to go on a beach trip with some guys I know but I left before any girls got there because Iâ€™m that much of a coward and the guys there demanded to know why I wonâ€™t talk to girls but I was too nervous to tell them that I was too nervous to talk to girls anyway I hate myself and I know Iâ€™ll be smoke forever because Iâ€™m a fucking coward
