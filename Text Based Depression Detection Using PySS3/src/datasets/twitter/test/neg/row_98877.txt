My career is screwed up, I'm almost 40, I'm single and alone, and my family has abandoned me.  Why am I still doing this?I've already been sent to the hospital against my will last year when I was fired the day I went into a surgery I needed to have.  I've been through 5 jobs in the last 2.5 years and my current one is about to go too (they're in bankruptcy).  I've been spending the last 6 years struggling to find and maintain employment and have been treated so crappy by employers that I wonder if I have any value at all.  I worked so hard, put myself through college on a scholarship, the only person in my family to have a degree from a good school, and it's all for nothing.

I don't want to live like this anymore.  Every day I just think about my plan and how I'm going to do it.  Every single day it goes through my mind.  I spend most weekends sleeping in.  I avoid people now.  I haven't been in a serious relationship in 13 years.  I have a hearing disability that's subtly used against me at my jobs.  I've just had enough...of the abuse, the abandonment from my supposed friends, the medications that make it impossible to have any sex drive.  My parents hated each other and I was just a chip to be used to extort money as a kid.  

I lost my home and had to file bankruptcy 3 years ago.  Now I'm about to lose my apartment too after having moved for a job that laid me off a year later.  I fucking hate myself and the life I have.  I'm almost 40 and I have nothing, no matter how hard I worked to find success or at least happiness.  I just don't want to hurt so bad anymore.
