If I call a suicide hotline, and I'm still on my parents' cell phone plan, will they know?I would rather them not find out their 25 year old daughter is popping pills because she still can't handle the fact she got dumped a month ago and can't find a full time job, doesn't know what she wants to do with her life, doesn't have friends that are around, and can't afford her bills. 

She also has no idea why she can't find someone to love her. 

Alternatively would anyone be willing to talk?
Thank you. 

Also, there should be another way to prove you are human.
People who are already frustrated with life should not be subject to having to try to guess the damn letters 5 times.
