I completely gave up on life and getting betterIt's getting really bad for me. I haven't felt okay in months and I haven't been genuinely happy in a long time. I tried therapy for almost a year and it wasn't that good. I think suicide is the only way out of my life and my misery, I tried to end my life in 2015 by taking a whole tablet of a medicine that act as beta blocker but it didn't do anything and I woke up okay and alive. I completely lost hope in life and i don't want to be alive anymore I just want a good and quick way to go, I don't want to survive the attempt and end up paralysed or brain dead
