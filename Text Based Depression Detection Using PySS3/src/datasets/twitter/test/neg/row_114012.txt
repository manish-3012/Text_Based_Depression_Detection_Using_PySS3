I want to do it before christmasMore problems keep piling up. I thought it was bad enough 2 years ago, but I guess not. I know I can't do it because it would hurt my mom and friend. Being severely depressed was awful, but now I have health and financial problems on top of it. I have never wanted to do it more than I do now. How do I keep going when I know the rest of my life will be in pain? I really don't want to ruin my mom and friend.
