Is suicide after high school reasonable for me?I'm in my third year and I'm not taking any class that will help me plan out for the future after high school. I predicted this would happen years ago and I realized everything is going to become a dead end. I have no passions, no interests. I'm not good at anything. I'm extremely bland. There's nothing I can think of doing as a career path and I wouldn't even know what career path to choose if I got into college. I don't want to live in my parent's house for five years and later become a bum on the streets. Suicide doesn't seem like a bad option for me considering my life can really only go downhill from here. I've never really had symptoms of being suicidal and I'm not sure if this counts as one. I just want to be ready to have an escape route once i hit that dead end.
