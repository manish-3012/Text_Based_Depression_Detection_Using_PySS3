I am a disappointment to everyone I care about.Alright let me tell you the story of my life. I'm an Indian teenager born and raised in Cali by two wonderful immigrant parents and I have an older brother who's about 4 years older than me. I was a pretty smart kid in elementary and early on in my life (GATE and all that shit).



 Fast forward to high school and I start to struggle.I would be extremely lazy with my work and half ass everything, resulting in average to below average grades. honestly if I was in regular classes I might have been an A or B student, but I kept taking honors and AP courses just because I wanted to appear intelligent, even though I got Cs or failed all of them.  Instead of telling my parents what was going on, I would lie. Each year, each grade I would lie about my grades, going as far as to even make fake report cards. My parents found about some of these things but not all and while they were angry and upset they would always forgive me in the end and tell me they love me. They are really amazing people who don't deserve a kid like me. 



Now im 17 and when I was submitting my application for college my dad was walking through it with me. When it came to the part where I had to input my high school grades I inputted fake ones because my dad didn't know the grades I had actually gotten and he was watching me. The application was submitted and I got into the school I had always dreamed of getting into. My dumbass told my parents this and basically announced it to everyone who I know. All were pleased with me and congratulated me. I even put it up on every social media that I have. None of this is really happening though, because as soon as the college requests transcripts from my high school they will know something's up and take away my acceptance.



 I'm living a lie. I want to die because I have no reason to hurt these people who have been nothing but good to me. I have attempted suicide before and seen how much it hurt them yet I still have these feelings. I feel guilty. I have two loving parents, im not poor, I have an older brother who looks out for me. Hell I even have a girlfriend who loves me.I've been given so much in my life but I still manage to fuck it up. I keep lying to everyone. I keep fucking up. I called the suicide hotline yesterday and im sure their intentions were good but the gist of what they told me was "You really seem like you're dealing with a lot" and "You are not a bad person." I know I am. I know that I deserve to die.
