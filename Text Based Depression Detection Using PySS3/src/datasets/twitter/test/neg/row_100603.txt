really hope you can help me out hereAt first I want to say that Iâ€™m not suicidal right now. I have been though for about 7 years now on and off. I donâ€™t know if this is the right sub-reddit to post this but I hope you guys can help me out. So hereâ€™s my problem.
8 years ago, back in school I met a girl. We fell in love the moment we met and started having an affair, both not able to tell the other one how we felt because of the fear of feelings may not be returned.
After a year we had sex, it was the first time for both of us. After that we somehow lost it and ended up not talking to each other for about 2 years. In this time she started a relationship with a friend of mine. I got a pretty heavy depression and got suicidal. Unrelated to this I went on medication that even made the depression worse, leaving my body and mind shattered. Anyhow I more or less recovered and life went on. The girl went to the united states for a year. When she came back (she still was with the friend of mine) we had a long talk and made up. Unfortunately feelings got really strong again and we started having a kind of affair again (not physically at the beginning). We both tried to end it but were unable to go through with it. It ended with us having sex again. At this time she started to suffer from pretty heavy anorexia and other mental issues. She told her boyfriend, they stayed together and we stopped talking to each other again. I pretty much hit rock bottom getting depressed and suicidal again. About that time I started drinking on a daily basis and doing drugs and started a relationship with a girl from school trying to get something to stabilize me emotionally and kind of completely blacked out everything related to what happened.
After 2 years I was able to face my emotions relating to what had happened. I broke up with the girl and tried to cope with my emotions. The result was I started drinking and doing drugs even more but at least facing my emotions and trying to cope with them.
After a year I was more or less back on my feet but still drinking and doing drugs, though not as worse as before.
I realized that I wasnâ€™t able to open up to another person and was not able to have a relationship. I really worked on that and tried to learn how to open up emotionally and really made some progress with that too. Eventually I recovered emotionally but still being suicidal from time to time but now being able to cope with that more or less.
A few months ago I started having contact to the girl again because I realized that she still was a big part of my life and I still had feelings for her. It turned out that she felt the same way. Meanwhile she also had broken up with her boyfriend. A few weeks ago we met and it was amazing. We talked for a long time and found out we still were in love with each other and decided that we had to try having a relationship. She really is the love of my life and I am the same for her. I am really happy at the moment and our relationship is amazing. But anyhow I have this huge fear what will happen if it doesnâ€™t work out. I feel that I would not be able to go through this again and am afraid that I would kill my self if we broke up. 
Iâ€™m afraid that if I donâ€™t learn to control this fear I will sabotage and destroy our relationship.
I feel that without this girl I have nothing to live for, I know life with and without her and I just could not go through it again now that I got to know how wonderful life can be.
I realize that Iâ€™m kind of emotionally depending on her and she kind of is emotionally depending on me too but there is nothing we can do about this.
I gave her a hint about how I feel but I fear that if I tell her everything I put to much pressure on her or scare her away.
I really hope you guys can help me out. If I totally missed the sub-reddit maybe you can tell me where to go with my problem.
Thank you so much for reading and advice! 
(and Iâ€™m sorry for my bad English, hope I could point out my situation though)
