I dont know whatâ€™s wrong with me or how to get helpI just donâ€™t see the point in anything lately. I can hardly leave the house because i get so anxious, i moved in with my boyfriends family but i feel like i cant be myself and my boyfriend doesnâ€™t even care how i feel, Iâ€™m trapped here, i just want to die so so bad but no one will take care of my animals. I dont know what to do, i just want to be all on my own because everyone always takes from me and i dont get anything back i just get criticized and told itâ€™s my fault. Me being suicidal is sooo stressful on everyone else but no one wants to help me get better they just want to get mad. My boyfriend offered to watch the puppy if i do more therapy but i know thatâ€™s a lie. I left the house for 20 mins yesterday and he text me in a flurry about how i need to come get my dog because heâ€™s being too rowdy. I just dont want to be anywhere and i dont want to deal with anyone else but i dont have the money to be on my own. Thereâ€™s no other choice.
