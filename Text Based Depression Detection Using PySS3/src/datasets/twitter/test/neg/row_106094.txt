I wanna go far out into the desert and just die.I can't right now because I don't want to leave my pets behind. I care about them too much.
But right now it seems very appealing to just go far far away from everyone else and be by myself for awhile before I blow my brains out. I already know I'm gonna kill myself at some point. Might as well do it far away from everyone else so I don't end up rotting in some apartment or something.

I'm just so sick of seeing myself in the mirror. My fucking face is so ugly and disgusting I can't stand it. I wanna rip it off. I'll never be as pretty as literally any other girl. Every girl i see has cute facial features and hair while I have nothing. I wouldn't even be that suicidal over my appearance if I had some other things going right for me but I don't.

I have the most boring personality, low IQ, nobody has ever loved me, I have no will to live, etc. So many reasons to go off myself. Unfortunately I can't do it now so I have to pass the time doing meaningless bullshit until I can finally end it. Really wish I didn't have anything holding me back.
