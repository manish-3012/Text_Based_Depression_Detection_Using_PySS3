The ShotgunItâ€™s below my bed. Itâ€™s loaded. I think about it daily. Sometimes multiple times.

Itâ€™s my ticket out of here. Like an insurance policy, in a way. A reassurance that I can leave any time Iâ€™m ready. 

It belonged to my grandfather. I feel like a shitty person for my willingness to use it on myself. Then again, I feel like a shitty person for a lot of reasons.
