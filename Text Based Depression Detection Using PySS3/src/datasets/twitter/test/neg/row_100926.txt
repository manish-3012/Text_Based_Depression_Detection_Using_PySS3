Lost, confused and everything else in between.I don't know what I'm doing here. This is a get it off my chest, depression, SW all mixed into one.

Im a long term sufferer of depression 15yrs+.  Im diagnosed as dysthymic, recurring MDD, Bipolar and a borderline personality tossed in on the side. Im what they call resistant to medication since ive been on everything under the sun and then some with little to no change on any medication I've ever been given.

I've had two attempts at my life on the last 16months. The first one beginning of 2009 was an OD and I was in a coma for over a week and died and was revived at the hospital and spent a week in a coma. My most recent attempt was thwarted by a by-standard who happened on me out of dumb luck and decided he needed to save me from pulling the trigger on the gun. I never thought anyone in their life would tackle me from behind and throw a gun away from a person. But, I admire their conviction for wanting to help.

I've been institutionalized twice and released back to my own personal hell with a slap on the back each time and everyone telling me the world will work itself out. Which it hasn't.  I am by society's standards a successful person. I have a wife and kids and the white picket fence home. I have yet ever had to struggle to put food on the table or pay the bills. I have pushed my wife away over the last few years and she still stands by my side through everything. She supports me, she is a rock that I don't deserve for the simple fact that by me pushing her away I have fallen into the arms of another woman who has been my friend, my best friend for the last 12yrs.  My wife turns a semi-blind eye to it because she knows if I didnt have "her" that maybe I wouldn't be here.  I agree because what I haven't found the strength to share with my wife, I can share with my friend with no problem.  I've fucked my own life up.  I've spent the last 2 years doctor shopping to get ambien in abundant supply and resorted to even ordering it from out of country. I use the drug to turn my brain off, so I can make it to tomorrow, in hopes of something better might come my way. But, Im fooling myself, Im a robot, I'm on auto-pilot. I function at the minutest of capacities. I don't know how anyone doesn't notice the problem at my job.

I want out of this life so badly, I want this life so badly, I want the pain and the sorrow and the hurt to end. I want a better life or no life at all. I don't know where else to turn, I don't know what else to do. I've exhausted my ability to walk into doctors offices and say .. look im totally fucked up. I don't know what else to do. 

I'm lost. Help.
