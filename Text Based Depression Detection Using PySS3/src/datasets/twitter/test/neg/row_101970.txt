I feel as each week passes that I am dangerously close to going through with itI'm usually pretty good at articulating the way that I feel in words but I just feel so god damn empty and I just want the pain to stop. I was doing better for a little bit but now I'm drinking again just to fall asleep. I just wish I could stay asleep in my bed with no other obligations. People are counting on me to be there for them but I feel so fucking miserable and I'm no help to anyone. It's like I have this dark creature constantly clawing from my chest or the back of my skull and I want the pressure to just be gone. I may be intoxicated right now but the feelings are even worse when I'm sober. I dont even know what I'm looking for by posting this but I've browsed the sub for so long trying to gain some form of relief
