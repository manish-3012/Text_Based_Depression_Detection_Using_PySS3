feeling weirdI've had thoughts about wanting to kill myself everyday for years. But in the past 2 days, i've actually felt okay? I hate being alive and hate myself, but i'm not actively planning my suicide. 

My first reaction when something goes wrong is still "if i killed myself, this wouldn't matter, i would get rid of this feeling of deep shame/regret" 

I feel stable? Maybe numb? I don't want to kill myself at the moment. I kind of feel the way I did when I was on zoloft--numb, but emotionally stable. 

I've gotten so use to wanting to die I feel... not myself. I'm scared this is going to go away and i'll end up feeling 100x worse when i wears off. 

On another note, I've signed up to participate in some clinical trials. New therapies / medications for curing PTSD. 

Either I'm cured, or I die horribly maybe hopefully from it. It's a win-win in my book. Why would I want to keep living like this.
