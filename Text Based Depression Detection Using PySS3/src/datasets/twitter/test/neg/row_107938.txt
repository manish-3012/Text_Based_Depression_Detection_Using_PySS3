My life has reached an all-time low.I am a registered sex offender. This past week I was informed that I will no longer be able to volunteer at an organization that I was volunteering at.  (B/c there name showed up on the sex offender registry even though I am just a volunteer).  I haven't been able to find a job.  I can't even hold a volunteer position.  My probation officer has threatened to put me back in jail if I can't find something to do with my time.  I don't want to be a trucker for the rest of my life.   I wanted to be a data analyst but I don't know of any large company that hires sex offenders.   I've run out of things to try at this point.  There's only one thing left *to* do.
