I have only two reasons to live.... my Mother and Father. During restless nights I have nothing to do besides lay in bed and reminisce on my lonesome life, and how shitty the world is. Or play games on my computer and completely space out real life and sit on my ass for hours at a time wasting my time away. 

Every day I'm tempted to kill myself, emotionlessly until I think of my mother or fathers reaction, especially when I saw my father (who is a professional boxer and a personal trainer) be reduced to tears at my grandmothers funeral with me at his side consoling him. And the image still engraved in my mind of my mom sitting of the floor of my room weeping after thinking I had been kidnapped after me not telling her I was going to my friends house to play, when I was seven. I can hardly imagine what the scene would be if my mother walked into my room after getting home from work and seeing my body hanging from the ceiling. 

I really don't know what I'll do when they've passed and I'm left to live alone in this fucked up world we live in. I'm only sixteen and already thinking about ending my story with a strongly worded note to my parents.
