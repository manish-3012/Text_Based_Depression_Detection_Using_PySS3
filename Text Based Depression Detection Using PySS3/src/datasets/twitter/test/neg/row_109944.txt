ending my life within 48 hours.I don't have anything to live for. Nothing. I'm currently 25 years old, I don't have a friend, I never  really had a friend. I'm currently jobless. never been able to hold a job for more than 4 months and have been unemployed for more than a year between jobs, I have almost no money, and no prospects. I have very bad social skills, anxiety and severe depression which I have had a majority of my life. I dropped out of high school which was emotionally torture for me. Most people I come across seem extremely rude to me. I have nowhere to turn for help. I don't have contact with either of my parents.
I have never had a girlfriend or have ever really had an opportunity to get close to a girl which I believe would give meaning to my life, every girl I have tried to initiate contact has shut me down, immediately ignored me, or had something very hurtful to say, I get made fun of for this by every person I know (virgin jokes etc.). I live in a small town of about 15k people which I am unable to move from (no transportation/money) and there is no opportunities in this town to make changes in my life. I have no interests or hobbies, or have never found myself to be skilled in anything.I get nothing of joy out of my life, just consistent misery. I see no reason for my life to continue. I have tried to the best of my ability to deal with these issues.
