Suicide pact time: I will commit suicide a year from 
know if my life doesn't improve.I made this same pact to myself when I was 18: if my life doens't get better by the time I hit 25, I was to commit suicide. I am 25 now and realize this is just as "good as it gets" in the way that it's only going to get worse from here on out, and this is one storm not worth whethering.

If I don't have a quality girlfriend, and two closish friends, within one year, I'm just going to end it. I can't tolerate this loneliness anymore, and with the world being cheapskate city I feel like I owe it no loyalties.

"Hang in there," is what I have tried, and I already feel like I've experienced the last vestiges of what life has to offer beyond the endless sea of torment under the waves. I no longer enjoy life, people are beneath me, and I feel like I've been placed in the wrong age. Suicide seems reasonable in a year's time if nothing improves.
