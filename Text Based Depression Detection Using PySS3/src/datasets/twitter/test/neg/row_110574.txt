Why am I even doing this?I thought I was over it. I mean sure I have sometimes the urges to end it all, but I learned to handle it well.

I choose to stay, because even though I'm not really needed here, but I still think that me leaving would somehow scar those around me. It's awful. Like I have to be here, "just in case", but the time I'm needed never actually comes.

I tried my best, I went out of my way to help others, just because that was the only reason for me to stay. But I'm only needed as long as there is the problem. Then they leave. I am not good for anything else, than making people feel better about themselves. And after my second attempt I honestly believed that that's enough for me to stay. At least there is some use of me being here and suffering.

But then she came, and I helped her get better. We got together, and slowly I started to believe a lie that I thought was long gone: I actually might be loved. Maybe there is a place for me in this world, and maybe I don't have to suffer through this I don't even know how many years that's still back for me to die. Day by day she got better beside me. And then a day come when she told me that she finally feels well, and it was I who helped her. Next week after that she met a guy, and cheated on me.

And honestly I don't even know why was I even expecting things to be any other way. I was born like this, an outsider even in my own life. I cannot expect anyone to stay with me. I might be simply not made for that.

I know that I want to help in this life the ones who are around me, so noone will have to be where I am, but if I do my job well enough, I will be the only one who stays down here.

I made the mistake of hoping that things can get better even for me, and now I don't know how much longer can I continue doing all of this.
