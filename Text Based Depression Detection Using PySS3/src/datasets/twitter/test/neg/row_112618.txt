Swallowed by GriefMy life has fallen apart. Things started going downhill back in Fall of 2009. I was 15 and began to develop an eating disorder and it completely took over my life. I lost all my friends and isolated myself from my family. My mother really tried to get me to talk to her, but I felt I couldn't. I regret that now. I lost a lot of weight, but it quickly transformed into a way for me to cope with my depression.

The following summer in July 2010, my father died. I hadn't seen or heard from him in two years, so it crushed me. He was never the fatherly type, but I'd always hoped that one day we could have that bond and be close. I leaned on my eating disorder even more to cope with the loss. Despite this, I was trying to be more social at school, and made friends again, but it was hard for me to get close to people. It still is.

8 months after my father died, my mother, brother, and I went to a family get together at my uncle's house. When we got home my mother called my brother and I into the kitchen, and told us she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. It was caught early and she would begin chemo the following week. It was my worst fear come true. Everything changed. I was 16 at this time, and my mother began to become very weak from chemo and I was her caretaker. By summer 2011, she had a mastectomy, and was in the hospital for a long time. I did everything I could to help her when she came home. I cleaned her surgical wounds, helped her bathe, get dressed, use the restroom, and anything else she needed. I've never talked to anyone about what I was feeling or how this was affecting me, I just leaned on my eating disorder, but it was taking a toll on me. I started having bad chest pains and heart palpitations, but I kept this to myself and I tried to recover on my own.

My mom got better, was cancer free, and healthy. By this point I was a senior in high school. Things had started to go back to normal. I was focused on graduating, prom, getting into college, and really pulling the reins in on my eating disorder so I could start a new life without it in college. My senior year was great, and I got into my first choice university. We spent the summer getting ready for my move into my dorm. It was bittersweet, but I was excited for a new beginning with everything that had happened.

It was 2012, and my freshmen year was starting off strong. I didn't let food, weight, or any insecurities hold me back. I made friends, I actually hung out with them, we went to events on campus, and I had fun. I had a social life, which is something I've spent most of my life without.

November of the same year, mother and brother came to visit me. We went out to eat, they met my friends, and we had a good time. It was getting towards the time for them to start heading back home, and then my mother told us she went to the doctor. Her breast cancer had come back. It was caught early just like the last time. She was hopeful, but I was still scared. I was in shock. I wanted things to be good again and went into denial. In the second half of my freshmen year I relapsed into my eating disorder, started having really bad insomnia, regular breakdowns, and started isolating myself again.

My first year of college came to an end, and I was happy to finally go home for summer. This was in 2013. When I got home she was very sick. I found out she never went to treatment. She refused it. Which meant she was going to die. I couldn't accept it. How could I accept living without my mom? Without parents? I was 19. I knew nothing about being an adult, or living life without my mother by my side. That June she left her job permanently, and her coworkers threw her a party so they could say goodbye. She entered hospice, and I took care of her again, but it was a lot harder this time. She had a hospital bed moved into her bedroom, had an oxygen machine, and tons of meds to control her pain levels. Dozens of family and friends came to visit with her.

I became very stressed. Even though there were a lot of people over, I was left to do most things on my own. I was doing everything I had to do before, but I also was keeping track of her medications and when she needed to take them, I cleaned her tumors, I cooked her meals, and was up with her most nights because it was hard for her to sleep. I was happy to help, but I felt very strained. If my brother wasn't at work, he was in his room or out with friends. It bothered me because she's his mom too, but i bit my tongue and let it go. Some of my aunts noticed how tired I was and started helping me, and letting me take naps, but usually I'd just go to my room and breakdown. Everything was changing and there was no going back this time. 

Some coworkers of my mother's pooled some money together for a trip for 3 to a spa resort. A mother, one of her sisters, and I all went and it was really nice. My mom really had a good time, I took a lot of pictures, made some really nice memories. We got back from the trip and by this point the summer was dwindling to an end, and it was time for me to head back to college. I wanted to stay, but she told me to go and that no matter what happens I should finish my degree. Then she had a real talk with me about how things were going to be, and that she wouldn't live long enough to see me graduate and other things. I kissed her a bunch of times, hugged her even more, and told her i love her, then it was time for me to go. That was the last time I ever saw her. She died less than week later. I talked to her over the phone two days before she died, and the last thing we said to each other was "See you later." I had no idea that would be the last time. I should have told her I loved her, and I've beat myself up over it for a long time.

We were forced to sell the house because we couldn't afford it, and now my brother and I stay in a small two bedroom apartment. It'll be 3 years since her death this August. My brother just turned 26 and I'll be 23 in a few months. He's moved on. He has a girlfriend, tons of friends, and a career. He has a life. I'm still in college and am almost done, but I'm completely isolated. I don't talk to anyone. I've gone back to self destructive ways and solitude. I'm currently home for summer, but I'll be leaving again next month back to college. College has become a place of immense dread.

Emotionally, I'm still the 19 year old girl that lost her mom. I'm stuck. I completely shut down after she died, and I don't know how to let go and move on. It's crushed me. So now I'm in this hole engulfed in grief, in the dark, by myself, and I don't know what to do. I need my mom. I'm going through the hardest thing in my life and I can't talk to her. My life has fallen apart. Life has been beating me down since 2009 and it's finally won. I've gone down this road before a couple tines, but i don't think I can bounce back from this one.
