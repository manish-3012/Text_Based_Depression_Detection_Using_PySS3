Get out of my head!I never wanted you in, how did you even get here? All I wanted was to be happy. To have fun. To smile. Why the hell are you here?

Ever since she left, you came back stronger. And now, you're stronger than before. All because this month was special. Everything aligned. Our birthdays, when she showed she cared, when I started to have feeling for her, when I started getting the hints that she liked me too. Is that what you were waiting for? To bring back those memories and taint them with your touch? To make those happy feelings horrible?

Why. Why are you still here? Go away for fucks sake! I don't want to. I promised her! She would blame herself for what you will do! Just go away!

Please...

I don't want to die...
