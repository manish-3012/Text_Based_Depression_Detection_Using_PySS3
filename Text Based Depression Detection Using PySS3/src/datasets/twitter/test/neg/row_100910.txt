Feeling like self harming (Repost, same situation) Sorry, I'm not sure where else to post this so I hope it's okay in this subreddit since I'm not yet at the point of feeling suicida, but when I feel like this it sometimes does get to that point... anyway I'm not exactly comfortable posting everything on here but I've been cutting lately and it's starting to get out of hand and I feel like self harming right now and I'm really just trying to keep my hands busy and I would love to talk in a more private conversation so if someone would PM me or even maybe (preferably, if you're comfortable) text that would really help me a lot... None of my friends know except for one who is making me feel this way so I really have no one else to talk to.... I'm a 17 btw and to be honest I do feel more comfortable sharing things if you're my age or a little older.
