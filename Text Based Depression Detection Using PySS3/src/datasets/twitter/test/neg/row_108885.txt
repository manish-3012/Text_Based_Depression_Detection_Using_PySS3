I am determined to kill myself but I don't know how to do itAnd since I'm a lazy piece of shit I don't even know if I will 1. decide how to do it and 2. manage to find the equipment if necessary. I often fantasize about shooting myself in the head and sometimes about doing it in front of people (that's really fucked up cause I like to think sometimes that I have empathy how delusional am I I'm just a piece of shit who wants to emotionally scar and hurt other people) but I don't even know where to get a gun. I ranted a bit on /r/depression but nobody responded (I know, selfish on my part once again, I like to think I'm the center of the world but people don't give a shit about my problems they have their fucking own).
