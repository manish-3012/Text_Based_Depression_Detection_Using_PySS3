I got extremely drunk and tried to hook up with a friend. Even almost 5 years after, I think that I sexually assaulted her and feel like I should kill myself in an attempt to truly make things right.I am not sure if this is where I should be posting this. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

When I was 19, and she was 18, we were camping with a group of friends where there was a lot of alcohol. We both got drunk to the point where we both blacked out. I thought she had been coming onto me all night, so we went to sleep in a tent together spooning. 

When I woke up and showered the next morning I remembered that something had happened in the middle of the night, but couldn't remember exactly what. She didn't talk to me that morning at all.

A few weeks later, I was hanging out with her and some other mutual friends, but after she left her best friend told me that she needed to talk to me, and told me what happened that night, where I recollected a few things:

In the middle of the night, I woke up incredibly horny. I reached into her pants and tried to finger her, she pulled my hand away. I tried to grab her breasts and she again pulled my hands away. I tried to kiss her and she did not reciprocate. I believe I only tried each of these one time. I do not remember if she asked me to stop or not, but after I tried kissing her I stopped trying anything.  I do not remember if she tried pushing me away or even said anything. I do not remember if she asked me to spoon her again or not, and I am not sure if we even did resume spooning or not. 

I broke down after hearing what I did, and one of my friends (who is now her current boyfriend) said "she thinks you tried to rape her!", and then laughed. Her best friend then immediately told me that she did not think that at all, and advised me on what do next.

Regardless, I texted her and apologized to her immediately after I found this out. She accepted and thanked me for my apology, and we still hang out together with the same groups a few times a year. 

I like to think that I am a good person other than this. I always \*always\* ask for verbal consent when doing anything remotely sexual, I watch my drinking, and if I ever feel like I've drank even slightly too much, I will go home and shut myself away from everyone else. 

I am ashamed, horrified, and disgusted that I did this. I run within a lot of feminist circles, but I feel like I can't label myself as one after this accident. 

I never intended to ever hurt my friend, and even though people tell me she's fine, or to get over it, I still get intense feelings of guilt over what I did nearly every day. I feel the only way I could ever make things truly right is to end my own life.

I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but nothing in comparison to this. I punch myself in the face or slam my head into something because it feels like if I hurt myself I can make up for all of the mistakes I've made. 

I have been raped and sexually assaulted four times both before and after this accident occurred, and am somewhat familiar with the emotional damage that it brings. I cannot live with myself knowing that I may have inflicted that pain onto someone else. 

Some people (my current partner included) have told me that I did not commit sexual assault, but I don't think I can believe them.

What do I even begin to do?
