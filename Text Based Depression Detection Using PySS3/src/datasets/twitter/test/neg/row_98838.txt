Should I wait or just go through with it now?Im a 35 year old male and I really really want to kill myself, I have too many reasons which I won't get into here but I'm just not happy in this world, I never was and I don't want to be here anymore. The problem is my parents. I don't want to put them through it. I had always planned on waiting until they were no longer with us and then I could kill myself guilt free. But it's getting really hard. If I do it now it would hurt them but maybe they will get over it? I feel trapped because I have to put up this pretend mask that everything is OK and I'm normal even though they know I've never had a girlfriend my entire life. But recently it's been getting harder and harder to keep it up. Should I just end it now or just suffer on in silence for another 20 years?
