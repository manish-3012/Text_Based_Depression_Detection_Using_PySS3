Please stop filling me with these empty promises that you can't possibly keep.Please stop telling me that it gets easier/ better or any other variations of it. Please stop promising me that if I were to exercise and eat better my problems will go away. Etc etc.

It's hard hearing this. I actually used to believe it. I understand most people are saying it to be kind but it just makes me feel angry and pathetic. Oh yeah how could I not have known exercising was good for the body and that it realises dopamine. I'm such a dummy! All of my abuse will suddenly disappear if I run a mile!

I get that people are trying to help but please just be a little bit more thoughtful when making these statement, they've been proven by psychologists that they do more harm than good.
