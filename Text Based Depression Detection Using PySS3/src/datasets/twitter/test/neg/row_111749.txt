lost connection with friends, have nothing to live foriam disconnected with my friends and while they have fun and im left to sit by myself in class, i have to sit and hope something will change since they wont listen to me. Im seriously thinking about ending it, i know it will hurt my family but it will be better than feeling unwanted for the whole time
