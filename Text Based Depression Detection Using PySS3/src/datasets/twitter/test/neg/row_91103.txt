â€œSuicide is man's way of telling God, 'You can't fire me - I quit!â€ â€• Bill MaherI've struggled with depression since I was a teen and thoughts of suicide but nothing has compared to the last few months of pure despair that I'm currently suffering. I was going through college, paying out of pocket with some federal aid, holding a 3.8 G.P.A. with a clear path to a bright future. I needed a job to continue going to school and pay rent because tuition had risen and federal aid for school dropped. 

Up until this point I had conquered my depression of my early teens and actually was happy for the first time in my life that I can remember. However it wasn't apparent to me at the time how much money and how society depends on it. As a result of having a 14 hour per week part time income my financial aid for schooling was cut to a point that I had to strictly go to school, then work, then home to study, and get two hours of sleep each week night just to stay financially afloat. It started to take it's toll on me by burning the candle at both ends but it was manageable with staying connected with friends on the internet. The point that broke me completely was when I had filed for my financial aid at my college I had filled out a form incorrectly, my mistake and I take full responsibility for it, however the person in charge of the financial aid department caught it and had me refill the paperwork out again to correct the mistake. I though all was good until one month into the first quarter I get a letter stating all of my financial aid had been cut off because the original paperwork was turned in with the mistake and I would need to make payment arrangement's until it could be resolved. I was upset but not ready to throw all the hard work I had already put in to give up there and was paying $600 every month on tuition out of pocket. I had to pick up more hours at work to cover it and the only way to pay for it I had to take out a credit card that only had a $300 limit so I would charge $300 on the 1st and $300 on the 15th and pay those amounts off on the 30th/31st and 14th. I did this for 2 and a half quarters and the issue was fixed but was not reimbursed the money I had paid like I was promised but I know longer had to 100% out of pocket. 

The fact that I had picked up more hours to pay for school while the financial aid office at my college got it's head out of it's ass had become a double edged sword that ultimately ended up being the reason I had to drop out one quarter from graduating with a degree.
I would have had one quarter to finish the next year but the increase in income had placed me into a higher income bracket for federal aid and tuition raised again that year. It would have been fine if my employer didn't pull it's corporate slimy maneuver of hiring up more people in order to drop hours just low enough to not qualify 90% of it's work force for the union benefits.

It was at this point, dropping out of school and only given 12 hour work weeks, that my depression took a tailspin.  I couldn't afford rent at those hours and I was about to be homeless but I had found a full time job at a warehouse with overtime. I applied and was told I could start that week. I put in my two week notice at the old job and only had to work two weeks at both jobs. However I had herniated two disks in my back at the warehouse and couldn't work. The other job was fine with letting me finish employment at that time with no fuss but because the warehouse was signing new contracts company wide because of a change with the company they were contracted through and they basically didn't resign me and laid me off. I was fine with that because I could find a job once my back was healed. However, my workmen's comp claim was denied because it couldn't be proven that the injury happened at one or the other job's so in the middle of physical therapy hospital bills that would have been paid through L and I were dropped on me, the best part was the hospital told me to not worry about giving any insurance info because L and I would cover it, by the time it was denied it was too late to claim under insurance and I couldn't walk at this point. 

The depression has had a hold on me since the day my L and I claim was denied. It's grown into so much more than I could have ever imagined. I feel more numb every day, emotionally and physically numb. As cliche` as it sounds it's true and I all around just don't care if I live any more. This past week has been especially difficult and I don't know exactly why but there hasn't been a single day this week that I haven't woken up thinking about killing myself and It kind of surprises me but it doesn't frighten me in the slightest way  that I want to end my life. Right now the only thing stopping me from ending my life is my Grandmother, the only human being that has ever given me any type of love, has buried to many grandchildren and children of her own. 

I honestly don't want to contribute one more second of my being contributing to this fucked up society that seeks monetary gain from atrocities like the Boston bombing. All anybody cares about is money and the easiest way of getting as much as possible. 

TL;DR, I couldn't care less if you read this.


edit: An extension to the original post more back story as to why.

While I realize my depression is mostly situational it isn't what contributes mainly to my suicidal thoughts. It is what our species has become and how it has achieved what it has, especially the "modernized" humans. These are the reasons I no longer want to be a part of this world.

The United States prides itself on being a "strong" nation that doesn't "tolerate" injustice. The United States has become what it is today by basically steam rolling any and all civilizations that don't mesh with it's belief's. We declare that terrorism is the greatest threat to civilization, however it is the largest state terrorist organization to date. The biggest example is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While we don't fight that war with troops on field, we fund one side of the conflict. While I do believe that all people deserve a place to call home, I don't believe this gives anybody the right to systematically uproot inhabitants of an area, regardless of size, to create this home. The State of Israel has been erected on blood of a stateless nation of people with the help of the United States. While I don't condone the way the "Palestinian" resistance has gone about fighting back, I can't say that I blame them. While they were not a declared nation or a declared ethnicity, they had a home. Now they don't, "Palestinians" have been forced to live as refugee's in neighboring countries and treated as sub-human. How does the United States respond? By funding Israel and helping them become a declared nation as well as expand as much as they can. While the "Palestinians" and Israeli military forces have resorted to extremism and only the "Palestinians" are labeled terrorists. During the birth of the United States the people revolting against unjust rule were labeled as terrorist's as well. But I could speak much more on that issue as this issue was a major topic of study for me in college.

While it is very demoralizing that I nearly graduated with a major in International Politics and Business with a minor in macro economics and journalism, it is not a driving factor in my depression. It's the fact that the only thing that I was stopped short was money. MONEY. That green fucking paper that everybody is so god damn thirsty for. Tuition rose, financial aid got cut, and my having a job and working more at work caused me to receive less aid. I had fought as hard as I could to stay in school and broke through walls that should have slowed me down but only made me speed up just in case the next one was larger. That was until I literally hit a wall that was impassible. I needed to pay x amount of money out of pocket to pay for the increase in tuition and lowered financial aid received. I needed more hours at work to be able to pay rent and school, but the hours were non-existent at the location I was at. I searched other locations in the same company that had the hours and would take a transfer. Luckily that happened by pure chance. One of the other guys I worked with got scheduled to help setting up a new location that was kind of far away and he didn't want to drive the distance, so I swapped schedules with him. It was two weeks of setting up and stocking the store. The night shift supervisor was apart of the team and told me he was looking for a full time night crew worker and really wanted me to fill that spot because I worked my ass of the whole time. He the store manager said he wanted me as well and would accept the transfer in a heart beat. So, I had found a store that could give me the hours to finish school and get my degree. With my head high on my way back to my store I had gone in to my store to request the transfer. That was one of many soul crushing experiences of my life. My store manager said she wouldn't put in the transfer because she, "didn't believe it would be accepted by upper management." I talked to the supervisor and was told I could quit and apply at his store but couldn't guarantee that I would be hired. That was such a hard situation to swallow and I was so upset so I started looking for other work. Many months passed and it continued to suck more and more. Then there was going to be an opening for a management position in a department that I was qualified for and was being looked at by the current manager to replace him after he was promoted. upper management hadn't reached a decision on who would take over the department before the manager was promoted and it stayed open for a while but another guy at my position and I were given the responsibilities of that departments management without a pay raise and split the hours. After 4 months of this we were over the indecisive of the situation and upper management caught on. They announced they would have a manager for the department at the end of the week. Excited that one of were going to be manager we decided who ever got it would make the other second, but the announcement of the promotion was made and it was that one of the manager's from another department would take the position, that didn't have a clue about the department, and his department would go to one. Everybody was upset. Everybody knew why they did it that way, it was money. Nobody needed a pay raise this way problem solved, except me and the other guy had to train the new manager. They didn't care that both of use needed the hours and/or pay raise. 

Then the warehouse job opportunity came up and I jumped at full time. Then the back injury happened. First hospital visit I was told to go back to work at light duty after the E.R. doctor poked my back once, given an Aspirin prescription, and helped into a wheel chair ,because I couldn't walk, for discharge. Two day's later the pain had gotten to the point that even with help I couldn't put any weight on my legs and was carried to the car by a neighbor and my dad to go to a different hospital. At first they put me through basic drug seeker checks. Quickly realized I really was in pain when they tried to have me sit up. I was given pain killers and I fell asleep for the first time in three days. When I woke up I was given an MRI and confirmed I had two herniated disks. They also took blood when I was first admitted, probably to test for drugs, they also told me I had Diabetes. I was given an appointment with a spine specialist who sat down and gave me a referral to a physical therapist, who after the L and I claim was denied charged me just under $500 for a referral/consult. The L and I claim wasn't denied until half way through physical therapy and out of the whole experience were the only ones willing to work with me on payments until I got working and also helped me file an appeal, which got shot down instantly because I couldn't prove what job the injury happened at...basically blah blah blah we won't help you because you can't prove it so we can save MONEY.

When I was able to walk I went to a doctor to start diabetes treatment. I couldn't afford the appointments after the first three and wasn't able to go back. I also can't afford the supplies because my health insurance doesn't cover any testing supplies and a small portion of insulin and nothing on needles. Basically unable to treat my diabetes. Keep a close watch for symptoms of high or low blood sugar. I have type 2 but the doctor was worried it was possibly type one in early stages and would start to present as type one at some point. I have no idea because I can't afford any doctor visits let alone the basic supply's to treat it. Fucking money. I need money to be well. MONEY. Why is it that even when it comes to deceases that will kill cost so much MONEY? Even if I had cancer right now I couldn't fight it, I don't have enough MONEY!

It's funny, MONEY doesn't just make the world go 'round now, it's a fucking requirement to live. If I was in a car accident tomorrow and it wasn't my fault and they didn't have any insurance I would be ultra fucked because I don't have enough MONEY for that. Of course I would receive life saving treatment but that would go onto my "tab". 

Modern civilizations fucking disgust me to my core. How do we even fucking dare to say we are "advanced" civilization when we value MONEY over human life. That Galaxy S4 is coming out next month, how many people are going to buy it? How many people are going to think about the atrocities the person goes through every day that put that phone together? The new iPhone is supposed to launch in September, how many will think about the person that put their new phone together probably wants to kill him or her self? Or the fact that they spent $600-$700 retail on those phones when it cost a couple of dollars to make? How many saw the news of the iPhone production facility in China that is prone to explosions because of poor conditions, or the fact that suicide is so prevalent that they installed nets on the fucking housing blocks to prevent success? Do the people that saw that and still buy these phones not care about human life? Are they not able to make a human connection because of how far away it is? I honestly don't know and find it fucking demoralizing that we as humans don't see that and think critically about our decisions in regards to financially supporting a company that would continue practices that put MONEY about human life. It makes me feel shitty for being a human at all. We saw the revolution of an entire region in the middle east fight against tyranny and when there was a slight move towards progress we stopped caring and stopped paying attention and the tyranny washed back in like a tsunami, the receding tide was the calm before the wave hit land. Now Syria is in danger of becoming the next Rwanda, Iran, or Pakistan, where civil unrest creates a dangerous deep seeded hatred based on affiliation at birth for the next generation. We just sit back and collectively and right letters saying it's bad and they should stop or else we'll right another fucking letter. 

We are such a fucking worthless excuse for an "intelligent" species. We're just fucking beast's that have tools that are far more destructive than sticks and stones.
