The right thingTalk to someone?  I've got better shit to do with 72 hours.  Permanent solution to temporary problem?  The only time I don't want to die is when I'm clearly delusional, and that just gives other people more reason to be angry at me.  The most selfish thing a person can do?  Me eating and breathing is selfish it just causes me to be alive and fuck things up for other people longer.  Its not about ending my pain its about reducing everyone else's.  I am stupid, I am weak, I am worthless.  Everything I think, feel, say, do is wrong.  Everything about me is wrong.  I need to do the right thing and I've known it all my life.  I can't say "good bye cruel world" or "fuck you" to the world.  I can see reality for what it is and I'm sorry it took so long.
