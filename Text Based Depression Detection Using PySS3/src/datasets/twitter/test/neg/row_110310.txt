Just had such a good month and now Iâ€™m sitting on my bathroom floor deciding if Iâ€™m going to see tomorrowEveryone always tells me Iâ€™m a bitch and awful and then I donâ€™t hear it for a little bit so I think maybe Iâ€™m getting better but I never do. Everyone ends up hating me and I never do anything right. Like I really just had my best friend tell me her life has been miserable for these past few months bc of me and nothing I mean nothing has taken away every bit of seretonin faster. I really donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. Iâ€™m not gonna be a good enough person for anyone and Iâ€™ve ruined everything so
