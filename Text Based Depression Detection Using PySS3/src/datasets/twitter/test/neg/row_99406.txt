I made things worseThis is a follow-up to [my previous post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5maywr/i_never_thought_i_would_but_here_we_are/)

So I decided to phone CRA (the Canadian IRS) to see what I need to do to get my Student Loans back into good standing, so maybe I can go back to school and finish a certificate program or a trade.

It would cost me about $6K to get back into good standing. But, now that I've contacted them, they've given me 24 hours to set up a repayment plan or else other collections methods will start. My current job is ending soon and I haven't had a call back from any of the other 2 dozen places I've applied to.

I can't afford to go into bankruptcy because of the fees involved.

My province used to have a skills training program, but it was cancelled because we're under a conservative government.

I've explored all my options and I have none, and I've made things even worse by trying to fix them.

Now I *have* to kill myself. It's the only way to save my loved ones.
