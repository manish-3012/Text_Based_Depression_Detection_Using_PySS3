POCD has made my life a living hellItâ€™s become sort of a vicious cycle, I wake up every few days with a new way to try to convince myself Iâ€™m a horrible person. Usually Iâ€™m able to keep it contained, even joke about it but every week or so, I cry my eyes out. I consider my own suicide as an option, before coming to the scarier realization that Iâ€™m scared of dying, only using this as a reason to reinforce that Iâ€™m a bad person. I havenâ€™t been able to be proud of my own achievements in so long, because it all feels undeserved. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m making this post right now, maybe itâ€™s a cry for help? But I donâ€™t think I deserve that either.
