ZombieAt this point iâ€™m just a dead man walking. Iâ€™m only alive right now to try to get better, and I hope i do. But i doubt it. The medications donâ€™t work, the therapy doesnâ€™t work, new scenery doesnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t even see a future for me anymore. 

Itâ€™s not fair to have this, i didnâ€™t ask for this illness. I was even told my doctors previous drug use didnâ€™t do this, it was to self medicate. Iâ€™m so tired of fighting, Iâ€™m so tired of feeling alone. Why should I fight? Whatâ€™s so wrong about me leaving?  Itâ€™s so selfish that people expect me to live like this forever when mostly every day is just agony.

I just want to rest, I just want peace. I want my funeral to have people attending it. This illness has already caused me to isolate, or caused people to leave me, or caused dynamics to change. Iâ€™m ruining my life, i donâ€™t want to die with nothing but ruined memories of the sick person that i am right now.

The day is getting closer for me to pass on, for now I guess I just suffer alone.
