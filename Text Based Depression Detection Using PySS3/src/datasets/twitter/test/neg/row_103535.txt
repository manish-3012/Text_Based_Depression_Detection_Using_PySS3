Do I want to kill myself?I mean Im not sure and i dont have a valid reason to do it. I love my gf, i have some friends that i can trust, but im just overall sad, the only things that bother me are my job that I hate(i cannot really get anything better atm) and just the fact that i donâ€™t see a reason in life since im dying anyway no matter what i do.
Am I just edgy? I just cannot imagine myself living and getting to be old and happy.
Also Im sorry if i mispelled anything, english is not my native language
