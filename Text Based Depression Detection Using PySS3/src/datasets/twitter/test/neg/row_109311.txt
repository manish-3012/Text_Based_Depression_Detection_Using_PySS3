I am a cowardI am a weak excuse of a human. I've always felt like a burden to those around me, I have no social life whatsoever, I fail in every single thing I try. But still, I can't find the courage to finally put an end to it all. I've been slowly trying to kill myself. I have used pretty much every drug available in hopes that I might OD. Nothing really seems to amuse me anymore. I am sick of trying to get through the day. I am so worthless I wish I wasn't ever born. Life sucks, I wish I could gather the courage to finally do it.
