VentingSorry I just needed to vent somewhere. So much has been going on and my emotions are too much to handle, I donâ€™t even understand them, even little things will set me off and my mind will just race. Stuff going on with my friends, my own mind, money, thinking about the past, college, my insecurities, just everything keeps piling up. I hurt myself yesterday, nothing big or deep, just with scissors but thatâ€™s how it started off last time, Iâ€™ve not done it in I think over a year and now it all got too much. I do go to therapy, my next appointment is in a week so I do get help. I have a meeting with college tomorrow so they can try and give me support there as well. I just donâ€™t know how theyâ€™d react if I tell them Iâ€™m self harming again or if I tell them that the majority of my thoughts have been about killing myself lately. Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t go to college today because I didnâ€™t trust myself to go and not do anything. I am trying with myself but it gets harder and harder with each day. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can cope. I canâ€™t see anything good about myself or life anymore. Iâ€™m just an unattractive, annoying, burden of a teenager. Who would truly care about someone like that? I have so much emotional baggage with my past, my present state and my mental health that the majority of people wouldnâ€™t want to deal with, and I can understand that. Iâ€™m sorry, this wasnâ€™t to worry anyone or anything, no one should have to worry about me. I just needed to vent somewhere before I actually lose my mind.
