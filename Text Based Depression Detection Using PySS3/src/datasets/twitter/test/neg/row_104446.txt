OverI've never posted twice in one day. I'm crazy. I can't stop trying to contact him and it's ruining my life. I need to see him again. I need to. I don't want to go on. I'm doing it now. I have to. I'm taking the bus to the train station and I'm going to do it. I can't live this way anymore. It's over for me, it has been for months now. I'm done.
