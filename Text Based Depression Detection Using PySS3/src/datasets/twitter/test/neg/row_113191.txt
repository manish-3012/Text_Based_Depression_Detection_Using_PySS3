Some days I am really tired of livingI am almost 44 and I have had depression since I was 10. I have a permanent physical disability, even surgery couldnâ€™t fix it. I get treated differently by my able bodied peers. They either pity me or avoid me. Just generally make small talk which gets really boring. I was conceived out of wedlock by parents being the first child and I got the curse of life. Siblings are doing better than me. Able bodied, healthy and very attractive. I have dated in which relationships havenâ€™t lasted for more than 6 months. I am tired of being told to learn to let go of them while my loved ones make me feel like they keep me on a tight leash. So much for â€œletting go.â€ 

I donâ€™t have a plan. I feel too tired to even carry one out. I am just so tired of crying everyday, taking meds, trying to get out of bed and take care of everyday life stuff. My disability makes me feel isolated.

I wish I could just sleep and never wake up from this body. I wish I had a different one.
