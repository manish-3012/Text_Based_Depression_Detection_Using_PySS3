PainNo matter what I do, I always end the day hating myself. I donâ€™t serve any use to this world. I am in deep pain and am in a constant state of hatred for myself. My anger boils up inside me and I only can imagine destruction to ease my hurt. Itâ€™s like this life finds a way to fuck me over, day in and day out. I see others being happy and loving life. I feel so terrible. I am absolutely miserable and a God canâ€™t save me. Iâ€™m just venting but everything Iâ€™m saying is true. Why was I put here just to suffer?
