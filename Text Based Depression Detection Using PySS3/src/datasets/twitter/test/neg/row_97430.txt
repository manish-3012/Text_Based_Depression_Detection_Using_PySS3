Thinking about how life holds so much pain.Hello there,

I will be 30 next month and I don't see any future at the moment.

I'm emotional unstable and it's hard to pay attention to the important parts in life. 

Right now I'm sitting at a train station after I had a fight with my girlfriend. We both got so mad that she left the apartment and went with the train to the next city I assume but not sure. 

My current life could be good I think. But I have throw my small web developer business 60.000â‚¬ debt and can't find a bank to finance it. Next month at, almost at my birthday, I have to pay 8000â‚¬ and don't know how.

Last year 2 family members died, my sister opened up to me that she got raped as a kid, my business went downhill. I feel completely lost and don't know how to deal with everything at once. 

Don't know what to do or where to go with my life. 

My girlfriend is not answering me and I'm worried...

I don't know how long I can or want to keep up with this.
