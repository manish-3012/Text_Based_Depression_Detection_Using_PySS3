keep hanging on...i found this subreddit by clicking random. just wanted to share my story, if that's okay....

i've been depressed since 6th grade &amp; was a cutter from the 6th grade until about 2-3 months ago.

my life as of right now? my boyfriend of 1 &amp; 1/2 years is breaking up with me because we never get to see each other, one of my CLOSEST friends just died in a car accident, i'm losing my job &amp; my apartment. &amp; in a little less than a month it'll be the 2 year anniversary of my best friend's death due to suicide.

but you know what? things ALWAYS find a way to work out. I promise you. I know how much life sucks, believe me, I've been through some REALLY rough shit. there is always someone to talk to, and there WILL be better days. please don't let go.
