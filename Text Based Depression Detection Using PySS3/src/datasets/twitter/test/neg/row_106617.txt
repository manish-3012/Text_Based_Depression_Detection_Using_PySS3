I donâ€™t see any solution for my happiness besides dying.I donâ€™t even have the energy to get into it. Iâ€™m miserable in my life, and my mental illness is debilitating. I canâ€™t even handle such a minimal amount of stress, and I canâ€™t function. 

On top of that, I remembered some serious trauma from my childhood, and I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s real or not. I break down any time I even have to do a small thing for the business my fiancÃ© and I own. I regret opening the business every single day, even though it was really my boyfriendâ€™s dream and he handles most of it by himself (and enjoys doing so). 

I went to a psych ward for 10 days, and I just got back. While I was there I didnâ€™t want to die, because I was removed from everything stressful in my life. But now Iâ€™m back, and if I so much as *think* about my responsibilities, I break down crying. 

I am not meant to be alive. Iâ€™m too weak to handle the stress of it. I feel like itâ€™s inevitable for me to end my life.
