I posted a few months ago or something, and now I'm feeling bad again.It all started because I sent my boyfriend a link to an article about "toxic parents." I did it because he has some serious issues with his parents. We've talked about it before so I don't think it was offensive or anything. I don't understand why he wouldn't say anything about it.

Well I was at work when that happened, and I recently got told that I'm about to lose my job if I can't figure out how to do all the computer work that's required of me.. even though it's a work-study job that I've had since september and only work 8.5 hours a week.. not nearly enough to fully learn a lot of different procedural steps on unfamiliar software with no training.

Someone came in and asked where the herpetology lab is and I told them, then I started talking to them about how that's my second choice for major and stuff. After they left my bosses talked about how they didn't know what herpetology was, then they looked it up and made comments like "Yuck who'd want to go into that?" "I'd kill that if I found it!" "People who major in that aren't going to make any money."
Made me feel pretty shitty.

My boyfriend always does stuff like this.. I'll try to talk about something that's important to me or something, and he'll blow it off. I was supposed to go to counseling this morning and he didn't ask how it went.

Speaking of counseling.. I was trying to go to the free counseling center at my school. I had an appointment for Thursday, but when I got in they said they accidentally scheduled another person for the same time. They asked if Monday at 11 could work and I said sure. I went up there this morning and they said the person I was supposed to see isn't in and I'll have to reschedule for tomorrow morning. It's like I'm not meant to go to counseling or something. Pretty frustrating, but whatever.

I turned my phone off and now I'm just laying in bed crying. 

I feel really bad right now. I want this to be over. I went to the cafeteria to have my last meal. No one said hi to me. No one waved at me. Oh well.
