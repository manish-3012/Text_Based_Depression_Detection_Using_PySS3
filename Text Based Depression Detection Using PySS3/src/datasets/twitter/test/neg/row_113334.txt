I want to kill myselfI hate my existence. I'm always so tired and I can never get any energy to fix it. people say they care, but in the end they were all lying. everyone I know always leaves me and It's always my fault. I do self harm constantly and even when I don't try and hide it no one cares anyways. I'm a selfish and disgusting human being who deserves to be alone. I'm not allowed to be sad because everyone I know has it worse and all my attention shifts to them whenever their hurting. I have talked my friend out of suicide multiple times, but whenever I need help no one can help. I'm surrounded by people, but I constantly feel alone. I have been suicidal for 3 months now, but no one cares. I can't afford therapy (not that it would help) and my parents think it's all for attention. That's all I am. I'm just a disgusting attention hog. I want to die. all my problems would be solved along with everyone else's. I'm just everyone's problem. My mind is a mess and it's all tangled and I can't fucking untangle it. I am seriously just considering taking the entire bottle of Advil and whatever other shit I can find in there and just fucking ending it. I'm tired and eternal sleep seems like the answer. I don't know what to do anymore. I need help, but i can't get any. I'm just so fucking done. I'm so tired of crying, but I don't have anything besides this.
