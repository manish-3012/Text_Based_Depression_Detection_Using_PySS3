I just can't win can I ?So I was at a party yesterday and kissed a random girl. She was my first kiss since my ex broke my heart. Now all I can think about is how much I miss my ex. So by trying to be happy and move on I feel dragged back into the darkness. why did I ever fall in love and give this one girl so much power over me. I still love my ex and I don't know what to do. If you look at my post history you'll see how it's been a big problem for me. I hate love right now because I so badly want to love someone else. But I am just a mush of emotions and I don't want to be alive anymore. I've been through so much turmoil and I just need it all to end. I'm anxious and I don't know if I'll ever be able to move on from my first love. Everything is just really bad right now. What can I do . How do I do this. I want to be strong again.
