whats the pointim used to rejection and doing my best to try to see the bright side. i used to have a lot of real friends until i had a mental breakdown and my dad told them all to fuckoff so now noone wants talks to me before i was put in a behavioral center for 3 days. sure its possible to make new friends but the feeling of isolation overwhelms me because it just does. I never feel welcomed except by some of my family but they would never understand. They know im sad but they really dont know how bad it gets. I try to help other people and be selfless by reaching out to those that contemplate suicide and seem to have it a lot worse but anything i say is almost never acknowledged and i feel even more worthless. i want to stop thinking about other people but i also cant because if i only care about myself then i cant imagine what i would really become. im not a bad person. but it feels like it. i stopped taking meds for my anxiety because it heavily affected my memory and made me want to commit suicide even more. i hate this. i know i will continue to feel shitty with this illness. i offered to help but theres nothing i can do beyond that. I pray "God" savea me before it gets unbearable and I have to "save" myself
