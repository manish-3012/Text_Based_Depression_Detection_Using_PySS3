&gt;In order to create an ideal world, every man, Christian or not, has the duty to live in the same way that Christ is depicted. What this means is, every man must live by unconditionally loving his neighbour. For people to live in peace and happiness, there can be no hate or desire for othersâ€™ misfortunes in their hearts. Why? Because in a world in where everyone is happy, someone who wishes ill to another cannot be happy, since his happiness depends on the suffering of the latter. And if everyone is to be happy, no one can suffer.

&gt;Christâ€™s cross is to represent the burden this love implies. The world is far from utopian, and most likely this will not change. But for those who truly wish to try to better the world must love others. And he who loves others in an imperfect world will see them suffer. And he who sees those he loves suffering, will also suffer. In the same way Christ is said to suffer for othersâ€™ sins, those who sincerely love others will suffer when they err.
&gt;
&gt;And this is why I want to apologise to everyone, since, different from the Christ the Church represents, I have been unable to carry this burden. I believe that in my determination to alleviate others from their problems, I rejected their offers of help; I rejected my Simon of Cyrene. And there is no man more arrogant than a Christian who believes he can carry a burden bigger than that of Jesus himself. I could not carry my cross without Simon, and I do not want to ask for help, as I do not want to be a bother.
&gt;
&gt;And so, I have no other path but to fall. My suffering cannot be compared to carrying all the sins of the world, but I could not carry those I tried to. And for this, I apologise to all those I met and loved, and I hope I can one day be forgiven.
