I want an unsuccessful attemptI have had unsuccessful attempts in the past, of course 

I want one so that someone may listen to me when I say I need something to change for my mental health to improve

I want to die

I'm trying my best to live though 

I feel like i am going to attempt

But part of me hopes it is unsuccessful in a chance of finally getting help

But the other part wants it to succeed

I know its greedy and manipulative, but each time I come out and say "I need this because I am suicidal" I am shit down, told to shut up, put on suicide watch, and made to feel more suicidal
