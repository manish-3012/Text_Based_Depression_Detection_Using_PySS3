I'm not even sure why I'm posting thisI don't even know where to start. I posted some topics here a few years ago, discussing why I am depressed. The short of it is, I used to be a devout christian, until sometime mid 2008 a rapid and overwhelming series of events forced me to realize that if there is a god, he is a royal jackass and unworth any man's love or obedience. This sent me spiraling into depression and eventually a bastard combination of depression and nihilism. I got a job at one point, which I promptly deserted after three days. I've successfully destroyed just about every social facet of my life. And now I have moved on from simple self-loathing and hopelessness to actually hating each individual member of humanity; Viewing everyone as a corrupt, backstabbing, and utterly vile creature, wishing nothing short of complete genocide upon this entire damned race.

Would I ever actually kill anyone? No, not unless I could take out everyone at once, which is obviously an impossible goal. So any efforts would be utterly pointless. This does however prevent me from ever carrying on a "normal" life, as I look at everyone with nothing but hatred and paranoia. This of course leads to even more feelings of isolation and loneliness. Couple this with the fact that I, as mentioned, view all things as entirely pointless and trivial, and thus not worth the time or effort, and it's obvious why my suicidal desires have only intensified over these last few years.

Obviously I realize that I'm irreparably stunted and broken as a human, and my complete and utter lack of effort in taking care of my diabetes (Type I) mean that I should just do the inevitable and off myself.
