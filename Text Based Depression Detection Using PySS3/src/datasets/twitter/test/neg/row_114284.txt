Today everything hit me at once...Today everything hit me at once.  Iâ€™ve had slight suicidal thoughts in the past, but nothing like Iâ€™m experiencing right now.  A little over a month ago, I was at work, sitting in a random hotel room in a random part of the country, having what felt like my most depressed day Iâ€™ve ever had.  Hereâ€™s what was on my mind.  Iâ€™m single, and none of my â€œfriendsâ€ ever call me just to see what Iâ€™m up to, or invite me to dinner, or hang out, etc., but they all hang out with each other all of the time.  I donâ€™t know why, but that really got to me.  For the first time ever, I felt really alone.  Iâ€™ve been in a few relationships, one serious, but Iâ€™ve just been really lonely.  Iâ€™m surrounded by people, strangers, hundreds of them for most of the day, but at night, Iâ€™m alone.  No one to go home to and talk to, not even a cat.  So anyway, Iâ€™m really depressed, sitting alone in my hotel room, and I get a random message from a dating site from a random girl who is interested in me.  We start chatting, and she initiates everything.  Sheâ€™s really cute too, by far the cutest Iâ€™ve ever dated.  Anyhow, she invites me to hang out the next day, and for the first time ever, on this very day I was so depressed, it turned around.  We met the next day, hit it off really well, and went on a road trip the next day through the desert.  For about two weeks we would go to dinner, talked about the relationship, and do cute couple things.  I really liked waking up to a â€œgood morning sunshineâ€ text.  It made me feel like someone was thinking about me.  Then it faded.  We never slept together, but she slowed down the contact.  The pet names were gone, the good morning texts were gone, the smiley faces, etc.  She had lost interest.  We continued to see each other for a quick walk around her place from time to time, but I was doing all the work.  I was doing the initiating, and she would respond hours later with a text.  Last night I went over to her place, and I was ignored while she browsed her computer.  It had been a while since we talked, but she didnâ€™t want to.  This was the night I was hoping for us to hit it off again.  It ended up with her â€œhaving stuff to do,â€ and me leaving.  It was apparent that she didnâ€™t feel the same way about me that I did about her, and that she wasnâ€™t willing to talk about it.

So today I went to see her on her lunch break, and long story short, she has simply lost interest in me.  I canâ€™t take another girl losing interest in me.  When she first contacted me, I was already depressed because I knew that I would fall for her and she would eventually lose interest, which happened.  This has happened time and time again.  I want nothing more than to be happy with someoneâ€”noâ€¦ to make someone happy, and as soon as I fall for one, they lose interest.  I canâ€™t take the rejection anymore, and I feel that every relationship I enter in the future, I will just be depressed because I know as soon as I really like someone, they wonâ€™t feel the same.  Thatâ€™s the main source of my depressionâ€”not feeling wanted.  That's what I'm afraid of.  I'm afraid I'll end it one day if this happens again... happens with someone I really fall in love with, or even marry.

I threw away a teaching career that I worked hard to achieve.  I taught for four years, and bought my own house that I lived in for about two years.  I felt like an adult for the first time in my life.  I did yard work, did interior design, had a cat, etc.  I came to the realization that I hated my career, and quit after four years of teaching, and ultimately had to foreclose on the house that wouldnâ€™t sell.  So now Iâ€™m a flight attendant.  I love my job, but I donâ€™t feel like an adult.  I live in hotel rooms, and when Iâ€™m back in base, I live in a shared room with other pilots and flight attendants.  Iâ€™m running from myselfâ€”thatâ€™s why I do what I do.  Thatâ€™s why I fly to random cities by myself on my days offâ€”just to get away from me.  I havenâ€™t cried in yearsâ€”not since the finale of LOST, but today I fucking lost it driving back from seeing her at work.

Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never have a normal life, or that itâ€™s getting too late for one.  I want a house, a yard, a wife, animals, and kids.  I want to grill in my backyard, cut my grass, and have someone waiting for me when I get home.  While this lifestyle is fun, itâ€™s only temporary.  Iâ€™ve never been normal, and Iâ€™m okay with that.  Iâ€™ve never been an alpha male.  In middle school and high school, I was a bully magnet.

Iâ€™m tired of being the nice guyâ€”the guy who is patient in a relationship, the one who gives selflessly so that the girl can be happy, only to have her lose interest.  It happens time and time again.  Iâ€™m ready for it to be my turn.  Iâ€™d like to have a shitty week, and have her call me, and say, â€œhey, how are you feeling?  Anything I can do?â€  Or at least acknowledge that I have feelings.

I donâ€™t cut, Iâ€™m not on anti-depressants, I donâ€™t drink, smoke, do drugs, gamble.  I eat relatively healthy and exercise occasionallyâ€”albiet Iâ€™m a bit overweight.  I donâ€™t know what my coping mechanism is.  Iâ€™ve lost weight from not eating lately.  Iâ€™ve never in my life not had an appetite.

I have a loving and supportive family, and a few great friends who Iâ€™m sure I could talk to.  I just paid off my car, so thereâ€™s really no excuse for me to feel this way.  I feel like an asshole for even being depressed, when thereâ€™s so much I have, and so much others donâ€™t have.

Even if this gets no replies, I just like the idea of getting this all out there, so that itâ€™s not all stuck in my head.

**tl:dr, As soon as I fall for someone, they lose interest in me, time and time again, and Iâ€™m starting to fear this never ending.  Most relationships Iâ€™m in end with the girl simply losing interest.  Thatâ€™s the part that hurts the most.  Itâ€™s knowing that someone you really care for simply doesnâ€™t care about you anymore, and that thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it.**
