Less than a week now.Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m really going to do it. When I get paid Iâ€™m going to get the pills I need. I wanted to go to the park and do it but I think Iâ€™ll stay home. 

Iâ€™ve lost all concern for myself and Iâ€™m not depressed any more. Just decided and determined. 

Thank you to those who have been there before. I apologize for not being able to recover.
