Looking for advice - pls helpA bit about myself - Im 15 and have been bullied most of my life. I play guitar and bass very well but I have zero confidence. I have extreme difficulties talking to girls i.e. when everythings going well with her either a) some random guy steals her or b) I fuck everything up. I feel extremely tired and done - not only with women but with life. I appreciate the responses.
