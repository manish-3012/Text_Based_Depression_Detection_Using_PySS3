Am I worth it?Sometimes I feel like i'm just useless. I always mess up at work, I cant stand being around people, nobodies ever fallen in love with me or asked me out, I have no skills and I'm not very smart either. the only reason I feel like i'm still alive is because of my dream of escaping my home and having my own family. I feel like ill never be able to complete that though especially because  I get overwhelmed from my families issues and the work I do. If i cant handle that then how could i handle a marriage and having kids?  I'm too useless to even make my dream a reality so why should I bother existing if I know the one thing i want will never happen?
