Iâ€™m going to kill myself todaySelf explanatory title. 

I called my mental health team last night to be told they can only offer me a workshop for coping skills for a couple of weeks and that any other support isnâ€™t necessary because things arenâ€™t severe enough, and this behaviour is â€˜typicalâ€™ of someone with my mental illness, despite the fact I havenâ€™t been unwell for over a year and even then wasnâ€™t presenting with symptoms nearly as bad as they have been the last few weeks.

I have nobody to talk to. I have nothing to live for. I have lived through pain and abandonment over and over and over again since I can remember. When I say that I have nobody, this is absolutely true. I have no trust and no space left in my heart for anyone new. 

Why the fuck should I keep living through agonising pain? Is it really selfish to kill myself? Or is it selfish for others to expect me to keep living through absolute hell for years and years because they might be a bit upset for a few weeks? This is all I know. Pain and grief. 

I feel homesick. But I have nowhere or nobody to call home. The only time I feel any semblance of relief is when I think about the fact that I am going to kill myself. 

I just wanted to get that out.
