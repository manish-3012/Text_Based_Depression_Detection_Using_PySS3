Ok I'm so pathetic. It's time to end it.You know what I did with my life?

I got an inheritance of 200k after my parents died and wasted it all on rent, studying, cigarettes and weed over the course of a decade. I smoked so fucking much and only ate garbage so I gave myself cancer. I had the sweetest girlfriend and dumped her like a piece of garbage. I didn't achieve anything because I had my inheritance and didn't feel pressure to work. I wasted my whole life and will die soon because I gave myself cancer. I'm 28 and my life is already ruined.

I texted my ex-girlfriend and she hates my guts now. Tells me I'm a loser and a whiner and she doesn't care if I die. She's right.

My miserable existence needs to end. There's no hope for me.
