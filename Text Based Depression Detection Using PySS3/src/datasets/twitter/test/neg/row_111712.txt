Gambled everything I had away, I'm fucking done with this worldNothing makes me fucking happy and the only way to escape my pain are video games as they allow me to be somewhere else

I just spent everything I had on a fucking gacha game hoping to get the one thing I want and I got fucking nothing

I know it's gambling, I know it's fucking dumb and I know I'm fucking retarded

Nothing in my life ever works out, my meds don't do shit and I'd rather die than going into a ward

Maybe its my fault, maybe it's society or maybe both

I dont want to be here anymore and now I wont be

And dont get me started on "somebody will miss you" nobody fucking will I'm nothing but a parasite
