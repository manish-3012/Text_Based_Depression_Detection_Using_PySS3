So tired of being aloneI'm so fucking tired of being alone. I just don't want to even go on anymore. I feel like I can't physically do it. I'm just not okay with myself. Everyone says that you have to learn how to love yourself, but 31 fucking years and I've still got no idea how to do it. the world just seems so fucking empty and pointless. There's nothing to make all of this fucking pain worthwhile. I keep thinking about killing myself, but I feel like I'm too big of a coward to do it, and I don't want to half ass it and wind up a vegetable or something.

I think I'm going to try to go see my doctor to see if I can get on some kind of antidepressants or something. I'm afraid that they'll commit me or something if I'm honest about how I feel.  I don't even know what the fucking point of this post is.
