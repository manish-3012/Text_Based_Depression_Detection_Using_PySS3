Was falsely accused of sexual abuse, my entire life seems ruined even after the situation has died down.Around 3 months ago, I was falsely accused of sexual abuse with a now ex-friend of mine. I was thrown in jail for 4 days, and the legal fees to get this sorted out cost me well over $10,000, the only reason I'm a free man is because my ex-friend did not press charges and my lawyer did an excellent job in proving that the allegations were false, even going as far as my friend admitting they were false allegations.

But the reason I'm here is because even after all the charges were dropped, and my name legally restored to a completely clean record, my reputation has been destroyed, a news report was made the day I went to jail with a story depicting me as a rapist and they refuse to correct the story after it was proven I was falsely accused and all charges were dropped. I live in a relatively small state in terms of population so I feel like I have a target on my back, and I feel like my music career, and opportunities to get a job, attend a college, or even live in a relatively nice place after I move out is ruined. I know that my best chance of starting a new life is moving away from this state and starting somewhere new, but I feel like the opportunities to do so have been completely crushed, I am unable to find a job, and most people seem to only believe the news story, and not the legal matters that proved me innocent. Honestly I'd be lying if I were to say that suicide hasn't crossed my mind numerous times throughout this entire thing, but I'd also be lying if I were to sit here and say that I want to die. I just don't see a way out of this and I don't see myself being able to live a normal life, let alone the life I've been trying to work towards as long as I can remember. I've been spending my days attempting to write with anxiety and stress blocking my creative vision, sleeping at all hours of the day with little motivation to get up, or chain smoking my stress away into the latest hours of the night in isolation. I have a few friends that have been trying their best to help me through this, but I have no pathway to follow, no one can seem to relate to my situation for obvious reasons and most people just sit and stare in shock when they hear my story, with nothing but sympathy and agreeing that I should probably start somewhere new. These sentiments are nice but I still feel alone, like people understand that I'm in as shitty a situation as you can be in, but everyone just wants to feel sorry for me, that everyone just looks at me as a victim of society but accepts that I'm done for, and I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to live a normal life and leave this place.
