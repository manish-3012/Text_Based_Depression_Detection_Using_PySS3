So hard to see you folksIn every sense of the word it's so hard to see you people. It's hard to see you suffering, it breaks my heart.

It's also just difficult to see you...at all. Many of you go about your daily lives and never show face; no one really knows your internal struggle. I know over the years I've gotten pretty good at it.

I don't really have a reason for writing this post other than I just wanted to say reading through these posts over the last while since I've found this subreddit...it's amazing what y'all go through. You guys are so strong, beautiful. I hope some day you can see that.

Take care my lovelies â¤ï¸
