I want to disappearI posted another thread on a different sub-reddit about how much I've fucked up so just a tl;dr for that I guess is: dropped out of uni, depressed, nothing helps, no skills or resume, nothing to be happy about, parents don't know any of this

And for the last 15 days since then I've basically done nothing to change it because I'm such garbage. Today I was asked by my parents about University stuff which was a prompt reminder that I've still changed nothing, and I just pretend I'm still attending and shit..

Suicidal thoughts happen a lot but today has just been miserable, I have so many dreams and things I want but I don't see how I can do any of it. I don't even know what I want as a career so how am I meant to get anywhere? 

There's no way I'll achieve any temporary labor jobs because I'm just useless, weak, unskilled, I'm basically the person that I made fun of when I was in high school, a failure.  

I hate everything about myself. And I hope this stupid virus kills me but I don't go outside so I probably won't have it. And even then I'm a coward.. so instead of killing myself, I really just want to disappear, just not be there, no longer there. No one would miss me, I know that. I was a burden to everyone I ever knew. I am a terrible person. I get angry and I deserve to be hated. I ruin so much. I have no good qualities, none, zero, zilch. 

I'm worthless
