My brother might me the only reason Iâ€™m still here.Itâ€™s been about 6 days since that post of mine here, and I feel no better, though at the same time no worst. My brother came home today for Christmas it was nice seeing him, we have a six year age gap, but Iâ€™ve always looked up to him. So in a way the reason Iâ€™m still here is just to see him again. 
Though something just a few minutes ago sort of changed that. Heâ€™s allergic to the cat so him and my dad had to go get him so allergy tablets. And I decided I could finally do it, I could leave and just find a nice place to die. But I didnâ€™t. My plan was to ring a person I no longer consider a friend, the reason for this is because we are very similar in how we act and how we are, and pray she didnâ€™t pick up, just so I could say all my feelings and get them out there without having someone talk back. But I couldnâ€™t bring myself to talk for a voicemail, so I didnâ€™t. And sheâ€™s then texted me asking if everyone was ok. 
Then and there I realised I couldnâ€™t do it. So Iâ€™m still here, my dad and brother are home. And Iâ€™m still alive.
