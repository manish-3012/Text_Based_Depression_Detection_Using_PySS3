I'm sad and could use some advice.Im not suicidal right now(I was earlier, and might be later), but I could sure use some cheering up. My girlfriend of just over a year got really mad at me because I never want to leave her alone when she is mad. I want to talk it out and forget about it as soon as possible. She prefers to be alone and just calm down.

So we got into a fight about tea, lol, and she ended up going home. She called me once and said we were not dating and needed a break. I pleaded into her agreeing to hang out some time tomorrow to give me a chance. She abruptly hung up and a few minutes later she texted me saying "No more". So I am highly confused. I have no idea what to do now. I would love any advise to help me resolve this and stay calm. I have terrible anxiety and shake when I'm stressed.
