Ending my life as soon as i'll have the chanceSo it seems like the time has come; it feels weird, but i guess i have no other choices at this point.

I was born with a pretty bad gender dysphoria, which held me from having a proper life: i don't have friends, i don't go out, i can't find things i like, all because there's clearly something wrong with how my brain devoleped at birth. 

I consider post-puberty transition a failure: it's not going to heal or fix anything, i'll just be stuck in a body that's even more disgusting and i'll be turned into a jobless laughing stock; the passing rates for MtF are so low that to think that a post-puberty MtF girl can lead a proper life is so unrealistic that i feel bad just by thinking about it.

The only way that 95% of MtF are kept alive is by extreme hugboxing: outside of a few circle of friends, they will always be seen as a bunch of failures with wigs; and this not supposed to be offensive because of course, being transgender myself i do see and would accept them as girls, but changing gender isn't just about how a small circle of people see you, it's about having the ability to wake up at every time, watching yourself in the mirror and being able to identify with the creature you see on the other side. Of course, same goes for when you're going out: people shouldn't even suspect of you being transgender; this is what i mean by passing.

But this is unrealistic: outside of a selected few, MtFs are sadly, aesthetically awful and will always be greeted with laughs or even worse, people pretending to be on your side out of pity. 

I've decided that i can't lead this "life" anymore and that i'll take my life as soon as i can: there's no precise date; as soon as i'll have to get the underground train, i'll throw myself in it.

Have you ever seen how fast those things go?

I'll shower the people waiting there with blood.

It will be so shocking that the media WILL dedicate some attention to this issue; maybe, in the process, the future generation of parents will learn to take this condition seriously instead of mocking their kids for having it. 

I don't care what awaits me after this: it could be reincarnation, it could be hell, it could be nothing; anything, even spending eternity with uncle satan is going to be better than this.

Im working on a little mini book thing with my experiences, so that the police will be able to close the case. 

My final thoughts?

Im more excited about doing this than anything i've ever done in my entire life.
