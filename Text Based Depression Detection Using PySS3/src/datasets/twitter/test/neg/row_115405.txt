Iâ€™m sorry My other posts: 

Iâ€™m done...

Iâ€™ve posted earlier, but itâ€™s just not worth it. Iâ€™m 10 and Iâ€™m been trying to kill myself, but I just canâ€™t, I keep thinking Iâ€™m a loser or that Iâ€™m weak, but I just donâ€™t know. I think Iâ€™m doing something wrong, all my â€œfriendsâ€ say â€œsuicide is selfishâ€, â€œyouâ€™re such a selfish ugly bitchâ€, and â€œI fucking hate you so muchâ€. I even fake smile and laugh every day... I froze my arm with an ice cube, then I cut/scratched my arm with a FUCKING rock yesterday. I donâ€™t know anymore, I just want help.... please.... 

Suicide

Hello, my name is Kat, and Iâ€™m 10 years old, Iâ€™m very suicidal. Iâ€™ve talked to a therapist, but I canâ€™t open up, I say â€œIâ€™m gonna kill myselfâ€ almost 10/more times a day. Any tips to help?

So, I donâ€™t want to make anyone sad or anything, but every night I find myself thinking of ways to kill myself. Stab myself to death? Pills? Slit my wrist? Beat myself to death? Starve myself? I always plan on killing myself the next day, as you can see, I never do. I think Iâ€™m such an ugly, selfish bitch, but I just donâ€™t know. I think Iâ€™m a loser, a bitch, a $!ut, (sorry I just donâ€™t like that word) an asshole, selfish. I just canâ€™t come to killing myself, I donâ€™t even have a reason, do I need one? I also fucking hate my body, Iâ€™m too fat, my hands are to big, my arms arenâ€™t skinny enough, my hair is too short for a girl, my face is too fat, too pimply, and too freckly. Iâ€™m just a lesbian freak, I get bullied for liking girls. I FUCKING HATE LIFE IN THIS WORLD
