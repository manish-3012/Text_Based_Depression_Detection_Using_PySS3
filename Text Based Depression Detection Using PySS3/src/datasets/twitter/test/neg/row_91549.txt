No one would give a shit if I killed myself.Around this time of year it's the worst, everyone saying how you need to value your family and those around you. A few therapists have said to me how many people would be devastated if i killed myself, but it's such fucking bullshit. My parents are either disappointed with me or angry towards me, depending on their mood, and my younger brother has autism and wont voluntarily talk to me. The three people outside my family who I am even remotely close too don't really give a shit about me, which has been proven time and time again by every time they forget about me/ignore me/don't invite me or talk to me etc. At this point there is no negative to me killing myself, only thing that has prevented me is my own fear which is in itself pathetic.
