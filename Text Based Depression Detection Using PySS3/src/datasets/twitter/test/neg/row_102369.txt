I have a noose tied, I am scared but doing it tonight or tomorrow. I give upI honestly give up, truly give up now.

Ive already been hospitalized, medicated, had therapy, counselling, crisis worker, case worker, pwychiatrist, excercising, diet, moving towns, college, family time, 

My mind is so fucked up and its ingrained. I cant stop hating myself, my shame and guilt is unbearable. I have tried it all and nothing works and its because of my fault, im too stubborn and self defeating. 

Ive been unemployed for almost a year now, family supporting me, trying to improve. I dont care about anything anymore, im the worst person ever. Literally the only thing i about is my mom, dad and two older sisters. I love them so much and they have been amazing to me.  I love them so much and they are qll i care about and have been the only reason ive been continuing to live for the past while. 

Living requires education, career, confidence, indepependqnce, money, stability, friends, romance, goals. I have none of these things. Im so hopeless. So i cant live, its not an option  i need to die  I am crying my eyes out because im going to miss not being a part of my familys lives anymore. I wish i didnt have to destroy them when i go. Its really scary before you die. I keep wondering if theres something im missing but there isnt and i just need to be brave and die. I find notes cliche and pathetic but i want to at least write them a note and thank them for how they hard they tried for me, how much i appreciate my short time i had with them, how i love them and know they love me. How sorry i am. I cant take this another second, im hyperventilating like crazy, i cant see, i cant see. Thanks everyone who tried to help me. Goodbye forever
