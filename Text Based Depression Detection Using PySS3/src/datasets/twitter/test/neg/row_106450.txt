Time of yearI bet a lot of people feel like me at this time of year, it's really fucking hard to face xmas on your own. I just don't think i can do it. I tried finding a charity to work with, I thought i could help homeless people or something, but they're so popular I just couldn't get in anywhere.  My ex, who i'm friends with, is really depressed so I don't want to kill myself as it would upset her, but I'm struggling so fucking badly. What are other people in my position doing over xmas?
