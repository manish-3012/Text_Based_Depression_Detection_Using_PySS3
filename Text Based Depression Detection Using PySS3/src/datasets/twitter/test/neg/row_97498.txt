i donâ€™t know what to doA year ago a met a guy and things started to progress fast and we moved in with each other states away. He broke up with me due to me letting my social anxiety and fears get in the way. I didnâ€™t just lose him but i lost his family too that i was close to his family more than mine. He wonâ€™t take me back and now i feel like i have nothing left

So now iâ€™m staying at a friends house on the couch with no money and have to leave in two weeks

iâ€™m looking for a job but iâ€™m going to have to leave before i can even get one

My only option seems like suicide because i want to be with him so bad. Even though i changed he doesnâ€™t want me anymore
