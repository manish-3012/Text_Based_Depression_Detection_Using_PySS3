Every time I have an argument with my boyfriend I want to die and itâ€™s not fair to himTitle. I feel so frustrated at myself for wanting to die at every little minor inconvenience or big argument. Itâ€™s not fair to him and I canâ€™t tell him how I feel because it isnâ€™t right for him to have to worry about ever bringing something up if I want to kill myself. I just want the pain to stop, I donâ€™t know if I want to die. This always happens and I donâ€™t see it ever getting better. Itâ€™s not fair.
