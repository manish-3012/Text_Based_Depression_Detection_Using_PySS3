I didn't realize I didn't have anyone to talk to about this anymore.I was depressed for a long time. Then I tried to kill myself about 2 years ago, Got on meds, things got better. Medicaid ran out. No more meds. Been okay for a few months. But the thoughts started coming back strong a month or so ago. I was letting them pass but tonight it pulled me down so bad I had to say something. I used to have so many people around but I lost them when i tried it last time. And now... I don't have anyone. The only person I thought I had left straight up refused to talk about it and tried to guilt trip and dismiss and ignore it. So yeah. I'm alone in this now. I didn't know that until it came back. Tonight is going to be rough. 2 hours until the sun comes up.
