I was called selfish for confessing suicidal ideationLast night i asked my 17 year old for help. He said he was going to nap for an hour but set alarm. He got up and was watching tv. I waited til he finished eating and asked for help rearranging living area for Christmas. I cant do it 

alone.


He said tomorrow. But he never does.

I told him i wanted to die.

Im not proud but its so true and i have no family except him n my pets who rely on me.

He rolled his eyes and looked at me with anger. " you really dont think about anyone but yourself do you?"

What does that even mean...i need help. There isnt any.

I am like a slave. Wouldnt be missed. No funeral...i wish someone human loved me.

Real love.
