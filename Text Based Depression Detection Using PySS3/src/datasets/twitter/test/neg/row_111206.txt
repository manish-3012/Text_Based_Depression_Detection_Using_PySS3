I always ponder suicide when a vicious array of realities present them self to me relating to gender.I am a guy in his 20s. And naturally most guys. One of their biggest dreams is to find a beautiful young woman and have a sexual experience with her. Here is the problem though. I have approached hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of women only to get accepted by those who either are single for a good reason, or trying to use me or are so high maintenance I just cannot handle it then I see women able to just easily pick up any guy they want and treat them however they want use them for money and we have to suck up to them continuously and put in so much effort in order to get anywhere. It seems horribly unfair. Now why would I want to kill myself? So many women have told me many nasty things that just given it to some hot guy and I have been treated like an inferior continuously over and over and over. It feels like complete hatred and discrimination. My hormones are bothering me so much that I feel compelled to look for women yet I wish I could stop because of how nasty women are being. And you obviously know how women are to men who just want sex. I get accused of everything from being a faker to a pig to a creep and so you mean to tell me the only way to do this is by going around and continuously worshiping this evil people? I now feel like I am essentially just a slave looking for a master to control me. My very existence as a guy makes me feel as though I am just nothing and I hate feeling like I am owned by someone long before I even meet  them UNLESS with the only few legal options out of it, going after a desperate fat woman(just got out of a relationship with a 400 pound woman), get a gender change or kill myself.
