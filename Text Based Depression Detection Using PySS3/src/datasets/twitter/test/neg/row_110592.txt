I think about killing myself once againso me and my parents just argued, about me not cleaning the dishes, my brother is supposed to do that. So my mom just got home and started shouting at me about the dishes. Im almost always home studying or playing with my friends. My brother is always outside playing with his friends. Today it was his turn to do the dishes, it has been several times he didnâ€™t do them and for some reason my mom blames me for that even though i told my brother several times that it is his day. After i went to take a shower. 

After that i see my mom crying in the kitchen and i try to calm her down and explain what happened when she tells me to leave her alone. 
Then. my dad joins, heâ€™s always working but not in a hard way, he tells me that i should do the dishes if i see them undone and that i should be left without internet for a time, i tell him that he doesnâ€™t even care about the house he only cares about food and clothes, he then unplugs the router and i plug it back in because i said i want to see who i can contact to leave this family. I have never said this before to them and it looked  like my dad was stressed while my mother didnâ€™t care at all. Im pissed of this stupid life and i want to change my family to another one so i can have parents who actually will care about me(if anyone knows anything about the change family thing in sweden please tell me because im not joking im going to end up killing myself in this family). Im 14 years old. My mom does not respect my interests and â€œmotivatesâ€ me saying that i wonâ€™t come in a gymnasium( i think itâ€™s college in USA though im not sure) and that i will work picking up garbage. 

I donâ€™t know what to do
