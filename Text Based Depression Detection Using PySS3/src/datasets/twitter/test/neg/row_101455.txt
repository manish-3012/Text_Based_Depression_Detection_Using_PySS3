Should i tell my therapist?I have a plan, i do not self harm, i see it as "ive accomplished all i want to accomplish and im done." Nothing traumatic has happened to me. I have no reason to be depressed. I just want death, because its something new i can experience, i want to know whats on the other side, and because life seems like a much worse option. What will my therapist do? i am 14. Will my therapist tell my parents? Will my therapist effectively put a stop to my plans in some way? I have no intention of harming others in my suicide, i intend on either skydiving, hanging myself or (at the very most traumatizing the train driver) jumping infront of a train. I would also like reccomendations on methods. I have written a note. lmk what i should do please.
