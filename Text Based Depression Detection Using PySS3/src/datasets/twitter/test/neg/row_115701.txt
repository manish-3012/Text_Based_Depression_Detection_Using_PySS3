SL #5i'm exhausted, 

i'm tired, 

i'm 99% done with life,

i'm done trying, 

its my life,

i'm the author, 

i choose when to end it and how to end it.

i'm tired of living for my family or friends. 

i keep telling myself that it will get better in time, i keep telling myself that this is just part of life or that i will soon be happy. but i'm not happy and i never will be. I can try and get help but it wont do anything, it wont work. why is the world so judgmental. why cant we live our own lives without fear of shame and embarrassment. why do we shove our beliefs down each other throats. if you don't agree then you don't. at the end of the day were all humans. regardless of wither or not you believe that God is real or Zeus is real. It doesn't matter because on this earth, all we have is each other. why cant we learn to love. i'm not telling you to accept or conform to others but just remain respectful. when were kids, we don't see race, or gender, or sexuality or politics. all we see is each other and how we love to play tag together. so why is that when we get older, negativity just takes over. you wont realize how much you needed me till i'm gone. i'm not saying that to sound stuck up. i'm saying that because i loved you all. i saw past your flaws and past your negative energy. but you didn't do the same. you pointed out my flaws. you made them seem like it was the end of the world. you told me that i was worthless. you told me that if i didn't change, know one would love me. you made fun of my mental health. you knew. you saw the signs. you read my hints. but you chose to focus on yourself and ignore me. you played the victim while I tried to help you. maybe that was my fault. i loved and loved everyone but i could never learn to love myself. I thought i could be the one to make a difference in the world. silly me. i only soon realized that they were called fairy tales because they never come true. wishes don't come true. your born into this world for a specific reason, to carry out a certain task. sometimes that task is to be an example. i'm an example. i'm an example of someone who loved too much but could never learn to love himself. I was happy once upon a time. but the weight of the world was too much for me to carry. after all, i had already been carrying everyone's problems on top of mine.  maybe i should have been more vocal about my problems. maybe i should have reached out. but as family and or friends, are you telling me you never noticed? you never saw my texts? you never listened to my music? did you never see my sleepless eyes? my slit wrists? my tears on my pillow? are you saying that you never knew? that's a lie. you knew, you just chose to not to do anything. why? were you afraid. were you scared that you would have done more harm? you wouldn't have, have you just told me that you love me. that would have made me look at life in a whole new set of eyes, had you told me that you see my struggles. that i'm going to be okay, that you'll always be there for me. i wanna cry, i want to just hold on to something, i'm tired, this sadness is like a bug who wont leave you alone on a hot sunny day, i want to get better, i really do. but i cant. you wont let me, i wont let myself, I've written so many suicide notes and each day i tell myself that today will be my last day. its not. i cant. i cant seem to bring myself to end it.
