Is it worth it to live for nothing but simple surface pleasure but nothing meaningfullI'm beginning to believe I'm just a peice of shit. I don't do anything positive l, my co workers hate me because I'm socially awkward and over the years iv blown up because of our fucked up social work structure. I'm 23 never had a girlfriend. Starting to think because I'm ugly and weird and just not good all around. I'm fucked I know it. I'm going to be alone and sad forever. I will never know success or fulfillment or true love or what it's life to be a father. No ones life would be effected if I just killed myself right now. I have enough drugs to do it but I'm afraid of the overdose. I don't think I'm quite there yet but man idk how much more I can take of the only fun I have being small social gatherings and party's. Because I'm so broke and fucked its not worth it to live the fucking 6-14 days so alone and so sad and just trapped before I can do something with someone for fun to escape.
