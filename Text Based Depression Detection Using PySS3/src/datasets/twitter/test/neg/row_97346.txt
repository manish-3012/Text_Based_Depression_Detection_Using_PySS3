Haha shit I'm losing my fuckin mind manI'm just sitting here at lunch in my school with my head down and my thoughts feeling like a clogged toilet, as usual. Like damn if I could just die right now I'm gonna dance in the void that I'll be in. My whole existence is pointless and I will never go anywhere in my life, everything is going to come to an end anyways but pain is keeping me alive. Hey like I'm ready to for my conscience to just vanish I won't have to go through the effort of offing myself. If I hurt myself little by little will I build up tolerance? I am a disappointment breaking my promises no matter how small ha I'm a piece of shit this whole world is so horrible, trying to get out of here, here being my body and this Earth I'm ready to fucking go yknow
