Trying to cope with being molested and taking the man to court. Also trying to cope with being the middle man for my boyfriend and friend who tried to take him away... Thinking of slow-burning suicide.I honestly can't take it. I can't take hearing my thoughts anymore, because it's all just jumbled. I'm hurt and I can't process it.

I am taking a man who molested me almost 2 months ago to court (hopefully,) and I'm dealing with two people who hurt me really badly, but I'm trying to help them... I don't know what to do. I can't have time to grieve or be sad, and I feel like it's hurting me. Since I can't be sad, I'm telling myself to buck up, and it works somewhat, but it isn't actually helping too much. I'm hurt *badly* and I can't say anything because I'm afraid my boyfriend will drop me, my friend will leave, and... well that all excludes the molestor...

Forgive me for not including details in that, I just don't want to talk about it all... But it's all affecting me to the point I'm contemplating a slow-burning suicide. I have diabetes, been drinking a lot of sugary drinks, eating a lot of sugary things... I've gone off my diet, and I'm just contemplating letting myself be taken by it. But I don't want to die... But I don't want to live. I can't keep letting everyone think I'm alright, and I can't let... I can't
let
everyone be sad.





Please help me.
