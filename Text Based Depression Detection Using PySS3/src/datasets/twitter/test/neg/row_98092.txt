It's starting to feel like an option.I'm 34, a recovering heroin addict, a former musician who is now a nobody and about to be alone again.

Two years ago I was in a hole and I met who I thought was my perfect match. We had about a year of the happiest time of my life. True love. She told me in the beginning she suffered from bi polar disorder and little by little I saw it. Constant criticism and control, followed by a few days of making me feel like the center of the universe. Because I have serious codependency issues, I have hung on tight, begging to be forgiven for things I didn't do, having my every flaw poured over and raked over the coals.

The past few weeks have been so bad, she's been rapid cycling so bad, I finally got her back on her meds and what happens? She goes out of town to visit her kids who are with their dad and she spends our rent money and when I ask her what we are gonna do now and why she would do that she absolutely eviscerated me and told me it's over, and to fuck off and that she'll go stay with her brother because she doesn't need me just her kids and her meds.

She's been out of work for months and we've been scraping by. Refusing to get a job cause she's depressed. Meanwhile I make the only sacrifices while I work 40 hours a week. 

I'm so codependent it's pathetic. I don't want to be without her. I am washed up and I feel certain that at 34 I'm too old to meet someone and have kids or change my life. I just feel completely lost
 
She was so perfect to me, and I want to believe she'll change and come back to me. I can't stand the thought of saying goodbye. I miss her love so much. 

I can go back and live with my family, but I'm getting too old for this. I want to be happy and have a family but I feel too ugly and too old. 

I'm starting to really think I just want out. I can't do this all over again.
