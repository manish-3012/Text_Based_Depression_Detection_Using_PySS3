TIL that saying you are suicidal and asking for help is emotional manipulation and means you have BPD. Also, beauty subs are full of ugly people.If you want the full story, go through my recent downvoted comments. The TL;DR version is that I have a controversial but ultimately harmless beauty-related opinion, and I shared this opinion on relevant thread in a beauty sub, much to everyone's immediate "holy shit you're a terrible person". Anyway, the only reason I haven't told my parents that this shit's happened and I'm in legitimate danger of hurting myself is

A: My godparents are over and I don't want to fuck up their visit with my bullshit feelings

and

B: The overwhelming feeling that I'm overreacting/not valid/really should be dead.

I'm crying a room away from them with legitimately no idea what to do, one or two rude words away from a serious breakdown. What should I do, Reddit?
