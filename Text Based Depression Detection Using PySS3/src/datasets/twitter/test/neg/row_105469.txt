Feeling pointlessI feel pointless. I feel like there is no reason for me to exist, we are all going to eventually go back to being stardust again, after all. Why should I even continue to exist?
I suppose a little back story is necessary, a bit about myself.
My family is supportive. There are the only reason I haven't killed myself, despite having no attachment whatsoever to this life. They care, but not enough.
I recently turned to drugs to help. Not good drugs, not antidepressants, like I know I need, I'm too young for those to have any proven affect. Studies show antidepressants don't help teens.

I have tried weed, alcohol, LSD, Oxycontin, Xanex, LSA, DXM, MDMA, meth, heroin, Ritalin, Adderal, shrooms, and probably a few others I can't think of at the moment.

I regularly use weed(7+times a week), DXM(5-6 times a month), and MDMA(2-3 times a month).
Recently, I had a bad trip with DXM.
I tried to will myself dead.
I want to stop, but I can't.
I want it to end.
It isn't as if I am incapable of rational thought, as I'm sure many people who commit suicide in-the-moment are. I am rational, I am capable of thinking logically.
Suicide seems like a decent option.
My grades have been slipping. Not due to the drugs, if that were the case they would have slipped sooner, but due to the fact that I simply don't care anymore. I have no goals for my life. My parents want to get a gun for home defense. I wouldn't last a week with a gun in the house.
The reason I say my parents are "supportive" is that they care about me. I told them once I was depressed, so they took me to a therapist, which didn't solve anything. I just pretended to be better after one visit and that was the end of it. I'm good at pretending. I have a nice set of facades. I wouldn't want all my parents efforts to raise me to have been in vain, or for them to think that it was. My dad is almost never proud of me, he recently started antidepressants(last month), and they just started working. Before, he would yell at me almost daily about my grades, drug use, and apparent lack of social life. I have friends. They also do these drugs, but they don't do them for the same reason I do. They use them recreationally. I use them to forget myself.
I've never been this open to anybody I know. Never. Nor do I plan to be. That would ruin the image I have.
I don't feel any attachment to living anymore.
