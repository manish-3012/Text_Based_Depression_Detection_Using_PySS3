If I fully believe Iâ€™ll take my own life sometime in the future, why wait?Why shouldnâ€™t end it now instead of possibly meeting new people to sadden when I do take my life?



Why suffer for a few more years and possibly end up going insane and become locked away instead?




Why not take my life and allow people to begin grieving instead of in the future? At least right now theyâ€™ll be the youngest version of themselves and probably handle the grief better than at an older age.





Why do I even have to make posts like this? Why do I know itâ€™s the depression talking and not *really* me? Why am I so aware but still unable to stop it? Why do none of these medications work? 



Why am I even posting this? All Iâ€™m doing is exposing people to my own negativity with zero benefits. My apologies.
