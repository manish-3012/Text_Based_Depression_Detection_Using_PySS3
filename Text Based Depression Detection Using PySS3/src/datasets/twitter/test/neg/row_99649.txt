Logically, I see only one way out.Sorry for bothering everyone here I just don't know where else to go. 

A quote I've heard a lot is that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. I must be pretty insane, then. Because I've tried for so long and for so many times to give life a shot but it just doesn't seem to work out. Maybe that's a sign. 

Even thinking logically. If we were scientists and running studies, and no matter the variable involved, the outcome was always the same: it would be futile to expect things to change. 

There are so many pros for me killing my self. 
1.) I would stop taking up space from other people who deserve it more.
2.) I would free people around me from the burden of knowing me. 
3.) I would be able to escape the pain. 
4.) My family would get more attention and support from my death than they could get from me. 
5.) People wouldn't have to believe in me only to get disappointed. 
6.) I wouldn't be able to hurt anyone. 
7.) Everyone would be free of my angsty, over-dramatic posts. 
8.) Less stress on people who interact with me and have to deal with me.
9.) All my stuff could go to charity and help people who deserve it.
10.) Depending on how I kill myself, my body could be donated to science and that could help people.
11.) I would not be around to use resources for help so more people could use them who deserve it. 

The only cons I see:
1.) Hurting my sister and my dad. But no one ever said I was a good person anyways. It would fit in with my character. 
2.) Accepting failure. But at this rate, my life is mostly a failure anyways so again, it would fit right into the narrative. 

The nice part is that finally, I have a choice. I have over 100 mg of Xanax. I just have to run down the street and get my favorite flavor of vodka. I have detergent and bleach downstairs. I have a bunch of pain pills, too. That could cause a seizure. Or I could just overdose on alcohol. With my body, it would be about 22 shots in an hour maybe more since I had to eat. Or if I can't do that, I could get drunk enough to cut deep enough. I also could induce a hypoglycemic coma with all the diabetes medicine I have. Or, if I wanted to have a blast, I could mix all the Xanax, vyvanse, diabetes medicine, anti-depressants, and pain pills and see where that takes me. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. Probably because I'm melodramatic and annoying. So you're welcome to ignore my ramblings since they're pretty dumb anyways. Sorry if I wasted your time.
