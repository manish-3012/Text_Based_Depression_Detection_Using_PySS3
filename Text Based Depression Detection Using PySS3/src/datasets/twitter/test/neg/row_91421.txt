I've destroyed my brain and it has led to a horrible existenceAs a kid, I never could study. I always needed help and never could ask for it since I was too shy to admit I had problems. This caused me to be an idiot and never be successful in anything or stick to something for long periods of time. I get bored easily and I can't do most things because I rotted my brain out at a young age by doing nothing but playing video games, watching tv and movies instead of working. I never could. I'm so useless.

Lately I've been wanting not to exist. I'm not worth the time of others because I don't contribute anything to conversation or activities. I'm the worst person in the world. No one understands that. I have no friends. I have no one to turn to. I can't go to my family because I have too much pride in that sense. They don't need to worry about me anyways because I'm just a burden to them since I can't do anything right and am annoying constantly.

I wish my life could be the opposite of what is reality. I want people to tell me that I'm a cocksucker, a cunt, a no life fucker, a loser, etc. I want the negativity. I don't want anything positive anymore since it will NOT help me. Can someone just tell me that I'm horrible? Is that really too hard to ask?

I've also been super lonely since I have no one. It's pretty obvious why no one wants to talk to me because I don't know anything and I'm a monster. I wear a mask.

Edit: Thank you for making me feel better, Reddit.
