I want to die so bad (probably long)I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but it seems like it.... 
So, i've been feeling suicidal for a long time, as most of people with depression.
But, i was always scared of death, i had panic attacks when i though i will die one Day...
That's why my suicide attempt failed a year ago, 'cause i was scared of death. 
But now, thinking about my death makes me happy,
I wrote sort of goodbye letters, i'm thinking a lot about ways to end this shitty existance.
And it is what i want to do, maybe not today, maybe not this month, but i feel like i have to, it Looks like a way out from my fucked up mind, i don't even feel alive, i do not feel anything almost, i'm not sad, i'm not happy, i'm not feeling like anything.
I Look forward to sleep, so why not to just... Sleep forever?
I would have No issues, no problems, no hallucinations.
I don't know, i don't even care that my family would be sad, i just want this shit to end, i've been dealing with depression for years, i've took this fuckin abuse, i've seen BAD FUCKIN Stuff, i. Am. Done.
I want to die, i do not want to live anymore, i am a failure, i fucked up everything i could.
My life doesn't matter, I'm a waste of space and oxygen on earth.
I want my life to change, if it'll be the same as it is, and i will still be screamed and insulted at for self harming by my stepdad instead of getting help, i'll end up dead.
I've fuckin tried to stop it, i cut my wrist so they would see, but they only scream now.
I told my mom about how i feel about myself, and she lied about going to therapy.
I see no fuckin way out, i was never fuckin happy, my Child Hood was mostly sitting locked in my room, being beaten and insulted by my dad, being starved, and seeing how he beated and raped my mom.
I fuckin hate myself, i hate him, i hate this fuckin world, my friends left me as i told them about this.
I AM FUCKIN TRAPPED, I'll NEVER FUCKIN TRUST THEM AGAIN.
I'm a usless fuck, i don't deserve thier help right?
Fuckin worthless bitch, that's who i am.
There are great people i met on reddit who help me as they can, but i need help from my mom or ANYONE who i know from "real life"
But they don't fuckin care, i told my Best friend from Child Hood, but she changed the topic as soon as she could, i know she didn't understand...BUT FOR FUCK'S SAKE, I OPENED UP, FACE TO FACE AND SHE DID NOTHING.
Writing is fuckin easy, BUT I HAD TO FIGHT INSIDE MYSELF TO TELL HER THIS, AND SHE IGNORED THIS.
Of course, if i'll die they'll say that "i gave no signs"
I don't fuckin know what to do, i'm fuckin scared that i'll end this, but in the same time i want to so badly, i suffered for years, and i would FINNALY BE FREE.
I want to die, i want to die, i want to die, i want to die I FUCKIN WSNT TO DIE.
WHY DIDN'T I KILL MYSELF YEAR AGO? FUCKIN WHY, I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS.
Maybe, if i would suicide they would see my problems were real?
I guess the only thing i can do is fuckin wait, if no one helps then i will die, but as i said my mom &amp; stepdad don't care about this, my problems are fake like they always say, and i have no point in life, why do i have to Wake up?
So i fuckin suffer?
I hate my life, i want this shit to end.
I want help, therapy..ANYTHING, just so this shit stops, i don't even know if I'm real, am i even a person?
I want to end this, i don't want to hear these fuckin sirens going off in my head, seeing shadows... I want this to end so bad, if i could cry them i would for hours...
I'm sorry for wasting your time, there are people who deserve help, and i wasted the time on my selfish usless ass.
