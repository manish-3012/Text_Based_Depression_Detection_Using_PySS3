Drowning in responsibilityHi my name is Joe and i feel like i'm drowning I am the youngest of four siblings and i'm the most responsible i use to take pride in that from 18-20 but now at 23 i'm just sick of it i have helped all of my siblings numerous times i don't expect gratitude but a thank you or reimbursement would have been nice. All of my siblings owe me between $1-2 thousand dollars and it seems like i will never see a penny of it back its not the cash itself its the time i spent earning the money that no one seems to respect. now not only am i the safety net for my siblings i'm being asked to take custody of my sisters kids which i agree they need someone who actually cares for them to take care of them but i have not been able to live my own life because i have been busy helping my siblings out of their shitty life decisions financial or otherwise and i just cant anymore i'm so tired i have not had a vacation in 3 years because even if i get time off work i'm working side jobs to make money so that when inevitably someone asks me for money i can or when my sister's kids need shoes or school supplies i can afford them. I just keep coming to the same questions why do i care? Who is the safety net for the safety net? in the 5 years of being an adult there has been one thank you from my siblings it wasn't even sincere my eldest brother had just been fired from his job so i let him move into my apartment he moved his girlfriend in with him lived with me for 3 months he only paid 1 month rent and at the end of the 3 months he thanked everyone in the apartment but me in a Facebook post i was the only one in the apartment with a job making sure the bills were paid my mom replied to the post saying that and he added me to the list which was the point i knew he didn't care.
