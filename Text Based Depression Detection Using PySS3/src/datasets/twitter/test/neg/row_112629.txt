It just never stops.Hello, I've never actually tried using a forum like this for this before but I don't really have anyone I can talk to. I can't remember the last day that I didn't think about suicide at least once. I unintentionally came up with multiple plans that would be the fastest and least painful and that would inconvenience the least amount of people. I don't know where my depression stems from I've been dealing with it for over 10 years and it just keeps getting worse. I keep getting reminded that it just isn't going to get better. I have very few friends and those I have I constantly have to fake my personality around. I'm always tired and just want to be done.
