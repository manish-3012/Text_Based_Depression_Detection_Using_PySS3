My close friend killed herself, my dad might lose everything he has because my grandad is trying to steal it from him and my SO hasn't spoken to me for two days because I stayed home to shower and grocery shop instead of going with her to work in the library.Currently sat in a Dominos waiting for a Â£22 pizza and struggling to see any fairness in life and any reason to go on.
