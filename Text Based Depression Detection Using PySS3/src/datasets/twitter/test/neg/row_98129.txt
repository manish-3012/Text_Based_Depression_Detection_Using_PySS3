Is this life honestly just purgatory? (Not suicidal, yet)I'm curious on ur guys answers. I feel like maybe I fucked up in some other life, or maybe I'm supposed to help lost souls along with my own lost soul.

 I feel like people are intentionally nasty to me but I'm unable to make or defintely uphold relationships cuz of those past traumas. The ratio is 5% me doing bad things (minimal) to 95% bad things happening around or to me (fucked up shit)

Is the next life finally going into the void? Or is it going to void but getting woken up occasionally to get drunk and yell at bartenders?
