Moving beyond dreams.I'm ready to do something soon.
Something that will stop this cycle of negativity.

Everyone lies. They can't help it. Then pretend they don't or forget it affects you days later still.

Oh no nothings happened or worth re addressing or taking note of.

Let it fester.


Wait until they face the consequences.
