My heads a messDepression for going on 6 years, 4 suicide attempts, still don't know how/why I'm still here.
-Black sheep of the family
-Pushed away by friends
-Useless twat with no job, no future, no hope
-Full packet of cocodomol looks great right now
First time speaking out about topping myself before considering it but I'm too scared to, I just need a way out without the shame of suicide cause it just makes being the sad excuse of a person that I am even worse afterwards
