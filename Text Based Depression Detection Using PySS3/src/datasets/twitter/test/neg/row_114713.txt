I lost my career and my girlfriend of 10 years. This fucking sucks.Two months ago, I was forced to resign from my career I had been working toward for the past 4 years. My girlfriend of 10 years, my high school sweetheart, my first girlfriend, my only friend, just broke up with me. I was so in love I let my friendships dwindle away. Now I don't have anyone.

I don't feel suicidal but this fucking hurts. I'm don't know what happens next. I'm scared.
