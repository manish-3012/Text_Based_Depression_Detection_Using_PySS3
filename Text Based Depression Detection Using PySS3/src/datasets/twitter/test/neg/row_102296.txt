GuiltI had a talk today with my therapist and my parents. My mother said she has stopped putting energy in our relationship because I'm so negative and my father thinks getting a job will fix my problems (because then I'll get physically tired). Now I just feel lazy and toxic and like they have given up on me. And the times I talked to them before this they gave me basically the same guilt trips. Everyone tells me committing suicide is easy, but planning my suicide takes so much of my energy and I am so afraid it will fail, but I really hate myself and my life right now.
