Now I can't stop fantasizing about coffee induced suicide.Sooo, basically as an unmedicated bipolar person I crashed my life straight into the ground and lost everything (after two years of trying to build a future in a career I really liked) but I'm no longer in denial, I just really wish I had gotten help earlier (and that past attempts at getting help weren't ignored)

I suppose my biggest problem is I have all these physical, real world barriers that are obstacles that are scary, intimidating, so much so I'm just sort of sitting back and watching my life float on by on a futon that hurts my back and neck terribly. I don't think I have to kill myself, I just really want someone to help talk me through my day to day. I think I can get away from the situation that's causing me grief and into a job that's at least tolerable. i've learned my lesson, see, in the past I thought my problems were external. I just needed to get someone "good" and I'd be happy. No, I had everything and still the darkness lingered, tempting me to work harder to try and get somewhere stable, only to reveal itself as the demon known as Mania. 

I am medicated, though and have an appointment with the mental health team again on the 26th, these mental health dates are like beacons, trying to get to each one so I can hopefully make it another day. 

Each morning I wake up to the reality of my situation and the nightmare before was only slightly better because the demons that I face took physical form and manifestation - my biggest fear is the slow, slow crawl to homelessness and the loss of the few items and my two incredibly loyal pets. 

So often my mind wanders to ending my life because I'm at a loss of how to fix it. I try each day to do something a little bit better for myself but its so hard without a sense of direction. Applying for a job everyday. 

If I can't fix this by the end of summer or make reasonable progress I will probably just end my life. I want to pick a method in which no one else is blamed (as if i jump in front of a car or train) and one in which I think I can do reasonably. 

I don't know why I'm even reaching out. I don't think I can find help anywhere. I'm just trying to prove myself wrong.
