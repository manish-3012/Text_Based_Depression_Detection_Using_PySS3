Not a matter of if, but when.Does anyone else here feel that they may not know when or how they'll end up taking their life, but that it's inevitable? I'm 22 years old with a track record of trauma, pain, and depression. I've had suicidal ideation as long as I can remember. I was born with a congenital cataract and have always been scrawny. I was picked last on every sports team and my narcissistic mother would always put me down and sometimes resort to physical violence for little reason. Growing up I was constantly teased and picked on by my peers for being different. When I was an adolescent my parents divorced but I never liked either of them. I've felt alone my whole life. I turned to drugs at 13 and used almost everything heavily for a while to cope until my trips started turning sour after an overdose at 17. I almost died that day and sometimes wish that I did. The trauma from the overdose and heavy tripping led to a mental breakdown whose effects lasted years. I deal with chronic pain from fibromyalgia and hypermobility syndrome on a daily basis and am almost always in fight or flight mode from pain and anxiety. I often feel that I'm dying from some horrible disease and have had more doctors visits than I can count. Some days it's impossible to power through it all leaving me to question my existence and wish to resort to the seemingly inevitable, suicide. I don't know when I'll do it, or how, but all I know is that more likely than not I'll one day reach a breaking point and end my life. I'm a spiritual person so I don't want to do it through violent means. I have contemplated running away into the wild and staying there until my body decays. Either that or making it quick by shooting myself in the chest or something if I really just can't take it any longer. "Life is suffering", says the Buddha. If that's the case, then why live?
