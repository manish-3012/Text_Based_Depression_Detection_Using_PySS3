I wouldnâ€™t do it. But I can see how someone wouldI wouldnâ€™t do it. I couldnâ€™t. My brother did though. And sometimes these feelings of emptiness I have. Guilt. Remorse. Hopelessness. Feeling like youâ€™ll never get better and youâ€™re stuck. I get it. I get why someone would do it. Sometimes that pain is so great and you just donâ€™t want to feel it anymore. Iâ€™ve personally never had thought like it. Plus I couldnâ€™t do that to my parents. Another kid? 2 out of 3?? No. I canâ€™t. But I do wish there was a magic little pill I could take to make this shit inside of me go away. But thatâ€™s why I go to therapy now. And Iâ€™m trying to meditate. And do all these weird little things to try and heal. And I know the day will come where I feel happy again. And Iâ€™m looking forward to it.
