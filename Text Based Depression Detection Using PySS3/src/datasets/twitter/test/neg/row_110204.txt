im doneI know no one will see this. I just want to put it out there. 

The past few days have been some of the worst for no reason. I have been more and more suicidal and today might be the breaking point. I have contacted the suicide prevention hotline twice. They didn't help at all. The first person basically told me to journal. I barely talked to the second person. I hung up after a minute. 

I want to do it but I feel so fucking lame. I'm scared it will hurt or that my boyfriend will be really upset with me. I don't want him to be hurt  by this at all but I know that's not possible. That's kind of why I haven't done it. 

I lost it tonight. I have been crying so hard that my teeth won't stop chattering. I keep realizing I am pushing everyone away because I am so depressed. No one wants to hear about how much I hate myself but it's all I ever fucking think about. 

I'm so tired of pretending to be fine. I haven't told anyone that I am this suicidal. I have been thinking about taking pills or driving my car off the road. I even looked up how to tie a noose earlier. I don't know which way would be the least painful. I don't know what I am going to say to my friends and family. 

I want to do it so I don't have to keep suffering. I am so tired of being alive. I hate the world and everything in it. I wish I could have enough courage to actually do it. I'm tired of ruining everyone's life. I'm tired of having to be around me.
