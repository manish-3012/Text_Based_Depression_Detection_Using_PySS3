been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately... this is pretty much a messy rant...These past couple of months have been rough I've lost motivation in everything i quit playing soccer, kickboxing, cooking, and many other things that made me genuinely happy, just because i can't drag myself out of my room.. i used to be so social and now i only talk to a few people nothing really makes me happy anymore all my life I've dealt with shit and never seemed to care but it's starting to get to me I'm 16 turning 17 pretty soon my mom is incredibly religious and homophobic and we get into fights a lot since i'm a lesbian and an atheist.. my entire life i've really had no one to talk to besides some close friends, whenever I go to my parents about something they always make it about themselves, i've asked for a therapist for my depression and to see someone for my ADHD as i can't even focus on simple things like school work, my mom refuses to get me medicine or to talk to someone about my feelings and my dad told me to get over it, a couple months ago my mom really nonchalantly asked me if i was gay i told her i was cause it seemed like maybe she wouldn't get mad but she immediately yelled at me and then ran into the bathroom to cry to jesus for three hours and that just made me feel great.. a lot of my issues steam from problems with my mother she constantly yells at me and my siblings though i'm the only one that stands up for my self and everyone else my mom has tried multiple times to physically assault my younger sister even going as far as to slam her against walls and try and choke her though i guess in her defense shes on a ton of medicine and loses her cool a lot every time this happens i protect my sister and usually end up pulling my mom off of her and getting hit instead and ending up with a bruise or two but thats only the physical side of my problems the constant yelling is almost worse since your not able to defend yourself in anyway or it makes it way worse though usually i speak up cause i dont want to take that shit so i get in a ton of trouble, i guess in my moms mind only her feelings matter as she can constantly say awful things about you and you cant say anything in return or she loses her shit thats usually how the fights start, she constantly tells me i dress like i worship the devil or that she wishes i dressed more like a girl even going as far to make fun of me and assume i'm transgender she'll say things like "i sure hope your not gonna turn into a boy on me haha" or making a joke about me being trans or something then when i reply that i'm not she'll pull out the "are you sure lol" ( i support trans people they're amazing its just mind blowing how insensitive my mom can be when she acts like shes a perfect parent). Shes even gone as far as to attack my friends and try and cut me off from them a few nights ago one of them was helping me with some homework it was about religon something i know nothing about and my mom comes in and is all like "WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME FOR HELP" and the proceeded to call my friend mind you a minor, a dick as a grown adult.. imagine having a parent who acts younger than you and has the mind-state of a fucking child also my dad always takes her side even when he knows shes wrong so he doesnt have to deal with her shit. (theres a lot more problems with my mom but no ones gonna read this so it doesnt really matter hopefully i get a therapist soon)   I also recently got into some trouble when my mom found out i was vaping (yes i know i shouldn't be doing it till 18 and no i'm not contemplating suicide over a juul) but it helps me focus since she wont let me get a prescription and it honestly takes away some of the emotional pain i'm feeling, but since this incident my mom has been constantly saying really mean things to me which make me feel even worse about the whole situation... but yeah suicide seems more appealing everyday just kinda needed to vent..
