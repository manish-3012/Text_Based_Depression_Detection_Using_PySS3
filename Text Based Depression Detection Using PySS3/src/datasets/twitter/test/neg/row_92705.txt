Abused as a child - I think it screwed me up..Help?This is going to be long and all over the place, but I just needed a safe space to be able to get this out.

I was raised in a very abusive family environment, and I'm worried that it's damaged me irreparably. My parents were very religious and involved with the catholic church, often they would use religion as a platform for the heinous acts they'd force upon my siblings and I.
I won't go into detail of the abuse itself, but suffice to say that for all of my childhood I was belittled, humiliated, harshly beaten, severely punished at every opportunity and sexually assaulted by several family members. To this day the residual effects of that abuse manifests in PTSD, depression, self harm, fear of abandonment and hyper-sexual tendencies, which I've been coping with since I was about five years old.

The worst part being that because I was raised this way, I didn't understand the gravity of what I was living through until after I'd finally left. The abuse was so constant and we were kept so completely socially isolated that it was normalized and accepted as just a part of every day life.
One night when I was 15, I'd finally had enough and ran off, I've been on my own ever since.

I'm in my early 20's now and it's been a long road to recovery, I know that I'm still healing. But I've been disturbed to realize that aspects of my sexuality have been influenced by my childhood traumas and I can't help feeing betrayed by my own mind and body, and sometimes it just makes me feel sick to acknowledge it.

I'm been coming to terms with the reality that I'm a sexual sadist, meaning I derive sexual pleasure and satisfaction from the pain or humiliation of others. However, I donâ€™t think of it as just enjoying seeing other people suffer- what I enjoy is when people consent for me to hurt them, either emotionally or physically (or often both).

While I have very limited experience in this as it's difficult for me to open up to others about this aspect of my life, for me it comes down to two aspects â€“ control and connection. I very much enjoy being in control of another person, having both the ability to bring them pleasure and pain, and to manipulate their emotions, hopefully fulfilling fantasies of their own along the way, is intoxicating. In terms of connectivity, the trust that people place in me to hurt them is a very gratifying and secure feeling for me.

I'm so grateful that with the help of a therapist, I've become decent at compartmentalizing my sexual urges and my personal morality. Having been experiencing extreme sexual fantasies from a very young age without any understanding of what it meant, it helped when I first started learning about sadism and kink on the internet, though I never thought Iâ€™d consider â€“ for example, degrading women as objects for male pleasure, engaging in gendered emotional sadism, forceful sex acts or to simulate abusive relationships. My fantasies of whipping a woman or forcing her to degrade herself while she cried upset me just as much as aroused me, and for a very long time left me emotionally confused and exhausted.

All of my life I swore that I would not grow up to be like my parents, and for the most part I've been successful. I'm able to control my anger, I find great joy in taking care of others, and I never lash out irrationally. But even so, the sexual trauma still left enough of an imprint on my developing psyche that my sexuality was forever influenced by their selfishness and evil acts.
While Iâ€™ve learned that participating in kink in a contained environment within a safe and consensual dynamic doesnâ€™t challenge my ideals...On the other side of that coin, sadism is also part of the unhealthy and dark side of life, not the healthy and bright side of it. Being sadistic is not being nurturing, but destructive, it breaks the stability of society and isn't appropriate for a family environment. It would destroy me to know that a sadist was hurting my loved one, so how can I possibly put someone else in that same position?

I struggle with these feelings a lot as I'm generally peace-loving and do my best to be kind and considerate of others..and yet I can't shake these primal urges to consensually own, use and abuse another person.
Am I a monster? Am I evil? Is there a place in this world for someone like me? I don't even know.

I should mention that despite my attraction to abusive behaviors on a sexual level, I'm not at all that way in my personal life. I believe that no one is "better" than anyone else and we should all have equal opportunity to succeed in life. There should be fair treatment of all people, regardless of gender, race or creed and I'm an ally for social causes, particularly to areas where there is considered to be inequality and try to help rectify these issues if I can. 

I'm reaching a point in my life where because of my history and it's effect on me, I'm feeling completely alone and overwhelmed. I've lived with this secret shame so long, and for the life of me I don't know what to do with it.
 If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read about my screwed up life. If you have advice, incite or your own story to share that would be very welcome and appreciated.
I hope this finds you all safe, healthy and happy.
