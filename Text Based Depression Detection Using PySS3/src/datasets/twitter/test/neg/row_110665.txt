Please ReadI have had a great life filled with fantastic opportunities.  I have people that love me and would do anything for me.  Still I have had my moments where I felt stuck, like there was no way out.  I've let myself get overwhelmed by the pressures of everyday life and even thought about suicide on a few occasions.  When I finally get a chance to calm myself down I remember all of those people that love me and care for me and I think about the impact my death would have on them.  I realized the pain and regret that they would feel, knowing that I felt there was no other alternative.  The truth is that there is always an alternative.  This week, one of my best friends completed suicide.  He was a confused kid, just like you and me.  He let himself get overwhelmed by his feelings of inadequacy and loneliness.  He wasn't able to see all of the people that loved him.  I wish he could have attended his own funeral to seen the mass of friends and family, whose lives were ripped apart by his decision to leave us.  I wish that I could have showed him how great of an impact his life had on me and how devastating it felt to have to let go of him.  There was not a soul in attendance who, even if they had only spoken to him for five minutes, was not distraught by his passing.  I know that some of you feel like no one would even notice if you left.  I know that some of you think that your friends and family would be better off without you.  I am here to tell you that you are wrong.  If you think that your feelings of depression are a burden to your friends and family, you should know that there is no greater burden than the regret they would feel if they lost you forever. There are so many thing I wish I could have said.  Things that I never thought I needed to say, that I assumed he understood.  You may think that your friends and family dont love you, but you are wrong.  I know that my family has difficulty expressing these feeling in words, but I have seen and felt there love. I know it is there.  It is harder for some people to see it than it is for others.  You create this box for yourself and you cant find a way out of it.  I know what that is like. I know that I am rambling here, but I had to share this with you guys.  I know what you are going through.  I dont know your name or your story, but I have an idea of what you are going through.  I just want you to know that you are not alone.  If you are thinking about suicide, please PM me.  I want to know your name.  I want to know your life and why you think that your only option is to end it.  Most importantly, I want to show you how wrong you are.  I want to show you the impact it would have on your loved ones and the pain it causes.  Please, do not hesitate to contact me.  I will do my best to respond as quickly as I can.  Thanks for reading.
