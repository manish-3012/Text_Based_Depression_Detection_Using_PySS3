existential crisis maybe idkcurrently down in the dumps. again. iâ€™ve been thinking of ending things for a very long time now and it just kinda feels weird that i no longer feel scared when i think of actually doing it. itâ€™s as if iâ€™m sure that iâ€™ll be doing it soon... i donâ€™t want to hurt my family but this is killing me... idk... man this sucks... i love life and iâ€™m excited about the possibilities, my future but when i think about the process, all the trials iâ€™m going thru &amp; iâ€™ll be going thru, my fragile mind and heart canâ€™t take it. well good day just needed to get this off my chest
