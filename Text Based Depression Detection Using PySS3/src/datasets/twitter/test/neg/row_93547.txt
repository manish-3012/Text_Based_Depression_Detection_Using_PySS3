everything is just a blur in my lifeMan i just don't know wtf to do with my life anymore i keep trying to fix things and make things better and i just keeps getting worse and worse the more i try, 

Every time i see someone achieve something they always dreamed of or worked really hard towards i feel really happy followed by an instant wave of self loath cause i am not good enough for anything i have never made my parents happy, I was never able to get good grades am always an average student but now cause of  competition even those average grades are now trash, i was never able to make friends, i don't have the skills to reach my goal/ dreams. 

it's like the more i try the more i hate myself cause it NEVER FUCKING WORKS, Dying always seems the better option.

I am sorry i always use this subreddit to get my feelings out cause there is no where else or no one to tell this to
