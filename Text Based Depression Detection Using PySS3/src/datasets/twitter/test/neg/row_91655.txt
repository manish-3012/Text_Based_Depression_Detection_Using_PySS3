If I want to go, why am I not allowed to?I'm done with living. I'm finished with everything I should hane done. I'm done with school, I moved out, I had a relationship that failed and learned better than to try again.

I just have no reason to be living anymore. I want to put an end to it now. Exit stage left. As soon as I've got the opportunity to do it painlessly.

 Why is it such a big deal? Why is it unacceptable, I can't even talk about it to people without them losing their minds.

All I want is to finish myself. Why not? Why do I have to be alive if I don't want to?
