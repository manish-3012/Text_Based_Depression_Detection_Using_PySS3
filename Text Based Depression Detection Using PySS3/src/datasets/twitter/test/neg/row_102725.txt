Panic attack leading to overdose?I supposed I should start with saying I'm seeing a counselor for depression. Before this weekend, suicide has never been a huge factor of this, I don't think. I've had many suicidal thoughts but I never thought I'd act upon them. I was sure of it.

However, yesterday, something happened. I was having a particularly bad day, the depression was spiking, but I was under control. Until I had a headache. I don't know why, but it was splitting, I couldn't get it to go away. I took some painkillers (the regular dosage) and washed it down with alcohol. I probably should've known that that was a bad idea, but typically it always did the trick to numb the pain and send me to sleep for a while, it was never too harmful. Then I experienced my very first ever panic attack. I had no idea how to respond to this, my behaviour just became so irrational. 

I took in total around 4-5x the normal amount of painkillers and a fair helping of alcohol. The headache was killing me, the panic attack hadn't left, I felt like I was going to die...

Luckily something pulled me out of the haze, I called a friend, we saw a doctor, blood tests were done, I'm fine. Very mild overdose, no poisoning. But it left me with this feeling. I've never heard of someone behaving like that during a panic attack. Was I subconsciously trying to kill myself? Had the suicidal thoughts prevailed? And how the hell do I control these urges... I guess more than anything, I'm looking for someone to talk to who's been in this situation. I need to know that if I have a panic attack again, am I going to respond the same way? Any thoughts would help. Is this even relevant to this sub? God idk.
