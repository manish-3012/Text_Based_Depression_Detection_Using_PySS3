Another shit dayThey were all saying that I was the one that changed Instead

If only I knew what was going on inside their head

I was nowhere close to being different unlike everyone else

Maybe I should just forget about them and move on ahead

Walking away from my life where I saw all of my friends staring at me

They all gave me a look where it was something I couldn't see

They told me to stop suffering in an eternity of no end

All I can even say back is... "Thank you guys, for being my friend"

Please forgive me as I never intended to be your best

I didn't know my life for you was put on test

I even tried with many efforts off my chest

Please forgive me before I put myself to rest

I remember I started my life when I was only eleven

I thought life wouldn't be hard till I learned there wasn't heaven

I remember I was told to make sure that my life can be easily condone

But it's not as easy as you think if you can't even take care of your own

I remember we were only kids when we had no responsibilities

Our life was taken by granted  till our struggles consumed disabilities

I remember we were only in school and making sure we took notes

Judging by our written words, they were mostly despairs and quotes

Why am I here?

Every word you say hurts my ear

You make me want to disappear

I get love and I get hate

Baby girl I think I took your bait

My love for you was priceless

Your love for me was lifeless

I thought you were the one but I was wrong

You are the reason I made this song

You lied

I cried


I don't know anymore

Inside I feel like there's a war

You are the only one I cared for

Your mean words fill me up like a tumor
