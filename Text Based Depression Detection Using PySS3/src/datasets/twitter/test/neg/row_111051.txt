I want to give upI seriously feel like giving up, but itâ€™s like - I do YouTube and I have amazing people who are subscribed (all 446) and I have great friends. 

It feels like my family want to mess up my life though, I canâ€™t decide ANYTHING for myself. I wanted to go college because that would have been better but noooo my controlling af parents made me stay at the sixth form so I can take my 12 year old brother home!  I am 17 - my phone is NOT allowed in my room, Iâ€™m not allowed on ANY FORM of technology on a Tuesday. I feel so trapped. 

Nothing I do is good enough
