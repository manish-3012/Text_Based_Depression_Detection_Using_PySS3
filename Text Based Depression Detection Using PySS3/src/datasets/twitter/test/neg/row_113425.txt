I don't want to die, I just can't live in constant pain when the answer to that pain is all around me (cannabis)People say just move to another state but that's hard having a nerve disorder and high func. autism.

People say everyone has problems and to stop whining about mine.  I have no friends or family.  I'm in this bed 99% of every day and have no contact with anyone other than this laptop (haven't spoken a single word in over 4 years).

Cannabis stops the autism madness and the nerve pain.  It freaking stops 95% of my mental and physical problems.  But it's illegal here.  I would lose disability, health insurance, and get locked in a cage for 2-3 years to grow a single stupid plant.

Over 20 years with over 20 pharmacy prescriptions all failing and many causing new problems and addictions and I still haven't earned the right to have the one medicine that works.

I'm tired of the issue being about people wanting to get high for fun.  Cannabis isn't fun for me, I could care less about being high.  But honestly I don't understand the moral problem with feeling good and being happy...

It's a medical issue.  22 Veterans die every day from PTSD and cannabis stops those nightmares and the flashbacks.

Cannabis stops the flashbacks I get of being abused by this horrible fat man and I have to think about that every day.

Autism keeps me to where I can't make eye contact or even go in public.

My rare nerve disorder kept both arms from working at all for a year and now I can't lift anything over 10lbs or they go numb for days with horrible nerve pain.

I'm not even talking about high quality bud.  I'm talking about freaking trimmings.  Eating trimmings that give no high stops 95% of all this.

It's all around me.  Kids are smoking it for fun all around me but I can't up and find some dealer.  Plus insurance won't cover it so even if it was legal I couldn't afford the 2oz or so I figure I would need to make 30 days of oil.

I just don't understand why there aren't people in the streets protesting this right now.  Veterans and the disabled are suffeirng and no one cares.  People joke about cannabis like it's something funny and not a big deal.  Well for people like me it's a matter of life and death and I don't want to die but I'm being pushed off this edge and no one cares and no one hears ME SCREAMING THIS IS THE ANSWER.  LITTLE KIDS WITH AUTISM NEED CANNABIS OIL, IT STOPS SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND IT'S VERY BAD.

TRIMMINGS THAT PEOPLE THROW AWAY STOP ALL THIS.  OMG I FEEL LIKE I'M IN HELL, IT'S ALL AROUND ME AND THE ONE MEDICATION THAT WORKS IS A JOKE TO PEOPLE WITH A STRANGE STONER JAMAICAN CULTURE WRAPPED AROUND IT.

I JUST WANT THIS PAIN TO STOP WTF IS GOING ON????  I HAVE TO SUFFER KNOWING WHAT STOPS IT AND TO ATTEMPT TO GROW IT IS A FELONY AND I WOULD BE HOMELESS AFTER SERVING TIME IN PRISON.

OMG I don't want to die.  I know it's going to fucking happen too.  It's so sad such a little thing like a handful of leaves is what kills me.  This world is fucked.  Where are the protesters?  It stops seizures.  It's not evil.  Nothing else stops nerve pain like this.  It's almost comical if it wasn't so tragic.  Then I get banned just talking about suicide in other places because no one wants to hear it.  People want to pay just enough taxes to get the retards and homeless out of sight and out of mind, sweeping us under the carpet and not listening to the very few desperate requests we are making.  If we are going to suffer with no purpose in life for God's sake allow us to have cannabis oil that you can't get high off.  CBD oil is just one cannabinoid out of over 120, you need full spectrum or to eat the leaves.

I don't understand why I'm in this situation.  I really don't.  20+ prescriptions and I still can't have leaves off a plant that hasn't ever hurt a human being.  The bastards have been using me for decades as a lab rat for their profit and could care less about public health.
