Almost did itThe first of this month I was in a hospital unable to breathe by myself. I overdosed on benzodiazepines and opiates I also drank a lot of alcohol for good measure. I was caught minutes before death at 3 am. Anyways... I ended up getting committed for the 7th time because I canâ€™t fucking die and Iâ€™m crazy. It was a bad experience as usual. I lied a lot like always to get out early. 

For a few days I felt good about life after coming so close to it ending. Now I just want it to end again. Will I be committed or actually die this time? Idk feels like Iâ€™m trapped here to be tortured. I feel unsafe but I canâ€™t be in the ward again itâ€™s embarrassing
