Iâ€™m backSo I thought this feeling went away. Have nothing to my name and need help so bad. Real help. Not well wishes or a hang in there buddy. I try to dig myself out of the sadness but it pulls me right back down. So many problems mentally, financially (like not $20 to my name), Iâ€™m 38 and my mind has had enough. I donâ€™t want to be homeless and some bum living at center. My life was at its peak a year ago and slowly its slipped out of my hands. Iâ€™m sorry
