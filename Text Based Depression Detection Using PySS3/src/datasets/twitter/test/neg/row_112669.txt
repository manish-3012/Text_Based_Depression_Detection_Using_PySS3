I think I need some help.I'm not quite sure why I am posting here but I guess that I am hoping to find a way out other than suicide.  I just wrote my last letter.  I am now 21 and have been depressed on and off since I was 14, just recently "recovering" from a 14 month period that was probably the worse I have ever been, to find that there is nothing left for me now: my friends have moved on, my girlfriend left me, there is just nothing left. It feels like I put in all that work, went through all that crap for nothing, I have no reason to be here anymore.
