Vent postGod I just want to die.... I need to be awake in 3 hours but I gotta convince myself to sleep instead of lying awake thinking about how I just want to fucking rip myself apart.

I just want the fucking relentless pain to STOP, I'm consumed by pain yet I can't feel... I can't feel true empathy for those around me, I can't cry, but I just feel like a seething mass of wrath geared towards self destruction, just kill me please, yet it's not death I crave, it's simply an escape

I can flip from feeling completely fine or even happy to 100% wanting to die in a matter of seconds.

I don't understand.
