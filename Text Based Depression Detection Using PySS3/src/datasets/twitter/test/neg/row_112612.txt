There are only a few reasons why I haven't killed myself1. Though there aren't many in my life that I care about that will be affected; the ones that will be affected I care dearly for.

2. My pets, I have reptiles that of which my family don't exactly love, so they won't have anyone to take care of them; and my dog, she misses me when I go out for 15 minutes so i can only imagine how depressed she would be if I'm gone for the rest of her life. I don't want her to feel my emotional pain.

3. I'm a huge fan of long drawn-out narratives. I read tons of manga and comic books, and God so fucking help me I don't think I can die before I see the actual conclusion of Kingdom Hearts... And One Piece.. and Transformers... And DC's Dark Metal series...

Point being... Find something you love so dearly that it's worth being miserable for; only then will you not commit suicide and still be depressed. Cause I know how difficult it is to just... be happy comparatively.
