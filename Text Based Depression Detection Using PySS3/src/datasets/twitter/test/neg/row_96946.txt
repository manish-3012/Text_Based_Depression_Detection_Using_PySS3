Feeling like I have no right to be depressedSo many people in this world have it a lot worse than me. Some of them keep on pushing through life despite their hardships.

 I feel 1. Useless because I'm unable to deal with life the same way they can

 and 2. Guilty because I have never encountered any major problems in my life. 

My family is not broken. My parents have their problems but they are never abusive. I have the privilege of receiving higher education. I don't have any major health problems. I have a few friends. I have a couple of part time jobs. My family and I aren't in any financial troubles.

When I see people talk about their battle with depression &amp; how they've become better it doesn't make me feel better. It just makes me feel absolutely useless &amp; want to kill myself more because I think: my life is so much easier than this person's and yet I can't deal with my problems. Sometimes I feel so jealous of &amp; hate the people who manage to deal with their anxiety/depression. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way about people. And then i want to kill myself more.

P.s. this is unrelated but I just want to say I absolutely hate it when I post about my problems and people start telling me successful stories of how themselves have dealt with anxiety/depression, while never addressing how I feel. Like i posted sth like "I can't get myself to care about the things in life and I feel like im slipping away" and then a person conments "I was depressed too, then I did this and that and I'm much better now. You just need to start doing things. Keep loving urself u can do it :)" and I'm like ok. Congratulations on your success. What you've said does not address my what i said in any way. also i now feel like absolute shit because ive tried but i didnt succeed like you. 

But obviously I can't say this to the person because it's rude and i can only say thank you while feeling worse than I originally did.
