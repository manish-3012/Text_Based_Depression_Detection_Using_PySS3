I want to die noblyI've found I'm going to be bald around age 25. I've decided to spend all my money on living now and I'll die then. But I want to die in a way that makes people proud, and every day I wish there was a situation where I could save someone with my life being taken. I've thought about joining the army, but combat is low. Life is scary and I don't know what to do.
