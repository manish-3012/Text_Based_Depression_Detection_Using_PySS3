Canâ€™t pay my debt. Guess I have to die thenI honestly donâ€™t know how I can pay this amount within such a short period of time. It doesnâ€™t help that all my bills are in a language Iâ€™m not fluent in (French)
Iâ€™m not a citizen here so my options for loan, insolvency might be limited. The amount of debt is staggering and I donâ€™t have enough fight in me to deal with this.
Iâ€™d rather use up the money I have left to  buy fentanyl and die (donâ€™t think I can get a gun here). Iâ€™m too scared to jump off our office building. Also, I might survive . 
I wish there was a way to suffocate myself while I sleep. I live alone so no one can find me.
Googling helium suicide bag in a bit.
My SO knows about these thoughts and is trying to help. But heâ€™s depressed and doesnâ€™t have money either.
I used to be full of zeal and happy, but now with debt I just want to die.
I have my kitchen knife in front of me. But I know slitting my wrists is stupid. Iâ€™ll be in pain and worst of all, I will fail.
Iâ€™m all alone in my apartment now and I feel numb. Like Iâ€™m half dead already.
I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting.
