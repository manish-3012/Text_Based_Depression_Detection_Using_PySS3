At what point should I call a suicide hotlineI've been thinking about it, but I've been worried whether I should since I don't know if I'm "Worthy" I haven't attempted suicide yet. And I'm not about to commit suicide. But suicidal thoughts have been showing multiple times per day.  When should I call a suicide hotline?
