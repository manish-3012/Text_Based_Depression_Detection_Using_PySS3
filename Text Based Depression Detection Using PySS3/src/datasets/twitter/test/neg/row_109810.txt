I blew itI missed an important deadline for my senior project in college and I have to repeat it. The problem is i have no money left and i needed the job after to help support my mom's medical bills and my sister. I feel like such a failure and I can't face my family after this I can't handle this anymore. Life feels like a series of awful events with nothing but monotony in between so what's the point? I just wanted to get this off of my chest before trying to do it because I'm too much of a coward to even leave a proper note
