I need help. I'm running out of options.I'm 20. I'm studying college, away from my hometown. 

One would think I have a good life, and honestly, I don't complain. I'm a decent student, my economic situation is stable, as well as my family. I have a girlfriend who is always supporting me and is the cutest person in the world.

The thing is, I don't even know how to describe how I feel. I guess the best description is that my mind doesn't allow me to enjoy my life. I'm always paranoid, insecure. Even though I am pretty good at what I do, I feel I will fail everytime I start something. It took me one week to send a job application because I just didn't feel comfortable with my CV and thought it was useless. 

I constantly fight with my girlfriend because whenever I see that she's happy with another guy or simply not with me, I panic and feel like she's going to walk away because I keep having these mental breakdowns in which I just say I want to suicide.

I've attempted it once, but she says she's scared I'll do it eventually. The things is, even though I feel I need to do it or I want, I can't. Something keeps me from doing it. But my mind won't shut up. I keep thinking that the only way she'll be happy is if I die, because I'll stop trying to keep us together and she'll be free to find someone suitable and worthy of her.

I'm afraid to tell my parents because I don't want to worry them or I don't want them to take me back to my hometown, but things are getting out of hand and I feel I am hurting my girlfriend way too much, since she's the one accompanying me through this. 

I'm looking for psychological help, but money is a big constraint and there's times when I feel good and I dismiss my problems, which makes me forget about looking for help.

I don't know if this post made any sense, but I tried explaining it as good as I could.

Please, help. I don't want to end up being an abusive boyfriend and hurting her because I am so insecure.
