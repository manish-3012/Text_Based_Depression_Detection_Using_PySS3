I actually remembered having a dream for once last night, and it seemed super symbolic. (not really in the most positive way)So, for about the last month or so Iâ€™ve been closer than ever to going through with my suicide again. I was hospitalized back in 2018 for an attempt and since I was released Iâ€™ve basically been slowly thinking up some kind of fool proof method so I donâ€™t end up messing it up this time. I wonâ€™t get into that or share anything further since Iâ€™m here to gain some insight on my dream. Basically it was me climbing up a mountain of unimaginable height, and I was attached to a pulley/zip line thing. It felt like an infinite amount of time before I reached the top of this thing, and when I got close, I became extremely scared. For some reason actually getting to the top was terrifying. I really wanted to do it, because I knew it was worth it. But I just sat right under the very top, and kept telling myself â€˜just do itâ€™, over and over again, frantically. I finally ended up leaping to the top, and the view was incredible. I was terrified to get where I was, but once I made the final decision to say fuck it and go for it, it was amazing and peaceful. I assume Iâ€™m not the only one that sees the underlying metaphor here. Itâ€™s definitely had me thinking a lot today. If you read this far, thank you. I just wanted to share this dream with people that might relate to the meaning I see behind it. Maybe Iâ€™m just reading too much into it, idk. Any input you guys have would be appreciated :-)
