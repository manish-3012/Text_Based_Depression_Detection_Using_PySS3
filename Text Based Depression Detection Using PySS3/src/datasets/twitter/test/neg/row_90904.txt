I feel like Iâ€™m not strong enough for any of this.Iâ€™ve been experiencing symptoms of PTSD after something that happened to me a few months ago, and honestly I feel like this is too much for one person.  Some of the symptoms have reduced, but I still canâ€™t trust anyone.  I canâ€™t walk down a street without thinking of what people could do to me.  A friend invited me to something, and it freaks me out that my first thought was that he wanted to do something to me.  Itâ€™s just nightmares, and flashbacks, and crying in bed, and so much hell... Iâ€™m scared and confused and incredibly depressed.  I want a real healthy relationship, but I donâ€™t trust others to not hurt me or myself to filter people out. 

Iâ€™ve gone to so many lengths to help reduce this (therapy, journaling, etc etc), but Iâ€™m just so tired.  I know that at the end of the day the fact that the world is unsafe is never going to change.  And at this point Iâ€™m struggling to convince myself that Iâ€™ll ever actually heal. Iâ€™m tired of every single day being a journey, a testament to healing, a representation of the idea that Iâ€™m okay.  I just want to hit â€œstop,â€ maybe not now, but I canâ€™t shake the feeling that in a few years, thatâ€™s just how itâ€™s going to go, inevitably.  

This is kind of a rant.  I just... I think at some point, the weightâ€™s too much to deal with, and thatâ€™s when you have to think about whether all of this is actually worth it. 

Idk :(
