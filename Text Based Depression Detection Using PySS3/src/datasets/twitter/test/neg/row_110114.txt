It has to happemI have already decided that i'm going to be the cause of my own death. A handle of Jack and 8 bars of Xan and i'm out. I'm miserable and worthless and this is all I want. I've been in love with a boy for a year and even after he verbally, emotionally, and physically abused me for three months before cutting me off, i'm still attached even though nothing is ever going to happen between us again. He beat me to the point of giving me a severe concussion, bruises all over my body, and complete hearing loss in one ear. I don't think I can live without him.   I'm afraid that if i kill myself though, people will go after him. He's already been completely ostracized from our school (it's very small) because of how he treated me. I'm a very popular guy with a lot of influence and I hate that I've ruined his reputation. Another huge concern is that there's a freshman boy, he's like a little brother to me. He tells me all the time that he idolizes me and looks up to me and I hate that i'm going to disappoint him. I don't want him to be angry with me. I don't know anymore. This is a mess of thoughts in my head, so I apologize for the lack of order.
