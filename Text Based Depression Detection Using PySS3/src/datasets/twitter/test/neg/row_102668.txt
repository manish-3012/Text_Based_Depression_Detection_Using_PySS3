The class system?The people at the top
Live comfortably 
Enjoying all the luxury that life has to offer.
Never worrying about budgeting money
Due to Financial issues being non existent 
Living a dream most people will never know.

The people in the middle
Work their fingers to the bone 
Always playing the lottery 
Yet never winning 
Trapped in an endless cycle of Bill's and mediocrity 

The people at the bottom
Are forgotten by society 
Left to rot on a cold street while the unrelenting rain pours..
Their eyes convey only sadness 
Their stomachs are empty as their pockets and will to live.
People look at them like they are a diseased 
Hope fades away day by day
Until nothing remains except the urge to end this living nightmare they find themselves in..
