I am desperate for anything to help meI used to be hopeful. I am a shell of myself. I feel a hollowness inside of my body and disgustingly strong disconnect between myself and this world. I tried to make myself feel these urges less by spending time being with my mother and grandmother. But I am apathetic to everything. My relationships are slipping away. I have no concept of a future. I don't think I belong on this planet. I've been in therapy for a long while but my depressive episodes just keep getting more severe. I don't want to keep going through this pain. I feel like I am losing myself. I am too anxious, depressive, and fearful to become anything useful to those who have taken care of me. I don't want to hurt them but I'd be lying to myself to act like I am not a burden or dead weight that keeps them from being able to live how they want. I wish my family could have had a better daughter than me. I am so sorry to them. I want to be better, I am willing to try anything so I can pay everyone back for the burdens I have created. I don't know if I can keep doing this though.
