Someone help...please..Someone, anyone help...please I don't know what to do anymore my life is falling apart and I can't take it. It hurts too much. 
  Long story kinda short... Im married to a man I no longer love, inlove with another man (but he has kids and his family and baby mama whom hes no longer with don't like me because he and I are best friends and have been for many many years). 
 My mom has cancer and doesn't have the money to get help, and now she's going to lose the house. As a single parent of 5 there's nothing she can do to stop it as her husband passed away several years ago. It...it hurts watching her be in pain and not being able to help. I..I can't do anything for her and she's suffering. Ontop of all of this I feel that by me being here I'm a hindrance on my mother and if I wasn't here she wouldn't have to pay to feed me or for gas or anything... I'm working on getting a job but that money's going towards a car that I desperately need. 
 I just... I can't deal with the thought of losing my mom. I've lost my dad, my step dad, my aunt, uncle, grandpa's, great grandma, (my) sisters mother and just so many other people... My mom is all I have left and Im not even frucking 21 yet and I'm gona lose her. I..I can't deal with the thought. 
  I've been crying out for help all goddamn night and the ...the ONE person who's been here for me since I was like 12, has nothing but a sorry for me. That's it. I..I'm crushed. I need something. Someone. Help. Please. I'm so desperate. Someone to talk to who won't just give me a Goddamn sorry. Say something. What do I do?!?! I'm so lost and hurt and the only way I see things getting better is if I "leave".. please... I have no where and no one else to turn to. Tell me this is worth it. Tell me my misirble frucked up life is worth living and trying. Just...help..
