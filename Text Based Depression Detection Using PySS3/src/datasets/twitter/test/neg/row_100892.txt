I am ready to go.I am in my last year of college. I have to come up with over $10k worth of money for school to graduate. I have no idea where to get that money. I feel awful for putting my parents in this situation. I'm not the only child they have, and I know they are constantly worried about my schooling all while trying to make sure my sister has a good childhood, complete with all the fun experiences and options I had. I have to get two more jobs, on top of my current one and 18 credits, to maybe afford school. I feel like if I just go, life would be easier for everyone. People around me think I'm a bitch, my parents are stressed by me, I cannot make my significant other happy, I have few friends who I can actually depend on, and even with them, I don't want to bug them constantly with my problems. If I am out of the equation, people would be upset, but would be free of me forever. 

I am ready.
