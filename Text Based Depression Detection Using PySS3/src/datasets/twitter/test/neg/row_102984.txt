I think I am going to kill myself in three yearsThe title says it all.

I just can't see myself past these three years. I'm too weak for this world.  Everything in this world is *bleak*. There's no purpose for me in this world, I mean, what am I?  I'm just a second choice. 

 I can't even express how much I hate myself. 

I'm not a good artist, student, nor daughter. I'm just a waste of space that should go for people who really needed, people who will push our society into a bright future. 

Death is so tempting, for five years I've been obsessed with death. It's such a pleasant thought. Passing into an unknown world forever and not being remembered by anyone.
