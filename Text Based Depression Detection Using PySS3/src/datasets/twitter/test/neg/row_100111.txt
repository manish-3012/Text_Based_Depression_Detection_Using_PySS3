I don't know what to do anymore.I've been wanting to die but I'm just to scared to go through the process for quite a number of years now I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder not too long ago and my parents wouldn't even SHOW ME WAYS TO LESSEN THE SYMPTOMS OR HELP, my psychiatrist told me I have an IQ of 88 with ADHD symptoms, I failed my drivers test 3 TIMES in a row, I have no friends, I get bullied at school, I have macrophilia, and I have nobody to talk to about my problems, my mom says for me to get over it, my dad thinks I'm just begging for attention even though he has barley been around to even know me that well. I just felt completely hopeless and I know its just going to get harder for me later on since I'm graduating this year. On May 14, I'm immediately going to be taking summer classes at a community college which will be even more stressful and hard to deal with and not only that but I'll still be at school and what made things hurt the most, I asked someone I really liked out and they said no, and now I feel even more crushed. I feel like I should have never been born or I'm just a mistake.
