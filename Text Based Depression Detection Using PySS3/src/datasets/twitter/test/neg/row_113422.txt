My Friend who was there for me killed himself.When I was hospitalized (suicidal ideations) he was there for me. He made sure I wasn't alone. He cared. It makes me mad. I'm pretty much over it but I'm still mad. Why does he get to do it? It's bullshit. Fuck him. Not gonna go into too much detail because it might give away who I am. We had plans. We had stuff going for us. Then he had to do this. I wish he would have at least came to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive him. I'm not as worse off as I was but still going to have to live with the fact I have major depressive disorder alone now.
