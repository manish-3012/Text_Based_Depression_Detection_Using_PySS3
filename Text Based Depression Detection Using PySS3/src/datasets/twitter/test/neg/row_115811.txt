Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t even be happy anymoreEverything is fucked this whole online school thing made me not study for the longest time and I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s happening. My family is trying to make me happy and yes I do feel happy for some time but then itâ€™s back to this feeling which makes me feel like Iâ€™m in hell. No matter how good things might be itâ€™s like I wonâ€™t allow myself to be happy. Thereâ€™s no point to being here if I can never be happy. Iâ€™m probably gonna go kms at this point
