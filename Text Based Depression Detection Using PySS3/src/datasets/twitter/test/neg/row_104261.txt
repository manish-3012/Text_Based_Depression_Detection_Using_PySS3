Religious hoping to be ok....Idk how to start this. Iâ€™ve been pretty religious all my life, was mocked all my life for being the good Christian boy. I tried to leave, after a lot of bad stuff happened to me, and it didnâ€™t work out. So I went back to my old religion.

If Iâ€™m being honest, I donâ€™t really want to kill myself. But between my bad choices (THERES A LOT OF THEM), and the stuff I couldnâ€™t control or even prepare for, I saw no other way but to kill myself. 

IDK how many times Iâ€™ve tried now. I got pretty close a couple of months ago, but the rope I used literally snapped in half. I wasnâ€™t even mad or sad or anything. I sat down in shock for a few moments, and hereâ€™s where the religious thing kicks in. I decided that since the rope broke and every other thing I tried failed, I must be here for a reason. So, I tried my best to do better for however long I was left here. 

But like everything in my life, it horribly fell apart. So now Iâ€™m sitting here, tapping on my phone, and being mad at myself for being so stupid. Iâ€™m going to try again tonight, idk what to hope, idk what to think. Just hope to be ok soon.
