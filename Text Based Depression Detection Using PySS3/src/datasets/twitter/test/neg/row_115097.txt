Something isnâ€™t right with me today.I feel like I have had a heavy presence on me all day since I woke up. Constant nausea and weakness in my hands, I had some food earlier and it didnâ€™t help. Had some coffee and it also didnâ€™t help. Tried to take a nap in my car on my lunch and I just had so many dark thoughts that wouldnâ€™t escape me. My brother took his own life in his car while on break in June. Maybe thatâ€™s a part of it. Back at work I now feel like a freak. I canâ€™t focus and everything is dizzy to me and overwhelming. I want to go home as soon as possible but I am afraid of being alone and donâ€™t get out for two more hours. I feel like I am going insane right now.
