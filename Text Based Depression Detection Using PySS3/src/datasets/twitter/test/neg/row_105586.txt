What hurts is that no one cares and I was born to be hatedI have no community or group. Society sees me as a joke and Iâ€™m not taken seriously. Iâ€™m just the freak everyone calls mentally ill or crazy when in reality itâ€™s them for being ignorant. Iâ€™m not a bad person and donâ€™t do anything to anyone yet everyone acts like I effect their lives. Not to mention the fake statistics that keep being spewed.

In a magical world where we have a choice in being born I definitely wouldnâ€™t have wanted to be. Iâ€™ve done nothing wrong but apparently just existing is bad. I wish I was bad or crazy because then the way Iâ€™ve been treated and talked about would be justified.
