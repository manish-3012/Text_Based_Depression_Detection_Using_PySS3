Wishing I don't wake up every morningI wake up every morning and wish I didn't.  Tried going to counceling for childhood trauma that I've kept hidden from my family and all but a couple friends, who I've lost for one reason or another. Counceling only made the issues more obvious and the depression has worsened. It started off with thoughts of just being dead, but has evolved over the past few months to methods I would use. 

Keeping busy, exercise, and eating decent work for only a short time. It's usually the end or beginning of the day when my mood drops and I feel very alone. I've never had a serious relationship, never had a close friend, and people ignore me or don't seek my attention. I feel very neglected and unwanted. 

I don't think I can sustain this much longer.
