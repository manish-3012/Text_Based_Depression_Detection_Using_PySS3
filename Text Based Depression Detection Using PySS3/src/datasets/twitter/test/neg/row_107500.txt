Near the edgeI still live at home, I'm in my early twenties. I'm a man. I have a STEM degree (from 2016). I got a job in June a few cities away. The commute was bad but it was a good job and I was grateful for it. Long story short, I had a breakdown a few weeks ago and was advised/pushed by a doctor (female) and my mother to resign. I wish I hadn't. I have unbearable anxiety each morning knowing I should be in work but I have now been terminated. My mother tells me not to feel guilty as she's great, and I gave her a lot of my salary to pay her back from when I lived here rent-free, but I'm such a burden. Two months. Two fucking months. So weak. 

I worked THIS hard for my degree to get sidelined by some weak fucking "episode"? I wasn't even under that much stress! And yet there I was, sedated at home, playing videogames, signed off work and I did it, I fucking gave in to it and resigned. I need to go back to my job, I'm going nuts. Psychotic episode? Stress-induced psychosis? Man the fuck up!

 

I loathe myself. Before I got this job I worked part-time, on and off, and before that I was a slob for over sixth months, contributing nothing, drinking too much and fruitlessly applying for jobs. I considered ending it back then and hate, HATE that I'm back here again. I was here two years ago as well but got through it. The only thing giving my self-worth has been destroyed through my own weakness and drama. Fool. 

But now I've destroyed my career, and I don't know how I'll revive it. I may be able to go back to my part-time job, but this is a major backwards step. I've let others convince me to fuck my life up by resigning. I'm so weak, men shouldn't be ruled by their feelings.

I'm conservative, I'm pro-life, but I can't take the shame anymore. I can't do it. I've written a long note and will need to go to the library and print it. I'm extremely depressed and I don't know how I'll bring myself to do that, but I need to print it off and make clear that nobody else in my life is at fault, that this is on me.

I need to end it. I'm seriously considering taking the train to a frequently used spot on the coast a few hours away. I keep making these mistakes and can't enter adulthood properly. This is utterly pathetic and worthy of scorn. I fear going to hell but I need to go. I had some good years, but depression, anxiety and constant mistakes are ruining me. This weakness must end. I fear hell but welcome the relief at knowing I wont be a burden anymore.
