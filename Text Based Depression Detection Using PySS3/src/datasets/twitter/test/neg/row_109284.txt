We as individuals are nothing but a temporary, microscopic creatureLook at the big picture. We homosapiens are probably unable to comprehend the number of years this universe has existed. There has probably been many many trillions raised to the trillion'th power of millennia already passed, and an infinite number more to come. We at most live to around 100 years, which is nothing.

This is my personal opinion, but seeing as we are not an endangered species, the only humans that have a chance of having *any* noticable impact on this universe are those who progress the human race with new philosophies, such as Isaac Newton. But for the vast majority of us, we are quite literally meaningless to this infinite vacuum we inhabit, and no matter what we do in our lives, it won't change a thing.

These thoughts are just my justifications for contemplating joining the endless-nothingness bandwagon early.
