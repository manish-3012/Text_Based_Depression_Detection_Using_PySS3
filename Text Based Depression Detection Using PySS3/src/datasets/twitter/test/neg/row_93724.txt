Guilt and FearI want to die, but due to the the pain I have experienced in life i have lost any religious connection I ever had. While sometimes the idea of nothingness comforts me it also chills me to my core. I also have extreme guilt every time I think about dying because I know it will hurt anyone who cares about me. I don't think I would kill myself but every day life is getting harder. I'm starting to think I can't keep going, My mind has abandoned me, everything I do feels mechanical and I don't feel any passions, besides random flashes of quickly fading happiness all I feel is anger despair and overwhelming anxiety and sadness. I'm lost and confused and don't know what to do anymore.
