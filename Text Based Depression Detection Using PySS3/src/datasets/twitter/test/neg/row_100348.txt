Suicide is the only way to end all this once and for allWas in a relationship with a guy two years age and we didn't last long and eventually broke up. We decided stay friends because we understood each other very well and could help each other to through tough times. Even after two years of breaking up, I'm still in love with him. But I never told him that because I didn't want to loose him as a friend. Now, he's in love with someone else. And the thought of it is killing me from the inside every single day. I'm starting to lose my mind. I'm crying myself to sleep every night as well. I wish I could tell him about how I felt, but I'm afraid it'll everything way worse than it already is. All I can do now is either live with this horrible pain or to end it all. I guess the second option sounds better.
