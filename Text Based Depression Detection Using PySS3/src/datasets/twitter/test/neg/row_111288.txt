Do people actually care, or am I nuts?So, I'll be honest, not sure if this goes here, but I figure I should ask anyway.

One of the biggest things I see with like suicide prevention advice is how big of an impact on others it'd have and all that stuff. I've even gotten it myself (for better or for worse). However, there's something that always bugged me...Whenever I see people react to suicide or death in general, most of the time they seem to just...get over it quickly?

Or rather, it seems like the usual response to suicide I see from people is just a "ah, damn, that sucks", then about 5 minutes later they are onto a new subject, or don't even really bother to begin with. I mention this because I've seen this response to death a lot; in an online community I was in, someone committed suicide (I think, it's hard to confirm) and no one reacted to their last message, or even noticed that they were gone until I said anything about it (even then it was the typical "sheesh, that sucks" then forgotten about minutes later). Today, a friend (still don't know if I'm using that word too casually given how short of a time I've known them) mentioned how they just found out their old mentor killed themselves last night, and after about 90 seconds everyone including him had moved back onto joking and laughing and it didn't seem like anyone paid any attention to it at all.

I'm not trying to sound cold or anything. Maybe I'm just insane here and have a bad read on people's emotions, but it always makes me wonder, do people actually care if you kill yourself? People have told me that when I've mentioned my suicidal ideations, but the more I look around the more I wonder if that's actually true or just something people are just saying. I unno, I hope this doesn't come off as callous, I genuinely don't understand.
