The 4th...Iâ€™m upset an donâ€™t know how to calm down and I want to puke not because I donâ€™t feel good but because i want some sort of way to try an make things stop for a second I guess I donâ€™t really know or understand?  I donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t know  whatâ€™s wrong ... I think tomorrow will be hard but I donâ€™t really think thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m upset I donâ€™t know. I know I canâ€™t die tonight but I want to really bad. Tomorrow will be hard. Holidays are always hard... only one other person in my life besides me celebrates an thatâ€™s my mom an for some reason the fourth has been one that Iâ€™ve typically remember spending with her throughout my life I guess maybe because the rest of my family was religious an against holidays an I was taught they were bad growing up but I was so fascinated by the light show and loved the way the the blast made my chest echo it was like I was in a trance and got to share this special moment with just my mom. But ever since she remarried when I was in 5th grade we stopped doing almost everything/anything together like going to parks , hiking , singing in the car and the tradition of discover the best an coolest last minute spot to find a show...ever since then holidays for us and especially the fourth because they were special (not because of the politics or America) for us I think has been really really hard and kinda devastating because  my mom is unhappy with her marriage an only stays pretty much because of the pain Iâ€™ve put her through growing up with my dad demonizing her after the divorce and is afraid to go through that again an because she hasent / doesnâ€™t have a job ever since I was born and canâ€™t support herself or my sister if she was on her own. I feel , hear and see the strain and tension every year and is very hard and it brings a lot of emotional things from when I lived with them  because thatâ€™s when they were at there worst an almost got a divorce and just the guilt and everything Iâ€™ve put my mom through and I honestly donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m struggling right now but itâ€™s something I can put in words that also bothers me and itâ€™s something I can get out I guess... Iâ€™m sorry for the vent an long post .. I donâ€™t think I will do anything serious tonight because I donâ€™t want this to make things even worse for my mom but Iâ€™m barely able to survive at the same time ... I know things would have been a lot better for her an everyone if I had never been alive in the first place
