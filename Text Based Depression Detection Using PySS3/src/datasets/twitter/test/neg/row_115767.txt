Trusting therapistsI genuinely can't understand. I can't search for a therapist even I get so angry with the search. Im too broke and can't afford to meet with a bunch and try to "find the right fit" and google basically says if you can't afford a therapist or to pay the hotline fees then youre sol and can just die anyways. I'm tired and not scared anymore, just done.
