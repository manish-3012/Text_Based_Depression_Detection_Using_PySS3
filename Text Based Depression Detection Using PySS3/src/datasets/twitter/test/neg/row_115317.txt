I see no way outIn the last year my life has gone to hell. I lost all my friends, I dropped out of University, after 5 years of studies, and I started lying to everyone that stayed in my life, mostly family. Thing is, after all this time, I just can't see anything I could do. I tried looking for a job, but got no replies. There is no money to continue my studies.

So the only thing I can see is to end it all when my family leaves for vacation in about a week and a half.

I just screwed up my life, and even though I've been trying to fix it for the last month and change, there is nothing that can be done anymore. It just feels so... Hopeless. I don't even feel sad about it anymore. It's just how it is. I feel like it's the logical and unavoidable conclusion.
