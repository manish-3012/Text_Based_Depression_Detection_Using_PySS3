Just took a shitload of tercianwhat's up guys

thingds didn't get better

i took 17 pills of tercian

hoping it'll be enough

nobody can help me, not even my psychiatrist that told me he felt uneasy around me

also told me that because of my "personnality" and my "relationship troubles" i would never be able to complete my studies (i'm doing my last yeah to because a psychologist) I know it might sound weird, but i'm good at helping people

at least i thought i could do it

&amp;#x200B;

i guess this is goodbye
