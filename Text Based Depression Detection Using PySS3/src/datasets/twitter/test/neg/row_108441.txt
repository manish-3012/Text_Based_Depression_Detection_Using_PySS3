I really need help guysIâ€™m literally on the brink of suicide. The only thing stopping me is my boyfriend. The thing is, heâ€™s hurt me to the point me recalling whatâ€™s happened in the past is encouraging me to end it. Itâ€™s not just that though, the sexual abuse I suffered as a young child at school by another student along with the verbal and physical abuse from my dad played a large factor. I keep a knife in my room as a way to stop cutting. This seems really weird but I made a promise to my boyfriend I would stop cutting. Cutting has always been a coping mechanism of mine but in exchange of him stopping something, I agreed not to cut nor smoke. Itâ€™s been difficult but I love him enough to stop. Fair enough Iâ€™ve broken the promise in response to him breaking his promise but now Iâ€™ve stopped for about 2 months now. I keep a knife in my room so I can teach myself to be strong and fight the urges. If I can be exposed to a knife and not want to cut. Itâ€™s getting harder and harder every day though. I wake up every night from nightmares and have to convince myself not to kill myself. But when I say â€˜convinceâ€™ I mean I have to physically restrain myself from going downstairs and slashing myself up or taking a load of pills, go on a walk and lay on the train tracks anything that will just kill me. My self esteem is so fucking bad. Iâ€™m physically repulsed by the sight of my own body. I sent nudes to different guys because I wanted the attention and compliments, something Iâ€™d never had. When I told my boyfriend, he got angry and said he thought I was an attention seeking whore. That really fucking hurt. Hearing the love of my life say that about me and I know thatâ€™s what he really thinks. He tells me that he said out of anger and he wanted to hurt me(we were having a very heated argument) I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I nap just so I donâ€™t have to be awake, I need help but I can only get it at the start of next month, I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™d last that long. I help others and try to convince them to not commit suicide and honestly that helps. Me helping others makes me feel good, but itâ€™s not enough to make me happy. I honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt true happiness, not even with my boyfriend. However, being with him has brought me closest to true happiness as I ever thought I could feel. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever gonna be happy. Itâ€™s gonna stay shit forever so whatâ€™s the point?
