Scared to talk about dark events in my youth*Extremely sensitive material revolving child molestation below. Throw-away account.

I was molested when I was very young by my older brothers friend. He touched me and made me touch him amongst other sick things. I remember that the deal was that I had to allow my brothers friend to touch me if I wanted to hang-out with them. As a kid, I idolized the both of them and wouldâ€™ve done anything they asked. This was a sick game, but I was so young I didnâ€™t understand what was happening and just went along with it. This lasted for years until we moved away.

My fucked up childhood messed me up badly. When I was 9 or 10, I molested three young boys during different times. As a fucked-up kid having been molested, I assumed this type of shit was normal. Even though deep down I knew it was wrong, it was something that I assumed all kids did. To this day I am haunted by what I did. I canâ€™t move forward with my life and the guilt is eating me whole. I am 28 years old and this is literally killing me. I am extremely depressed and suicidal. I feel disgusting and deserve to feel as awful as I do.

I need to talk to a therapist about this, but Iâ€™m terrified. This is something so personal that Iâ€™ve never shared with anyone. I donâ€™t even know where to begin without falling apart. Iâ€™m also scared that charges will be pressed against me for what I did. I want to begin healing, but I donâ€™t know how!? Sometimes I feel that my only chance at happiness is through suicide. Is there any hope?
