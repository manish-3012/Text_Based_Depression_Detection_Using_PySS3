I dont get enough sleepI am somehow unable to fall asleep causing me to get less than 6 hours of sleep a night for weeks.
Not a problem to most probably but the problem with me is, that I get extremely suicidal and sad when I get even 30 mins less than 8 hours a night.
All I want to do is kill myself but I know that if I were just able to go to sleep everything would be better.
But no matter what I just cannot sleep and my suicidal thoughts keep me up even more.
It's like being stuck in I vicious cycle.
I cant see an end to this anymore.
