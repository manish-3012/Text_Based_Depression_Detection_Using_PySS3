I dont know what to do and I feel tired of this allI've felt suicidal and depressed on and off for a long time and I've cut myself before but I've been having a period lately  where i haven't been happy but nor sad and its been happening for too long, like whenever anything like this happened it always ended soon after and I was back to feeling the same way so i always get anxious whenever im ok for too long. Nothing has happened yet but I've still been starting to go back to the same routine i had where I acted happy but im so fuckin far from that and I dont want to bother my mother or sisters with this or my friends cos theyre dealing with theyr own things but sometimes it really feels hard to continue being the psychologist friend whos always there but Its not like I wanna stop that cos I dont want any of them to do anything stupid just cos they didnt have anyone to talk too but at the same time I still feel like if this continues I might do something dumb, currently im just trying to avoid thinking too much into it by working out and drawing a lot but I know for how long this will work and im scared of what I might do when it stops
