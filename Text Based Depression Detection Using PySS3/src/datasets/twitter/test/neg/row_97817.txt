Why am I still here?Everyday I wake up wondering why I woke up. I feel like Iâ€™m an hour glass and every piece of sand is 1 day, and Iâ€™m filling the bottom of the glass with 1 piece per day and once itâ€™s full Iâ€™ll kill myself. I constantly wonder why I go to work, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m going to snap out of this? I havenâ€™t been genuinely happy in years, and I canâ€™t stop fucking everything in my control up. Iâ€™m like like a cancer, everything and everyone I touch turns into shit. I truthfully wondered how many more days until the bottom of that hourglass is full of sand and my time is up.
