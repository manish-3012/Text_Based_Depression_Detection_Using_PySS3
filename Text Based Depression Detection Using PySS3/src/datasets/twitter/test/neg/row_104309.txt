Been abandoned by person I loved and my mum is blaming my mood on my period.Iâ€™m not saying it wonâ€™t make it worse, but when people say stuff like that it feels like my situation is being completely disregarded. Iâ€™m suicidal all the time anyway and my emotions just come out more at that time of month.
