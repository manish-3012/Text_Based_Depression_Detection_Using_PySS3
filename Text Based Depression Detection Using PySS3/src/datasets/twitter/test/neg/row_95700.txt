Can you help me decideI've attempted suicide twice before by overdosing on pills and wasn't successful unfortunately. We are in the middle of moving and my psychiatrist gave me her phone number because she is "worried about me". I texted her yesterday and no response. Not really surprised with that one.

My question is: should I try with ativan and alcohol? I'm not exactly confident with this since I survived my last 2 overdose attempts. The benefit is I could do this today, the downfall is if I survive it will seriously mess me up. 

Or should I just wait until we purchase a high caliber handgun? (Or even a shot gun) I feel more comfortable with this decision,  because I absolutely know it will work.
 This crippling depression that has its hands around my neck and it's squeezing harder each and every moment is making me desperate.
