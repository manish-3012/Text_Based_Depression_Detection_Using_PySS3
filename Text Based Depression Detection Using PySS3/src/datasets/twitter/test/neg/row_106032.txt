I probably could have done it until I read /r/suicidebereavementI hate that I opened that stupid sub. Now all I can think about is how if I kill myself, then my family isn't going to be sad for awhile, but rather they'll carry that pain for the rest of their life. It's bullshit. Maybe I should just distance myself from them. I can do something to make them hate me. Then it won't sting them for so long cause they'll be used to me being out of the picture.
