I'm angry at being aliveNo one understands this. Not my family, not my friends, and not my girlfriend. No one fucking gets it. Its not about my depression or my anxiety or all the struggles I've had, or all the bad memories I want to get rid of. I just don't care about this fucking existance. Sure I still want to do things, but what does it even matter? Some stuff has meaning to me but I dont think even the meaningful things in my life even matters to me anymore. I just hate this fucking existance and humans. And I will most likely be killing myself in the future If somehow I dont have an abundance of things to keep me going (more specifically drugs). Life's just not worth shit to me and I'm only still here because I'm afraid to die, but I would not mind doing reckless things to further that agenda. I cant fully explain in words the anger and bitterness and resentment I have towards existance. And there is nothing motivational to be said that can sway my way of thinking because everything that I experience is a result of existing which is something that I despise. My life isn't all that bad. It can be nice at times but I find myself every once in awhile punching myself in the face and screaming my head off into the night and thats not even a fraction of the amount of rage I could express. Not a single person I know could ever comprehend the malice and emptiness I feel in a daily basis. I'm not even here, I'm not real. I'm just an illusion, an idea for other people to make a commodity of. I'm a fucking husk who feels nothing.
