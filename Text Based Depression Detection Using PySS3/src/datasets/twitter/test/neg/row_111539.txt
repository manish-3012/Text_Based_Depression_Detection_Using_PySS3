Help?I really dont know how to start tbh, on Reddit for a while now but never posted anything. I'm 28 years old from germany pls excuse my bad english. So i tried to take my life atleast 10 times now wich failed obvs, first try was like 15 years ago by jumping out of my bedroom window at my parents house,of course my parents noticed so they send me to see a therapist,he told me that i'm just confused and too young so after going there a few times i got told to grow up and get over it..so i did,i finished school and started to be an adult. But a few weeks later i tried to kill myself again and it almost worked,my sister found me and told my parents so i got rushed to the hospital and they saved me. After all off that i really did my best and it went well,i thought i had everything i needed and my family is proud of me,wich never happend. The past 2 years been the worse for me i tried to overdose on painkillers,cut myself etc. I have a really good friend..well tbh my bestfriend over in England,she saved my life more then once, more then i ever told her, she is fighting Depression herself for a long time now and i do my best to be there and help where i can. She really means alot to me. My friends here dont understand why i feel like this and why i tried to kill myself,they just tell me to stop beeing a pussy cause my life cant be that bad. So i thought true it's not that bad and yeah i can do it but nope..this month i wanted to die more then ever, i hurt myself almost everyday by punching a wall so bad that my hands bleed and i cant move em for hours sometimes, i started to isolate myself from my family and most of my "friends". Honestly, i'm gonna do it again tonight. I dont want to be a bourden to anyone anymore.
