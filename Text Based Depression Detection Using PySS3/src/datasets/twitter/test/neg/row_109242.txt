I'm getting bad againFor awhile I was on the up, but the last 6 months the thoughts are so overwhelming. I attempted suicide 6 months ago by downing an entire bottle of tylenol while I was drunk. I spent 2 days in the hospital. I can't get rid of the thoughts of suicide. I have horrible nightmares from my years of abuse, and it's gotten to a point I'm only sleeping 2 or 3 hours at a time, which in turn makes my thoughts even worse.

 I just want to down a whole bottle of pills and get it all over with. I don't see the point in living because I'm not happy at all. I hate listening to my therapist tell me it will get better. Even with taking antidepressants, it just doesn't help. I'm even taking the highest dosage possible for my medication, and I'm still just sad. It's pathetic. I just bring everyone down and don't see the point in trying anymore.
