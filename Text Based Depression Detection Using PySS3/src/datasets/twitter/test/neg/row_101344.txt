Don't blameDon't blame my death on law school. Don't blame it on the girl who broke my heart. Don't blame my lack of religious fervor. Don't blame it on the music I listen to, or my parents. I don't. It's no one's fault but my own. I have spent 10 years this way. It's not normal. It dissipates, but it never goes away. I am going to make it go away for good this time. Why must suicide be so stigmatized? 

I have a defective mind. Weak. Soft. Corrupted. 

It's my fault. I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt anyone.
