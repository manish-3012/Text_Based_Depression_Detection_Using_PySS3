WishI wish that i could find a girlfriend. At the least, just for a bit. Every singel wish that I've ever made. Every wish from, 2011 was to create a relationship. 

I'm not a bad looking guy. I've always been happy / friendly and positive / hopeful. 

From being a small child life has just screwed me over. Society and everyone wants me out.

I was at my highest peak. I tried everything. There is no self improvement that will help me. It just needs to happen. 

The longer it takes the more i spiral down. 

I used to have so much hope and patience. I used to tell myself, any day down. For over 9 years. 

I'm just not good enough for girls. I feel the standards are so high. I should be great for almost any of them. They dont think so. Not a single one.

On top of this. They gang up on me. Like I'll walk down the street and they all laugh. 

I wish i could be homosexual.
