with a knife, rope and a letter by my side again and yet i'm being stopped by my consciencei'm really confused by what is happening..
my schizophrenic parents are putting me through shit tons of guilt trips now and saying how it was my idea that got me into this awkward position in the first place.  
 
the last time my parents talked to me is how they wanted me to follow their orders to the letter and disregarding my ideas and even burning the actual plans i drawn out right in front of me, they fully wanted me to follow their idea.. was even called a pussy, not a very big risk taker and even threw a slur of insults... 
and in my very cautious background, i checked their planning, i already know what is going to happened and immediately warn them, was called even more insults and a friend of mine told me that rumors that started from them and then getting to my relatives and spreading to friends are slowly revealing itself. 

with high regards to them, i ignored the damages i'm going to take..so it did happened, then a friend of mine told me that my parents have spread rumors that have been blown out of proportion 

to make the long story short: 
such really damaging rumors and out of proportion gossip made me fell out of favor with everybody..and in my really depressed and upset state, i pushed my friends away...and my parents are eating up my situation and using it towards my little brother and scaring him into following their shit planning...

slowly i'm becoming an alcoholic like my uncle and oftentimes at the end of a knife wanting to end it all.
