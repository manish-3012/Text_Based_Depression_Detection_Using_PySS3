I donâ€™t knowI havenâ€™t slept the whole night, I have to go to a funeral with my mum at 2pm for the guy who ended his life. I didnâ€™t even know him at all but itâ€™s had a huge impact on me. I feel so sad. He was only 20, and everyone thought it was happy. He didnâ€™t open up and tell anyone just like me. Iâ€™m just so broken. I want to kill myself.
