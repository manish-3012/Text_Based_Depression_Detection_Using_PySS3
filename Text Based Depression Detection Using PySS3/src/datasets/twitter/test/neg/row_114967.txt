I have a planI probably wonâ€™t go through with it since Iâ€™m a coward and a bad decision maker but Iâ€™ve finally made a plan to kill myself. It feels good to know that I may do what Iâ€™ve been wanting to do for years now. Better late than never. If I go through with it, I should be gone in a few days time. Sorry for wasting your time with a pointless and selfish post that adds nothing to your day
