VentIt's so fucking painful right now. I don't know why she couldn't love me I would at least love to know fucking why. Is it because of my acne? is it because i'm quiet? I don't feel human anymore I just want to do the hardest thing imaginable to make them regret it. I want to pain them my ugly sad because that side of me is like hell. Earlier I was crying and yelling out of anger. I loved her so much but apparently I wasn't enough. And the fact I know she is after a guy that looks better then me right after she left me. She said she loved me. I have parts of my mind saying i'm a horrible person like i'm some sort of parasite or monster. But apart of me just wants to become so much stronger. God I cant explain what is in my head its killing me every so slowly its suffering.
