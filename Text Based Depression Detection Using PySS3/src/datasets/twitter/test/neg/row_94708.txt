I don't know what is wrong with me...I use to be a very positive person, I would always look at the bright side of things and when there was none, I would look at what I had learned from the experience. I use to have a lot of patience and use to always look at the good qualities of people. When people were rude I use to always put myself in their shoes and do my best at not judging them. My closest friends use to tell me that I was the closest thing to an angel that they knew. However, things started to change a few years ago.

I had always been the perfect child, the one who did EVERYTHING right. This was because ever since I was a child, I was hungry for love. All I wanted was to please EVERYONE, this caused a lot of damage to my soul. And the damage was even greater after I started doing some things to please myself as well, like having a boyfriend, wanting to study a different career than what my family wanted, exploring new religions and not just the one that I was raised in. As I explored my own personality, many people in my family and many of my so called friends turned their backs on me. This broke me so bad, after that I have never been the same.

Now I am back to trying to please everyone, I just want to be perfect and loved and I cry every single day even about the littlest mistakes. I have a boyfriend that loves me and he shows but I feel so insecure. I don't feel like I'm enough, I don't feel worthy and I cry about it everyday. I use to never be jealous, but now I am so insecure that even when he likes more than 1 of a  girls picture I start to question the love that we have.

I don't want to be like this anymore, I want to be happy and I want that other part of me to understand that I am enough. That I have the right to be happy and that people can really love me for who I am, not just if I please them. That is all I want, but it seems like the most impossible thing in the world...
