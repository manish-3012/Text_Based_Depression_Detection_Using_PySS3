Having a bit of a rough timeMy life feels so devoid of worth and meaning. I have burned so many bridges and treated people so horribly while Iâ€™ve basically been floating and completely unaware of it all. I started thinking about my future â€” even just the mundane things like paying bills â€” and it filled me with so much fucking dread. I feel like Iâ€™ve been cruising through my life on autopilot this whole time without any awareness or plan. Iâ€™m majoring in a competitive field that I love but every day I feel more hopeless. 

Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™ve been tired for years. Iâ€™m only twenty but I feel like Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so tired and Iâ€™ve been tired for years. I canâ€™t even get through a day without dissociating because of everything thatâ€™s happened in my life. Iâ€™m medicated for anxiety but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s working anymore and I have a therapist but I still feel alone. This pandemic has especially totaled my mental health and I really donâ€™t see myself getting better. 

The only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself is because I know firsthand how absolutely agonizing and debilitating suicide bereavement is. I have a sister who means more to me than anything in the world and I canâ€™t let her go through that. Sheâ€™s literally the only thing keeping me alive right now. I feel like I shouldâ€™ve died when I was sixteen but here I am feeling worse than I ever have. I donâ€™t think the pain is worth it.
