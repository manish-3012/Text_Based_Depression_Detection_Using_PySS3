I don't know why I am still waiting.I've survived so much shit that I should be happy to still be alive. 
I often loose myself in questions, what should be different, how it could be and how I could change it, but always I'll get to the conclusion that it will be never this way. 
For years I've tried to change something, I've tried to give myself and this world a chance.
I just can't understand anything, how things are the way they or why people act the way they do, it's just too much for me. I wish I could turn off all my thoughts.

I don't know why I've been waiting so long.
I would have everything that's needed.
It would be so easy.
When I am imagining how it will be afterwards, just darkness, just nothing.
It would be so wonderful.

Why should I worry how others may feel about that?
They never tried to help, even though they could've seen the sights. I would be no longer my problems and i wouldn't anyone's problem.
