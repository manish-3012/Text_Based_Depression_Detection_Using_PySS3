aspirin tinnitusso i took a decent amount of aspirin last night (somewhere between 3500 to 4000 mg, didnt count exactly just kinda went in). didnt die i guess and woke up feeling more than fine. got a bit nauseous/dizzy throughout the day, but the worst thing has been the ringing in my ears. hasnt stopped and everything sounds like its underwater. i know this is a pretty standard symptom so can i just wait it out? ive got work tonight so im afraid i wont be able hear much especially with the white noise. idk dont really wanna bring it up to anyone just wondering if im risking long term damage.
