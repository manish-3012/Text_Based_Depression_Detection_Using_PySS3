If you're thinking about posting, talk to me. I'm here to help.Shoot me a PM, I dare ya. Talk to me if you need someone right now.

*Update 1:30 PM PDT*: I'm heading up to San Francisco to volunteer pouring beer at the Giants vs. Athletics baseball game. I still have my phone with me, and I promise I'm still here to talk. Just send me a message.

*Update 4:45 PM PDT*: getting ready to set up and get things rolling. Here's the view from next to our stand: http://i.imgur.com/STf2j.jpg (if that isn't beautiful, I don't know what is)

I won't be able to respond for a little while as it gets pretty damn hectic when people want their draft beer right away. Talk to someone you know if you feel scared. There are always people ready and willing to help.

Thank you so much to everybody who contacted me. I'll keep in touch. You're all important to me now. Thanks again everybody.
