i think that iâ€™ve ruined my one good relationshipas the title says, i sent a hostile message to my partner after getting annoyed and havenâ€™t gotten a response for 10 minutes. i feel like i ruin everything and with school going back i really need their support but now iâ€™m not sure if iâ€™m even worth their time and effort. iâ€™m a waste of space and i just want to stop existing
