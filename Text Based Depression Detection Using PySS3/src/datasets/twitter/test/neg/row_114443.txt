A little over a year ago I had an attempt and was saved by a police officer who took a drive down a random road.  He saved me and after things improved, I sent him a letter.  Thought some of you might find value in it.Note:  I posted on this subreddit a long time ago but think it might do some good again.  As always, a PM is fine if anyone needs some support.

Officer _______,

My name is Id_rather_be_eating.  You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/drugged out of my mind.  I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me.  

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was.  You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am.  There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night.   I had a relationship end with a girl I moved for after only six months, financial problems, living a fairly lonely existence, and a number of other chronic issues.  Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much.  Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years.  I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II.  It has the highest suicide rate among all forms of depression.  

Most of that night comes back in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined.  You are very clear presence throughout that memory though.  You were professional, compassionate, and from what I remember, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours.  To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me.  You weren't supposed to.  I'm glad you did.  Since then, I've gone through quite a few changes.  I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life.  I feel shaken, humbled, and good.  

I have no idea what your life is like.  I don't know if you love or hate your job.  I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you were just as lonely as I was.  I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life.  You were a calming presence for my family when you eventually talked and they wish to say thank you as well.  I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, long time and if that's the case, if you forget me among the hundreds of others you help, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and somewhere, he thinks of you often.  I will never forget you.  

Again, thank you.
