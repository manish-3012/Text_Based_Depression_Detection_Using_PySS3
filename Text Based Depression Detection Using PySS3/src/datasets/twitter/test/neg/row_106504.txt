I've never, ever felt so hopelessI survived all the physical, emotional &amp; sexual abuse growing up. I've survived my history of mental illness. I've managed to get through all of it because I clung to the tiniest flicker of hope that my broken spirit could find. Now, I just... can't find it anymore.
I'm on my own - sort of. My parents are dead, the rest of my abusive family is states away. I'm currently with my partner staying in the house of a friend of their mother's. After this, we'll be moving in with her. She's... invented a new kind of awful, honestly, and i'm so so fucking scared that her jealousy of me will lead to her succeeding in her attempts to get rid of me, but, that's not what I'm worried about the most.

There's so much pressure on me right now to get a job. No, I'm not just so lazy that I'd rather kill myself than get a job. I've been trying. I'm 22, I have no real experience, no reliable references since almost everyone back home knows I'm a bag of crazy. I'm not employable, and to be completely honest, I doubt I'd keep any job they gave me for very long. I have personality disorders, PTSD, schizoaffective disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. There's no doubt I'd fuck something up within a week of even getting a job, which is unlikely in the first place. I just... I don't want to be a burden, but i'm worthless. Sex work seems like my only option, and I'm very very reluctant to take that route, and my partner doesn't want me to either.

Oh, and I might be pregnant. I have no idea how I'd afford an abortion, and I can't go through with childbirth. I can't. I'm weak. 

I was a person with so much compassion and who saw beauty everywhere, but I've started to fall out of love with life. There's no way forward for me. I only make everyone's lives worse. I should relieve everyone of the burden that is knowing me. 

I tried to wake up my partner to talk about this. They didn't respond for quite a while then just repeated "what?" in an extremely apathetic tone until I went away. 

I know where the knives are in this house. I've planned for this. I don't even know why i'm posting this. Maybe one of you has that flicker of hope I seem to have misplaced.
