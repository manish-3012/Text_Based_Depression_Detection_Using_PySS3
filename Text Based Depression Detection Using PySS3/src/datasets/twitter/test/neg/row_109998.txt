Feeling pretty low tonight because of my acne and how I look...I have had acne since I was 10 years old.
Itâ€™s spread to my body for the past 5 years.
I have bumps and scars every where...
I try EVERYTHING. Countless products, prescriptions..

I feel bad about myself most times. 
Tonight is very, very bad.
I keep looking in the mirror wondering how my boyfriend can *chose* to date this?! To have sex with *this*?!?!?!!!!! 
How can my friends/boyfriend/family not throw up in disgust when they look at my raw face? Or when they touch my skin? How are they not embarrassed of me...?

I donâ€™t know why I am feeling it so hard tonight..but I honestly think I would just be better off dead because this is never going away and Iâ€™m so fucking disgusting looking I feel bad for everyone around me. Iâ€™m 21 and I have had enough.
