I'm dying as we speakIt's fukken 1251am where I live, and I've exhausted all of my energy, time, and resources. I've already taken  a splendid mix of pills and vodka. I came here for one last rant and hopefully save somebody else in my position. The love of my life took the kid a week before Christmas. I've had to pay her to see him in the time since. She now hangs out with guys and posts her fuckery on fb. Whatevers. My issue is her childhood rapest gets to spend more time with my boy than me. My father has spoken to her numerous times to get her to see things differently, she refuses. I've spent the last four years supporting this mess. The kid is only 1 1/2 so do the math on who got the majority of the pot. I also funded her addictions. Whatevers. Don't get me wrong folks, I'm not perfect. I've had my own shortcomings and battled my own addictions. On a brighter note, I'm three months clean from a four year long addiction to meth. Which her father got me into. Again, whatever. Actually, that's how I got on meds. I have done a 180 with my life from when she left. I got into treatment. But tonight, after seeing her most recent post, I said fuck it. If I was only a money pit for this girl, lemme give you and my boy what you want. Fortunately for them I have a reasonable insurance policy on my life. Unfortunately for dad, he's gonna wake up to this mess. Damn right I'm being selfish. If anything good has come of my life, it's been my ability to be an exceptional people person. My decision came down to having to pay to see my son, and her taking the money elsewhere. I'm gassed out. I have found a new hate in life and it's myself. For allowing and supporting such bullshit. I gotta go on another journey in the stars. I love you all. Alohas.
