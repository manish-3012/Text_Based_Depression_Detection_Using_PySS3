I'm going to do it within the next few days.All my life I have suffered. All they do is drug me up and send me off. Police found me on a bridge last night, sent me off to a hospital, "This will be the start of a new chapter, it'll get better" " Help is on the way" The doctors like to say. 

No. I'm done with this world and its lies. And you know what? I'm glad.

I had an internal discussion within the past half hour and I'm certain this is what has to happen. Keeping me alive will make me worse off than dead. This pain is chronic. And it will only get worse, as it has done. No more. I want to be at peace. Shame I was dealt a shitty hand. But so some people's lives go.

I'm just posting here because it wouldn't be bad if for once I could find someone who would really, really understand what I was going through. Before I go.

Peace out, I hate this fucking world.
