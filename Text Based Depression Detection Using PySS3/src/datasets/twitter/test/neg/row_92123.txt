Sick docNot sure what to say. My marriage is failing and due to my suicidal tendencies I'm unable to go take care of patients. I've made critical errors both with patients and with my wife. I have 2 beautiful girls who mean the world to me. Right now I am laying in the tub while my mom watches them. My world is crumbling and I can see that. I just can't kill myself because of my girls. I don't know what to do. Thanks for listening.
