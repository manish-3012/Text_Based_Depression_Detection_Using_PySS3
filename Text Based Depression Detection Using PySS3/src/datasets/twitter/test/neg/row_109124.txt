It's interesting how none of this is gonna matter in the first placeWe're all gonna die eventually anyway, right? So does it matter if it's sooner rather than later? I'm 16 and even if I do manage to live till 25, I know suicide will kill me eventually. 

I'm so tired of trying to help my friends and not being able to do enough. They come to me and I try, I swear I fucking try, but its never enough. It happens all the time and then no one ever, ever checks on me. I'm not asking them to, I dont want them to waste their time, but it doesn't hurt any less.

2017 a friend forced me to go to my school counsellor. I was in the hospital and I remember just shutting down. I couldn't talk at all. A crisis counsellor came and tried to talk to me, then said to just write it down. I remember my mum saying to say that I'm not gonna go through with anything so they don't take me to a psychiatric hospital. 

I regret doing what she said. I think maybe, in some other life it would have helped me. I just went to therapy for a bit but then begged to quit. Sometimes I wish I could get back in. Sometimes i wish I could ask them to seriously have me admitted or let me see someone who could let me get medication or SOMETHING. Every single fucking day my head is so fucked up, so dark, and I just deal with it. I don't tell anyone. I'll laugh and be happy sometimes but it just comes back around eventually. Sometimes I'll just think the darkest shit on how I could hurt myself or soemtimes othet people. I would never do the second part, but I know it's not normal. I need help and I can't get it. I'm fucking terrified. And even if I don't commit suicide now or ten years from now, I know I'll do it eventually. It's the only way I'll go.
