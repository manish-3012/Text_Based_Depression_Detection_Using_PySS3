Probably going to kill myself next year.Life just hasn't been the best for me, being a 14 y/o trans girl with depression living in latin america is kinda hard. I won't go into details about the things I've been through because I don't think it's too important. A few months ago I realized that I didn't feel like a boy and came out to some of my friends as a trans girl. Everything went well so I decided to tell some more people about it, since then, almost no one I know uses my pronouns. Now I have to deal with dysphoria and being constantly misgendered. 

I also have no future whatsoever, I have no talent or skill, I can't even talk to people in real life, it makes me feel anxious and I always end up being awkward.

I just don't enjoy life, every time it seems like it will get better and it ends up being the same or worse. I constantly feel tired for no reason at all, damn, even sitting on my chair and typing this makes me feel tired. I love my friends but honestly I don't care about how they would feel if I kill myself.

Killing myself this month would be a shitty thing to do, it would ruin my family's christmas and new year, so doing it next year is better. I guess I'll just keep myself alive until then, wasting my time playing videogames and wishing I was born a girl.

Hanging seems like the best option, if I do it right it shouldn't be too painful, and if I do it wrong, it would be pretty painful which isn't bad either, feeling pain would be a nice feeling before death.
