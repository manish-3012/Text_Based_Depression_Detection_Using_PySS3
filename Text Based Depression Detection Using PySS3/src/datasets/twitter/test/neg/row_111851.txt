It's all too much and everything's so overwhelmingFirst off sorry for bothering everyone with this but everything's just gotten so hard. Its all so overwhelming and everything's happening so quickly. I'm starting sixth form next year and my schools expecting me to have everything figured out and i fucking can't. I'm a trans guy and I'm finally going to a mixed school, but I don't even know which bathroom to use, because I look too masculine to use the womans (and my anxiety cannot take all the looks) but I am not out and so can't use the mens, and I don't know what to do and I have so many things related to this that I'm unsure of and its just so hard. I'm just so lost and everything's so stressful and I'm probably never going to get it all figured out, and I'm in therapy with meds and none of that is helping and I relapsed last week and it feels like I'm never going to get better.
