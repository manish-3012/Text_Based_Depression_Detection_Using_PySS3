i truly believe no one cares for me anymore.it hurts. in all honesty everything hurts. im mentally exhausted and i feel like im at the lowest point in my entire life, as if i hit rock bottom finally without exaggeration. my heart hurts so fucking bad i constantly have headaches and its hard to breathe all the time. i feel dizzy and weak and everything is so painfully especially mentally. everyones tired of me; exhausted. i feel like everyone is the same. they tell me they care, they help me out a bit, they realize im someone hopeless. a piece of shit. they grow tired of me and i cant help but feel like everyones so fake. but in reality all i do is blame my problems on everyone else. all i do is blame everyone for my fucking issues and i dont understand how people could give me the fakest comments to exist. â€œyou deserve to live.â€ â€œyou matter.â€ i honest to god believe im a fucking piece of shit and i deserve this pain. im selfish and arrognant and honestly too sensitive. i want to die. i really do, at least i dont want this life anymore. i want to restart. the thought of me dying has never escaped from my mind, it comes up i swear every second of my life. no one would care. no one would truly care. theyd all pretend how they were my friend and that they cared and move on, and forget about me. god i feel like such a bother and i know im going to regret this post later. just ignore this imsuchafuckignbotjertoeveeryitngokhmygod im sorry just dont worry because im too much of a pussy to ever kill myself and i somehow always end up in the hospital. im sorry.
