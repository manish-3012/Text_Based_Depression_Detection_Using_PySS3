Thinking about doing it again...I've had a suicide attempt almost a month ago, but my best friend called 911 on me, and the cops/paramedics came just before too much harm was done. I got put into the hospital, for a bit. I just feel like doing it again, but without the cops/paramedics. Just me, a knife, and a roof, tonight.
