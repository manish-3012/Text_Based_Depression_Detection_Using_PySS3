I'm doneWell, I can't believe I reached this state. I'm getting tired. All I seem to do is hurt the people that care about me the most. I'm afraid that they might leave me so I end up controlling them. Why do I do that? Why do I hurt them? Why did I hurt her? The only person that showed me love, I hurt her so much. I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore, I'm tired
