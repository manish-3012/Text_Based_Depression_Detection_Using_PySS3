Honestly done with life.No one cares about me. The last thing my parents think about is me, sometimes i donâ€™t have food to eat and sometimes they abuse me. My girlfriend just acts like iâ€™m not important and iâ€™m also the last thing she cares about and she doesnâ€™t respond to my texts. Iâ€™ve got no friends get bullied at school. And my friends who care about me end up killing them selves. everyone says to hang on but it just gets worse. in these last 4 years iâ€™ve been though multiple counselors, antidepressants, suicide attempts, and mental hospitals and every time i get though something i feel worse. iâ€™m out of gas and iâ€™m honestly ready to go and at this point have accepted that iâ€™ll die to my own hand
