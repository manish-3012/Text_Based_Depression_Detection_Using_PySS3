Iâ€™d Leave Me, Too.Iâ€™ve been ... hard to deal with lately. Iâ€™ve been manic; angry manic. Breaking things, throwing things, screaming, sobbing. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized so many times this year, and Iâ€™ve slowly pushed everyone I love away from me. 

But after thinking about it, maybe thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so suicidal. Iâ€™m tired of me, too. I want to leave me, too. Iâ€™m tired of my shit. Iâ€™m sick of me. And now Iâ€™m sitting here, typing this in the darkâ€”as I have no one to talk to and, well, nothing left to say anywayâ€”I realize it. 

I just keep praying tonight is the night I close my eyes and donâ€™t wake up. Sure, maybe itâ€™ll get better, but ... why bother when you canâ€™t even stand to look at yourself in the mirror anymore? Whatâ€™s the point of anything? 

I dunno. Sorry for the weird, pointless rant of the usual â€œwow I hate myselfâ€ shit but today was really hard. Iâ€™m gonna go drink a bunch of NyQuil and get some sleep so Iâ€™m refreshed for another day of ideation and disappointment.
