Checking myself into rehab tomorrow22M. After two suicide attempts, five hospital stays, a crumbling family and a wall of debt, I'm finally deciding to take charge of myself and figure out what's going to keep me living. It was either this or crippling isolation fueled by marijuana usage that was just getting me nowhere. I'm scared. But hopeful. Hopeful that 30+ days will do more to me than 3 days in the psych ward.

Wish me luck. Cheers. First time reaching out for actual help in the last couple of months.
