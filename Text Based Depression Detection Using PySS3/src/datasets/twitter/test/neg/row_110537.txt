Completely hopeless and life just never gets better.Money is so extremely tight. I have about $25 left and that's after I overdrafted because of student loans and my stepdad took pity on me. I have an amazing boyfriend and he worries constantly about money because of me. I am a burden to everybody I know and love. I desperately just wish I had even $100 a month. Im applying for disability due to extreme disability but it takes so fucking long. I need help so bad but there is none in sight. Suicide seems more attractive every single fucking day. What the fuck do I do. My car broke down, then I got scammed by a tow place, so I can't even drive. Can't get a job anyway due to the depression. Even if I could, that could fuck up my disability application. I am so fucking hopeless.
