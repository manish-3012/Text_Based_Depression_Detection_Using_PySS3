Can't afford anything but to kill myselfI'm now completely alone. I keep asking for help and none come. I can't even afford to get to work anymore. My parents refuse to help and I have no friends to ask for help either. My bills are so high that I'm not even breaking even when I get paid. I can't qualify for any financial aid because they say I get paid too much. I'm trapped with no way out. Except one. I've been trying to find shit to overdose on and finally decided to OD on what prescription pills I have left. I tried every other pill that I have but obviously those didn't work. Hopefully this will.
