I'm just tired.I'm tired of my life. Have been the last 4 years. There used to be a time when i was happy. Now that time is just a distant memory. I suffer from anxiety and OCD. God damn every day is just a battle. What brings me down the most is that the past year i was actually getting better. Started making friends again and started working out. Even fell in love. But she tore me apart. Life hit me with so much in the past period so here i am, rock bottom again. I can't do it anymore. I'm just tired.
