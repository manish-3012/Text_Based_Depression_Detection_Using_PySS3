Everyday is a private hell for meEvery day I wake up and I want to put a bullet in my head. I've been depressed for 20 years, 4/5 of my life. 

It's getting worse and worse. I can't focus on anything anymore. I have this terrible physical pain in my head that feels like an immense pressure pushing out from the inside of my skull. Most days I can barely manage to go out of my bed. I feel like everything is crashing down around me. I'm failing two of my classes this semester, mostly because I either spent all my time at work or laying in bed and doing nothing. I lost my job because I wasn't cheerful enough to be a janitor. I don't get invited anywhere anymore, because most people got scared off after I tried to kill myself a few months ago. My family tells me I should just get over it, that I'm an adult and I need to be in control of my life. 

I feel like there is no point in anything. I've been trying so hard to make my life better. I did all the things people said I should do. I'm 25 and I'm not even done college. I'm unemployed. I don't have any real friends where I live. I try to go out, but I can't afford it anymore. 

Most days I just cry. Not even for a good reason. I just start crying. My head hurts so much half the time, that I wish someone would bash my skull in. I see everyone else going and living their lives, and having fun, and making these awesome friendships, and I just feel like it doesn't happen for me. I always fuck it up, or something happens that fucks it up for me.
