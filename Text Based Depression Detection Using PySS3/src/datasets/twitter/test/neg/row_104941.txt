I can't win guys. I can't. Im finished. I need helpI'll keep this short and sweet.  My wife left me for no reason 2 years ago (i'll get into this more in a sec).  I was completely destroyed.  

Things got better.  Started talking to this other girl.  Last night we broke it off because it just wasn't working.  She was upset and got quite angry but whatever.  Seeing how well that went I decided to add her to my blocked list on facebook.  Low and behold my ex-wife (who I had added to my blocked list already) has a new last name. 

I didnt need to see that :'(.  That just ruined me.  I want to die.  I know it shouldn't bother me but its killing me.  I didn't need that.  I can't do this anymore :(.  I cant live like this!  

Please help.  I feel like throwing up, i feel like just wanting to die :(.
