i wish i were better with relationshipsIt's been a year since I've seen my friends. They said they would keep in contact with me, but that was kind of a lie. All but one person has forgotten about me by now, which is understandable. I dont want to make new friends, I dont want to meet new people at all. The last time I tried to talk to someone new I had a panic attack, she probably thought I was a fucking freak. I think I'm better off being a background character. 

I feel like shit constantly, I made everyone I love leave and the ones that didnt only care about me out of pity. I dont even want their help at this point, I just want to be encouraged to do it. I'm already such a leech to them and all I do is whine and demand peoples undivided attention and make people uncomfortable and overshare about my dumbass trauma. I want my best friend to look me in the eyes and tell me to swallow glass.

It's probably kind of weird for me to say I'm so lonely and sad about it when I still have a friend who kinda cares about me left. I have a family, but I've been neglecting my relationships with my siblings and I shouldnt talk to my parents.

I feel like I want to die recently more than usual. It feels like all day I'm obsessing over thoughts about images of my own dead body, or overdosing or jumping in front of a truck on my way to get groceries, which sucks. I'd never really taken steps toward killing myself until recently, I'd just think about it. I'm really really considering it though.

I'm rambling, I'm sorry I'm rambling, I'm a little sleep deprived. I don't know if I'm very coherent, my problems probably arent even as bad as I'm describing them
