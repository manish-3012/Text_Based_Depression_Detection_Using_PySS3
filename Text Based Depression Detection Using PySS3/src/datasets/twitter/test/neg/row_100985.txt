I don't know what to do anymoreSorry
i just wanted to talk i guess
i dont know anymore if i want to keep living or die. i guess the best way to describe it is a star wars quote. im being torn apart, and i want to be free of the pain. I know what i have to do but i dont know if i have the strength to do it.
i tried everything i can think of. I live with my father but were poision for each other. i do everything like shopping, the bills, the budget etc but i cant contribute anything real, i had to drop out of school because i just couldnt keep it together anymore. i have a disability hearing coming up that everyone says i should win but its been years since i applied and i just want it to be over. even if i do win, nothing will change. i wouldnt even get enough to pay what we pay now for rent. i just feel defeatedm and im tired.

ive tried to kill myself lots of times nad i always failed. some of my family think i just do it for attention. I got a 100 grams of caffeine and i want to mixx it with some water and drink it but im a coward and i dont know if i can do it i dont want to die but its over and i lost. i just want to sleep
