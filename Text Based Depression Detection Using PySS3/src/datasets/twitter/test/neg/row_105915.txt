What is the point in my life?17M

What is the point in me personally continuing to live. I just realized that video games are the most impossible thing to me, and itâ€™s pretty depressing. I care about nothing. I canâ€™t even cry anymore, I havenâ€™t cried in like 10 years. I have nothing left to care about.

I donâ€™t care about my family. Not rlly sure I have a family. I immigrated to America as a young child. My family is halfway around the globe. My only sibling died when I was in elementary school. My father left me soon afterwards. My mother and I have no relationship at all. 

I donâ€™t care about god. I wasnâ€™t born this way, but Iâ€™m an atheist. Pls donâ€™t try to convince me. itâ€™s not gonna happen.

I donâ€™t care about school and my career. Iâ€™ve always been an excellent student. I was accepted to my Ivy League dream school this December. Why am I attending? So I can become an investment banker or consultant and pretend to help bad, rich people make more money. (Kinda salty BC I come from a poor background).

I donâ€™t care about girls. Iâ€™m kinda messed up in this way, but I went for attractiveness so far. Sure I had sex with a few hot chicks but as cheesy as it sounds,  I want an intellectual. None come close. Even the smart ones at my school donâ€™t.

Give me more things to care for. Iâ€™ll tell you why I donâ€™t care about them at all.
