Just don't feel like it anymoreThereâ€™s just no point in even trying anymore. My handful of friends lead happy lives â€“ they have no problem talking with girls and are all relatively successful. I have a crippling fear of rejection so I donâ€™t even bother. This stems from the fact that Iâ€™m literally the ugliest person I know. Every single one of my friends is better looking and more confident. I am simply a defect. The only girl Iâ€™ve ever loved no longer loves me and it's completely my fault. I want to cry every time I look in the mirror because I look so disgusting. Some people are just meant to be nothing I guess. And that person is me. I will never overcome these frustrations either as I will never be comfortable with how I look. Rather than be lonely and self conscious for the rest of my life Iâ€™m going to just kill myself and spare myself the misery I experience every fucking day. I wish there was some other way but there isnâ€™t for someone as defective as me.  I know it sounds like I'm over exaggerating but that's truly how I've been feeling for months now with no end in sight.
