Painless ways to end it?I have nothing to look forward to, Iâ€™ve always had terrible grades, no skills, and have been horrible at talking to people. Iâ€™m not built for this word and that has become obvious to me. Iâ€™m in my final year of high school and know I will either wind up homeless or at best, in poverty. I canâ€™t make it in the real world so Iâ€™m wondering how I should end it in the least painful way possible.
