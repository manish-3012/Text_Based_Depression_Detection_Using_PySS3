19 year old kid looking for adviceI donâ€™t know how to explain it but

I feel as if Iâ€™m free, as if I had let go of a lot of weight ever since I started being honest with myself. I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. For about 2 years now I havenâ€™t had anything bring me excitement or happiness. The only reason why I get up in the morning is so that my life doesnâ€™t get worse than it already is. Iâ€™ve been feeding myself the usual bullshit like â€œPeople care about youâ€ â€œItâ€™ll get better!â€ â€œItâ€™s all about having a positive mindset!â€. Today I was heavily thinking about a plan to go through. 

It also doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m in the military and havenâ€™t been home in almost a year, I had to work on Veterans Day and I wonâ€™t get a day off for another month. My vacation for the holidays was denied due to COVID 

I donâ€™t know what to do
