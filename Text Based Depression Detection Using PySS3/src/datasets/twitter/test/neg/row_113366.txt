Not immediately suicidal, but in dire need of support.I'm in no immediate danger, so please don't prioritize this post as there are likely others in far worse jeopardy.

If anyone has the spare time though, I'm under incredible stress and facing harsh agony. I spent five weeks in a maximum security prison and then two months in a psychiatric treatment center for sending a threatening text message to an ex-girlfriend whom I've been obsessed with since high school (I'm 26). Two weeks into my incarceration she cried rape and I was faced with the possibility of life in prison. My name and face were printed in the local newspaper; the whole nine yards. I'm suffered with anxiety and depression my whole life.

In terms of my upcoming trial, things are looking good. I passed my court-mandated psychiatric treatment with flying colors and am proud of my growth as a human being, but as you can probably imagine, I'm still terrified out of my mind. My family is paranoid of my every move and action. Every time I hop on Facebook or Skype I get further scolded that I'm going to hurt my case by speaking of it, despite the fact that I am innocent of all charges (sans the threatening text).

I've damaged or outright destroyed most of the most meaningful friendships in my life due to my mental health issues and at times feel that I am facing this battle alone.

One of my problems is that I grieve forever. My ex-girlfriend, my former best friend -- it just goes on and on forever and anguishes me to no end.

I think of suicide frequently, probably daily, but to tell a psychologist/psychiatrist could wind up hurting me in court since in my state being a threat to yourself can cement jail time.

I guess I'm just asking anonymously for some help. How can I retain hope? How can I let go of the past and heal these wounds?
