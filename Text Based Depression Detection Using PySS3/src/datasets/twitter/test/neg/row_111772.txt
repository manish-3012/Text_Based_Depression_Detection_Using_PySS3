if any one needs to talk pm me. A girl in my town hung herself today and its struck close to home. I want to make a differenceDon't just through everything away, people out there love you, if not there are people that will, I'll be one. Pm me if you need an ear, I wanna help you or someone you know because well you only have one life so even if thongs are bad they will get better. My dad used to say "life has a way of working these things out" it may be bad but things will be better I promise you that.
