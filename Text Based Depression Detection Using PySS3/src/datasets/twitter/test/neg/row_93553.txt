I am so tired...I always have a hard time in the summer... For the last 16 years, summer has been hell. I get depressed and suicidal every year. I am so tired of this... I saw my therapist yesterday and ended up crying for half the session, with her just sitting there silent... That just made it worse. I told her I was suicidal but not at immediate risk. The thoughts got worse after leaving, a lot worse. My mom has been horrible all day, and now I have to go to work. All I can think about is the knives (yes plural) in my bag... And I work at a warehouse, basically, so I have a safety knife that I carry for work purposes... I have always been pretty good at just keeping moving... But I don't know how much longer I can go... I have attempted 4 (or 5, can't remember some stuff) times before, and I just wonder what's stopping me now...
