I feel hopeless and I'm scared of myselfSo to be vague, I have a chronic illness. No insurance. No job. No money. 

I don't want to live anymore, not if this is how I have to feel constantly. I've tried everything. Natural remedies aren't helping and I'm getting worse. 

I don't have money for anything, can't get a job because I'm too sick. 

I'm just done living in constant pain and depression. 

I want to kill my self and that makes me hate myself more because I have an amazing boyfriend and I know my family loves me. 

I'm just stuck and can't stop any of this shit from happening.
