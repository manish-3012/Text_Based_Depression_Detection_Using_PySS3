I cant anymore.I am Suicidal and suffer from depression. When I was in grade two, there was a girl who bulled me. She made me feel insecure unsafe and made me hate myself. sometimes I have nightmares that haunt me about this. My parents know about this but they don't believe that it's true. It's hard for me to do anything. I struggle to do work and some days I feel like harming my self. I feel like a burden and a pain to everyone I know. I apologize like a freak because I'm scared of being alone. I always feel like I am hurting people, or causing problems for them. I have anxiety and I freak out really easily. Every day I worry my self to death and I always have my knee shaking. My parents always complain about that. I go to therapy but for some reason, it's not helping. I feel like I'm lying to the world and my self and I can't do anything about it. They keep telling me to stop doing that but it's so hard. I feel like a failure and I was hoping that by coming our I could find another friend to talk to.
