Developing schizophreniaI am losing reality every day that goes by. I hear voices daily. They're not next to me. They're not whispering in my ear. They are always outside of my room door, in the kitchen, in the vents. I've seen a screaming face come out of my poster in my room. I have seen an arm reach toward me coming from out of my curtain. I have extreme paranoia. I can not trust anymore. I do not trust my girlfriend even though she says she promises to not do things that will hurt me. All of her friends hate me. Apparently my paranoia makes me a horrible person. My paranoia is completely justified to me. I am absolutely right. The entire world says I'm wrong.

The only thing I am able to do that makes me feel better is remembering the thought of judgment day coming. Anyone who has hurt me and brought evil to the world without an inquiry of forgiveness or guilt will be dealt with and all of the pain and suffering will be brought to an equilibrium by justice. May God accept my never ending plea for forgiveness and may He protect me from all evil including whatever my NEVER STOPPING THOUGHTS ARE.

I will not suicide, it's a sin. but wow how beautiful the thought is to leave this worldly life. There's too much suffering for me to handle.
