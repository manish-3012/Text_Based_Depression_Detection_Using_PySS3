I want to die and hate myself for itThis school year has been so stupid, one class I wanted is a disappointment and one class I didn't even want has the best teacher I have this year. I don't want to take the advanced classes I am now, but we weren't allowed to change anything. I don't want to take a year of pain and sadness. I'm our dog's least favorite person. I have friends, but I'm the most distant in all of the groups. I have a significant other but I don't even make them happy, always just angry or sad. But I'm pretty spoiled and wanting to die feels selfish and I hate myself even more for it. Like what kind of person wants to die because of one year being bad? I'm so tired. I just want to stop waking up.
