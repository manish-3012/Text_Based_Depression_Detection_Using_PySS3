The thought that my life is not improving and will not improve makes me want to kill myselfMy high school life was a life I wouldnâ€™t wish upon anyone. Loneliness, stopping infinite ~~fights~~ battles between parents and struggling to score my desired grades 

Iâ€™m an international (southeast Asia) and I know that my life wonâ€™t improve unless I go to a good college and start a new life. My family is already in a lot of debt 

Iâ€™ve been a good student throughout my school life. My house has been anarchy over the past 6 weeks. I couldnâ€™t study at all. My A Level exams are 4 days away and I cry every time I solve a past paper because I know Iâ€™ll do bad, despite understanding all the tough concepts 

The fact that I have to stay in this chaos for 5 more years is crippling. My A Level grades couldâ€™ve been the only stand out point for any foreign schools to accept me
