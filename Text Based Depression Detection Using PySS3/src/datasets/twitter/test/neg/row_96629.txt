SelfishI think the phrase â€œsuicide doesnâ€™t affect just youâ€ is such a selfish phrase. Do they think I donâ€™t know that? That I really wish to feel this way? Do they think I enjoy suffering and wondering why I just donâ€™t want to be? Iâ€™m not an idiot I see through it all itâ€™s just a trick to make you suffer along with everyone else. I donâ€™t know if I want to suffer any longer.
