I donâ€™t know what to doMy life by pretty much every standard is pretty great. I have a loving family, never had any financial problems, and super supportive friends. I mean I still have problems but I mean who doesnâ€™t?

I am pretty sure I was sexually abused as small child and definitely in high school. I was bullied a lot through middle. My best friend has terminal cancer and I have a whole slew of mental illnesses. I have anxiety, severe depression, OCD, and am probably on the autism spectrum but my therapist and I agreed it wasnâ€™t worth getting a true diagnoses for it. 

I have spent a long time working through my traumas with a lot of success. Therapy has been great for that. One thing it hasnâ€™t helped with is my actual mental illnesses. Bad stuff has happened to me and I have accepted it but my brain is so messed but I feel essentially tortured and handicapped. Iâ€™ve tried pretty much every medication under the sun, soooooo much therapy, with no success.

My question is why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself? Im wasting so much money on things that are not helping and I am running out of options. I have been fighting this so long and I feel like I keep on getting worse. I donâ€™t think there is really anything else I can do to improve my quality of life to make it worth living.
