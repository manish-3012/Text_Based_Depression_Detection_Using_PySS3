A Redditor saved my life tonight. "Never get into the shower when youre that high."I was a marijuana addict for nearly three years. Most people have no idea because I do pretty well for myself. However I suffer from crippling depression

I got into the shower *that* high tonight. I smoked a lot... No days off, three to five times a day. Most people have no idea because I do pretty well for myself. However I suffer from crippling depression that was getting worse every day. I was to the point where I knew I would never kill myself, however if I had seen where an *accident* could have happened, I would have gratefully excepted it. 

I gave up weed a week ago, but tonight I broke. I hit "fuck it." After only a week off, my tolerance had gone WAY down. I was in a bad state. Decided to take a shower and go to bed. In the shower I saw it. I realized I was going to slip and fall. I was way too high, and my balance was shit. I knew that it was my out. This wasn't a chance, I saw it fucking happening.  

Then that comment. 

"Never get in the shower when you're *that* high. If you catch yourself in that situation, immediately sit down and try to calm yourself."

They were like words being spoken to me in the back of my head I fucking swear. I now had a choice after feeling what it was like to see it coming. I was terrified... When the choice came, I took it. I sat down. I hope whoever posted that comment out there see's this and knows that you saved my life tonight. I'm sorry you lost your brother the way I almost took mine.

I did the dishes, and flushed the rest of the weed down the garbage disposal. Tomorrow is a new day. Thank you.
