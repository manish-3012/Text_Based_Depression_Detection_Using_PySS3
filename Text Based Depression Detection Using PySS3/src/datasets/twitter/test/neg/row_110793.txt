Lost the will to liveI've posted here a few times before about my desire to kill myself...but I've never found the strength to finish it.

I recently got admitted (detained) by my psychologist to hospital because she felt like i was going to kill myself over the christmas break.

I've spent the last 3 weeks in an inpatient facility and today was my discharge date.  I felt ok about it but not fantastic because i had been getting a lot of support while i was there and found some meds that helped.

I got home today and it's all come flooding back.  I'm having a mental breakdown and im feeling a lot of self hate and a definite urge to end my life. 

I've lost all hope and lost the will to live.   I Just want to die
