Why I struggle to celebrate this time of yearIâ€™m still recognizing how deep my issues go, I donâ€™t know if any one would believe this story but this is how it all began. 



It was Christmas, I think I was 9?, our family is quite poor + dysfunctional but my mother and her boyfriend would always get us (my siblings and I) a Christmas bear with the year written on the foot. Even at that young age I knew that we couldnâ€™t afford much and I just couldnâ€™t understand why we kept getting these bears when I would rather something more â€œpracticalâ€ (clothes, shoes etc). 



I made the mistake of asking what the deal was with the yearly bear thing and I was mocked harshly for it. The following year while everyone else got a normal Christmas bear with the year and their name written on the feet, what I received would be referred to as a â€œsuicide bearâ€. My parents played an elaborate â€œprankâ€, I was woken up to a small bang/popping sound. They set my bear up to look like it shot itself with a toy gun, complete with a suicide note, stuffing falling out of a hole in its face. 



This happened every year, each new year brought a new suicide scenario and suicide note. And as the only gay child in a homophobic family, these suicide bears came off less like pranks and more like suggestions. 



Today I struggle with harm ocd and suicide ideation. Iâ€™ve been trying to get a higher level of mental health care because the counselor I speak with on the phone isnâ€™t really equipped to deal with amount of issues I have. This is really only scratching the surface of the fucked up things that happened to me as a child. 



I wish I knew how to find peace without the long sleep
