12 hours and counting ...Exit time for me is Saturday, August 3rd at 1:30 PM PST.  I have to say I feel better than I have in a really long time.  Having a goal, focusing on that goal, doing necessary steps to maintain that goal ... it feels good.  All the other problems/pain have fallen away.  I don't have to feel the pressure from those situations anymore.  I can't find a decent job ... if I'm dead, I don't need one.  I can't pay my rent ... if I'm dead, I don't need rent.  I'm estranged from my whole family of origin ... I won't be missed.  My "friends" can't grasp the reality of my desperation ... they finally will.  The hope of healing or somehow "getting better" ... no more expectations.
