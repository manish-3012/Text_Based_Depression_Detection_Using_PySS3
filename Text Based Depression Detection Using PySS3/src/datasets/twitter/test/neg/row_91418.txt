End of my ropeI'm literally sitting here staring at the rope, already knotted to where I would go unconscious before I would suffocate, and wanting to just be done with it all. I've been chronically sick the last few months that has left me in pain despite being in and out of the hospital over it, my dead end job where I'm working a job a couple pay grades above me without the actual pay, and just tonight my husband of 2 years decided he hated me over the fact I have to sleep more lately from the illness so I can work which means I don't always wake up for our little girl when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

I'm done with my chest always feeling like its on fire or being slowly stabbed. I'm done with having no respect at my job. And I don't want to even feel the pain of the man I love so deeply hating me for something I can't control.

edit: because of you guys, I was able to put my rope away and go to bed so I could get up a couple hours later for work. while nothing changed at work, Hubby and I were able to work something out so I wouldn't end up like I did last night.
