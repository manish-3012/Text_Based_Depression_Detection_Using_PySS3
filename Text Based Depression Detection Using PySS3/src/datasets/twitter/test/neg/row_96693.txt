My best friend killed herself, she wanted me to do it with her and now shes gone and im still here......My best friend since I was seven hung herself... I have to go to a funeral for today. I don't know if I can make It through the day. Lately life has been so hard, people I thought were my friends aren't and just make fun of me behind my back. I have no family and lately the lack of family has been killing me. Ive been fighting my way through cancer and cant even afford my nausea meds let alone food and everything just feels numb and a blur, im so depressed I kust want out so badly but I cant bring myself to do it. Like I feel so lonely that it hurts physically...â€¦..
