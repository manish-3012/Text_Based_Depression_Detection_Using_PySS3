Psych wards are worse than prison..When I was in the emergency psych ward, I never knew if I was gonna get out. It was terrifying. My life outside was suddenly on hold. No chance to explain to anyone (not that anyone cares, I came to learn). Maybe I shouldnâ€™t have cared where I was if I didnâ€™t value my life but it meant I would have even less control of it. The utensils they gave me where spoons only because plastic knives and forks were too dangerous. No locks on bathrooms, had people walking on me shit all the time. No mirrors. Trapped, not knowing when you can leave. Itâ€™s scary being trapped not even being given the chance to end your life yourself.
