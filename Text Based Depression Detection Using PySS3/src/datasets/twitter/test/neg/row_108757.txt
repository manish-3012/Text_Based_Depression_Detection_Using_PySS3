I'm not sure anymoreI don't feel as if I would actually act out and attempt suicide, but I can't stop thinking about self-mutilation. I feel like such a fuck up. I've never told anyone that I ponder the idea of killing myself. Every time the thought enters my mind I have a panic attack. I want to live so badly, but I feel like I'm doing the world a disservice for doing so. I feel like I'm losing my best friend. We just broke up because of his mental health problems. I thought that everything was okay but I'm terrified for him. I feel like this is all my fault. I want him to see happiness. I miss him so much and I want to help him. Even if we just remain friends forever, I want him to be safe.I feel like I've brought this upon him.
