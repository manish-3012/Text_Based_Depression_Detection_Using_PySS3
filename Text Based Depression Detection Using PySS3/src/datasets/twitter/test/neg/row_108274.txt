does this ever get any betteriâ€™m fucking heartbroken. i have no idea what to do and no one to go to, my only friend stopped talking to me, i lost several pets, and the person i care about has told me thereâ€™s no chance of us together. iâ€™m so lost. i want to have a purpose or at least feel like i have one. i almost committed suicide the other night, i just canâ€™t do that to my family. i shouldâ€™ve done it. i self harmed a lot and now iâ€™m mad at myself for that. i wanna feel loved, i want to have a purpose for once. i just want this to all go away. it hurts so bad
