FuckI'm fresh out of rehab and I've already fucked everything up.... again. I've been high, stole a beer, and now my family wants me gone or to change, and I'm just done with everything. I don't want to die but I don't want to fucking live. Wherever I go, I have a fucking habit of pushing the limits until I hate myself and fuck everything up, and I just don't want to deal with myself anymore. i feel like the world would be a better place without me, and it's getting to the point where I just want out. Fuck, I've already written a note. The only thing that's holding me back is trying to not hurt anyone else but that's happening by me just fucking living, and I want to cut off the pain I'm causing everyone else.
