Iâ€™m exhausted and idk if I can do this anymoreI havenâ€™t had a good nights sleep in weeks, my anxiety has been going up non stop since end of 2018. Iâ€™m just tired of it, tired of thinking I can actually change my life when actually, I just fail or fuck it up more. Iâ€™ve been fighting for 7 years now, but these last 2 have been relentless. I feel worse and worse each day and the possibility of me getting better is looking next to none, Im on a massive waiting list for therapy, being refused an appointment at my doctors because itâ€™s not an emergency. No one cares about me. Iâ€™m trapped in this shitty existence using every bit of my last motivation to help others, and just get smacked twice as hard in the face with it.
