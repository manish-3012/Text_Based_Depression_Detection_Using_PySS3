Twice in one day lmaoI wrote my notes last night. I took a 40 mile bike ride (I had planned to jump in front of a car- ik, really selfish). The car ended up swerving and missed me. So, I kept going. I found a bridge and was leaning over the edge. A young kid waved at me and I couldnâ€™t do it. I didnâ€™t want the kid to see me jump off a bridge and get hit by traffic. Damnit, I need to die. I felt free in those couple seconds in which I thought I was going to get hit by a car, tbh.
