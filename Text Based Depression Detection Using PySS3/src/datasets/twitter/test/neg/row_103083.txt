i dont know if i need psychiatric careSo like, Idk what to do or who to talk to.. a whole series of events happened to make me feel the way i do.  my Therapist lied to me and told me she thinks i graduated therapy but recommended this other guy who can supposedly help me with my pot usage as i used to rely on it more so than i do now, he never got back to me. I have been having on and off thoughts of self harm and sometimes suicide. My job makes me work nights and i never get a day off and they will not by any means accommodate what i need off, I have been sexually assaulted this past october and it still fucks with me mentally, back in 2k16 i had some traumatic events happen that makes me close up to people and have flashbacks. My new boss tells me i don't deserve to live and that i am a disappointment, he gets mad at me when i ask him questions and tries getting me into trouble. I have a manipulative friend who doesnt want a relationship because he is in one and says hes straight (which i respect) i dont know what to do....
