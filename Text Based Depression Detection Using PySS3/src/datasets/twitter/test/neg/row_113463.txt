My only lifeline left is harming myself.I have been suicidal for a very long time. I was raped by my dad for years while I was little and itâ€™s taken itâ€™s toll on my mental health. I have responsibilities for my younger sister in care so I know I canâ€™t take my life, so this is why I self harm. For most of my childhood I had no control over my own body, and now I am free I have no control over my head. I self harm to take the power back. I stab myself in my legs and I could easily bleed out but I choose not too. I have the power to take my life and that is the only thing that gives me satisfaction anymore. When Iâ€™m alone I cut and if I hit my artery I could let myself die. I donâ€™t though. I donâ€™t know if I could ever stop harming myself and I donâ€™t plan to. I enjoy this safe place. I want to die but right now that isnâ€™t an option so this works for me. People donâ€™t understand that although this isnâ€™t the best coping mechanism, Iâ€™m still here for my sister because of it. I donâ€™t hurt anyone else and it doesnâ€™t even hurt me realistically. Sorry for the rant but I had to vent somewhere after the day I have had.
