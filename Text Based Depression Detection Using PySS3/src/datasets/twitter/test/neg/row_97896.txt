I Hate Myself and Want to DieFuck man, let's see.. I just have had a pretty wild time for the past few weeks. Failed out of my dream school (because I haven't gone to a class in about a month), wasted 50k of my parents money and just am so miserable and angry at myself. I guess it's just venting but I feel that suicide would be like ripping off a band-aid. It would hurt my family and those close to me (not that close, don't worry) but in the long run I'll just continue to be a failure who hurts others. Why stay alive? Right now it's just fear of dying, and you shouldn't live just out of fear
