How much abuse is too much?I'll try to keep it brief, I could talk for hours though.
My partner is 6 months pregnant, suffering post natal anxiety from our first child (16 months), has be a bit of a depressed person most of her life, bad attempted suicide in her teenage years, and is currently threatening to do so on a daily basis now.
I don't know what to do, I walk on egg shells and any mistake (perceived or actual) is grounds for a outburst of rage, which last night resulted in me being locked out the front of our house, so I used a bin to get onto the roof and drop down into the back yard after several hours, injuring my ankles in the process, slept on the concrete floor of our pergola, had to read and listen to her scream and yell and blame me for wanting her to die and for doing everything on purpose. This went on until 2 am, started up again at 7 am, I was allowed back into the house so I could watch our daughter while she got ready to go, out or to kill herself I don't know, and after I saw her hug and kiss our daughter with tears in her eyes I walked into the garage and waited, hoping I could prevent her from leaving without making it worse but I can't let her go and kill herself. She stayed inside and after another argument about something else I'd done wrong, resulted in her opening the door and throwing glass candles, 1L bottles of water, ceramic ornaments at close range directly at me. I managed to shield my face but my arm and legs are quite bruised.

How much abuse is too much? I want her to be ok but I can't see us together anymore. I have to remove our daughter from the house but if I do that might be the thing that pushes her to do it, I don't know what I can do. I am over all of this, J don't want any of this.
