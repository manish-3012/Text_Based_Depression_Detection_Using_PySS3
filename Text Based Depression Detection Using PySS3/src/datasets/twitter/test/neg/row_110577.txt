VentThe world is a messed up place - no matter where you look there is suffering and misery. Reading news article after article and hearing the talking heads on TV repeat the same bullshit ad nauseam is really starting to wear on my psyche. People are divided, people are triggered, people are not listening to each other, and people are fed up with one another. There seems to be so much hostility everywhere you turn. You try and ignore it all and you're doing yourself a disservice by not staying informed in important matters. But then you open yourself up to it and you're constantly bombarded with despair. The world is not happy. There is no true joy, only a facade people tell themselves. Try all you want to find your own sense of purpose, great on you. Whatever gets you through another day. 

But I am not happy. I am tired. I am alone. I have a moral obligation to attempt to stay on this Earth for my family and those who care about me, because there are those who do, I'm sure. But it's so easy to just slip away. We are pawns driving this dystopia forward. I just want to close my eyes and go to sleep forever. Coward's way out? Sure. A way to erase whatever self-appointed guilt I have in regards to how fucked the world is? Perhaps. Regardless if it's all in my head and actually meaningless, just as much as I am to whoever the fuck reads this garbage? Absolutely. I don't know and I don't really care anymore. Fuck I want to blow my brains out and just be done with it all.
