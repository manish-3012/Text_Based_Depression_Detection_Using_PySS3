I'm worried about my friend.Hi guys. This post is on behalf of one of my best friends. For reference, I am a 17 year old guy, posting about a 16 year old girl. we are both rising juniors. I'll call her Lauren to keep her name private.

Well for a while I have been a little nervous about her mental health. Lauren and I have been great friends (strictly platonic, we help each other with dating advice all the the time) for 10 years. Anyways, sometimes in the middle of the night she will text me distraught over her life and her problems. Occasionally when we are hanging out, for seemingly no reason she will suddenly shut up and act all depressed. It seems like I am always being a therapist towards her. Frequently I am calming her down and listening to her problems (which I am completely ok with)

Recently, another friend of ours, (I'll call him John) who is also best friends with both of us, told me some disturbing news. Apparently Lauren texted him one night after she had been crying for hours and said she wanted to kill herself. Tonight, she was texting both John and I. She is telling me how she loves John and wants to date him again (they dated for a few months, they were a great couple), saying that she is in love with him. Well John showed me some of the texts that she sent to him, and she said that he was one of the only reasons she was still around.

Worst of all, both of her parents are somewhat alcoholic and are unable to help her deal with her problems (which is why she always turns to John and I).

How can I help my possibly suicidal (and certainly depressed) friend? She means the entire world to me and if she were to kill herself, I don't think I could go on either. If there are any tips you guys could give me, that would be awesome. I love this girl (in a non sexual way) and she has always been one of my closest friends.
