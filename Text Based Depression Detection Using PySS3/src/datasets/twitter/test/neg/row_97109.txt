Too poor to achieve happyI'm transgender, but I can't afford medical transition. I have to be seen and treated as the wrong gender everyday because I can't afford to fix it. I've had suicide plans mapped out for as long as I remember in life. But lately I've lost hope that someday I can be the real me.
