I love life but I don't see any option anymoreWeird title but I don't know how to summarise my thoughts, so yeah. This is about my voice, its ruined my life. It started off with what is probably my biggest regret in life. A girl said something about my voice sounding weird, I kinda laughed it off and so did she and I moved on for a few weeks. Then one day, randomly, the thought popped into my head, so on a whim posted my voice on some sub on reddit. That's the regret. The comments were brutal. My confidence fell to zero. Til that day, I've never fully recovered. For years, I've spoken in this very strained but barely understandable voice used to hide my real voice. It just made things worse though. Now, even when I try speaking normally I can't anymore. Its a combination of severely beaten self confidence and physically not being able to revert back to my normal voice anymore. I have 3,000 recordings on my phone and computer. I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind here, seriously.

I've thought about going to a therapist or councillor but because that requires me to talk, I just can't bring myself to do it. Same issue with a speech therapist. I know this is all in my head, but I can't seem to let go. The reason I say I love life is that when I go days without speaking, I'm okay and kinda happy even. I draw, make art, enjoy YouTube videos, browse on here, read a great book, play my guitar and on a good day can sing in a somewhat normal voice. The minute I need to talk though, my happiness takes a nose dive. Plus, some days I'm lonely. Not being able to communicate isolates you. I have this one friend who I've been texting with for years, I've made every excuse not to meet up again as obviously my voice issue. I feel I'm pushing my family away as well as I tend to isolate myself as I rather not speak at all. I only have the job I have because of my dad and he has said on a few occasions that "If you weren't my son I would've sacked you by now!" As you can tell from the sternest of that quote, my dad is sick and tired of me. My mum occasionally cries, my sister is patient but clearly frustrated my brother has become distant(we used to be super close). As you can see, I don't see a bright future, how would I meet new people? how would I meet a GF?, if my dad sacks me, then what would I do? I feel I'm destined to be that lonely 45 year old constantly in his basement(or out in the street) having done jack in his life. I'm already half way there(I'm 23). This depresses me greatly, so see no other choice but to cut the cord before things increasingly get worse. I honestly feel like I'm out of options here.
