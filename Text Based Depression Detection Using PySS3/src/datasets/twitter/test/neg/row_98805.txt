Anyone else dread that life is taking so long?Iâ€™m simultaneously irate that Iâ€™m nearing 30, and that many of my â€œyouthâ€ years are behind me or wasted but also deeply concerned that barring no accidents or diseases I could potentially have to live this life for another 30-40 years. It just seems so long. Does anyone else feel this way?
