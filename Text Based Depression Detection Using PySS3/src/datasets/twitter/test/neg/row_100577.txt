I Wish I Weren't Like ThisI'm torn up inside and out. My face is unshaved and my hair is a mess. I'm wearing that ugly yellow beanie and I look a mess.
 
I asked if I could be your housemate. I need some way to stay in school. You said no so quickly. Don't you remember how I raised you for years when mom wouldn't? I mean so little to you.
 
You tell me not to think about you. You were the love of my life and my best friend. I'm going through it the worst and I think I have no one. My friend or my lover.
 
My brother, you aren't who you were supposed to be. Your going away. Part of me thinks you may have had it coming. It could have been so different. In sorry he hurt you too. 
 
My mom. You let him rape me. You didn't mean for it to happen but he is your brother. You were supposed to look after me.
 
My God. Why do you tell me to stay and be strong. Can I just lay down now? I'm so tired.
