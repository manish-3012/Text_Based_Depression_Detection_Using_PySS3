What length of time is enough, where nothing improves, that makes suicide a reasonable action.I'm in a difficult position. I'm 23 and 7 months into my first professional job. In high school I decided I'd kill myself when I graduated, didn't happen. In college there were numerous occasions I was ready with my finger on the trigger to kill myself. It never happened. Now as I progress into real life the reality of working all week to only get weekends to myself is really hitting me. I don't like working all the time, but I'd never be able to do that because I want to maintain my current lifestyle. I can kill myself whenever I want, I'm just trying to ascertain an amount of time that is reasonable, if my life doesn't drastically improve, then I will kill myself.
