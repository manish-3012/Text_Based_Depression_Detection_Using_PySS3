Failed Attempt #1Last night I had a couple friends over who had brought over some booze; I thought, hell, now or never right? I can get shit-faced, take the couple  of pills I have been storing for my more planned out attempt day but hell, no time like the present. They leave, I prepare for bed. My family has gone to sleep. I have inoculated myself against writing my simple suicide letter for weeks: "Cremation-- no funeral. It always had to be this way. I love you" and set out to take the first of many Ambiens and Mybulen. It was a bizarre cocktail of drugs, also did about 1-2g of shrooms in there for (hopefully) a light passing (didn't happen). It's past 5pm where I live. I still feel a wreck and I can't stand or talk or talk properly. I'm barely getting through this post. I feel sick and miserable. I'm not surprised I am not dead but regardless I'm majorly pissed off--so pissed off in fact, I mad a reddit account just to vent HOW pissed off I am. At least this is better than being rushed off to hospital and hit with a astronomical medical fee as the place where I live just went back into hard lockdown once again for surges in COVID cases. I need to be dead by the end of this week, I just have to be. And the only sure why that was going to happen was what happened last night. Fuck.
