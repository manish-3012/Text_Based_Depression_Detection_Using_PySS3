nobody ever asks me if I'm okI feel like in every relationship I have I'm always the one doing the emotional labor. When a friend of mine is going through shit I drop what I'm doing to help them. My dad talks to me about how he wasted his life and how he wishes he could divorce my mom and I listen and offer a shoulder to cry on and later he's back to calling me awful names. My boyfriend talks to me about his depression and I listen and try to talk to him about it and all he can say is I don't understand what he's going through. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about jumping off of a bridge or trying to figure out some easier way to kill myself. And I'm afraid to try opening up to anyone about that because I'm worried I'll just hear the same thing I've been hearing. They'll tell me I don't know what it feels like to be depressed or that I have such a better life than them so I should stop complaining. I think soon I'm just going to finally kill myself, not ask for help or leave a note or anything. Just do it finally and be done with it. I'm not ok, I just want to die.
