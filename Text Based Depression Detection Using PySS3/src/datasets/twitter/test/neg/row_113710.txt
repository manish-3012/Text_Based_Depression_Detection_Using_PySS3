Out of optionsTl;dr: I feel like Iâ€™ve made enough attempts/effort to justify suicide.

Over the course of my adulthood(35M) which is reasonably underway at this point, Iâ€™ve had many issues that stem from having a bad back. I struggled with depression since I was pretty young, but as my back injuries got worse/more severe, so did the constant pain. I have 2 suicide attempts on record medically, and one involved opiates about 9 years ago, so my pain killer options are super limited. Every day is filled with physical pain. Getting out of bed hurts, wiping my ass is becoming increasingly difficult as I continue to lose range of motion, i am struggling with walking more and more. My employment prospects are not doing super well either, as you might imagine I have some pretty substantial physical restrictions. 

Over the last several years Iâ€™ve been fighting the depression and back pain. Constant doctor visits, specialists, diets, exercise plans, antidepressants, sleeping pills, antipsychotics, physical therapy, etc. Iâ€™ve only been getting worse. I have no employment prospects, have never had an intimate relationship/girlfriend, and at this point I am a drain on my moms fixed income resources. I see no cause for hope in my situation. Itâ€™s not the depression as much as the inability to do anything. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to family and friends and they are way out of their depth with this kind of thing. I exhausted therapy options where I live, either full or donâ€™t take my insurance, been on multiple waiting lists(some for over a year) and nothing as of yet. 

I donâ€™t see a day in my future that isnâ€™t filled with physical pain and discomfort, not to mention all the mental crap which I try to discount as mostly being overemphasized by the constant pain. My last dr visit he suggested we just start over on the antidepressants(as in letâ€™s try the ones that didnâ€™t work before and maybe now they will). Iâ€™m not a fan of suicide, but Iâ€™m less a fan of not even being 40 but being physically worthless in a way that people canâ€™t even see.

I made a sort of deal with myself that I wonâ€™t kill myself as long as my mom is alive because I donâ€™t want to hurt her like that, but Iâ€™m finding that deal gets weaker day by day. Iâ€™m just so tired of being in pain. I just want it to end.

Iâ€™ve effectively isolated myself over the past several years to the point I have regular contact with 3 people. And lately Iâ€™ve been cutting that down. I have been intentionally rude to family to try and make it less hurtful when I execute whichever plan is appropriate for the time.  

I donâ€™t expect anything to come of this post, but for those reading and thinking about killing themselves, I challenge you to do your best to not. Try everything people tell you to try, go through the hell of antidepressant roulette with a doctor(s), try to talk to friends and family, therapists, suicide hotline, forums, and any other avenue that might help you get well, or at least well enough.

I feel like Iâ€™ve done all I can do, the only two things that keep me going are not wanting to hurt my mom, and the old adage â€œYou can always kill yourself tomorrowâ€.
