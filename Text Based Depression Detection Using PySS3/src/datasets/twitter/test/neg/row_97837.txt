I will kill myself on my 30th birthdayIm 27 now and my plan is to kill myself on my 30th birthday. Ive already told all of my friends about this and they are freaking out but idgaf cause it makes sense to me to end myself before my life turns into living hell 3 years from now.

I currently live with my parents and as of now, my life is FABULOUS cause my parents have $$$ and I get everything I want. However, they told me I should move out next year cause I will be 28 by then which is â€žtoo old to live with your mom and dadâ€œ I guess.

I have a crappy job and get lousypaid. I just did the math and once I find an apartment for which I will have to pay + the money I will spendon food, I will have only 300 $ left every month to spend on my hobbies and other needs (social life, travelling, clothes etc.). THATS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY and like whats the point of living if you cant afford yourself nice things from time to time?

On another note, some of my family members are struggling with theirhealth. In 2-3 years, some of them might be gone. Such a scary thought. I dont wanna live in a world like that.

people start to look like crap once they enter their 30s. Bye bye beauty!

Honestly I have no idea why my friends are calling me psychotic, whats the point of living once everything starts going down the drain? They even advised me to look for a therapist o_O
