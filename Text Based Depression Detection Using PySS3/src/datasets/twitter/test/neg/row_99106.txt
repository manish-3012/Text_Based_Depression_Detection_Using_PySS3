Suicide on my mind everydayI feel really empty like I'm living life on auto pilot. I just hate the whole world. I'm rather popular and supported by friends.  My family could be better but they try. All I can think about is feeling the blood dripping from my veins how beautiful it would be to sleep forever.  My cats will be taken care of at least. 
 I have a therapy appointment in a week. I'm just trying to make it until then. I'm just so disappointed in myself for being such a pathetic person. I was just trying to give myself a chance to fall in love. I let my guard down ..  now it's hard to breathe. I wish this was last week or a couple months ago but it's been almost a year.  I'm so mad... I cannot believe some people .. I'm just... I feel true hate...actual hate. 7 days left...
