EmptyIâ€™ve been left so long by mental health services and the gender clinic I have deconstructed my feelings.theyre just chemicals and Iâ€™m existing trying to make the good chemicals go in my brain but they donâ€™t so much nowadays. I donâ€™t enjoy things. I wanted a girlfriend but Iâ€™m too numb to be sad about being forever single being in love is illogical and just chemicals flowing anyway why even bother.inthink I want to die more than try to get a job sent like two hundred resumes nothing back Iâ€™m unemployable because I am autistic and rejected from society. wonâ€™t get top surgery in time either Iâ€™ll die with my body as it is, how I donâ€™t want it to be. Wonâ€™t find belonging in a job or a partner too late
