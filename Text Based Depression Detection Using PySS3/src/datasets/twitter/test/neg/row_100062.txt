Can't do it.Every time I plan to hang myself I will think about it all the time, especially on the day, but then i wont even act. I have never managed to be in a position where I would be able to do it, I just think to myself "maybe tomorrow". It's not like deep down I don't want to do it, I just never do.

Edit: Never mind, please ignore, I'm gonna do it today!
