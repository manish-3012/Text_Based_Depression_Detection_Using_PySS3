Reaching the end of my sanity for a third timeI made an impulsive journey to Washington away from family and everyone I know to try and start fresh, but of course my depression followed me. Tomorrow im going back to Michigan with no plan whatsoever. I have no money and no work prospects. I cant get a hold of anyone to get me from the airport and I have no clue where I'm going to go. There are shelters in Flint, my grandmother may let me stay with her, or maybe my mom although I don't think she will. In a month it's going to be too cold to sleep outside. I don't know how I'm going to eat. I have no idea what to do.

Ive tried twice to kill myself. The last time was a little over a month ago. Now, on the cusp of this new stress, I have no idea what else to do but try again. I don't know what else to do. I'm very scared. Really fucking scared and so stressed I can hardly move. Thinking about standing at the airport alone figuring out which way to start walking.
