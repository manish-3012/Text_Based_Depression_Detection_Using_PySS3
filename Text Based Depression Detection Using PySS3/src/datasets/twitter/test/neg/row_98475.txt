Feeling better commiserating with you allI don't know why, but spending time among people who understand how I feel is kind of uplifting. 

I'm currently working on a certification and basically just have a few pages of work left. I wonder if I'll be able to finish by the deadline or if I'll fail again. Therapy tomorrow so at least I'm forced to brush my teeth and go outside.
