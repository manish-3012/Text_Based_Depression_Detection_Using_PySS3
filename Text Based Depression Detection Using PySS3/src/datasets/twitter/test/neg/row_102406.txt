Back here again.Itâ€™s been a fine week. I have no reason to feel like this but I do. 

I canâ€™t focus, I canâ€™t keep on burdening my friends and family with how I feel. Theyâ€™d have an easier time without me here. Iâ€™m a Paramedic student and all I want to do it die. How would I ever be good st what I do if I was this fucked up. 

I want to end this. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve been fighting for so long and I am so tired.
