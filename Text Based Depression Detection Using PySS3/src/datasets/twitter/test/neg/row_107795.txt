The only reason I haven't done the deed yet...I don't want to bring grief and shame to my family. I don't care about myself. I have been intentionally taking part in increasingly self-destructive behavior because I am hoping that if I push things too far it'll all end for me without it looking obvious. I don't want to suffer anymore, but I don't want my family to suffer either. How can I have the best of both worlds? How can I end my life while mitigating their sorrow?
