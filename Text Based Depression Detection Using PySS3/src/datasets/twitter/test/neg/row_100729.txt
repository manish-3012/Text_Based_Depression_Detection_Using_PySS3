College SucksIve been at university for three years, and my grades suck. I still don't have a major because I applied undecided to the university, and couldn't transfer to any degree because my grades suck. I wanted to transfer into biology and do a pre med track but that's out the window. Im seriously been so depressed that ive been crying myself to sleep every night. Im obese and have no friends either. I have no idea how im gonna face my parents after the end of this semester. Im done with my life.
