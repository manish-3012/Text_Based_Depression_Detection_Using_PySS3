i have no idea what to do anymorethis month is a big trigger for me and i dread going to therapy. i already feel useless to those around me and finding less and less to be happy about. my entire life feels like some trauma porn manga and its making my suicide feel ten times more appealing. i want to be fixed desperately, but not at the risk of my current well-being. ive faced more ableism in a ward than i do outside of it. i dont know what to do, especially when everything goes to shit
