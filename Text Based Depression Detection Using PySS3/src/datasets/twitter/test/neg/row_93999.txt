I just don't know anymoreI'm 19 and wanting to end it all for years now. I'm a failure in my life, doing terrible in school if i even do the work, no social life, barely if any friends, my family say they care for me and about me yet criticise everything I do and don't do. I was sexually assaulted as a kid along with being bullied constantly. I know im ugly and unattractive physically and my personality is worse with me being boring and an asshole that pushes people away and hurts people in hopes that I inevitably get low enough and the courage to finally do it. 

I never have any positive thoughts of the future, I never really have. I've always been quite alone and my personality is mainly why. People barely want to talk to me and its always me for why. My mother is emotionally abusive and I never met my dad. I have low self esteem, no confidence, pessimistic, hyper sexual cause of what happened to me as a kid and my sexual fantasies and kinks are fucked up cause of it. 

Overall I just know how I'm gonna be able to live any longer, I hate my life but I'm too much of a coward to take it.
