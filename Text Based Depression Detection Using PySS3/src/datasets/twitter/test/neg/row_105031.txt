I did itIt's 3am. I just swallowed over 50  paracetamol tablets. I really don't know what's going to happen after this. I'm just going to go to sleep now. I see that a lot of people say that paracetamol doesn't kill you, just fucks up your liver and leaves you in tremendous pain but I need to take the chance that it will. I'm not happy, probably never will be. I'm just existing and that's not living. Nobody cares about me. My death won't affect anyone. I said it in my last post that the last time I attempted was 7 years ago. I'm just really sad because I thought I was doing so well for a while but I feel like I'm just gone back to where I was before. I try to be an optimistic person, and not to moan, but everything is just gone to shit. And I need to accept that it's never going to get better. 

I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know if I'll need the hospital if I wake up and survive. I just hope I die.

To the people on this sub: Thank you all for being so kind and caring. You all deserve the world. Iâ€™m sorry for not being strong enough to carry on.
