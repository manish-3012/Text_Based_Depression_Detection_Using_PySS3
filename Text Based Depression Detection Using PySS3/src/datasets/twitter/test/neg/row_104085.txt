I need a little help re: a good friendbecause I'm honestly stuck. I have no more ideas on what to do to try and help--if I even can at this point.

(I'm keeping this a bit vague since idk if he does reddit or not.)

A good friend of mine is male, and near 30. A fucked-up childhood, a fucked-up engagement ending in no wedding (thankfully for him), probably a few stable relationships, and now a string of god-awful relationships or flings or whatever you want to call them. 

He started dating this one girl a little over a year ago, she had a ton of issues of her own to work on. Constant fighting between the two of them, yadda yadda. They break up because she needs to get her shit together. Turns out that when he started dating her, he tossed all his goals and dreams out the window, just to be with her.

Now that relationship is over. He still wants her back; and on some level he still wants me (we dated extremely briefly years ago). 

He has no goals, nothing in particular in life that he wants to accomplish. He treats his friends well, works hard at his job...but it's just going through the motions. 

As far as I can tell, each day is just as miserable for him as the day he broke up with the girlfriend. 

He's not particularly suicidal, but he constantly tells me "I'm not going to make it to X date". His birthday, Christmas, new year's, you name it. He's not suicidal in the ways you see on /r/SW--but he's taken up all sorts of things to push his body well beyond the breaking point.

Example: warrior dashes, excessive gym time, not eating (while doing these things), and most recently, taking up MMA training. (Mixed Martial Arts.)


I've tried to talk to him, several mutual friends have tried to talk to him. His medications (all...six or seven that he's tried) just made him actively suicidal instead of this passive-aggressive form it's currently taking. He's claimed to work out all of his mental issues from his younger days, and I do believe that one.  He just has no more zest for life; nothing really makes him happy anymore.

And with that epically-lengthed post, I ask you fine people: what else can be done? We've all tried talking to him and helping him as best as we know how. I don't think therapy would do anything productive for him.

Suggestions? It breaks my heart to see him this way.
