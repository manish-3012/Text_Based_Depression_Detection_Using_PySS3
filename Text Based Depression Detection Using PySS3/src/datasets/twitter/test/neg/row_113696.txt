ScaredThinking about making another attempt. I'll be using money I don't have in order to help me attempt. It will have to be soon since I'm late on my rent. Also my internet will be gone shortly. Want to say goodbye, but no one to say goodbye to, that's from my end though not from theirs. There is something that I lack, maybe it's a soul, it makes me constantly feel like I'm on the outside looking in. I might leave a note, don't really want a funeral. I think I've made my choice a while ago, but am too scared to go through with it. Last time when I was covered with blood I just burst and became a blubbering mess. Knowing that terror and panic await me is giving me pause. I guess I'm trying to make it easier. I guess this is my battle and I have to overcome the terror and panic of dieing. Thanks for giving me some time, see ya later alligator.
