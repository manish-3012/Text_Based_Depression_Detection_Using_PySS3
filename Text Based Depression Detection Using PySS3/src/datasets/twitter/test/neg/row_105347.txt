I am a failureI am 26 year old male, and live with my grandparents. I still go to college, but by the time i graduate i might be 32 if not older.

I have no friends, i have no girlfriend (ive only ever had one), have no kids,  i work at jack in the box, people make fun of me for being single for so long some even say im gay. My younger brothers even have kids and started their own families; i can tell i bring a sort of shame to the family.

 Academically im doing alright, but socially i am painfuly alone. Partly its due to the nature of my studies which involve lots of math ( that doesnt lend itself to a very active social life)

Sometimes i just want to kill myself. I have no person to talk to, even my mom makes fun of my plans. I have no friends, and even my family members seem to have abandoned me.
