Mmm.Just sick to death of being drained of all fight.

Doing way more drugs than necessary and just hoping I don't wake up.

EDIT: Should my family read this, know that it was how I wanted it. I am that selfish and no apology could ever make up for it. I'm sorry but I can't do this forever. I hope that one day, you will forgive me but that is more than I deserve. xx

EDIT2: This is great stuff. Anyone want to chat since I'm way up?
