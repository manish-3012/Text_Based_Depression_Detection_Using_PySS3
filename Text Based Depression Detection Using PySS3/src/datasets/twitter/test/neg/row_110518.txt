What to do when you have suicidal thoughtsTitle says it all.  
It usually comes in waves, sometimes it's not as strong and sometimes it's so bad I feel like I want to jump from the 17th floor. It got much worse recently. I'm not planning on doing it anytime soon. Even though I crave it, the thought of death and suicide scares me a lot.  
What do you guys do whenever this happens? How do I stop it, or at least calm it down?
