The only reason I am alive is because I owe too much...To my parents. They've spent their entire life trying extremely hard to help me in every way, but I've come to think it's just not possible for me to pay them back no matter what I do. If I knew my death wouldn't devastate them I would be hanging right now. I know how to tie two knots like the back of my hands: my shoelaces and a goddamn noose.

But I'm too rational a person to mill myself. And I owe too much to kill myself. And I'll go to hell if I kill myself. But every day I can feel I am slipping a little closer. I'm getting a little less sane, a little less smart, and a little less rational every day. 

I have tried being open about it. Nobody knows how to help me, and I ended up feeling worse for upsetting them. As for a therapist? I had one. She was really helpful, but the first antidepressants had me feeling apathetic, so she switched me to a different medication that ended up making me suicidal (even more than I am now). I was going to swallow all of the pills I could find, but I barely stopped myself and messaged her and my family. The result: she abandoned me because she didn't want to take responsibility. 

I am sitting here with a noose I tied. I don't have anywhere private and strong enough to hang it, and perhaps not enough intent to hang myself. But as it's going, I am getting closer and closer. I just want it to be quick, painless, and clean; these three things are the only things stopping me when I have a seriously bad episode. 

I know I sound incoherent. I said I have only one reason but I don't even know anymore. All I know is that when it comes down to it, there's just a tiny fine line stopping me when it gets bad. And every time it gets bad that line gets tinier and finer. I don't know when it will snap. But if this doesn't stop, it snapping is guaranteed.
