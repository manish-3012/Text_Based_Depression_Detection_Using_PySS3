I want to self harm even when Iâ€™m happyI feel like self harming even when Iâ€™m happy

Recently things have gotten worse with my mental health, Iâ€™m getting suicidal thoughts for the first time in years and have started self harming again. 
Today I had a good day where nothing went wrong and I didnâ€™t feel bad in the slightest. When I got home I suddenly felt like I needed to do it and when I stopped myself my anxiety got worse and worse until I felt so bad that it was all I could think about. 
I have people in my life that care but as someone who has had people overwhelm me with their issues I feel like I canâ€™t approach them to talk about it, without my anxiety getting worse and it going in a cycle.
I donâ€™t know what to do.
