There's nothing to live forI'm 23 working a shitty job outdoor job that doesn't give a fuck about me.  They can schedule me for 20 hours one week and 65 hours the next.  They don't give a fuck about my health or my sanity.  I'm freezing my ass off at work and hate every minute of it.  

Women literally don't give a fuck about me.  I don't know how to talk to them anyways so I suppose it doesn't matter but I have had any luck with women.  This pisses me off because my co-workers love to brag about how they met some chick at a party and slept with her that very night.  Like it's no big deal at all.  Here I am, unable to even get a hello and they're out banging women they met hours before?

Not to mention the shit I read here on reddit.  About how guys bang women left and right.  How they go to a bar and go to her place to get laid.  How they've fucked two girls at once.  How they've gotten laid without even trying. That shit fucking infuriates me. 

And what if I do find some girl who wants to date me?  What happens then?  Do I go along and marry her?  Chances are that in this sex-positive society she's banged a few dudes in her time.  How can I look her in the eye and take her seriously when she's choked on 10-20 other dude's dicks?  How she's been intimate with dozens of guys before me?  How do I tell our future child that their mommy was a slut?

I have no hobbies or things to take my mind off the world.  I live alone and have no friends.  There's nothing that I can do to change that.  I'm just a socially retarded person.  I wouldn't be surprised if I found out I had aspergers.  

There's no reason for me to get up in the morning other than the fear of losing this shitty job and in turn losing my shitty house and becoming a homeless dumbass.  I have no more motivation to do anything anymore.  I have to struggle through life on my own.  Why the fuck even try?  

It's Friday night and I have no where to be, nor the energy to do anything even if I did have plans.
