Just woke up, feeling ready to dieIâ€™ve taken a two-week vacation from work to allow new meds to work and do some heavy outpatient therapy. It hasnâ€™t helped.

The very thought of returning makes me sick, and I even got a text from my boss last night saying heâ€™s looking forward to my return on Wednesday.

Suicide seems like a very good option. I was raped as a child, and blamed myself for it for decades, and still do. As a child, I thought I was going to hell for it. I was bullied, and confused sexually until my mid-20s. 

Yep, dying seems like a good option, and I only hope God can forgive me if I go through with it.
