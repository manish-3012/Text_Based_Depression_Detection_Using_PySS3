I'm so tired. My demise is my only aspiration anymore.I've been wrestling with suicidal compulsions and severe depression for two decades now.  I've failed to self terminate five times (Can't even get that right.) but have not made an attempt in about seven years.  I've struggled every day.  I have to fight myself every morning and convince myself that I should get out of bed and not just try to sleep forever or take a dive out my window (High up in an apartment.) and finally end this pointless fight.

I have spent my life living by my the "Fake it 'til you make it." mantra and I suppose I have.  I have a decent paying job that I'm acceptable at, I also hate it.  I have a family that cares as long as there's no negativity.  I have a reasonably sized group of friends who don't really talk to me anymore.  These years of faking it have left me with a fake and empty life that it seems like plenty of other people are happy with.

On the other hand, I can't stand it.  My life is pointless.  At this point making major changes really isn't possible.  This is it.  This is my low, boring life trajectory.  I pretty much gave up about a year ago, I've got a few personal commitments that require my attention.  Once those are resolved (Couple of months.) I am planning on calling it.  I'm going to close out my accounts and everything and drive until I run out of gas or road and then walk until my legs give out.  That's how I'll know I've arrived at the end of my journey.  I think it's better if I disappear than if someone finds me.

Tried therapy, drugs (both prescribed and self-medicated), philosophy (various), getting over it, trying to be happy.  Did not work.  Over time this has only gotten worse.  I guess a small part of me is still fighting or I wouldn't have posted anything.

TLDR : I'm a big phony but it's OK because I've penciled suicide into my schedule.
