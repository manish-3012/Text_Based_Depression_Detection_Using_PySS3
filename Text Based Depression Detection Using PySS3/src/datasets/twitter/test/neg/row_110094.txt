Sorry for a late 2am ramble.Lately, I find it hard to do much of anything. Working retail is consuming me. I believe my current relationship is hurting me as well. I feel like i'm being cheated on and not knowing hurts more. I have no direction. I'm not in school. I just turned 20. I work at walmart. I'm in the national guard. I feel so disassociated with everything recently. on my previous birthday my former bestfriend told me that I stunted her growth and there was no longer space for me in her life. I'm convinced my family hates me. I just don't see the point in continuing when everyone else is rapidly moving ahead and I fall further and further behind. I don't feel I have friends I can depend on. &amp; I get manipulated into situations because I can't say no. Why is there a point to staying alive? waking up in the morning? I'm just another statistic it seems like. I don't have anything to look forward to so why not just be gone?
