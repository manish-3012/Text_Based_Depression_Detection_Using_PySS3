I have a death plan. Anyone else?I figured my death would just be an easy sympathy grab for my parents and those around me. 

I tried to talk about my feelings to people, but they all just brush it off. My parents make it all about how hard life is for them. I've been depraved of friendship and affection.  My death will be a platform for people to parade themselves as brave souls battling the dangers of suicide, all while they blatantly ignore every sign of me reaching out to them now. 

Tired of having to exist, I plan to die after cutting myself off from family and associations. I do not want them to get to claim that they helped me. They have done nothing for me, and I do not owe it to the world to live. I'm getting done with my studies first. I'll move to another country, and I'm ending it there. It will take a while, but I want to make sure I'm uncontactable. If I earn enough money, I'll set a system that sends them money every month for several years so they do not realise I'm dead until it's way too late. 

I'm 17, and I do not know how long I have left. I have felt undeserving of happiness since I was 9. Maybe if i give it some time, I'll find happiness elsewhere and change my mind. I do not think it is likely that I will live past the age of 35. 

Do any of you also have death plans?
