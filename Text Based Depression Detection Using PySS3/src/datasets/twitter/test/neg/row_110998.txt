I'm tired of my seizuresSuicide is always on the table. And it sucks because I worked so hard to get off of drugs and got my kids back.
I feel so selfish. 
I have severe rape trauma PTSD. It's a complex form and almost every night I start to get anxious about what happened, my feet tighten, my jaw pulls, and I have seizures over and over. I can't tell anyone because I have no one and I have no one because I can't tell anyone.
I have to get up and take care of kid all day and then every night I'm reliving my experience and having seizures.
I've gone to counseling and all it does is trigger things even worse.
Yesterday I damaged my legs seizing. They pulled weird. One straight and the other nearly to my chest. I know it will heal but it's just so hard to handle.
I need a sleep study but I can't even get a break for that.
I just can't keep doing this. The body aches after seizures, the fear, the stress
