Want to end it allI think about killing my self everyday. I research and read things online just to understand the best way to do it. Iâ€™m too scared to do it but I wish I had the courage because the pain life has dealt me is too much for me to cope with. I canâ€™t keep going on with this life of suffering anymore. I want to go to sleep and never wake up.
