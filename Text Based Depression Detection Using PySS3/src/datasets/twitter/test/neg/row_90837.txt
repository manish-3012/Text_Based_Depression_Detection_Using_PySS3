Can someone take care of my kitten?The only thing I have left is my cat, as much as I love her, I can't stay around much longer. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember and my girlfriend of two years just broke up with me using a text after ignoring me all day today. I'm tired of this world and getting hurt by everyone who's important to me. Once I find something strong enough, this noose around my neck will do what it was made to do years ago. I hope someone takes care of my cat for me, I left plenty of food and water.
