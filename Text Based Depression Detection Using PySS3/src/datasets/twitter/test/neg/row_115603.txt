I don't know if I'm suicidal, but I know I don't want to wake up tomorrow.Been out of work since January 4. My 4th fiancee in 10 years just walked out on me -- but she's still in the house for another two weeks, chatting with her friends and presumably her new boyfriend right in front of me. She took all our friends with her. My family consists of a father I barely speak to, and a brother who is too checked out to help. I'm probably about to lose my house because I can't afford the bills anymore.

I feel completely and totally alone, and I don't want to do it anymore. I'm 35 years old, and I have a dog to show for the last 12 years of my life. I don't think I have it in me to start over again.
