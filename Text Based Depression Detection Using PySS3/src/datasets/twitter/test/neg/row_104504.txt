I feel like shit.I feel like my insides are ready to turn inside out. Work is unbearable. I don't feel like I can control my face, so I'm trying to avoid everyone. I just wish I could go back home and stay in bed...why can't I just sleep? I cannot do another 6 hours of this. I wish that I could explain to them what is happening, how close I am to hanging myself, but all I will get is a lecture on how I need to go to church and it's the Devil that is making me feel bad...that or they will contact a doctor who will force me into a psych ward. Ah, fuck it.
