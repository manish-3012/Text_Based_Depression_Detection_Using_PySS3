I barly feel motivated enough to write a post to ask for helpTheres mo exit.  I'm gonna be stuck working shit jobs or being homeless the rest of my life. There's something repellant about me that i get fired from every job and dropped by every friend for what feels like no reason but really it's just that I'm a shitty rotten person and the worlds better without me
