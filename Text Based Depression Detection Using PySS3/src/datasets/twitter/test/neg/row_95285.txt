HopelessHello

As I write this on my phone, 0:44 in the morning I cry, for many a reason, most of which are streaming through my head all of which feel impossible to put out in a way that conveys the pain they bring to me.

I'm 19, I'm a male, I live by myself, I've never had a relationship. I feel so trapped in a spiral of loneliness that is so inescapable that everyone suffers from it deep down. On some level I hope that one day I will find somone that I can connect with emotionally to a point where I feel like we're soul mates. I fear this will never happen. I feel so alone in my existence that I shouldn't wait to see what happens on the other side of death and cut to the chase.

No longer existing brings a sense of terror that makes me want to scream until my lungs collapse. I feel alone in this aswell as the response is often one of religious sentiment or one so nonchalant that I want to give them a taste of my fear.

I don't know what solution there is, if there even is one. I want to make it through this night so I can talk to my counsellor tomorrow.

I appreciate any comments, knowing that I've shared my thoughts instead of keeping them in will be a feeling. I think.

Stay safe.
