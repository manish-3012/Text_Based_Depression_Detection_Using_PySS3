I'm so very overwhelmedI really don't care anymore 
I just can't do this anymore with everything filling my thoughts up.
I'll never be on the right direction and everything I do is wrong 
I don't even remember what I was going to say anymore 
I don't know
I don't wanna feel movement I just want to be off drugs 
I will never have her 
I will never do anything right 
I just want lines to snort and to be left the fuck alone but I want someone to talk to me 
I can't make up my mind
