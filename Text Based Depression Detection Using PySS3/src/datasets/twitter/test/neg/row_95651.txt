Things haven't ever gone well, and it seems as though the trend will carry on longer than I will.This is a throw away, obviously. I can't bring myself to post here with my normal username because I don't want my brother or sister\-in\-law to stumble upon this post. I don't want intervention, and I can't really deal with the thought of trying to explain this all to them without them thinking it's partially their fault. Except, it kind of is. 

I was raised poor. Poor enough to not realize exactly how shitty our living situation really was. With a mother who was bi\-polar, depressed, and had experienced childhood sexual trauma. A mother who spent the majority of her time in her room, curtains closed to block out the sunlight and wanting nothing to do with her kids for days at a time. Living with an uneducated dad who was the only one able to work, to provide something of value to his family. Even if it was for $8.00 an hour. Even if it was two jobs back\-to\-back for 16 or more hours a day. Even if rent was $900.00 a month and threatening to rise. 

I remember my dad sleeping on the couch in the living room a lot. I thought he was lazy and just taking up the room. My brother and I couldn't horse around and be loud. I resented that. But, no, he was working two full shifts just to keep our rental townhouse. He slept on the couch because our mom was so often depressed she would just want to be alone, and he obliged. She got to wallow in her darkened room and he got to sleep on the couch that was nowhere big enough for him. I didn't realize how sad it was as a kid. 

We, as a family, saw glimmers of hope and chased them down until they burned out and left us worse off than before. Failed inventions, failed jobs, failed careers, failed ambitions. I feel like we just failed and failed. My grandmother helped us out a lot. After my grandfather died, she had free reign of his money. And all she wanted to do was bail us out of one situation or another. It saved us. Time after time, it saved us. Finally, at 30\-years\-old, I still live with my parents because I can provide much more than they can. I'm keeping them afloat more than they could themselves when I was a child. We rent, it's expensive, but I don't want to see anyone suffer like we did years and years ago. I'm not even detailing half of the story, just rushing the details so that you guys have a very basic understanding of where I'm coming from.

Anyways, recently, my brother and I applied for a mortgage. Got pre\-approved, stupidly made an offer on a house without more to go on and I found out he has debt I never knew about. His wife is pregnant, so I took that leap at a house that would work and would be affordable, but it looks like it's going to turn sour and we are left with no real options. 

I busted my ass to save for the down payment, to pay our parents' bills, to bail my family out when they needed. But that debt looks like it's going to sink the offer, and I'll lose the $1,000 I put down to secure it, and I just am kind of done. 

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. They just keep getting worse, and every thing that goes wrong just builds on it. It never used to be this way. I was always happy and helpful, but after so long of being everyone's pillar when you, yourself, need support, you just collapse. Or, at least I have. 

I'm tired of being desperate and being so relied upon that I feel crushed. I never wanted to kill myself, and I never thought it would actually get to this point, but I keep taking steps toward it. Everything falling through like this isn't just a step, it's a leap. 

I just don't think I have many days left in me. I sort of hope I don't. It's bittersweet.
