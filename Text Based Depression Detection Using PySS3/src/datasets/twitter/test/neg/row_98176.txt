I'm so hopeless[Trigger-warning: Self-harm]

I almost cut myself again the other day. I almost started cutting again. Me! I'm a grown-ass man! I'm 32 years old. Imagine how embarrassing *that* would've been. It's embarrassing enough with the countless scars I've got from all the cutting I was doing years ago. Having fresh cuts would just be... Oof. But I just need *something*. I'm going insane from not having an outlet for all this shit. I haven't cut in sooo long. Ugh. It would feel so, so, so good, though. I've stopped doing heroin, stopped popping pills, and stopped cutting. Bad idea. I should've at least saved one of those things. So I could do *something* when I'm as down/sad/depressed/stupid as I am now. I just feel so alone and hopeless.

I can't stop thinking about my little cut-kit. With my favorite knife and scalpel, band-aids, bandages, those strip-things to close big wounds. Mmmm. Big wounds. Open up my skin a bit. Let my flesh breathe. Say hello to the inside of my arm. And bleed. Bleed and bleed. It's so comforting seeing all that blood. And the intense feeling of... Of what? It's positive, at least. A **good** feeling. And the feeling of accomplishment when you manage to get a really deep cut. Almost as wonderful as heroin. Just almost, though.

I sincerely hope I'm not triggering anyone with this. I'm really sorry if I do. I just need to vent. Get it out of my head.

And don't harm yourselves, guys. It's really, really lame. And so addictive. Take care and have a nice day.
