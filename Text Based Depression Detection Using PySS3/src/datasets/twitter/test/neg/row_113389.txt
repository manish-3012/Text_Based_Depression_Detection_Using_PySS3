I'm fairly certain I just bombed my bio lab final. I feel like garbage. And I just don't want to hear the "I told you so" from everyone that thought I couldn't do it[get a biology degree.]It's my fault I'm not good enough. And I feel like garbage. I'm trying route out if it's possible to just end my life right now in the school bathroom but I don't have anything that dangerous with me. I stopped carrying a way to self harm around a while ago so now I'm stuck feeling like garbage and barely being able to cry bc I just don't know I can't get very many tears out
