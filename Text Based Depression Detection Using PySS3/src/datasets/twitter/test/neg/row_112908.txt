I want to be happy againI was once happy before, but now Iâ€™m over here just cutting my thighs, in my parents bathroom fucking crying. I wish I can stop. I want to be happy again. I want to have my old friends back. I want to be 15 again. What is wrong with me. No fucking wonder nobody wants to associate with me.
