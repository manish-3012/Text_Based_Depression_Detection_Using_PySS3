Seriously thinking about ending itI cant take the constant sadness and depression I feel anymore. College is making my life a living hell. Everyone I attempt to talk to ignores me and treats me like scum, even when being friendly. I sit in my dorm room all week until I go home and repeat the cycle the next week. My grades are falling because of my mental state. I don't know how much more I can take of these feelings of inferiority and worthlessness. Im a guy and all I do the whole day is cry. I don't know what to do anymore. I think this may be the end for me.
