Food makes me Hate myselfI've never liked healthy foods and I'm 14. I don't know how I've survived this long but I hate myself because of what I eat. I wish I didn't have to eat so that I didn't have to judge myself every time I ate. Sometimes I wish that a Heart attack would come and take me so I don't have to deal with this.
