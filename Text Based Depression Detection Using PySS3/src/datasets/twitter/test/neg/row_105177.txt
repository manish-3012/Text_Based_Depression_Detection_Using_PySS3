In the past 2 months everything has fallen apart and I feel like I'm shatteringEverything has fallen apart in the past months, I'm struggling making ends me. I'm having to ask on reddit for help just to keep floating. It's amazing how one thing can off set everything else, lost our income tax, water pipe exploded, and my health. People don't know bad things are in my life because I don't want to burden people.  My health is falling apart . I don't know what to do, I've been suicidal but I try to stop those thoughts because my dog and hamster need me, I can't leave them behind or my parents. But I just feel like I'm worthless, and a bad person.  I have PTSD, TBI, and bipolar my emotions are all over the charts. I post things on here and become scared I'm going to get bullied.

When is okay to say to hell with everything? Nothing will ever get better. I don't know I just feel like a million things at once.
