It's too late for me to call a helpline, can I talk to someone?I'm really struggling (like we all are).

I've been suffering with agoraphobia for 3 years now and it's getting rapidly worse. 

No therapist or DR can figure out the root cause of this and I'm stuck at home at the prime age of 20 having panic attacks pretty much every single moment I'm awake. It's gotten so bad I freak over the smallest things; I've had a tattoo on my wrist for 2 years and I love it but today I freaked and wondered why I ever did something so permanent.
Anyway... enough about my anxiety.

It's so bad that I'm getting these red hot flashes that are a mix of severe suicidal thoughts and panic attacks.
I wake up and I want to be dead. Every day I am thinking about it more to the point I've been thinking about planning it. I don't want to feel like this. Right now, right this second I want to just leave, I want to walk out my front door and throw myself at the train track down the road. But I don't want to die..... 
I keep opening a document to write a suicide letter and then closing it. I am so proud I'm closing it but it's getting harder and harder. This boiling hot feeling is getting more intense and in the same way I can't fight a panic attack, I'm not sure I can fight this much longer.
Everyone is asleep here in the UK and I just feel so hopeless, I want to wake my parents up and scream at them and beg them to help me but what can they do? 

I'm on SSRI and beta blockers. They were both kind of helping for the first maybe 2 weeks and now neither of them are doing anything to help. I know my doctor is trying and trying but I can't keep trying much more. I am so damn tired of all of this and I don't want to live in this constant state of fear all the time. A state of fear that I don't know how to battle no matter how much I try.
