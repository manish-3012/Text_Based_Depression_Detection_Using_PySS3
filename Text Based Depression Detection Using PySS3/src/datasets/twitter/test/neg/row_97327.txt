Iâ€™m not okayI feel like Iâ€™m being punished by the world. I try but maybe not hard enough. I just donâ€™t know how to cope anymore. I feel like I drowning in bad things and everyone keeps telling me it will get better but itâ€™s only getting worse. 
I was doing alright after a terrible move back home from abroad. 
I had dealt with the problems and met a great guy. I donâ€™t deserve such an amazing human how constantly tryâ€™s to help but ultimately is helpless with my problems. He stays by me. Then I got laid off in December and it all came crashing. I am still unemployed because my depression and anxiety are keeping me from doing the things I need to do. I see my psychiatrist but she keeps changing my meds so I donâ€™t think they are working. I canâ€™t sleep and Iâ€™m eating all wrong. Iâ€™m chronically ill as it is which makes everything even harder. Iâ€™ve tried to get medical help but all the doctors keep sending me in circles. Iâ€™m scared of everything which is making both my mental and physical states worse. 
Tonight was really the last straw. I am getting my masters through an online university and my computer is toast. My wonderful boyfriend is loaning me his for the time being but I need to work to save up to get a new one. I know this but it just seems futile. Everything feels like a waste and I shouldnâ€™t keep going. 
Iâ€™m tired of being sick. 
Iâ€™m tired of not sleeping. 
Iâ€™m tired of everything I touch breaking. 
Iâ€™m tired of letting people around me down. 
Iâ€™m so tired. 
I donâ€™t want to keep going and besides my love Iâ€™m struggling to find a reason to keep going. Iâ€™m just so broken at this point I want to give up. The worst part is that I am too cowardly to kill myself. 
Please help. 
Why am I being punished for being alive?
