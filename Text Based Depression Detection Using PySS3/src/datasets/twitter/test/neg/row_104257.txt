I'm Lucky I Don't Own A GunIt seems Reddit has everything, huh?

I'm a recent college graduate. Got to sit at home and watch the generic "Congrats Class of 2020" posts roll by while thinking nothing but, "If you graduated on time in 2019, you would've had an actual ceremony."

I wasn't even at home. As a matter of fact, at this very moment, I'm sitting in a motel with my mom and brother - unemployed and miserable. My younger sister was kicked out by my mom, and yet she has a whole job and a driver's license. I'm just shit. 

Aside from problems with seizures, nothing is stopping me from getting a job. And I'm applying every day, but every job has shut me down. The one opportunity I had post-graduation to immediately do something with my Bachelors in Theatre was thrown out the window immediately. Every time I open my mouth to someone about "good news this" and "possible opportunity that", the shit gets shut down in a matter of days due to one thing or another.

I don't have friends, just guys who occasionally sleep with me. Everyone has time to wander their phones, but can't respond to texts? Maybe I'm not cool or hip enough to get it. Which is why I'm always alone, no one to talk to. Complaining to the one platform I've had negative thoughts about because of that "incel" stuff (along with the occasional ignorant, completely out of left field rude comments in the subreddits I was a part of). My "best friend" left me before we even graduated, literally dropping me for a freshmen she married in the span of a year and a half.

Something is obviously wrong with me. People who come into contact with me know I'm pleasant, and yet no one wants to invite me anywhere. I stopped using Snapchat because every "friend group" I was "a part of" kept getting together without me. They don't want shit to do with me, which only encourages more antisocialism than before, and yet I'm looked at as the person not reaching out.

I just want to die. Simple as that. I cry often. Too often. Even that's a lie; I tear up often and almost easily, and yet I can't get myself to cry for long. I just keep faking it, probably because I don't want to be acknowledged by my family. All I want to do is take the easy way out, with a gun to the head. But knowing my shitty luck, I'd manage to survive.

The one thing that keeps me from going out and just getting shot or running into traffic is my family. That's my excuse. Even though everyone's a mess, we still need and depend on each other. I don't want them to grieve.

Other than that, I would've been gone long before I even graduated - intended date or otherwise. And no one outside of family would bat a fucking eyelid, maybe "oh, the chick with the big boobs? yeah, she was funny". I'm just sick of my life.
