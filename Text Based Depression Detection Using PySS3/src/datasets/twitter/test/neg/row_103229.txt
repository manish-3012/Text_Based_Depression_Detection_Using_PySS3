Iâ€™m constantly thinking about ending itIâ€™ve been constantly thinking about suicide for everyday now and just ending it all. I recently moved to turkey for my education (hard to live in the country where I came from due to expenses rising a lot), sadly turkey isnâ€™t that open to the English language so i couldnâ€™t find a university that teaches in English. So I was forced to learn Turkish and then enter a university in Turkish. I struggled and still struggle understanding 90% of what theyâ€™re saying because accents exist and they talk really quickly. Iâ€™m a man of self-development and self control. So I tried my best but it was all down the drain. I started not going because Iâ€™d tear up in the middle of the class because of the entire situation. I come from a Muslim family which means suicide is absolutely forbidden but I just canâ€™t get it out of my head. Even moments where Iâ€™d openly say to myself â€œman suicide doesnâ€™t seem that badâ€ i wish to educate myself and develop myself but itâ€™s impossible for me in this situation and itâ€™s killing me that Iâ€™m wasting years from my youth. Sadly my financial situation doesnâ€™t help me so Iâ€™m unable to leave the country aswell (I have a residence permit) but because of my nationality Iâ€™m also facing racism from the Turks (Iâ€™m Palestinian) not everyone but the majority is against Arabs.. for obvious reasons. I called the suicide hotline once and hung up because I thought they couldnâ€™t do anything about my situation. I feel absolutely nothing towards anything, even the good moments make me depressed, i prefer being alone all the time, I hate talking to anyone about anything, it feels so empty to live nowadays and especially in these times where university is everything... I wish to find a job but itâ€™s impossible because I live in a city where jobs are basically dead.. (trabzon) .  Sorry for this but I felt that I needed to say this to anyone and anywhere..
