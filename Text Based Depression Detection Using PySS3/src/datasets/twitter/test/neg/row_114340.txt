Feel like a piece of shit.Not gonna do anything. I know that. But i want to. So bad. And I feel like such a piece of shit. Depression and school are kicking my ass. How am I ever going to handle college or being an adult? Why am I not happy when I have a boyfriend that is amazing? Why am I such a worthless person? I just don't fucking understand.
