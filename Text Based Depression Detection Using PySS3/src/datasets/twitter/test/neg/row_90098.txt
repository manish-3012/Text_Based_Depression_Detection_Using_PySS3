I'm not suicidal, but the oppositeBack in December there were about 5 or 6 days where I was severely suicidal and my wife only knew about maybe 2 or 3 of those.  And the extent of how suicidal I don't think she fully grasps.  Since that time I made the effort to seek therapy, who then pointed me to a psychiatrist.  Anyway, I've been going to her since mid-February and given 1mg of Risperdal and 100 mg of Zooloft a day.  _x000D_

The feeling of suicide has gone away, but I have an intense amount of 'not caring' going on.  This has especially impacted my performance in school, yet I've been creating music way more than usual.  For the most part I'm okay, but I often feel like I'm in an emotional grey zone (not overly happy, not overly sad, right the fuck in the middle of meaninglessness)._x000D_

So, I feel this way, I am NOT suicidal in the least.  So, because of this I have this strong desire to sit and watch things around me fuck up.  Not enjoy watching it, but let it happen and not giving a fuck whatsoever.  I think this is harsh to the people around me who care, so now I have another strong desire to cut ties and move somewhere, start a new life, and be sure those I associate myself with are fully aware that I do not give a fuck whatsoever.  I wanted to die before, I have tried and failed.  This is the birth of a super villian.  THis is how it fucking happens.  I don't want it, but that's what it is._x000D_

I can't believe this is me: (
