Sad boi hours rantIg take down this rant if not appropriate for this sub.

Honesty, I plan to end my life in 2 years. I got nothing to live for at this point. My family would mourn for a few days then go back to normal, they'd be happy knowing the fuck up of the family is gone. I'm just a dissapointment, failure, I have nothing going for me, im the outcast, the one nobody ever liked, the one who never had any REAL friends, I have trust issues. All I do anymore is go to bed hoping I pass in my sleep and wake up wondering why I didn't, along with my mental state and SH issues, I cant see myself living past 20.

Some say suicide is "selfish" and "it gets better, give it time" When? When does it get better? When will I stop wishing I could die? Or even "I'd miss you, stay for me" no, why should I stay and suffer for your benefit because you'd be happy if I stayed? And then theres, "help is available (instert suicide hotline number)" along with "you have no need to be depressed/suicidal" just no. I know no hospital, ward or therapist could help me at all.

I've held off telling people how I feel because I know they don't really care or want to know. I haven't been cared about for a long time. I lost interest in things I used to like doing (mainly drawing), I barely have ambition for anything anymore, life is a tiring job and I'm almost ready to clock out forever.

I tried small things to improve my life, but why commit to something when im just gonna be gone? I see no point at trying anything anymore. At this point nothing can change my mind. I won't make it to my 20th birthday, I plan to go on the night before. Not gonna say/go into detail about how I'm gonna do it either. But it's gonna happen.

Anyways, end of my sad rant (now through a blur of tears) I must say now I'm gonna go try to do some shit to fill the rest of the night ig.
