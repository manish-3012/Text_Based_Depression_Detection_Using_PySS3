I'm in limbo with the only real interpersonal relationship I've ever had, and it's killing me.I'm sorry if you see this R, but I needed to get this off my chest to somebody I don't know, somebody who will give me sound advice.

I met a girl over the internet about 2 months ago to the date through a mutual friend, whom she has broken off contact with and I am in the process of doing the same because of her abusive nature. This girl and I hit it off right away, through mutual interests and similar senses of humor, even though we live in different (but neighboring) countries. I helped her break contact with the mutual friend (whom she was much closer to) and through that we opened up to each other, starting with her, and then myself sharing something in return. This led to, especially in the past few weeks, us developing feelings for each other. Even before that, I felt as if I was closer to her than anybody I ever had been before, it was like a magnetic attraction, not necessarily in a sexual way, but a pretty pure one. In so many ways our lives had mirrored each others. In all honesty, in the first month and a half I knew her, I would have probably considered her one of my best friends, definitely my single best friend near the end of it. That's when the feelings started. I won't gaslight her by sharing her personal trauma here, but needless to say we both have quite a bit of it. Personally, I was born into an unloving family who really couldn't care less whether I lived or died. I got dumped in to a couple of different foster homes, but the worst one was when I was seven or so. There was an awful woman who would take me down into her and her husband's basement and hurt me, mentally, physically, and occasionally torture me sexually. Thankfully, very little physical damage was done, but I'm left in a state where I find it relatively difficult to be turned on by women, naked or otherwise, even though I'm straight. She on the other hand, has trouble trusting men, and with relationships. We've been skirting around the idea of a relationship for the past week or so, with things feeling immensely different from day to day, but the balloon finally popped last night. We sat down and had a long talk, and we agreed that the best thing for both of us was to not be in a relationship. She says she wants her feelings for me to die out so we can go back to being friends, and I kind of wish mine would go away too. At the end of the night, we agreed not to voice chat for a while anymore since that seemed to be exacerbating the issue, and we tried chatting over text before I eventually said that it was all too raw right now, which of course she was fine with.

I'm in an incredibly conflicted spot and, if I'm honest, it's tearing me apart right now. Of course I would love to be in a relationship with her, she's a wonderful human being with an infectious laugh and eyes that could light up a room. But the fact that the thought of being with me makes her anxious and nauseous is just too horrible for me to think about. For a long time I thought of having a meaningful relationship as something above all else, I built it up to be this gargantuan thing that I couldn't live without. At the end of the day, I really love her and I want what's best for her. Even if it means being away from me permanently. Right now there are so many aspects to this and so many feelings floating around in my head that I feel like I'm looking at the situation through a microscope and flicking around helplessly, focusing on one tiny thing at a time but so far from seeing the big picture. There are a lot of questions I could ask in this thread, some of them incredibly selfish and short-sighted ones like "How do I convince her to give me a shot?", or maybe an entirely selfless one like "How do I make her happiest at any cost?". Right now I just want to know how to make myself feel better about this. It's been 2 days I've been feeling like this since I knew the talk was coming, and since it's happened my stomach feels like it wants to burst out and I can't stop my heart from thumping every time I think of her. What if she decides she doesn't even want to be my friend anymore? What if this, what if that- I just wish I could stop myself from hurting and gain a little perspective. To be honest, I don't have that many other friends and I don't want to go back to living an unloved existence. If she left me entirely, I don't think I'd have anything left worth living for. I just... I just want my friend back. People are my whole world, and I've been abandoned so many times before. I just don't want to be left alone again. I'd do anything.

The worst part is, I don't have anyone to talk to. I've never really been able to open up to therapists about anything other than my anxiety and this is far beyond that. She's the person I would have gone to about something like this, but obviously I can't do that. I just want to feel okay again without pushing all of this down and pretending I'm okay for the millionth time.
