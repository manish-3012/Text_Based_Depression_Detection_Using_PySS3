I don't feel like a human being. Does anyone else understand?I'm 26 (27 in about 3 months) and I don't feel like a human being. I have bipolar disorder, and have had depressive episodes and lots of anxiety for most of my life. I'm a failure in my career...I'm back living with my parents and working part time because I'm having trouble coping. I've had this nagging feeling always that I am not a person...like I'm extremely subhuman and I'm always shocked that people like me or want to be around me (when they do). I've never had a romantic relationship. It's like, when I was a kid (I'm talking about as early as 5-10 years old), I would consciously think other kids were "people" but I was not human... and I would hate myself for it. As I grew older, I felt that i don't deserve my friends, or praise from people, or what ever and always assumed that anything I earned in life I earned because people feel sorry for me.

I'm almost 27 and I've never had a romantic relationship of any sort because I'm terrified. I don't even know how I'd go about it. I'm so alone that I can't stand it. 

I hate myself so much...I wish I could kill myself. The anxiety and self-hatred is just too much, and I don't see an end to it. I'm never going to be able to do any of the things I want to do.

At my age, I am not on my own two feet, I don't have a steady job, I live with my parents, I've never had a relationship, etc. I feel like a leach on this world. I don't see the point of me being alive. People tell me that I have potential, but it's a waste. I'm a basket case and I think that I'd be doing myself and the world a favor by killing myself.
