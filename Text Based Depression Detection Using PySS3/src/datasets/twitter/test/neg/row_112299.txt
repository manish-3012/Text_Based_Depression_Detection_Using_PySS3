I need to end this soonI'm so tired of everything. Everyone leaves me no matter how hard I try to be a good friend or girlfriend or whatever it's never enough. It feels like it doesn't matter if I'm here anymore and my only friend is probably so sick of hearing me crying and she'll probably be leaving me soon too. Every day a vivid image of me blowing my brains out pops up in my mind. At night I get the urge to down all my pills. I feel myself reaching for them constantly but I stop myself. I don't know why I stop myself. I have no job no high school diploma no driver's license and I'm fucking 20 and I'm trying so fucking hard to get all of these things but the pandemic has made it nearly impossible for 2 out of 3 of those things to happen. I feel so fucking useless and worthless 
The love of my life left me for someone else 
My friends have all abandoned me 
I'm starting to push away family as well because nobody can stand being around me anymore 
I used to be so happy and fun to be around but now I don't even want to leave my bed I just want to die I want this pain in my heart to end I want it all to stop god I need it to stop.
