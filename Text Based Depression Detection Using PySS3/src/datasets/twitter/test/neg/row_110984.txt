I've been contemplating suicide lately.I posted this on the depression subreddit, but I want to discuss my feelings on this sub to see what people here have to say.

For the past few weeks I've been debating with myself whether or not I should just end it. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but while in the past I would have pushed them away, now I'm welcoming the thought.

I'm losing my will to live at an alarming rate. I don't think I'm meant to ever be truly happy in this world. My life sucks and is absolutely miserable right now and it might get even worse as the reality of being homeless is crawling closer and closer.

I need to be realistic with myself. My life will never improve. I'll never have a career, I'll never have any tangible skills nor talents, I'll never have a decent social life, a girlfriend, my student loans will never go away, &amp; worst of all, I'll never get away from my crazy ass mother.

Suicide is becoming more realistic as time goes on. Life is completely bullshit and is just way too fucking hard. Everyone tells me about how it's possible to turn your life around, but they fail to recognize the luck others have had in doing so which I lack.

The one thing that's comforting about suicide is the idea that if things ever gets too bad, I can always use it as a last resort and stop the pain. I'm going to die die one day anyway so what's the difference if I do it early, especially considering I have no future anyway?
