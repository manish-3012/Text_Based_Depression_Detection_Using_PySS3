Please Dont Give UpIf you can keep your head when all about youÂ Â Â 

Â Â Â  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,Â Â Â 

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

Â Â Â  But make allowance for their doubting too;Â Â Â 

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Â Â Â  Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,

Or being hated, donâ€™t give way to hating,

Â Â Â  And yet donâ€™t look too good, nor talk too wise:


If you can dreamâ€”and not make dreams your master;Â Â Â 

Â Â Â  If you can thinkâ€”and not make thoughts your aim;Â Â Â 

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

Â Â Â  And treat those two impostors just the same;Â Â Â 

If you can bear to hear the truth youâ€™ve spoken

Â Â Â  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

Â Â Â  And stoop and build â€™em up with worn-out tools:


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

Â Â Â  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

Â Â Â  And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

Â Â Â  To serve your turn long after they are gone,Â Â Â 

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Â Â Â  Except the Will which says to them: â€˜Hold on!â€™


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,Â Â Â 

Â Â Â  Or walk with Kingsâ€”nor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

Â Â Â  If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

Â Â Â  With sixty secondsâ€™ worth of distance run,Â Â Â 

Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it,Â Â Â 

Â Â Â  Andâ€”which is moreâ€”youâ€™ll be a Man, my son!
