I used to be afraidThat thinking about what would happen if I kill myself. The permanent presence of darkness and the things I would never see or experience anymore. 

Hell, half of me imagines waking up in the hospital. Would things change then if that happened? Clearly not. Well, things would have changed 'cause it means I failed killing myself and in turn a permanent damage on myself. 

But now? I'm not afraid. I feel happy actually. I'll do it April 10, Tuesday. 3 AM.

Already talked to my best friend. Said my goodbye, she suspects I was gonna cut her off again. That's good, but it's sad since she said sorry she doesn't open up to me but might say it someday... I won't be there anymore. 

I've thought of stabbing myself in the guts. So I really won't have reasons to survive. 

Why I'm doing this? Since I've got such a perfect life? I don't know. Maybe I'm self-destructive. Maybe I can no longer live with my anxiety. Maybe I can no longer live feeling nothing. Maybe I've lose the purpose of who I am. Maybe because i've ruined my friendship with my best friend. Maybe i'm done being a burden to my parents. 

Maybe. 

Only problem is, it would have been nice though. To see what would happened after I died. I'll make a post again, but for mow i'm gonna make the most of my Sunday and Monday.
