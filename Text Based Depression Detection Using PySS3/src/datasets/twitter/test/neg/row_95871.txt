I messed upA guy was entering into a personal conversation with a friend of mine. I asked him not to intrude but he still insisted that he wants to stay, and I cursed at him and raised the middle finger on him, he got mad and started swearing at me and my mom, dad and whole family. He made fun of me and I accepted it and I just broke and started a fist fight with him. Things got heated and now I am in the blame, I just feel dumb and stupid because this little shit got on my nerve. My mom blames me for raising the middle finger and now labels me as a slut and that I act as a boy. I just want to slit my wrist and die. I wanna kill my self.

I am crying uncontrollably and just want to end it please somebody out their help me I just can't take it anymore.
