you donâ€™t care about meeveryone always says â€œare you ok?â€ or â€œwhatâ€™s wrongâ€ but we all know you donâ€™t care. i literally can feel the annoyance coming through the screen. i feel like only one person actually cares about me. i honestly want to get rid of all my friends besides this one person. i wish i could do that. but then iâ€™d loose them too. they wouldnâ€™t be able to take enough of their time to me. they have their own friends. i feel so ungrateful because they care about me but i still am sad. jesus this sounds so lame. sorry to whoever read this. crap iâ€™m so sorry iâ€™ll just stop typing hereâ€”
