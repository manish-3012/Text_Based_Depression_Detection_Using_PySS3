Im sorry.Im sorry but i gave it all and it wasent nearly enough.

I thought i was stronger than this, after all I am only fucking 18 and had to live in 3 countries, over 10 cities and move school a good 15 times. When i was 8, I had to live in a room with my family of 5 for exactly a year, 6 months and a few days and only allowed out for a few hours on a saturday and i managed to survive. I managed to survive never ever belonging anywhere, always being a fucking outsider but then when I was 14 I met a girl. We were together for almost 4 years but 3 weeks ago a day before valentines day she left. I was going to take her to london for the day. but she left. 2 days later she jumped in bed with a 26 year old with a baby. I cant handle it anymore. I just cant. Im going to leave this on my screen, to her I want you to know i loved you more than anything. Im sorry. I wish you didnt do that. To my family, Im sorry. I always messed it up and made your life harder, I dont want you to be upset, Just know that I wasent strong enough. I deserved it. and to my few friends, I know you were all fed up with me as well. After all recently I was not included in a single one of your plans. So live happy now. Im done here.
