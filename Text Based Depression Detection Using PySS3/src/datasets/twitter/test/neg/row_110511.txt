Nothing has helpedI don't want to get into the details but this is basically whats up:

*im 15, turning 16 in 12 days


*im a guy


*I live in Germany on a military base(dads work) have been traveling every 2-3 years


*I have been depressed ever since I remember (around 6 years old)


*It hasn't been very bad until around 2 years ago, when I wanted to kill myself


*I cut myself a year ago(no stitches or anything) and I went to the states, went to a mental hospital for a week, then flew back to Germany


*I am taking meds


*I am seeing a therapist every week or more


*I think about suicide each and everyday (since last year.)


*there is nothing majorly wrong with my life, which is why everyone is so puzzled to think I would want to kill myself. also the reason everyone thinks im doing this just for attention


*this is like my 4th post in this subreddit over the past year, and nothing has helped. I want to die so bad

*please help
