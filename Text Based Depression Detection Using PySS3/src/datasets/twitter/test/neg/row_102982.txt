Untitledhi, 

if you dont have time dont read this. I'm a 17 yo guy who has lived in more than 8 different countries and everywhere i go all i do is cause pain to those how are around me. I have been bullied from I was 1st grade. I have thought about killing myself many times but never did it because i thought things would get better,, and it did for a while... I finally got a girlfriend. I was so happy for a while... until i suddenly felt an urge to break up with her... THen I hurt the only person in the world that I loved so much and it's been weeks. I just dont know what to do anymore. No reason to live. No reason to fight on.....

I'm looking for a reason....

srry for this stupid post
