Iâ€™m opening my heart here as a last resource to save myself and have the will to keep going on.I never went to a doctor to see if I have depression or something else, my mom seems to have depression but also never went to a doctor to actually be diagnosed. Stoping to think for a while, we seem to suffer from the same thing: lack of romantic affection. I feel good about myself most of the time, I have a great job, a great career, good friends to hang out, I know stuff I like doing to make me happy, successful hobbies and parallel projects, but, a recent event in my life has made me really miserable even though I seem to have it all. I met someone last year and we had it really awesome, she was the love of my life, someone truly incredible, that cared for me for real and was there to support me. It was a really intense connection but after some time we stopped getting along so well, lots of fights, misunderstoods and all of that. We eventually broke up and I tried to move on with my life, it seemed to worked for a while but I started to miss her. She never did anything bad to me, even after breaking up she was supportive. After some time I was so desperate to have her back that I was writing walls of text, calling her, saying how I miss her and that I need her. It didnâ€™t work, she said that I need professional help and that I need to learn to love myself first. I get that we are not going back but I crave for a second chance so much, I feel like I could have been better to her. I canâ€™t move on and this is killing me. I feel like I fucked up forever and  thereâ€™s no fix for that. She says I donâ€™t know how to be alone/single and this is actually true. I crave for romantic affection and when not getting it, I get really depressed. Not only that, Iâ€™m actually afraid to start new relationships and not be satisfied with my new partner and miss my ex. I also know I will fuck up again and get hurt again. I want to end it all because I donâ€™t want to suffer again because of my actions, I know thereâ€™s plenty of enjoyable things in life but they seem like nothing when weighing with the bad stuff. Iâ€™m this close to commit suicide. I donâ€™t want to start therapy but should I? Can a therapist help me? I want to move on and start seeing good things again and to be able to focus again, right know Iâ€™m about to go home from my job and I didnâ€™t do anything the whole day, I might get fired because of this.
