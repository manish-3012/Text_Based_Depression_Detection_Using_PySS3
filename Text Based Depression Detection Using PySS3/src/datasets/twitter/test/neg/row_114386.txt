A life worth losingI'm not articulate, so please forgive me. Brain-damaging psychiatric drugs, specifically Chlorpromazine and other neuroleptics, were forced upon me as a child for "moodiness". Moodiness caused by daily physical and emotional abuse and poverty. Shrinks love to pathologize everything.

I cannot tolerate social situations, even being around my extended family will trigger a panic attack. I withdrew school in the sixth grade because my mother claimed homeschool status. Bullshit! Though I continued my learning through the web. Sat for and passed the new GED battery in May 2014 with college-ready designation on my transcript.

I have yet to find an employer who is willing to interview me. I've submitted about thirty job applications (and followed-up with phone calls). Poverty, abuse, and Asperger's Syndrome have tarnished my hope for a better future.

As a nineteen year old, I feel like a f'ing leech living off my grandparents. Thank you for reading this rant. I truly appreciate your time.
