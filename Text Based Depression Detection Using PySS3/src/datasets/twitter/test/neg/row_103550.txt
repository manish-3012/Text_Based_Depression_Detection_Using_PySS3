World has gone to shit, my depression is back. It's 3 in the morning and I'm an emotional wreck.But it doesn't matter since I have no responsibilities at the moment so I just waste my time every day.

I love the combination of anxiety and depression I get almost every night now.

The only time I was happy in recent times is when I took a shit load of xtc in an attempt to feel something. It worked yess the feeling I have been longing for so long and then it was ripped away from and replaced by an empty feeling, a feeling you all can relate to. The feeling you get when you wake up at 12 and realise you're to unmotivated to do something, the feeling of pure sadness for no reason. And I can't seek professional help ether atm.


So now im considering doing the one thing that brings me happiness, for one last time...
