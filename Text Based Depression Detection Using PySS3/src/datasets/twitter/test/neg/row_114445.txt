Iâ€™m not okay.I donâ€™t really have a good enough reason for not being okay.. but thatâ€™s how it is.

Iâ€™ve been thinking of different methods of suicide for the last couple of hours, and I just canâ€™t stop crying.

I have reached out to a service that have always been amazing, but they donâ€™t offer crisis support (she suggested ED or my local crisis line - both a big no) and the grounding techniques she went through with me just arenâ€™t cutting it.

I just want to feel okay, instead of wanting to take myself out of this world all the time..
