A rapist deserves to dieShe was the younger sister of a former colleague. Both that guy and I had recently fallen from grace professionally.

I took her out. I got really drunk. We had a great time, dancing and carrying on.

I went in for the kiss. She obviously didn't want it. I didn't really want it either, at that point. But I said, "I'm going to rape you," and I grabbed her hair from the back of her head.

Within a few seconds, I realized it wasn't going to happen. I realized how awful the whole deal was. It took me a few more years to realize I'd hurt someone who had already been hurt, who had every right to be all about revenge and telling her Big Brother. I ran away like a pussy-ass coward. It took me a few years to accept it.

A few years later, her older brother sent a mass email to my friends and people I work with describing me as a "serial rapist."

I'd rather kill myself now than deal with any more of this shit. I am scum. I deserve to die. I just want to get this over with.

I just want to die, now.
