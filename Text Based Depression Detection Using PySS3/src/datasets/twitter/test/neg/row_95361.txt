My cries for help turned me into an outcast and no one takes me seriously I can't take it anymoreHello everyone , Never posted here but I guess this is probably the first and last time , I just can't take it anymore , I've been dealing with this alone for 6 years now always repressing it always hiding behind fake smiles and lying to myself that everything is ok 
the thing is I'm the kind of persons that rely too much on logic so I always try and comfort myself by lining all the solution and taking the best course of action ,so whenever i feel down I just find something to distract me and try to ignore the feeling or not thinking about it, but little did I know that i was just repressing stuff and it'll blow on my face someday 

Funny thing is it would've taken ONE PERSON , ONE FRIGGIN PERSON to stop me from doing it , but alas no one took me seriously 
last thing I needed was to be abandoned by my family
it's hard you know have your mom or dad tell you hurtful stuff
or scream their lungs at you whenever they see you 
because they think you're just lazy , while you struggle to wake up every morning because
it's hard to wake up every morning with the feeling of a sword piercing your torso  as if you were lifting the whole world on your shoulders
it's hard to be imprisoned in this black box alone cold 
everything is dark 
it's hard to breath everything is so heavy 
I've had it 
The only way I feel happiness is when I go to sleep because I can escape to my happy place away from my life

I'm sorry if this text is a bit long , I just wanted to share some of my story with you , I've decided to end it , I don't see anything I could do to get out of this , I'm not happy to become a quitter on life but it's not like it gave me a chance to recover.
and I guess living in a shit hole country doesn't help either
So I'm ending it 

But before I go I'll give you my last piece of advice , Find yourself someone , a friend a pal a family member even a friend over on the internet can save you , because Depression can be beaten , you just need to find that person who's gonna lend you a hand and pull you back up if you ever fall down , I in my case am a lost cause I didn't find anyone and it got worse the more I asked for help , no one listened , no one cared , no one answered
Don't feel sorry for me , but take my story as a way to pull yourselves back up
