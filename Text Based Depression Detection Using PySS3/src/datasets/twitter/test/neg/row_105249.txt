I'm probably getting thereTL;DR: My depression to go crippling levels after I finished university, about 2.5 years ago. Now my life is pushing me towards the edge, work to be more specific. 

I'm just tired of convincing people I'm not dumb basically. There's this one manager who keeps belittling my previous experience (basically I was an enterprise PHP engineer, now I'm an cloud java engineer, I never was a codemonkey) and its been going on for a year now almost. I even had an episode where I introduced a feature that was not yet needed and he laughed at me for overengineering things, in the end we ended up realizing we actually need it and I was right to make it. Its basically like that all the time - I go above and beyond, get laughed at and then we see that it was actually the right decision. Maybe the last part is not always, but I'm fairly sure I do pretty good engineering because my systems just work and my code is not bad. I do my best anyways, maybe I really am a shitty engineer though, who knows. 

Because I'm so depressed that there's literally nothing else in my life than work, I've started to become more depressed because of that situation at work. I've been drinking but recently got it under control. But after today I'm just not sure anymore. I'm just tired of fighting, its not healthy.

My whole life has been like that, someone picks on me all the time, but I fight back with politeness and stellar performance. It helped me in the past - i had scumbag professors in university and all I did was just again stellar work and they just stopped bullying me after they saw that I'm not a lazy idiot. Now it doesn't seem to work. 

I'm just asking myself whether I want to live this life if its gonna be like this my whole life. Its like the only things ahead of me is endless suffering and bullying. Come to think of it, maybe its what life is for most of people out there. Someone always bullies you. Whats funny is that I didn't get bullied in school, had a pretty healthy relationship with my classmates.
