Exit plan in placeI was hit by a car 30 yrs ago. They can heal with pins plates, casts almost everthing except your back. The car left me with 6 discs in various stages of herniation.  L5, L6, S1,S2 are the worst. I have a great surgeon who fused my neck, did epidurals, ablations. I was forced to concede I needed serious pain meds to cope. Time passes and the body gets older. Arthritis and osteoporosis sets in. I still had a life with as few pain meds as possible (I didnt want these meds, I hate the monthly visits, the humiliation of peeing in a cup) And now this opioid crisis hits. My meds were cut by 40% without warning. I was left with unrelenting, all consuming pain. I have no life anymore. All I have is pain. I had a good life, married 37yrs, first grandbaby, I had a future. But bec of the a$$ holes who used their pain meds after they got better bec they like t high I have to suffer. The idiots who who self medicate bec their life sucks.  And no one is standing up for us, legitimate patients. There are millions of us. Suicides are up for us, the forgotten. I can't do this pain anymore, I am in agony and I am so tired I'm just weary. So I have a plan, a perfect plan. Thank God my husband forgives me, but he is in so much pain over my decision. My daughter will be in pain after I'm gone. But God has forgotten me. I hope every drug addict dies in as much agony as I am in. Bitter, you bet. Their life sucked so they got high, get over yourself, you like the high, eat shit and die. You selfish people cost me my life, my future. Where are the people that remember there are legitimate pain patients? Who will speak for us?
