I want to off myself today.I had a violent eating disorder when I was 17. From throwing up to starving and not eating for days I found myself weighing less than 80 lbs I was 120-130 lbs before. Coming from an Asian background the pressure of looking a certain way got to my head. At the time, I've already had depression, anxiety, and PTSD. So trying to force myself to look a certain way took over my whole life and it was pretty evident for the people around me that I was slowly dying. 

When I was extremely anorexic I would eat a ritz cracker and 1/4 of a cup of white rice and coffee. *That* was my meal for the day. When I tried to fight my anorexia as a teenager and try to eat candy or a piece of chips I would try to throw it up. When I couldn't I would have thoughts of killing myself. Nobody cared in my life. My mom loved the weight I was at and thought I was naturally losing weight. I remember cutting myself so deep and literally slashing my arm to the point my best friend at the time had to come over my house and knock down my door and hold me down so I wouldn't try to stab myself. 

It became so bad every time I ate a cracker or rice or drank coffee I would want to kill myself because I wanted to keep my calories to 0. In my mind, killing myself was better than eating and gaining weight. I remember cutting myself because the pain was so great it made me not want to eat. I felt like if I was worried about the pain on my arms and legs then I won't think about eating. It was a vicious cycle. I'm 21 now and despite my rare intruding scuicidal thoughts I've gain my normal weight and it took a lot of self-loving. 

This past few months my boyfriend would mention my weight and say that "you use to be so adamant about not gaining weight." And I would tell him, "Well I was recovering from my anorexia and my head wasn't right so of course I was going to say that." But he keeps trying to make me prove to him that I really am body positive. 

You don't understand how hurtful it is when someone questions your body positive mindset. He's made me feel guilty about my weight. There's an obvious difference from how I looked when I met him and now but I'm not obese nor chubby. I've just gotten thick and grew a butt and breasts that I've ALWAYS wanted but he throws my weight in my face. 

Just last night he was drunk and we were eating out and I said something jokingly about getting fat and he blurted out in front of my friends, "well you're going to be fat no matter what." I played it off for awhile but my friends shockingly looked at each other and me and texted me to make sure I was okay because what he said was really rude. 

Progressively towards the night, specifically on the way home, he was justifying what he said by saying it's because I was eating fatty food (spinach enchiladas) and throwing my weight at my face. Obviously I cried because I felt so confident that night and I felt really beautiful. He continued to mention my weight and making me feel guilty about how I've obviously gained weight over the years and I told him, "I know I gained weight but I've learned to love myself over the years and I learned to love my body, something I couldn't do when I was 17 and it took a long time to recover." 

He just continued to throw his opinion of my weight telling me, "I don't believe you that you're body positive." And I kept trying to insist and prove to him I was. By the time we got home I was crying because I felt like I was questioning my self-image and self-worth again. I wanted to cry in his car instead of crying at home and wake everyone up but he told me to get out of his car and go into mine instead. I went into my car and he left me crying alone. 

The feeling I felt last night was the same feeling I felt when I was anorexic. That feeling of no self-worth. I didn't feel beautiful anymore. I didn't feel confident. I didn't feel like I was worthy. Those feeling were how I felt when I would cut myself and make myself throw up my food. I felt like teenager me. I felt that no one was here for me, not even my boyfriend, I felt completely alone. 

It took a really long time to recover from my eating disorder. Now I feel like I'm relapsing. I'm thinking about how much I hate my weight now and how I just want to quickly dispose of my weight even if I have to starve. I'm thinking about how I hate my physical appearance and want to change it. 

I thought I was strong. I thought I was better than this but I guess my boyfriend proved to me that I am weak. I am fat. I should feel guilty about my weight. I thought I was fully recovered from my eating disorder. I thought I'd never put myself in this situation where I would starve myself to slowly die. I feel so pathetic for relapsing. I feel like nothingness. 

I'm in bed right now. I've been crying since 4 a.m on and off. My boyfriend is at a baseball game most likely going to get drunk and he doesn't care about how I feel. I don't even thinks he feels bad and he doesn't even know what's going through my head. I've realized I have no one. I don't even have my boyfriend. I have no one and I've realized there will be no one who cares about me in this world right now. 

I want to off myself so bad so I don't have to feel like this because going through that traumatic experience again where I slowly die from starvation is a life not worth living. I rather slit my throat with my boyfriend's pocket knife and bleed to death right now instead of relapsing. 

I'm sitting here thinking about if anyone would miss me if I killed myself right now. To be quite frankly honest, no one will miss me. Not my family. Not my friends. Not even my boyfriend. He's at a baseball game with his friends right now and he knows the condition I'm in. He's just going to get drunk to forget. I've come to accept that I don't even have him. No one will miss me. You guys will read this and I'll just be another Redditor to you. 

I thought I was strong but I'm not. I'm weak. I really hate myself. I feel like this is the day I want to give up.
