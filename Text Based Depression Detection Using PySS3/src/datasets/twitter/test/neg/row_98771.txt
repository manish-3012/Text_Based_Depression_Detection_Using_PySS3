Man. I dont know what to do anymore. I've tried everything.Got a therapist, got a psyche doctor,  got all the help I can get, yet all they give me is even more ssris and tell me to just deal with my insomnia. Everything is crumbling beneath me. I am just dissapointed my parents more and more. I can't go to school. I cannot even force myself to. The people, the sitting in the classroom, I get bad anxiety attacks just fucking being there yet the stupid fucking doctor I have tells me to just keep taking my vistiril which doesn't fucking work. I really dont know what's next for me guys. Anymore school missed, I get in trouble, but I cannot bring myself to go. It's getting close to the time for me to check out.
