I hate everything.I've been super suicidal lately. Imagining all the sharp objects in my house while I lay in bed. I tried to distract myself with what I thought would be a fun post on Reddit and got shit on. Now I feel worse. WHY did I think posting on the internet would help? WHY am I posting this? I just wish I had the guts to actually do it.
