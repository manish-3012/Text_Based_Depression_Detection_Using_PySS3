Iâ€™m tried, Iâ€™m breaking.I donâ€™t know how long I can keep my emotions in check anymore. Week by week the wall that took me years to build crumbles bit by bit. And Iâ€™m scared that if I get close to anyone else theyâ€™ll start to crumble too. I just want to go quick not suffering slowly like this. It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts so fucking bad.
