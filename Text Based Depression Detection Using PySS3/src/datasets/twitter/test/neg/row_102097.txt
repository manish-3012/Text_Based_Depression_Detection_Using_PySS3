Please read.My entire life: 2 highly abusive, neglectful, extremely selfish, immature, semi-functioning alcoholic parents that fight almost every day. They abused my sister and me in every manner, except sexually. We were abused by our extended family when they watched after us. Side note: my parents would abuse us in front of other people, too, and seriously lessened their abuse of my sister when I was ~13. From ages 7 to 16, I was only allowed to see the few friends I had 2 times a week, if I caught my parents in good moods. I know very little about my parents. They know even less about me.

Age 3: My sister pushes me head first into the corner of a wooden table. The top right part of my skull is cracked open. 

Age 3: My dad beats the shit out of some dude for giving him the finger. I remember him coming home all bloodied and whatnot.

Age 4-5: No memories of this period whatsoever. Idk why. I imagine it's because life was alright and my experiences were all rather novel. Nothing occurred that really stuck with me.

Age 6: My teenage female cousin has me feel her up.

Age 7: My dad loses his first "good" job, due to his alcoholism.

Age 8: My only friend at the time moves away.

Age 9: I start to get bullied.

Age 10: My uncle, who would've taken care of me in case shit REALLY hit the fan, dies.

Age 11: My dad loses his job, again. I should add all of his jobs required business trips. It wasn't uncommon for him to be gone half of the days in a month.

Age 11: My dad beats me pretty bad, and sends me to school the next day, for the first time. I had to lie in order to protect myself. Child services began checking on me every month until I was a sophomore in high school.

Age 12: My parents stopped feeding me regularly. The neglect became very serious due to my mom's desire to get a job, so she could get more social interaction. The money from her work was not necessary. She divorced an extremely wealthy man a few years before meeting my father. My dad comes from wealth, as well.

Age 12: My mom, dad, and sister begin therapy together. They start spoiling the ever loving shit out of her because they feel bad about her "problems." For some reason, they didn't believe their actions had any impact on me until I was 18.

Age 12: My dad gets the job he's still working at.

Age 13: My only close friend at the time moves away (diff person).

Age 13: I begin to develop sleeping issues. Night terrors, sleep paralysis, ultimately leading to ~3-4 hours of sleep every night for many years to come. My parents said I was merely seeking attention when I told them about this. 

Age 14: My dad's 3rd DUI.

Age 14: I begin to do drugs, primarily Benzos/pain meds/Seroquel, in an attempt to cope with the extreme stress in my life and my sleep disorder.

Age 15: I attempted suicide because the daily abuse became too much. My teachers didn't believe me when I told them what my life was like, despite child services checking on me regularly.

Age 15: I had to get a job and work 30 hours a week to support myself, while maintaining straight As in all AP classes, due to the abuse I endured for doing any less than that.

Age 16: I begin smoking weed regularly.

Age 16: I attempt to tell my parents how seriously depressed I am. Their response, "it's your fault." I begin to console the suicidal thoughts with psychedelic drugs.

Age 16: I begin hanging around a really bad group of people. On the bright side, my involvement with them made the bullying stop.

Age 17: A meth addict threatens my life with a sling blade, forcing me to steal my dad's car and drive him to rob a store in order to steal &gt;$10k worth of electronics. I was never charged with anything. He plead insanity.

Age 17: My dad can no longer physically overpower me. The emotional/verbal abuse hits an all time high.

Age 18: My dad's 4th DUI. My parents finally take a cold, hard look at their lives and decide they've fucked up real bad.

Age 18: My parents agree to help pay for college, so I don't have to take out student loans (more on this later).

Age 18: I got raped as part of a frat initiation.

Age 18: I stop going to class, and begin sleeping ~18 hours a day. I stop eating. All of the money I had saved up is now gone. I end up dropping out of college,

Age 18: I witness my first death.

Age 19: I'm back with my parents. They're still verbally abusive. My mom still drinks. As far as I know, my dad doesn't. My sister is doing hard drugs now. I stop doing drugs. My parents allow my sister to physically abuse me.
If I do anything to fight back, they threaten me/physically harm me. My sister really fucks up my right hand, and spends a night in jail for it. That's all.

Age 19: My parents buy me a car (yay!), since they promised they would when I was 15.

Age 19: I discover my parents have been using my personal information to commit fraud with a neighboring 
family, for over a year. This is probably why they agreed to help pay for college. If I applied for student loans, this most likely would've come to light.

Age 19: I begin therapy, and attempt to get medicated. It doesn't help. I still just want to die.

This is a broad overview of the events in my life. Fill in the blanks with regular physical/verbal/emotional abuse. How do you move on from these things? How do you allow them to not consume your thoughts? My therapist says "just don't think about them." Well, I fucking wish it was that simple. Living with my parents probably doesn't help, but I currently can't support myself. Ya know, they've even been admitting some of their mistakes, but have since done very little to actually help me and change this cycle. Every bit of help they offer hurts me, too. Relying on support from the people that messed me up isn't easy. Especially since they still abuse me, and throw loads of cash at my sister. I watch them make the same mistakes OVER AND OVER, while I become a mistake. I feel powerless. I never have energy. I lost all of my decent friends after being raped, and won't go back to the old group of friends I had since most of them are fucking drug addicts now. I can't believe I was a STRAIGHT A AP STUDENT at one point, and now am this. I was the kid that was told "you can go to MIT 'n do whatever the fuck you want!" by all of my teachers, for most of my life. Well, look at where I've ended up so far, despite doing everything in my power to NOT end up this way.

I need something done. I need to get away from here, but I can't just leave. I'll die suffering in the streets, for I can't go to my extended family. I really wish I could, but my history with them prevents that. I don't want to feel this way, I want to move on in life, but ending these emotions holds prevalence over that. Anymore, my only option seems to be death, for I'm highly resistant to anti-depressants. Ketamine helped me in the past, but after about 2-3 weeks, I'd fall straight back into feeling this way. If it wasn't a dependency forming drug, I'd continue to do it, but I refuse to become reliant on Ketamine after seeing so many people become addicted to drugs. Please help me. I'm completely alone in this world, aside from my 2 dogs. Please help me.
