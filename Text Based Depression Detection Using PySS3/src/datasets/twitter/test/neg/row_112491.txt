The fuck is my life?Im 23 years old. Dad died about a month ago, the last time I talked to him was 8 months before he passed. . Shit still hurts. lately i haven't been able to sleep in 5 days. Mind won't stop assaulting me with regrets and cringe inducing memories. Just found out that my step dad and mom are getting a divorce today. I have an overdue ticket that I haven't taken care of due to laziness and deep depression. I hate how much work I do but am barely paid a thing. I hate people: Their promiscuity, Their greed, their selfishness. Their two-faced nature. 


I suck in social situations. My anxiety is through the roof at times. I couldn't get a chick, because even if I did, I don't want to get attached. I've been burned too many different times by various women in the past. So even when I want to date or even hook up with someone, I can't out of fear. 


And even when a girl is clearly showing interest, I don't know where to go from there. I look at her and think "she's probably a slut just like the rest of them. "
Which makes me disappointed.

Aside from women, my mental state is completely falling apart. 

All I want to do is drink and drink just to shut my stupid fucking brain up. 

I swear I must be autistic or something. I'm not normal and people can definitely tell. Communication with people is a skill I once had but somewhere down the line I lost my wittiness, and my love for talking to people. 

I don't know. 
There are so many misses opportunities, but due to my own stupidity I didnt capitalize on them.

I hate the world we live in. 

I don't want to participate anymore.
