My Last Day on EarthToday is the day, reddit. Iâ€™m going to finish this today. I have written letters to everyone I needed to say something to. Iâ€™ve written out a will as well. Iâ€™m all set and Iâ€™ve got it all planned out. Iâ€™m just waiting till my boyfriend leaves to go out tonight. He broke up with me on Saturday and says weâ€™ll never get back together and that Iâ€™ll never find anyone else. My ex probably doesnâ€™t want me back. I have no friends...basically no one else. Iâ€™m completely alone in this world. Iâ€™d rather not exist at all. I just released an album and itâ€™s all that I had. But itâ€™s not doing very well. No one is listening. No one ever does. 

Iâ€™m trying to decide how to spend my last day. Maybe Iâ€™ll go to the park. Get a good last meal from somewhere. If anyone bothers to read this, Iâ€™ll post before Iâ€™m about to do it tonight. Iâ€™m going to try to enjoy my last day on Earth.
