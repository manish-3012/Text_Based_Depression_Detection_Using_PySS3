I feel like suicide is my only option now after every parent figure in my life has become manipulativeAbout a year ago, I (18, F) moved in with my best friends (18, M) family because my family became homeless and although my family has found an apartment and moved in, I stayed with my friends family because my mother is extremely manipulative and was causing my suicidal tendencies to increase. I go to college in about a week and at this point I see them as a second family and theyâ€™ve expressed the same, even going as far to say that I can stay with them during holidays and such while in college.They have become one of my rocks and pretty much give me hope and security for the future. Last night my friends Mom got mad about us not wanting to go to a family get together thatâ€™s 3 days long, 2 days before I go to college. Their family regularly ignores my friend and I and makes the experience terrible for my friend constantly. She was drunk and texting all these horrible, manipulative things to both of us for hours and I had a full mental breakdown due to this and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s going to actually apologize and I really think our relationship is going to be so bad now that I feel like I may have to fully move out when I go to college. If I do this I will have no one to go to, nothing to call home. Iâ€™ve become so extremely suicidal because of this to the point where I donâ€™t even trust myself to sleep in my room alone. I truly believe if I have to move out completely I will kill myself.
