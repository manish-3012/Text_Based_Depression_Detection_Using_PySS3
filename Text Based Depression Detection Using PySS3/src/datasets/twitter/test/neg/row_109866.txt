I have no friendsWhat is wrong with me. 30 years old and friendless. I had one decent friend but I got annoyed always being the one to say lets chill and his wife was always present. And so I told myself I wouldn't call/text him and see if he contacts me. It's been about 2 months. So I guess it was never really there. I always knew. Just so utterly lonely. Waiting to die. Scared to die. Just so much hate inward and outward. Have a shrink he's busy till Tuesday. Will see how the weekend goes. Think I might just go somewhere. Idek how I manage to drag my ass to my shit of a job. So yeah. Sick of r/r4r or kikpals giving me nothing or a very brief smile. So yeah. Not expecting much. Feel like I've been in this funk for years with no hope in sight.
