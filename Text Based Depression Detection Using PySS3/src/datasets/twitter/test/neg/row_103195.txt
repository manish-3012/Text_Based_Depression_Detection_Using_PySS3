Nothing helpsSuicide hotlines are just people getting paid to read a script and pretend to care. Therapy is basically the same thing where hey just pretend to give a shit about you for a fucking check. Mental hospitals are pretty much hell and only make me want to kill myself even more. I wish euthanasia was more widely accessible so I can properly end my life without much pain.
