Panics and decisions I can't make.Okay. So this is going to get heavy so, proceed with caution. 

So I have fallen for this girl. Her name is N. N is fantastic and I love spending time with her and we attended the same university and I can see her whenever I want. Her nose is adorable and her heart is super open and she everything good about this world. She makes my heart flutter and I can't really look her in the eyes very much because it make me come appart due to part two. 

Edit: N does have cats and loves them and that's awesome! But I am extremely allergic to cats. Hives, sneezing, crying. All of it. 

Part two. I have a girlfriend of two years. Bestfriend. We've been through really shitty situations, and fight kinda often. She attended uni about 45 minutes away so we can only really see each other on weekends. I really do love this girl. But we have both discussed that we feel a constant need to talk to eachother because we can't visit as often and it makes me stay up later than I would like. Her and I can watch movies and fuck and just sit around together and be a couple. I enjoy her presence but it's very rare that I get to. She's not religious so o feel I have to go to church behind her back because she is so anti church. She know I go but it just feel bad when I do. 

Now comes my final issue. I have gotten it in my head that killing myself would make all of these issues go away. All this pain. I don't want to die I just don't want to hurt. I feel pressure to make a decision but I actually hate the idea of having to break up with someone. I hate loosing N as a friend. But, death seams like a good solution. I don't want to die. I just don't want to have to hurt anymore. I can't make this decision. Please anyone if you can give me some help.
