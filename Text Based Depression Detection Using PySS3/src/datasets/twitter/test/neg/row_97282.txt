sometimes i'm overcome with an intense desire to formulate a plan to kill myselfi hate typing this out because that makes this feels more *real* and i've always just kept my "suicide thoughts" to a very vague, bare, abstract minimum. and i mean, i know i'll never kill myself, right? i just keep thinking about it, and thinking about it, and thinking about it... 

the other day, i realized that i can't see myself married and with kids because i've simply never been able to see myself alive for that long (which terrified the shit out of me because in a cruel way, i don't think i want to die. it's just, sometimes, living feels unbearable. and that's even crueler because i have been so painfully fortunate in many parts of life. i'm such a fucking shitshow)

anyways, fuck it, i'll take comfort in knowing that the internet void will swallow up this panicked ramble. unnoticed and easily forgotten, like i'd be now and after i'm gone.
