I'm so scared, and tomorrow I'm home alone and I'm almost sure that I'm going to do it.I'm always so scared, my main fear is that I'll need to go to the hospital. Every night and sometimes during the day I fear that I'll have a medical emergency and have to go to the hospital where they will run tests on me, give me meds that make me puke, make me wait in triage while in severe pain, give me meds for pain that make me vomit. I'm Terrified and I have schizoaffective so its amplified x1000 because I'm losing touch with reality. 



I want to get in my car in the morning, drive around the places in my small town that I won't see again, then crash into a tree going 70 mph without a seatbelt.
