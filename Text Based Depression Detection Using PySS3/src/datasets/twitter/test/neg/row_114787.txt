Today I'll put a bullet in my headAnd it won't change anything.

People will be hurt, but none I care about.

None that truly understood my demons. And didn't add to them.

I'm scared of what happens after death, but even these 18 years have been too much pain. And I'm simply not going to live a life of so much pain when there no love, no happiness and no healing in it for me.
