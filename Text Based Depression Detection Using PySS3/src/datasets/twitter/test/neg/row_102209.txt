Iâ€™m ok with thisIâ€™m not angry anymore. 
Sometimes, shit just happens, we make mistakes and suffer consequences. Or the consequences of othersâ€™ choices/mistakes. I accept this is my life, this suffering. Which is getting worse but I know I cannot alleviate the daily physical pain. Iâ€™m so tired of fighting it. I worked hard, I gave it a shot, I fought those treating me like a worthless piece of shit but to no avail. Thatâ€™s okay. It doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m worthless. But I do still suffer. Iâ€™m exhausted, depleted, drained. I have nothing left so Iâ€™m letting go. I will figure out how to go but Iâ€™m not afraid of death anymore. I want peace. Iâ€™m okay with not living this life, with R having thrown me away. I donâ€™t even sense that thereâ€™s anything out there in the world anymore. My vision is going and I have to lay down all day. My health...eh, I dunno. My body wonâ€™t take me out for a few years at least so Iâ€™ll do it myself.
