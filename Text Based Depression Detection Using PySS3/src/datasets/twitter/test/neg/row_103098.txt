I donâ€™t want to die, but I have no motivation to live anymore.Iâ€™m a 25 year old female. Iâ€™m currently unemployed and still living at my parents house. In this past year my life has just gradually gotten less bearable. I become addicted to gambling in September/October 2018, I was incredibly fortunate to have had a large win and walk away with 75k, however in the process I damaged countless relationships with family and friends because all I cared about was gambling. More importantly I destroyed the trust with my partner of nearly 6 years. Iâ€™m now 6 weeks clean and I feel no desire to gamble anymore. However I feel Iâ€™ve completely ruined my relationship with my boyfriend. He recently joined the Army and since then things havenâ€™t been the same between us. He was away for 14 weeks during training and this was really difficult for me. We got through it and now heâ€™s only away Monday-Friday but as he put it we arenâ€™t in sync anymore. He tells me storyâ€™s about the other â€˜ladsâ€™ going out drinking and sleeping around on the weekends and I honestly feel like he feels that heâ€™s missed out on being a lad and acting this way. I personally just feel a burden to his life now and he has no need for me anymore. 

My career path was to join the RAF and unfortunately failed the medical due to a heart murmur I knew nothing about. This was an incredibly low point in my life and I fell into a state of depression. I feel he didnâ€™t give me the support I needed because he was so focused on his career and himself. After over a years testing they found my heart was wired slightly different but shouldnâ€™t cause me any issues in later life. However nearly 2 years on and Iâ€™m still in the process of joining the RAF I just feel no motivation to continue with it. I feel no motivation towards life at all. The only strong, stable figure in my life is my boyfriend and now I feel like Iâ€™ve lost him as well and Iâ€™ve got nothing to live for. 

Like I said in my title, I donâ€™t want to die I just really havenâ€™t got the strength or motivation to live anymore, everyday is a battle that I donâ€™t want to fight. 

Iâ€™m not suicidal, I couldnâ€™t do that. I just want things to get better and everything to be ok again.
