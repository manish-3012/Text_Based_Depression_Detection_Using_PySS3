Hate my lifeIt's a long story, but I'll make it short:

Girl I love rejected me a year ago. I've tried as hard as I can to get over her, but I know these feelings will never go away, and she's never gonna feel the same way. It kills me on the inside and I don't want to live the rest of my life feeling this way and I think suicide is the only way out. 
Being ugly sucks :(
