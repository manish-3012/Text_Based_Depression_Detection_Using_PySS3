Why do I hurt everyone I know?I don't really know what to say, I also posted this in another sub. I'd like to talk to someone. I feel like everyone I know has been hurt by me somehow, I caused by parents to divorce, all of my brothers are scared of me, all my "friends" don't ever talk to me and I'm always the last person for them to talk to. I feel like a burden to everyone I care about, they'd probably be better off if they never met me. I'm done ruining lives because I exist. I tried this before when I was 14, but I ended up wussing out and getting put on drugs that fucked me up way worse than I was before. I don't want to die, but I know I make everything worse by just being here.
 I'm sorry, Mom, Dad, W, J, A, Angel, Maude, Matt and Cam. It'll just be another motorcycle accident, okay? Love ya guys.
