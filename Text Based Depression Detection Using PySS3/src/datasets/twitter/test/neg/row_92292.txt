why does anyone say it will get better? theyâ€™re all lying because they want you to stay around longer, and for what?i really fucking hate myself. iâ€™m a fat, useless, worthless, sorry excuse for a human being. i wish i hadnâ€™t backed out of my suicide attempt so long ago. i held a knife to my stomach today but i didnâ€™t have the guts to do it. my presence here is unneeded, no one even wants me here but i still opt to keep fighting and i donâ€™t think i can anymore. iâ€™m fighting a war i will never win. i keep spiraling down into a deeper depression and itâ€™s swallowing me whole. i am nothing. i exist to bring myself and others pain. iâ€™m tired of hurting everyone, driving everyone away, yelling at everyone, being hated by everyone. iâ€™m giving myself to the 21st. i wasnâ€™t meant to stick around this long to begin with.

i lost my faith in the existence of a higher power long ago. i cried on my hands and knees and prayed for forgiveness, for someone to rescue me, but no one heard my cries. at this point i know iâ€™m just screaming into a void to set me free.

i canâ€™t feel anything.

the end is inevitable, i just want it to be sooner.
