I really need to talk about thisI've had a really bad time recently, and I'm unbearably shamed of myself. I've been silently suffering from a porn addiction and because I've found it so embarrassing I've been unable to find the courage to get help. Last night my girlfrien came across my internet history and is absolutely furious with me because I promised to stop watching porn. I feel humiliated on a level that is so unbearable, I feel like I can't get help anywhere and that people will judge me if i talk about it. I'm feeling like suicide is a very viable option at the moment and that I really cannot turn to anyone for help. If anyone could please help me in some way I'd appreciate it, I can't stand this.
