My life is going nowhere but downI'm in trouble financially with my school fees. My toilet broke down so my 1 m^2 toilet is now only 60x60cm to shower. Now I'll have to go the the library to use the toilet. I can't focus on my school work. I haven't even start on my school project that is due in 5 days. I'm not even interested in my course. I have my mom up my ass about praying for something I don't believe in. Did I mention that I have to fast? I am barely surviving and now the only thing I do is read and play games, which isn't productive what so ever.

My whole life I've tried being as nice as possible to everyone i meet. Watching every word I say so I don't hurt anyone. I've donated money to the poor every chance I get. And even after all my effort, the world seems to be getting much worse. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. In a couple years I'll have to give up 2 years of my life to the racist government that only cares about the rich while the people are getting left behind. They keep bragging about how everyone is equal but numerous study have shown that Singapore have only of the lowest social mobility in the world. The idea that I'm going to be in the same position as my parents kills me.

And while I'm trying my best to work on my studies, my sister dropped out of school and is now traveling the world with money my parents gave to her. My whole life I have been the second child and they could not make it any clearer.  

The only reason I haven't kill myself is because I'm a pussy. Fuck my life
