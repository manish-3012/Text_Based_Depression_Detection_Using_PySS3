First time seriously considering it.I don't think I have anything to live for. I have no friends, and there's no chance of me having a semi-attractive girlfriend. I'm not particularly ugly or anything, but I have a terrible personality. I'm clingy and have depression issues. I also suffer from delusions. I have no talents. There's a saying "Everyone has something their good at" (Not really a saying) but I'm literally good at nothing. I'm average intelligence, can't sing, dance, draw, or anything. I have shitty grades, and no matter what I do I always struggle. I'm forced to be in special ed so I don't have to be held back every year. My family's terrible too. I guess I shouldn't complain about them. They don't beat me or anything. But no one takes anything I do or say seriously. I'm always forced  to draw the short straw. If a family friend wants to stay with us, I'M forced to change rooms (Normally to a smaller room or forced to share a room with the youngest (He's 8, I'm 17.) Even he has a bigger room. Even though I'm the only one with any computer skills I have the shittiest computer in the house. My parents bought my brother a computer after a week of his asking. I asked for literally years. They still haven't gotten me one. I had to pull this one of a curb side for free. My mom treats me like crap, and is crazy. Anytime I try having a serious conversation with her she either ignores me or gets mad at me. My dad, anytime I try talking to him he just shrugs me off with a "Cut out your depressive emo Bull shit.". My older brother is a giant compared to me. I'm 5'10" and 130, hes 6'3" and 160 of pure muscle and he beats me. Any time I do something he doesn't like he starts crying and throwing a tantrum and punches me, multiple times. My parents let him. If I so much as dis agree with something my parents ground me. It sounds like a hyperbole but it's true.
I'm doomed to always be single, friendless, jobless, and fail at every ones expectations. Waking up in pain every morning knowing whats in the future but not being able to do anything about it is killing me. I can't take it anymore.

If you can find ANY thing I should have to look forward to in life PLEASE comment. Save my life internet.
