Is holding a knife to my throat occasionally not normal?Sometimes when i feel down ill put a knife or scissors to my throat sometimes for a while sometimes for a second sometimes i like to put pressure on the scissors and squeeze my throat a bit and visa-versa with knife, i hate pain i could never cut myself but i got alot of fucked up shit and mental health issues that either people think i over exaggerate when i say im sad or got anxiety but nah im not usual deppressed but i just do it when im sad thing is i couldn't kill myself the thought of the pain before death puts me off, but im not afraid to die i just wanted to know if its normal for people to do this? I've done it way to many times to count for probably past 3 years.

Also side story so i've got insane anxiety like cant even go to shops bad but my doctor just keeps giving me same anti deppresants even though i say they arent helping i need help but because i told a pyschosis physc that i did drugs and opened up about my usage and said how i tried to OD on heroin they refered me to a drug and alcohol program rather than something useful and i think the reason i don't get good medication that could actually help me is because i opened up about my past which is really fucking dumb in my opinion... i've been told pretty much best thing for me is private psychiatrist issue is they are 450$ in Australia money i do not have. I just find it funny how because i opened up about my past i now have to keep suffering my hell of getting 0 help (I don't do drugs anymore been clean for 6-8 months since i tried oding on H other than bud and recently did PST because kinda given up and im 18 btw) 

But yer idk Australia has some dumb fucking restrictions with help i can see why suicide is popular with people my age.
