Hit my head on the door repeatedly out of frustrationIâ€™m honestly not 100% sure if I have a concussion or not. I feel nauseous af and my head feels like itâ€™s spinning. When I talk my sentences are a bit slurred as well, But nothing too bad as my sentences are somewhat coherent. I donâ€™t even know why I would do something that idiotic. I Definitely regret doing that. 

I guess what triggered my impulsive outburst was realizing that Iâ€™m going to die alone and no one will attend my funeral. That realization just hit me yesterday and I couldnâ€™t sleep at all. I havenâ€™t spoken to my family in years and the last time they spoke to me was just them wishing me dead and telling me how much of a failure I am.

To make matters worse I donâ€™t even have any friends, Not even online friends. I legit havenâ€™t talked to a human being in a year. I feel like Iâ€™m going insane. Iâ€™m 17 turning 18 in a few months and Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself on my 18th birthday, Or even sooner. Iâ€™m really hoping I die tonight from my head injury. I hope I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow.
