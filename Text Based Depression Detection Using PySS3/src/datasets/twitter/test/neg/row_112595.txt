Shotgun WeddingThe one thing they don't tell you about suicide...

No matter who's left
Or how you do it
Or what there consequences are

You won't care. 
You'll be dead. 

That's where I am right now.

I'm still here.

Because my rational mind tells me if I kill myself, my daughter will be sent out of state to live with a father who doesn't care about her, solely because he's biologically next of kin and happens to pay child support. My mother will then drink herself to death, blaming her life as what brought me down and not having her granddaughter to bolster her will to continue.

I knowingly hold the fate of three generations in the same shaking hands that currently grasp a Mossberg Persuader. 

Life
Death

Blink

Just once

And they're all in the same

We play God every single day without ever knowing it. We lightly touch our own life, never comprehending the cascading dominos around it.

And yet
Once all of the pieces have fallen

Who would even be left to set them all upright again...

And even if they did
Would they care?
