I don't knowI've struggled with suicidal depression for literally almost as long as I can remember, I'm talking way back like elementary school (22/f if that helps with whatever)
As a college student I feel my internal thoughts, my moods, my feelings about the world are so unstable. I'll swing between being suicidal and extremely depressed unable to function for months, then feel great and the most productive I've ever been for a few weeks, then maybe about a month of feeling absolutely nothing, feeling completely empty and devoid of any desires or dreams or opinions or ideas. Then the cycle happens all over again. I've seen a therapist for 2 years. Nothing come of it. I hated going to it every week, I just don't want to talk. Tried an antidepressant and it just made me feel like shit, and I didn't want to become completely dependent on a drug anyway. I go from despising literally anyone I see to just praying that anyone would text or give me some attention. I had a suicide attempt that landed me in a psych hold almost a year ago. I think about killing myself constantly. For the past few months, I've made some attempts that weren't serious enough to get me in the hospital but were more or less attempts either way. Back in November I had a belt that I tied around my neck and looped around a tall bed post and leaned a couple times to see how far I could go before that would be enough to kill me. Sat with my door locked with the belt around my necks crying just thinking about life and how much I wanted to just throw myself off the edge of the post to finally do it. Convinced myself not to, eventually. Right now I'm going through a period of numbness again. I feel so empty that I'd almost prefer the suicidal depression because at least I'd feel something. School is starting back up again and I'm so close to failing out. I have to take an extra course load just to make up for all the classes I missed and failed when I was depressed and couldn't get out of bed. My depression flares up the most during periods of stress in school. The more stress I experience and the more sleep I lose as I try to keep up schoolwork, the more suicidal I feel and the more my thoughts of suicide become attempts at suicide. I don't really know what the meaning behind this long post is. I guess I'm just tired of everything. Sometimes I hear something inside of my head, not a physical voice but almost as if an evil outside force communicated to me through telepathy (this happens when I'm starting to move from a period of emptiness to a period of depression I guess) that I'll be much happier if, next time I have thoughts of suicide, I don't tell anyone at all and keep these thoughts to myself. And lately, what this outside person has been telling me makes sense. I'll be happier without anyone meddling into my business. I don't know what to do.
