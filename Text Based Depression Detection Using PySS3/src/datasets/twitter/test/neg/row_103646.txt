If I had a dollar for every time I've been told to see a therapistI'd actually be able to afford seeing one. I find it funny that people think that going to see some schmuck is gonna help me in the long run and then are dumbfounded when I tell them I've already tried it. 

Then comes the questioning and assuming, "Well did you try? Did you take the medicine?" Damn, never thought about that it that way. Maybe me chugging an entire bottle of anti-depressants in a week isn't a good thing, don't need you to remind me.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I'm just so tired.
