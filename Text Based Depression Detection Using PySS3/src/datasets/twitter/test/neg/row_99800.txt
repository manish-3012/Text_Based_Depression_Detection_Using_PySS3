What did I do to deserve this?I'm in Hell. I'm depressed. I live in the middle of nowhere. Both my best friend and my significant other stabbed me in the back at different times in the past month. And then they replaced we within a week. I've got nobody now. My little brother attacks me constantly, and my father screams at me because I'm the oldest child. My mother hates me. I get called names anywhere I go. I've got no reason to live anymore. In the last month my life was finally going well, and then everything fell apart. What did I do for this?
