Visions of deathDoes anyone else think about death constantly? I am always finding myself picturing a bullet tumbling through my brain, ripping it to shreds. Or I picture a razor slicing open my veins.  Shit like that is always playing on the movie screen in my head.  Not elaborate scenes just whispers of the final money shot.  Blood draining.  pressure releasing from a hole in my skull. Constantly.  I bet it's been going just about full time for 30 years now.  I don't now understand how im still alive.  I hate myself and the.mistakrs I've made so desperately. That self loathing combined with the visions has led to a craving for death.  I look forward to it. Craving is a great word. If it weren't for fucking obligations it would be done.  It's to the point where theyre not enough anymore.  

I crave pain so much that I've taken to.putting wart remover on a qtip and shoving it up my nose.  Holy shit that felt good to get off my chest by the way.  My little stupid fucking weak cowardly shithead secret Jesus I'm a piece of shit.   Burns like a motherfucker but in a good cleansing way.  Thing is too that it has started to bleed pretty consistently.  Infected too by the way it has started to ache.  Way too embarrassing to go to a doc for that so looks like ive trapped myself into the lead Rx.
