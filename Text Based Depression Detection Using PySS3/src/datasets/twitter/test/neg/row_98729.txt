There isn't any true reason for living.Life is just birth and death with all the emotions in between. 

I haven't lived for very long but if this is all there is to life then I don't want to be apart of this anymore. Both of my parents have left me and I already feel alone in this large world. The rest of my family expects a lot of things from me and I know I can fulfil my dreams but sometimes life just feels like a burden. Sometimes this sadness overwhelms me, the fact that I don't have a part to play in my parents lives anymore, they both have other families and things to tend to. I'm not going to kill myself, but I would be happy if my life would come to an end tomorrow. I'd gracefully accept death and the absence of these emotions
