what's the point if you have nothingno talents, no passions, no dreams. i'm all alone. i spend more time posting here than i do actually speaking to people. i have nothing i want. i'm too depressed to take care of myself, too depressed to do my work for my courses. i feel dead already. i can't trust people, i can't love. i don't believe that the best is to come. no, the best has passed; the best was when i was too young to comprehend anything. i still wish i had never been born.
