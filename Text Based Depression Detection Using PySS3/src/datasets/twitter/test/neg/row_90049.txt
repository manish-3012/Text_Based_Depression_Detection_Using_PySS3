I'm tired of livingI'm tired of being in pain physically mentally and emotionally I don't want help I don't want drugs or medication I don't want any of that. I'm tired of being unloved unwanted and uncared for, i'm tired of living  with the burdens of life, i'm tired of the people that only want to hurt me and i'm tired of being hurt. I'm scared to talk to people i'm scared too to function. I don't want to talk to anybody and I don't want anybody to talk to me I just want to be left alone in the dark. I don't want to socialize I don't want help i dont want to get better i just finally want to be at peace .
