Help me move past the hard patch pleaseHey there internet strangers.

I'm having a rough night ( no where near the worst it's been) and I can use some help.

I really don't want to call the hotline it's not that bad. But what are some practical approaches to stopping suicidal thoughts and feelings? 

I'd really prefer more positive replies, I think too much negative may make things worse.

Thanks again.
