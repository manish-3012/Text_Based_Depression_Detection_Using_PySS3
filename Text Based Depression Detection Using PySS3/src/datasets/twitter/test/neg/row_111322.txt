I want to be normalI'm not normal.
I wish I could live a normal life, but I look at people and envy how they can express their emotions to people they barely know so well. Selective mutism has ruined my life.
I want to end it but I keep thinking about how I've never fallen in love, how I've never owned a house, how I've never driven a car, or went to a party on my own.
I'm a loner. An introvert. I so badly want to be an extrovert, but that's impossible with my circumstances.
I'm barely holding on.
Sorry I keep making posts, it's my way to let off steam.
Failing classes, I think my parents are disappointed in me, I just don't know what to do.
I want to kill myself, but they'd by sad. No one ever knows what's wrong with someone till they're gone.
I want to kill myself and see if people would actually care, or if they'd say, "Yeah saw that girl once or twice, she never talked"
I have 0 friends. Pathetic of me, I know.
Any friend I've ever had I've pulled away from. Me and my cousin are very close but since I've become depressed again, I've pulled away.
I want to make an impact on someone.
I don't know how anyone could help me. I've tried, and failed.
I cry multiple times a day. Every day. 
Every. Single. Day.

I want to be normal.
So bad.
