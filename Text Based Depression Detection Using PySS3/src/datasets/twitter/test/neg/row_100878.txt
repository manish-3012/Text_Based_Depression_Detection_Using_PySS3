I sometimes cry while remembering and thinking about holding my ex-girlfriendâ€™s hand in 2014.Well, she wasnâ€™t really my girlfriend, more-so a girl a dated a few times.

I really liked her. I liked hugging her and being with her more than anything else in the world.

I try to move on but I find nothing to move on to.

More than anything else in the world I want a girlfriend. That is the only goal I give a fuck about accomplishing. I do not care what happens nor what I do with me life. All I want is a girlfriend.

Is that asking for too much?
