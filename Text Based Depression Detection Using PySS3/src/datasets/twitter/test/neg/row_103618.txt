My Mom says that I am worthless, mistake , and hopes I should dieThose words coming from my moms mouth hurts so much. I always thought that my family was normal and how mom abused me and my little brother was normal. My parents always fought every 3-4 months. One huge fight was on valentines day. Plates, utensils everything was shattered. Today was another huge fight.This time my parents took it too far and finger were cut and there was blood on the finger. And I was begging them to stop because my grandpa has a weak heart and its was so loud that other neighbors were listening. I shouted "please stop." and she came and pinned me to the ground and kept saying that i am useless and disgusting words. And thats were I lost it I said that she was cheating with my father(which she was for 1 and half year). And I said she never loved me and she hated me. And she said that is all true and I was a mistake and pain in her life. My parents are divorcing now ig. And it just hurts becuz i always respected her as a mother. And I am still thankful for whatever she has done for me.I just wanted a normal parents. I feel ashamed that I was even born from her. More than me, my dad has suffered from her. Don't even have my own room to cry my feelings to. Can't wait to get out from here or just end it.
