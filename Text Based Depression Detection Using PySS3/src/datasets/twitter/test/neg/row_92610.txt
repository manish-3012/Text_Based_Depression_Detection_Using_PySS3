Feel like I'm going to end up killing myselfFor the past couple months I have felt suicidal. It has been getting gradually worst since things been getting rough lately. The thing is I'm 19/M and don't have depression or any mental illness, but anytime the going get tuff thoughts of suicide kick in. Honestly don't think I'll be alive for much longer due to this. I just think it would be easier to off myself than to keep going in this shit life. Don't really know what to do, I don't have a strong support system. And the people I live with is the main part of my problems. Feel like I'm about to hit rock bottom.
