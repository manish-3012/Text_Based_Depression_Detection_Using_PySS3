Please help...I just feel so empty inside, I have no friends in real life and know seems to help me online, they just says it's my fault I'm depressed and stick being so I'm crying, and I really want to die, my dads gun is unlocked in his room, and I'm framing out, someone please talk to me. I...probably give backstory right, people do that....I'm trans, my parents refuse to accept me think it's a phase and I'm fat and ugly so I can't even pass in public as myself. No one cares about my feelings just what they see, I'm just so tired of trying to fit society when they are wrong. My parents make fun of trans people like we are joke fodder and not really the gender we identify with. I'm sorry just someone talk to me please....I'm so close to the edge and I'm scared.
