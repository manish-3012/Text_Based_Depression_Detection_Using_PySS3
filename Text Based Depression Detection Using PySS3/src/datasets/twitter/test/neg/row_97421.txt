Think I might die after this concert.I'm watching the Muse concert, something I've wanted to see since I was 12 or 13, I'm 20 now. Muse is also a band I associate with suicide, I listened to them when I was really seriously considering suicide at the age of 14 or 15. Now that I've "checked this off the bucket list" I'm basically good to go. I have no purpose now, so why not? I suppose this a thank you to all the comments I've seen on here trying to persuade people out of it, you are all such kind souls.
