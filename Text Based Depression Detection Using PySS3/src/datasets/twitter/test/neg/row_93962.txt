I couldn't do it.I'm not sure why I'm posting here honestly?

But im at the point where for the first time ever I was seriously going to do it.  I drove up to my moms cabin because I don't want to do it at home and have my wife picture it Everytime she in in the yard, and be forced to move. 

 I had the gun loaded but not Chambered and did a few dry fires. I just started crying at the fact that I would be the worst father ever to leave my 2 and 4yo daughters without a father. I packed up and went home and didn't tell anyone. 

We ended up having a few glasses of wine that night while watching TV, and my wife randomly pulled me in and and we layed hugging for a few min while watching TV. That act gave me hope and the ability to keep going for now. I can't express how much I need for her to do that again.
