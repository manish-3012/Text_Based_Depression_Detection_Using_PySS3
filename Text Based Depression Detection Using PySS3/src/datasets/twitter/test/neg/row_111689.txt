Sorry I'm still hereI'm so sick of this. So sick of feeling useless and alone, so sick of never being happy or feeling ok. So sick of lying all the time and telling every one I'm fine every fucking day because I'm not at all. I constantly just feel drained and tired of everything and I rlly see no point in carrying on. No one cares and it's not like ill be missed by anyone if I just end it all. I'm sorry I'm here. I'm sorry I'm wasting your time. I'm sorry every one has to deal with my shit when I'm a lost cause.
