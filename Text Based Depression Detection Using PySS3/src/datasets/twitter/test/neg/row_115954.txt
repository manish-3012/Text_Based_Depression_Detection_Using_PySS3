I can only find advice for victims, but I feel like the guilty party.I've considered posting for a while and never have. But my head feels so empty at the moment that I'm just letting the words fall onto the screen *just* in case someone has some useful words. I've been depressed with some ups and downs for years now. But thoughts of suicide only come up for a couple weeks at a time really strongly and then subside. I know I need therapy, but I can't get it this semester for difficult-to-explain reasons and have to make it to next semester on my own, so I'm kind of grasping at straws here for something.
I think constantly about why I feel the way I do, and I can boil it down to strong regret and guilt over past actions. And I know I can't overcome this unless I can overcome those. But whenever I try to research these things, I get:
Information for victims
Stories of guilt that seem accidental or mild.
And of course I'm glad that these are here for those who need them, but the more I research for help, the worse guilt I end up feeling.

I'm fighting myself over whether I'll hit the submit button, so I'm just leaving it at this, and leaving out details. Any comment or recommendation of guilt resources would mean a lot.
