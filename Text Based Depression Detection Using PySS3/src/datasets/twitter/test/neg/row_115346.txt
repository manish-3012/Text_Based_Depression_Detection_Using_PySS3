I dont wanna live anymoreI just chugged a bottle of wine in attempt to numb the negative thoughts but it aint helping anymore.
I just wanna die. I hate everything that happened the last 3 years. So much suffering.
Maybe I find the courage to end it in the coming days.
The will to change things are like 99% gone and im only filled with hate and anger. I know that I can change things but I dont even want to anymore. Everything is so fucked and im so fucking angry at the world and myself for what happened to me. Im better of dead then hurting others.
