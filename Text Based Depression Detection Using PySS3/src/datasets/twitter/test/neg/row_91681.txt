I might not make it till my appointment...Hey again, SW... Here I am again with my bullshit. Long story short.. Finally came to terms with the fact that I needed to see a professional and booked an appointment for my 'depression', though I'm completely clueless about these sorts of things and my appointment's on July 10th.. I don't think I can stay that long without doing something drastically stupid.

Lately I've been thinking more and more about how crappy my situation is and I just can't find the reason why I should work on making it better instead of just wiping the problem clean once and for all. I still need to find a job, but the market is outrageously bad where I live and I don't own a car, nor have the possibility to move away because of my mom's disability, and simply not the strength and confidence to go out and see people anymore. I've been working freelance and getting fucked over by 'employers'; my birthday's in a week and I can't handle that pressure, either. Penniless, hopeless, and completely demotivated.
