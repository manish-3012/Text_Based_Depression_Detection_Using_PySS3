lonely garbageI've never been in a relationship or even had anything close to intimacy with another person in 20 years of life. I've been in unrequited love multiple times and I've come to the conclusion that this is likely how love is going to work for me for the rest of my life. I feel so hated, lonely and distant from everyone, it's awful. I definitely don't see myself living longer than another 5 years if things don't change
