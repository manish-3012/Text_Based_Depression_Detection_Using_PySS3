Life is shit I want out, the sooner the betterNo one does or ever will care about me because of my shit face. All the shit that happens in life I face on my own. I live in a shit apartment because of the cheap rent so I can by a house but the market is shit so that's not happening. I wake up every day to work my ass of for shit people for shit pay. My friends and family don't give a shit about me unless they need something. I can't do anything because all the shit is cancelled. No matter how much I work on myself the world doesn't give a shit about it. I'm 34 and I am where an 18 year old should be. Nothing is working, nothing is changing. Don't try to convince me otherwise, whatever you're going to say I've already tried it. Just tell me how to die quick and painless.
