God please just take my life &lt;3The world you created is cruel, but beautiful. I don't really have a miserable life. I just want to cease to exist. I don't hate life. I just hate my life. I wish i was never born. I was never happy being alive. I'm lost. I'm empty. I'm tired. God, please, just kill me.
