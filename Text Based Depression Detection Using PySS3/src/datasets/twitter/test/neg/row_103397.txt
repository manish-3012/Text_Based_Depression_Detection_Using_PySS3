Does your subconscious ever take you for a ride?So, long story short, a close friend of mine committed suicide a couple years back and ever since then the holidays trip me out (they were born smack dab on Christmas Eve, fml).

 Examples: on Christmas Eve back in the year of my friends passing I had a panic attack that landed me in the hospital.

 The following Christmas Eve I thought very abusive and homicidal thoughts towards a loved one, when that's never happened in my life (like a demon took over me); I had to remove myself from the situation.

 And this year for some reason I'm having the worst set of flashbacks paired with depression that I've had for a while (my post history probably gives certain things away). These extremely dark feelings always come on all of a sudden like I'm being swallowed by a cloud of doom and it's like, why? 

There's not a lot of intellect or logic or even romance to my experience. It's not like I'm sitting here reminiscing at the good times I've had with this person; especially because my memories in general are so patchy. These feelings and memories feel entirely distilled in my bones. They feel physiological more than psychological.  

Usually my brain has a switch. I waver between two extremes of full and uncontrollable emotions and emotional numbness. For the most part I can turn the emotion switch off. I can tell myself "nobody gives a shit about your problems" and then I feel content to continue being a robot, but around this time of year, idk, I lose my shit, it's so hard for me to control myself and I get scared.

I have family members I need to take care of and a suicide attempt can't happen at this point. If I fuck up, if I lose my job because of a no call, permanently disfigure myself due to a suicide attempt, or die, they get fucked worse than I do. I don't want that. 

I'm feeling not well.
