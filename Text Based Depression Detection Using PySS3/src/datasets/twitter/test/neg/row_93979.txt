A good byeI believe I have stockpiled enough pills to make it a mostly painless journey.. I hope.

I doubt I can specify the exact numbers on here, but it's above the 100s for just one type of pill, and there is going to be 4 types in total. I am intending to down them all in a single seating with some sort of cold peach alcohol.

They say it's red alert when you have a plan with all the numbers I'm place and all, but I have run out of time. The pain, physical, mental and emotional, have caught up to me. Being at pain scores of 8 (0 to 10), -7 (-10 to 10), -8 (-10 to 10) respectively. I am no longer interested in seeking help because all they do is just lengthen the pain. I am going to end this before April hits and it will literally take a miracle to get me out now.

Thank you all for being around, for being there.
