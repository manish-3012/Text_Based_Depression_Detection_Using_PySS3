I've got an old friend who's in serious trouble. Advice?He's 20, real good guy. He's recently gotten himself clean of drugs, looking to get himself in a better position, but he's apparently battling a pretty serious problem with depression. I only learned this a few hours ago, after I called him up for the first time in years... he had been posting some pretty ominous stuff on his facebook.

I guess he fucked up his arm today after skipping out on a doctor's appointment to discuss his depression. When he talked with me, he said he had been battling this for years and said he didn't want to fight it anymore. We talked for a while, and he promised he would get help on his day off tomorrow. We made plans to meet up later in the week and catch up, he seems to be doing better... but now what?

Do I call the hotline for him, or what? He said he'd flip out and leave if they tried to put him on suicide watch, and I don't want to piss him off or make his situation worse.
