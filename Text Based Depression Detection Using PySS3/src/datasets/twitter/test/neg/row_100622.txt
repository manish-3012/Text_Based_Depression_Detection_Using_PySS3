Suicide is hard. Its painful without the right equipment. So I know I would never be able to go through with it. Every time I contemplate suicide, I think of the â€œWhat ifâ€™s.â€ 

What if I made a quick slice down my arms?
What if I downed this bottle of sleeping pills?
What if I jumped off this building?
Suffocated? Starved? Dehydrated? Hung myself? Froze to death? Etc.

Iâ€™ve tried it all, and they have never worked. I have scars on my arms to remind myself and others that I tried and failed. I have the memory of feeling disappointed when I woke up the next morning. My sense of fear steered me away from jumping off the ledge and to untie the plastic bag from my head. The pain of starvation and dehydration led me to cheat and take small bites of food or sips of water. You can imagine the disappointment I felt when I couldnâ€™t follow through or failed to succeed at the others. I feel like a coward. Im too scared to end it myself. But Iâ€™ve given up on trying to make it through life.

Every moment that I am alone with my thoughts, the same words repeat in my head: â€œI hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself.â€ While I shower, instead of the normal, innocent â€œshower thoughtsâ€ that Iâ€™ve heard of, i think about all the things I hate about myself. Even now, as I write this out, I cant help but to think that I have no redeeming qualities. The only things getting me through life are sex and drugs. The only two things that are effective enough at distracting me from the thought of ending it.

On a day-to-day basis, I donâ€™t look both ways before crossing the street, sometimes I â€œforgetâ€ to put my seatbelt on, and I actively put myself in potentially dangerous situations just so that someone could end my life for me. But I realize that if someone didnâ€™t mean to end my life, it will burden them forever. I donâ€™t want that either. I care about people. I care too much. Iâ€™d rather help a friend than help myself. Even if they wonâ€™t help me back. Theres no point in helping myself. All if my anxiety, depression, and stress are all self induced. I donâ€™t know the cause. All I know is that Iâ€™m not happy. I havenâ€™t been for a while. Im not even sure what genuine happiness is supposed to be anymore.

When I was younger, I used to build legos and put together kits of random things I found online or in stores. I used to paint, play piano, write short stories, ride my bike, and go shopping. But whats the point now? I only do these things if Iâ€™m extraordinarily bored. And when I do, I hate everything the whole way through it. For example, I recently started another painting. But itâ€™s worse than usual. Its hideous. I hate it. It looks like something an animal vomited. I cant even manage to be good at the things i used to enjoy. Iâ€™d rather stay awake, scrolling through social media on my phone, then fall asleep at 1am, then sleep for as long as I can. Thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to. And itâ€™s not just because of Covid. Iâ€™d sleep forever if I could. Its better than being awake, being alone with my thoughts. Theres nothing better to do anyways.

For now, since I canâ€™t pinpoint the source of my depression, I wish I could be appreciated at the very least. Appreciated by my family, by friends, etc. I wish I didnâ€™t feel like I was being used all the time. Used for sex, drugs, money, therapy. I want my friends to come to me for help but I wish I could talk to them too. I wish people would put the same amount of effort that I put in for them. Maybe its too much to ask. Maybe Iâ€™m being selfish.

I just feel â€œtoleratedâ€ with everyone I meet. I feel like Iâ€™m annoying them if I text first, I feel like a burden if I decide to rant to them, I feel like they think Iâ€™m faking it for attention. Maybe I did a while ago, back when being emo was a personality trait. But now, its real. I canâ€™t handle it.

In the end, I keep coming back to wondering: â€œWhat would happen if I ended it?â€ Would people care? Have I made enough of an impact in the world for someone, anyone to care? What would happen if I ran away and hoped to starve to death, freeze, murdered? I guess I wouldnâ€™t know until I try it.
