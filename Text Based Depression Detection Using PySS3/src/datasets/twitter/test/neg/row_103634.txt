Do you ever feel like if you had been dealt a better hand in the beginning stages of life, things would be monumentally different for you and those you effect?     Do you ever feel like if you had been dealt a better hand in the beginning stages of life, things would be monumentally different for you and those you effect? What if early in life something major had effected you and your life has just been a domino effect ever since, plaguing and bending everything and everyone around you till it and they snap? Can enough of these life altering challenges be enough to prevent it from being overcome or will it truely effect someone and whoever they allow into their life forever? Could outside influence be enough to overcome enough of the challanges to lead a financially successful life even if you had to start with nothing but documentation?
  
  What if early in life something major had effected you and your life has jjst been a domino effect ever since? Your parents could have split when you were just three years old and your mom left you at daycare? What if you ended up being raised by your grandparents for a few years before ending up moving out. What if you move into tour own place and worked, went to school, and kept decent grades and the state came knocking and you were forced to live in a grouphome that was bad for your safetey and health because you were "too young"? What if you were hungry and got a charge for breaking and entering and petty theft for stealing a sandwhich from your "grouphome"? What if it got you expelled from school? What if due to violence, theft, and being surrounded by kids with problems of their own caused you to feel better off on your own so you ran away? What if you did what you had to do to get an appartment (much older girlfriends name) and you were told you were still too young to legal work? What if you ended up in the drug trade and being very successful with it? What if you fall im love and have a kids, obviously you stop selling, you decide to get your GED and start trying to work. But because you fucked up you cant be in their life.. And your still just eighteen. What if being nearby is costing you your sanity so you move to another state? What if you got a little better. What if you started working and decided you wanted to go to school? You started taking eighteen credit hours of college while working seventy hours a week on average? What if we skip ahead to last month, nearly six years later to save time as it very much repeats itself.. Kids and all.  Maybe last month you found yourself sitting behind your running car as it sat in the garage. What if you survived but literally all you had was your ID, social, birthcirtificate, your cellphone thats cut off and some clothes.

     Can enough of these life altering challenges be enough to prevent it from being overcome or will it truely effect someone and whoever they allow into their life forever? Maybe that is where things have gone wrong? What if you dont let people into your life? What if we could rewind time to right before each big relationship. If you never got involved where would you be financially? Would you own three investment properties and be closer to achieving your dream of being a property manager and landlord? Is it too late at twenty five to even test it now? Not going to be easy with no degree and no money, car or liscense. Don't even have a job. How do you even begin? How do you even attempt to start to move towards our dream of being a property manager/landlord when you are so far away now.
    
    Could outside influence be enough to overcome enough of the challanges to lead a financially successful life even if you had to start with nothing but documentation? If you focused everything you had into imporving your life financially and avoided every other distraction, would outside help be enough? What if you could get a loan for your first investment property? Could you turn things around? What if they offered to educate you or put you in school while you built equity on the first investment property? Could you still retire at seventy with enough rental properties to retire financially successful? Alot of the way you make money is time. Is twenty five too late for that if you are offered help? What if your not? Where do you begin if you, not only arent offered help but dont have help? Friends or family?

     Do you ever feel like if you had been dealt a better hand in the beginning stages of life, things would be monumentally different for you and those you effect?What if early in life something major had effected you and your life has just been a domino effect ever since? Can enough of these life altering challenges be enough to prevent it from being overcome or will it truely effect someone and whoever they allow into their life forever? I suppose in the end it might not be worth it afterall. Regardless of how much potential you had, or how smart you were, you don't know where to begin and you dont have help. You dont even know if its worth trying.
