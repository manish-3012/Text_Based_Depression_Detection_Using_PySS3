I Need Someone Right Now.I am struggling to find the will to live. I'm borderline. I have anxiety. Negative thoughts, stress, depression... whatever.  The longer I live, the worse it gets. Worse. Worse. Worse. Worse. It isn't getting any better.

If I had a gun, I would certainly be dead right now. The only reason I'm alive is because I have no reasonable method. I can't just pop a bottle of pills and hope to die. That just doesn't work.

I've been a failure my whole life. I don't feel good enough for anything. I've tried finding reasons to live. I have. I can't find any. They don't exist. Nothing makes it worth it. I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to right now. Someone please respond.
