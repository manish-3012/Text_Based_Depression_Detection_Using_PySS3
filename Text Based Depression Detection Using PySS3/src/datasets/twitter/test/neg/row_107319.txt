..I just needed to put this somewhere without consequence. I am scared. The last two years of my life have been a lot. Iâ€™ve started self harming again in the last 12 months and in the last few days Iâ€™ve been burning myself. 
I am less and less ok as time goes on and I thought it was supposed to be the other way around. I have a little boy and I am all he has. He loves and adores me and he needs me. I love him so much and I stay here for him and I try my hardest. Iâ€™m just scared, scared of how much longer I have left and scared of the kind of life he will have if I leave him behind which I never thought I was capable of but I am really struggling. 
Iâ€™m getting help, but I am scared to be completely honest with people. I have never felt this broken and hopeless.
