College is stupid and it makes me want to die even moreI donâ€™t know what the fuck is wrong with my school in particular. They never even showed me how to schedule an advisor meeting. I started out with 4 classes and had to drop two of them because I was failing (both grades below 50%) and these profs couldnâ€™t teach if you put a gun to their heads. 

Now I have this whole English research paper to write on some bullshit topic I chose and we have to â€œcollaborateâ€ and â€œbrainstormâ€ in class with people who are writing COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PAPERS. Itâ€™s fucking stupid. Theyâ€™re not sharing my grade why should I have to ask for their help?? I keep skipping class cause I donâ€™t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers.

I think Iâ€™d be happier dropping out, living with my parents, and just working two jobs so I can focus on my side hustle. Itâ€™s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me Iâ€™m wasting the opportunity they gave me. 

I donâ€™t know. I just know I canâ€™t take this shit anymore.
