Ego-death, spiritual awakening, huge mind issues.Hey I am 18 years old, Ive been in a very bad state of mind (slightly delusional, formed a destructive identity in my mind) for 8 months now. Dont know how I pushed through though.

I am feeling torn between two parts of me. One part sees death as only solution (very very valid feeling), the other part says nothing matters now anymore, so you can keep playing the game - thing is, the dark part wont subside then. This habit came on its own after 6 Months of Depersonalization and DR, both known to provide for awakenings. But mine spiralled from an partial awakening, to depression and ended in a split identity. This "I", this observing spectator, this stable grounding identity, which I relied on during my anxiety days, mindfulness meditations and where I was sure, that I can do it, I will get over it, and live peacefully after this dark period, broke away. It is gone. Instead it is either total identification with ego or a somehow "inbetween" state. I dont have a grounded identity anymore, an I in which I can say that I want to live 100%, instead a submind which when it takes over, I feel like I shouldnt be living anymore and that anything I lived before is nothing but a story and nothing matters anymore (potential nihilism). No good vibes anymore, total apathy on some days where I dont know if I can even connect to people or my identity. BUT NO SYMPTOMS OF DP whatsoever. What happened? How do I know "I" want to live? Till now, I chose the part that felt more authentic to me, the peace. But this conflict creates a vacuum.

Just imagine jumping off a cliff but without ground to hit on. I feel so lost. So not like a normal person. So crazy. I am currently in therapy, for 4 weeks now.
