Is sleeping pills + Charcoal-burning a painless way to end it all?I guess this is the only place I can ask about suicide methods on Reddit. I'm considering different ways to do it but charcoal burning seems like a good way out.

So charcoal-burningÂ is a pretty popular way to go in where I'm from. Death occurs byÂ carbon monoxide poisoning. From what I've read online it makes you suffer before you die, so a lot of people take sleeping pills to make them pass out first and let the charcoal burning do the rest. Is it the best way to go aside from putting a bullet in my head? (I have no access to guns)
