Idk how else to say itMy bio mom murdered someone pretty brutally 4 years ago and she finally just went to trial. She plead guilty. And her sentence got reduced from 99 years to 45 with a chance of parole in 20 years.


It was all over the news. My bio moms mugshot has been riddled all over social media and the thought of ever potentially seeing her in my life time makes me want to end it all even more. 

I know 20 years is a long time. But i just hate the American justice system so much. And i hate her even more for even still being able to affect me.
I moved 8 hours away from her because of her abuse more than 11 years ago. I feel like the system failed not only the man she killed but me too. 

It isnt fair.
