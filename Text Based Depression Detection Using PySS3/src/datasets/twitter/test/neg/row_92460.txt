So tiredI told the person I cared about most that I wanted out yesterday. Out of this shitstain life Iâ€™ve been living. They told me if I needed help to find it and then ignored me the rest of the night. Iâ€™ve never felt the pull to join the other side more than I have today. Hell, if they donâ€™t care anymore, why should I? Why should anyone? Iâ€™m just so damn tired.
