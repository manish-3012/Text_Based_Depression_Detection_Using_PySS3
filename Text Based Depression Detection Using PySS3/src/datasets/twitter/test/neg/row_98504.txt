ConflictionA year ago, I once tried and feel will again. There's nothing more expected, I'm too weak to properly handle reality. Time has gone by quickly, but hardly anything has changed as I constantly heard it would. I've tried to become accustomed to this, no luck. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but eventually I'll be heading my way if there's no improvement. Right now, though, I'm not sure how to feel.
