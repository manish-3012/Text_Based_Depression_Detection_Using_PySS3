LostI promised myself that I would kill myself on my birthday, but now that itâ€™s a week away I feel so afraid because I feel like if I get set off into another depressive episode Iâ€™m gonna snap and do it when Iâ€™m not thinking straight. I wish I could at least tell someone or get the courage to write a note for my loved ones. I feel so lonely in my feelings because Iâ€™m either labeled as a bother or over dramatic/crazy when I do try to talk about this stuff.
