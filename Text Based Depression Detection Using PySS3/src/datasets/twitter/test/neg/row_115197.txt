For the past 9 years I have only existed and I should've died when my mom did.I think I'm hated. I think I'm a drain. I don't know how to help myself. I feel like a failure. My support system has dwindled to almost nothing. I feel like a burden. I don't want to leave my dogs because I feel like they need me and love me and I love them. They show me genuine love and happiness and are the only ones who need me. I want to feel loved but there is a lot of resentment toward me. I don't know how to make anything better or else I feel incapable one. I've been stuck in a rut and lost and lonely and like such a burden and like I've caused a lot of pain without meaning to. I'm not sure how to continue on living.  I mean well but I don't know what I can do or say to make anythinng better. Everything feels so dark and empty and hopeless. I'm not young anymore and time is slipping away.
