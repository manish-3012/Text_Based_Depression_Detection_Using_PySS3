How long can someone really be expected to feel like this?First post here. I'm desperate. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this. I'm just so fucking tired of fighting. I'm tired of fighting to stay clean, fighting to stay healthy and happy. Lately, it seems like a fight just to get out of bed and be a human being. Is it selfish of me to want to die or is it selfish of everyone else to expect me to keep living like this? I feel like an old puzzle that has lost so many pieces over the years that there's no hope for a complete picture anymore. I just need to be thrown out.
