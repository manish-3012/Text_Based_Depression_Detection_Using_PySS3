Iv been so deppresed and im seriously considering suicideFor some bqckstory, currently i am a guy,  17 yrs old, highschool senior
Long story short when i was 11 i was raped, and after that i became very introverted and shy barely talked to people and while i do hqve some friends, i havent even dared to get into a relationship, i guess fear if being hurt, iv been lonely for a long time, like i want a relationship, not just because of sex but just to feel cared but like i mentioned above im afraid of being hurt.

I guess i feel worthless and undeserving of love and im always thinking things like "even if i got into a relationship with some girl i would just be a burden" 

Ik i need help and need to get on meds but still what exactly is the point anyways
