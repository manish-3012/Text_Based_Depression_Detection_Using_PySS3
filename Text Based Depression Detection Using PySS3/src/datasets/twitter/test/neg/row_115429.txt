I want don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to continue on with life anymore. I just don't want to be around anyone anymore. I can't work because I don't like people. I'm about to be homeless again. I don't like going places and I don't like being here. I don't have any family left to talk to. I can't even remember my Mom or Dad's voice. All I remember is barely what they looked like. There's no one left on this planet I want to be around. I don't even like the smell of other people. I don't want to get a job or sit on the streets. I just want to leave this place, forever. I hate the idea of life. I hate being alive. I want it all to stop.
