i donâ€™t dread the way i feel,i dread being around others. having to be cheerful for holidays and helping people out. i dread having to be that fun kooky friend persona i put up because i learned people always abandon my sad ass. i donâ€™t hate waking up, but i hate getting out of bed. i accepted who i am for better or worse, and how i feel, this is just me now.

does, that make sense?
