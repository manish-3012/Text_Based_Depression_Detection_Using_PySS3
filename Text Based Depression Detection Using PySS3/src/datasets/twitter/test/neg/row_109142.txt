Nobody really understands what it is to really truly be out of gas. Out of energy.People, whether it's my therapist, my mom, my old friends from college who I only talk to on Facebook....People don't seem to really understand me....

I've wanted to kill myself since I was about 7 years old....I grew up in a household of misery, shouting, and tears. 

I struggled through. Had awful teenage years, and wanted to end it then too...I don't know why I didn't.

Then life got good for a short time during college...It was like I was a different person. I was loved. I had friends. Lots of them. I was (am) a Deadhead and went to so many concerts and that music soothed my soul, made me smile....Made me....different.

Then college ended. Loooong story short, I've had some incredibly traumatic experiences since then, and I've completely given up. I am not interested in anything anymore. Nothing. I just want to sit alone and stare at the wall until I fall asleep.

I don't think it's possible for me to get better. I'm 46, I earn the wage of someone half my age, I absolutely LOATHE myself, and I'm stuck in limbo. If my mom weren't around, I'd have been dead so long ago....But I can't make her bury her son. It's bad enough my 42 year old brother is a junkie and preys on our own mother, grandfather, me, anyone. He'll be dead within a month, I reckon, because he finally exhausted decades of my poor mom giving the shirt off her back to try to help him. But he's a dead man, and it's probably going to kill my mom when he overdoses. I figure she'll die of a broken heart within a few months.

That's why I'm waiting for my mom and my grandpa to pass away....But I have to exist until then. But I'm as good as a dead man already. I'm just a hollow shell of what I was....It's like I'm really dead. Nothing makes me happy. Bad stuff happens all the time. I'm just waiting out the clock until I can down a whole fuckload of hydromorphone and some immodium so I don't puke it up.

People still think that just because my body is here, that there's something inside it....But there's nothing....I wish people could understand that about me.
