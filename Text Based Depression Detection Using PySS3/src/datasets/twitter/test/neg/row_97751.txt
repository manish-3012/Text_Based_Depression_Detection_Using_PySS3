Less painful way to end it?I have access to sedatives and I've killed many small mammals with it. If 10 drops can kill them in 10 minutes, I'm sure the dose can be adjusted to kill me. I'm planning to prour maybe 20 drops of sedatives on my pillow and blanket and then go to sleep with the blanket covering my head. The only scary part is that I know it'll be painful.

Was wondering if there's a less painful way.
