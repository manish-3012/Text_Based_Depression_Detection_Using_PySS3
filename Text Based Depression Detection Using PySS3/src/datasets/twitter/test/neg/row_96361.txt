"You can't be depressed! You're ____"I hear it all the time. Im too young. I'm white I can't be depressed. I'm male. I'm straight. I'm tall. I'm lower middle class. I'm surrounded by people. I'm just making it up. I just want attention. I'm sick of hearing this. It only makes me worse. It doesn't help that I don't have anyone to talk to. I have "friends" but I don't trust them with my heart. Even those online helplines feel token and hollow. They feel like they read from a script and feel more like bots then caring people. I just don't know where to turn. I have a lot of life left but I honestly don't feel the point. I just don't want to be alone anymore. But I can't trust anyone with my feelings. I'm 17 and when I try to confide my feelings in my parents they shoot me down saying "oh every teen is depressed. It's a phase get over it. There are people who have it worse" they won't even let me get a therapist. What do I do? I feel like I need to end this. I'm tired.
