Not leaving a noteI've already decided on a method and for the most part, I'm just waiting to see what direction my life takes from here until the end of the year. I also realised, I'm not interested in leaving a note for my family because I don't care to leave one but I am curious if leaving a note may help them with some closure or help them deal with it.
