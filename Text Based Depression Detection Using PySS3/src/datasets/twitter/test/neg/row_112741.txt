Ironic.jpgI really have a good plan to do it (at least in my mind is a good one) and accomplish it.

As a good plan, it has a lot of steps to be completed rightfully, with that comes a lot of things that I have to doâ€¦ a lot of workâ€¦ a lot of energyâ€¦ things that I really donâ€™t haveâ€¦

And making a simpler plan seems (at least in my mind) that thereâ€™s higher chance of failure.

So yeah, Iâ€™m stuck at the moment.
