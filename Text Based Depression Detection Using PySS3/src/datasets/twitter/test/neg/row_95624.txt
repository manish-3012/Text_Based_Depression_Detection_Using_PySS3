What can I do to make things less painful for everyone around me if I do leave?So far I plan to sort out social media, health insurance, banking, and sorting out my physical belongings. I also plan to write letters, record videos, and leave some gifts for people, along with resources around coping with grief caused my by actions. What else can I do to mitigate the impact? I am lucky I do not have a partner or any dependents but I worry about my family and friends.
