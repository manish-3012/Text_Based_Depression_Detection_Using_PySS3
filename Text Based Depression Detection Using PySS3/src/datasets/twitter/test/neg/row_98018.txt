no return approuchingI haven't been happy for a long time, I'm 19 and have managed to fuck everything up. I never had friends as a kid, nothing has changed, the loneliness has been crippling, even more since I pushed away the one friend I did manage to get some how.. 

I have no one to turn to, no friends, as for family, dad died 7 months ago, my mothers mental and physical health is getting worse daily and there is nothing I can do. I got a response from one of the UKs best university's few weeks back, conditional offer, but my grades are too low currently and I haven't been able to do work in this mentality, every day I think of suicide, "what's the point in doing anything, doing to die soon anyway", things aren't going to get better for me, going to University was my last hope and now deadlines approaching and I have no motivation, feeling like I've already given up and it would be easier to end it right now yet small part of me just wants to be normal, be happy, do the work and live.

I stopped taking my medication two months ago and have been stock piling it, it's grounded and ready to go down in a glass, an hour ago I was emotionless whilst doing preparations, now I have the feeling of fear, I don't believe in god but it's sure scaring me thinking about the end. 

don't know what I'm doing, I feel so ashamed just writing this, wanted to just go silently but the fear, so much fear
