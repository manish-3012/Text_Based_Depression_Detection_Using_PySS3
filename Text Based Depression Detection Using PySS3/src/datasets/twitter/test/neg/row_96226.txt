I canâ€™t take the dissociation anymoreI remember only a couple of years ago when I was happy. Even more important, I was connected to myself. I felt things and I knew I was me. I felt I was me.

Now I donâ€™t. Itâ€™s a pressure in my head at first, first between my eyes then the back of my head. Then I donâ€™t feel anything and I feel like Iâ€™m seeing the world through a fishbowl. Itâ€™s been at least a year now.

Nothing fixes it. Allergy pills help a bit and yea allergies are a part of it but trigger point massaging doesnâ€™t work, getting drunk doesnâ€™t work, masturbating doesnâ€™t work.  Either does the rigorous workout regime I have five days a week. I noticed when I worked at Walmart talking to people maybe it went away. But the job was too stressful for me and tbh I donâ€™t remember if it worked.

Itâ€™s getting unbearable. Iâ€™m not me. Iâ€™m not anyone. I want the pressure to go away. I refuse to live another year like this.
