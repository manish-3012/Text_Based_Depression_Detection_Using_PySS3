I dont know what to do with myself anymore... (X-post from depression)I've posted here before, so sorry for the rant, but i'm just helpless, lost, and depressed. I have had an increasing amount of thoughts of myself dead. I feel dull, clumsy, and dumber by the minute, and it affects whatever I do. My grades are starting to drop, and I am the outcast wherever I go. I can't make any friends or because of my lack of hobbies, and social skills, I cannot say a complete sentence without miswording, stuttering, or sounding like a complete idiot. I am completely ignored whenever I try to contribute to anything, whether it be my roommates, class, group mates, and in general. I've been going to counseling, but the counselors in my university end up telling me to try medication (which I am strictly against), or go to another counselor. I can't go to a private counselor, because it will evidentially lead to my parents knowing, and they will NOT be happy about the fact that I am still depressed and avoid talking to them about it (because they don't really help at all). I've tried going to the gym (4 months, no progress, despite diet), but that didn't make me feel any better, just more self conscious. I've tried going to clubs, but I am still an outcast who can't make any friends there as I am anywhere else.

I'm at my peak, I have no where else to go, and no one else to speak to. I just want to die.
