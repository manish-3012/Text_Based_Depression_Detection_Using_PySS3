What is to be done about anonymous suicide threats online?Every now and again I'll see a threat of suicide pop up here or on other websites (It used to happen a lot on /b/ many years ago when I was on there) and I was wondering what should be done with such threats. Is there anything that can be done in terms of getting somebody involved or is it best just to try to talk the person down?
