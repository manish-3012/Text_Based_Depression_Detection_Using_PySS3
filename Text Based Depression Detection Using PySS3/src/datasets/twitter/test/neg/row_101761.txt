17 and miserable. Alone, never had a real girlfriend. Seems like all people do is bully me around, even children. I think I'm going to kill myself.I'm 17, 6'1, and 196 lbs. I am constantly alone, and miserable. I've never had a real girlfriend, and I just can't take life anymore. I don't think I can do this. This seems like the last place to go. Im seriously considering ending my life. My parents don't even give a damn about me anyways. Nobody does. The world will be a better place without me.

"No girl could ever want me", they would say before I dropped out of school due to constant harrassment. Now, I sit alone in my room all day on medications that numb my misery. I am done with life. I just want someone to love me. A nice girl. Please, help me. I can't do this for much longer. People always end up hating me. I've always been solitary, ever since a young age. I'm not joking either, I'm seriously considering saying goodbye to this wretched place. Watching everyone have teenage love, experiences, and sex, and I'm always out of the loop. Once I'm gone, I won't feel that pain anymore. I'm probably going to go through with this. I just can't stand it anymore.
