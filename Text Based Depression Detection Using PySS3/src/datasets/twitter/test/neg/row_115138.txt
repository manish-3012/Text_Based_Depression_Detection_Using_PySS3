I can't do this anymore.The last shred of happiness I had in my life was stripped away from me in June. I've tried to fight it for what feels like centuries, and I just can't take it. As of July 17 I stopped eating regularly, I went from 3 meals a day plus several snacks to one small meal every 2 to 3 days, only to become sick to my stomach. Recently my doctor told me that I was severely dehydrated to the point where she had me put on an IV. Today it has all come full circle, I finally cracked, and I am ready for it all to go away.
