Losing my last friendI can't deal with losing dear friends. I fell into depression after i finished school, i fell into depression after finishing my bachelors degree. I'm terrible at keeping up long distance friendships. So when i moved for my masters across the country, the only thing that kept me going was a friend that decided to move to the same city. Over the last 3 months here, we got even closer, as she has problems herself and we truly trust eachother and help eachother out. But it wasn't enough, she is homesick and gonna move back after this semester. I didn't take this news well. Yesterday my feelings got me and i cried myself to sleep. I don't know what to do. It takes me a long time to trust people and i'm tired of making friendships that inevitably will cool down or end after a few years. We will slowly but steadily lose contact. I just can't deal with this. I feel worthless all the time and this just adds to it. My friends are everything to me. I don't have a loving family or anything else that makes life worth it. I think i will deal with my flat and other belongings and just end it after the semester. 

Just had to get this out, idk how to deal with my feelings otherwise.
