Not doing the bestI have been in treatment, graduated from treatment so long as I stayed on my meds. But now, it feels like everything is crashing down on me all at once. Iâ€™ve been off my meds, Iâ€™m not getting support, and it seems like I canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™m eighteen in my senior year of high school, and it currently looks like I wonâ€™t graduate. I was accepted to my dream college but I canâ€™t attend if I donâ€™t graduate, and rn I am not doing very well at all. Iâ€™m failing two of my classes and all my family wants to talk about is how Iâ€™m failing my classes and they refuse to understand that that makes things worse on me. â€œI know Iâ€™m being hard, harping on it, but I want the best for youâ€ they say, but they donâ€™t see me when Iâ€™m alone on my room, working on school work until ten at night, crying because I donâ€™t understand math. Crying because there is so much pressure on me all at once, so much is raining down on me, I donâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. But I know if I just quit, my family would forever be disappointed in me, they would forever judge me. I really need support but I donâ€™t get it, all I get is pressure. Being pushed and pushed until I feel like Iâ€™m a rubber band that is gonna snap.
