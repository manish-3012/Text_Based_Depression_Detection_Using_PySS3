Cornered into SuicideI'm 26 and I hate every job I get. My passions bring no monetary return and I've had to sell my beloved instruments to get by. I quit my job 4 months ago and I've been in a hopeless depression. I'm not willing to work shit jobs until I retire. I would rather die. 
Even the simple things are getting under my skin, traffic, groceries, going on walks to clear my mind... I'm sick of it all. I don't drink or do drugs and I still feel like shit so often. 
I only have $25 to my name and I need $800 to afford rent this month. 
Sadly,  the alternative to not working is being homeless, which seems miserable too. 
I feel lile I really have no choice but to kill myself and I'm posting here out of desperation, praying that an answer will reveal itself.
