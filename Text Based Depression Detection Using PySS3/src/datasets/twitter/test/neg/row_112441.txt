Would rather be dead than homeless.I've lost everything, my relationship, my job, my money. And in a few days when I can't pay my rent, I'll lose my apartment too. I've spent the past month applying at every possible job, trying to get loans through my bank, asking friends, camming / sexsells, and I've still come up empty. And as selfish and immature as it is, I'd rather die than live on the streets or in a shelter. I've suffered with depression my entire life and my will to live has never been quite strong - and that was with a job and money to atleast pay my bills.

I've always believed I was meant to kill myself though. I always said I was never supposed to live to 30 and that's approaching soon. I think I just don't have the desire to keep going anymore. I have no desire to find the strength or the will or the hope to continue on like this. 

I'm scared as hell to even attempt to do it. Not so much of death but of the possibility of it not working or being in an excruciating amount of pain beforehand. Perhaps I'm just a coward. 

I just want it to end. I've exhausted all my options but one and I can't even do that. I hate myself for how much self pity I have, how selfish I am, how much my life is better than so many other's. It still doesn't stop the thoughts or stop it from hurting. 

Sorry for the rant.
