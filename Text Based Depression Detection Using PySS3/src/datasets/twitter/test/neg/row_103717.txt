Another reason why.So it's been a while since i last posted, -and that might be because i was bored or maybe i was feeling better. I dont really know- so in 2 days my parents are forcing me to go on a family holiday with them to turkeys Aegean Region. they never asked me what i wanted and they never do, seems like my decisions and thoughts doesnt matter to them. I dont want to go because I dont have enough clothes, I'm growing rapidly and most of my clothes dont fit me so i'll be very stressed and frustrated the whole time. I want to die knowing i get taller every day without gaining any weight, getting skinnier and skinnier every day. I'm 1.68mt and only 47Kg and that just makes me very uncomfortable anywhere i go and a different country is even worse. My mother tells me to go to a gym yet im self concious when i wear long sleeved shirts and trousers let alone gym shorts and tshirts.

I really dont know what to do, everything is just adding up and i just want to be happy, i just want to stop being embarrassed, self concious, and anxious.

Guessing by what's happened since i started middle school and now high school i feel like i might've had a chance at being a successful person in life but i now am definite that my end will come in the next years. At least I will be happy, i wont be anxious anymore, i wont be depressed and i wont be embarrassed.

I just wont be this pile of mess that is me.
