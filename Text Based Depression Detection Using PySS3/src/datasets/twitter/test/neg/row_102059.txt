The only thing stopping me is that the gun store is closedWhere to begin, Iâ€™m in crushing debt, it took me 9 months to find a job and it isnâ€™t paying me enough, itâ€™s just not worth it to keep on living.

All Iâ€™ve ever been good at is working on cars and disappointing my parents, they would just be relieved to know Iâ€™m no longer a burden on them if they found out I killed myself
