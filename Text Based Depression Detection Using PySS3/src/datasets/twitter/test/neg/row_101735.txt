Hi my name is sadThereâ€™s not much to this post but I felt like posting here. My name is sad (not my real one but ya know, confidentiality and that fitted) Iâ€™ve been Diagnosed with chronic depressed for 4-5 years(wonâ€™t even start explaining the trauma ) and recently 2020 has been complete shit, so many people Iâ€™ve cared about have died and every aspect of my life has been changing for the worst. Iâ€™ve done therapy and so many other healing â€˜techniquesâ€™ but no matter what nothing changes. Iâ€™m currently at my wits end, I just donâ€™t think I can go on pretending to be everything Iâ€™m not. The hardest part is thinking about all the people that will be effected, but everyone says to do what makes you happy right? What if the only way I feel remotely happy is through my own death? Everything else is just painful existence
