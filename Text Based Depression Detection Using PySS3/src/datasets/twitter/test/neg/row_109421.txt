suicidal SO and deceptionMy SO has been suicidal for years, with varying degrees of intensity. She's tried and rejected psychiatric care, including medication, so now we're just trying to deal with it on our own. I used to think that she'd be honest with me when she felt ready to make an attempt, but now I'm not so sure. She's hinted several times recently that the next time she's ready to try it, she'll keep it a secret and not give me the opportunity to intervene like I usually do.
This is the worst case scenario for us. I can stop her if I can sense that it's coming. I can't stop her if it's a secret. Any advice?
