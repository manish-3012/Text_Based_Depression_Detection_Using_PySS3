Why does it matter if I die anyway? Why canâ€™t people let others do what they want?For real, Iâ€™m dissociating hard right now. Iâ€™ve been depressed for years and Iâ€™ve tried to off myself a few times but not for a couple years now. Itâ€™s always been bad but I feel like itâ€™s evolved. Iâ€™ve been extremely emotional lately, dissociating almost daily, Iâ€™m exhausted 24/7. I tried meds a few months ago and they made me insanely angry and aggressive so I couldnâ€™t continue. I just donâ€™t see the point. Nothing is real. Itâ€™s not fair that I was born and now have to deal with the inevitability of a painful death. Why does it matter if it happens now, tonight, as opposed to ten years from now unexpectedly? 

I just want to drop.
