I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this.Im just tired of it all. I donâ€™t say this to be dramatic; or to seem as though Iâ€™m looking for attentionâ€” perhaps itâ€™s more just me venting about bullshit. But Iâ€™m tired of being me. I cannot stand being in my own body. I feel like simply â€˜beingâ€™â€” itâ€™s just too much for me. Itâ€™s become tedious. I feel trapped in my own skin, and frankly almost everyday is agonizing for me. I canâ€™t take the numbness and emptinessâ€” but at the same time I canâ€™t take feeling everything; itâ€™s overwhelming. 

So, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™ll happen. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, even though thereâ€™s plenty for me to be grateful for. Itâ€™s just not enjoyable. Every fucking day is grey for me. Iâ€™m just tired of it. I wish the best for you all; truly. But Iâ€™m just drained. Iâ€™ve spent the better part of the last 6 years trying to get back on my feetâ€” and even before then I was struggling. I wish I could describe this pain to you. But I donâ€™t think any form of articulation would suffice. Itâ€™s just heavy.

The only reason Iâ€™ve stayed is because of family and friends. Thatâ€™s it. Thereâ€™s nothing in it for me. Or so Iâ€™ve seemed toâ€˜ve found.
