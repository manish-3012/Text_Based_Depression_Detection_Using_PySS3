Ever have a good day, get a little hope, then get reminded how awful existence is?Yesterday I saw my therapist and had a good session. I felt a little better, was able to get some things done. I had a the tiniest bit of hope.

Then today my sister called me and reminded me of how worthless I am and that atom of confidence/hope disappeared. I got really depressed and cut myself for the first time in a month. And Iâ€™ve spent the rest of the day trying not cry or just kill myself.

She has a lot of control over my life and sheâ€™ll never be a good person or treat me like a person. 

I hate myself for being so stupid to have a bit of hope or daring to enjoy a few hours of relief.
