I canâ€™t escape itIâ€™ve posted here before. I left once because I didnâ€™t want to â€œtriggerâ€ myself and yet, I find myself going to sleep wishing and wondering what it could feel to cut my veins and drift away as I go to sleep

I imagine the lukewarm crimson red engulfing everything around me 

Iâ€™ve thought of a cyanide pill or vehicular suicide. I canâ€™t help but go online and look for suggestions...does anyone know a quick, painless way to end it all?
