I don't know what to doI'm 18. I've been scared for 12 years every time I go to school. My dad everytime I go to school says "You need to have the best grades. Start working." He's never satisfied with them. He always expects more from me. Before the school started today I had almost a panic attack - I was pannicking so much, I wanted to kill myself. The thought of killing myself never left me. I was 6 when I was bullied at school and since then everyday I think I have no purpose in life, I'm worthless beacuse I can't keep up to my dad's expectations and I want to end my life. Everytime i'm going to school I'm extremly panicing, thoughts of ending my life are bigger than normally - I feel like I need to do it right now. The only thing that kept me alive for these years where people that were just simply chatting with me. In school everyone hated me. I'm now in high school and well the hate suddenly stopped. I can't really focus on school beacuse of the stress that my dad has put me on for these years. Everytime he sees my grades he tells me I'm worthless and I will die without him. In the first class of high school I met a girl that later became and still is my girlfriend. She's the only thing I wanna live for. She was in the situation like me but she didn't have this hell childhood I had. She is the only thing that stopped me from killing myself and still is. But I can't stand this mental stress anymore that everyone puts on me and I just want everything to end. My life has no purpose. My moods randomly change and everytime I think about death. In school I'm so pressured I just wanna do something/anything to myself so I don't have to go there anymore - I'm crying every night beacuse of it - I'm that scared of it. Tommorow I'm going to visit my girlfriend I won't think about these things but I won't see her for 2 weeks and I don't know if I can survive anymore with that stress. For 12 years I've been saying to my parents that everything is all right. When they asked me that do I really feel alright I told them that I hate this life and I want to commit suicide beacuse I don't want to live they just responded with "I don't wanna hear it stop". Yesterday I was talking with my mom about my mental problems but she doesn't seem to care. She's like "Oh We will go but I don't have much time right now" and today I asked her again and she forget about it - even after saying it again she's didn't care. I don't what to do really I need help. Visiting my girlfriend will help me but I won't survive 2 more weeks in this school without her. I won't survive this long with this stress and without her. I will have no other choice but to do it. (I'm sorry for my english and for mixing every part of my story)
