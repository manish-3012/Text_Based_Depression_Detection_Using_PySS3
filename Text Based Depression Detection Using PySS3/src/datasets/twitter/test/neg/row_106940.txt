"You can always kill yourself later"This is like one of the few things that helps me to keep going. It's true...I don't need to kill myself right now and I can always permanently end it later, so why not stick around a little longer to see what happens? I understand a lot of people are in terrible pain - I mean, I'm in pain too, but I still hold out hope that things can change. I have bad OCD and right now I'm waiting to be admitted to a hospital for it, so...I might as well give the hospital a shot and see if I can improve my OCD before killing myself due to my OCD. 

None of this really matters IMO anyway...there are good reasons to be alive and maybe things will be better for me in 1 year. If not, there are always ways to commit suicide later. Know what I mean? I'll hang on a little bit longer. I mean, for right now it's just thinking "maybe in two weeks I'll have a date for being admitted to the hospital." I imagine, once I get that date, I'll say to myself "All you have to do is get to that date and then you'll have a chance of getting your OCD under control." Which will keep me alive until then.

I do have an extension cord in my closet that I was experimenting with...and sometimes it feels like it's calling me, like I'm being sucked into the void and I won't be able to escape it. So, it's a bit reassuring to know that cord will still be there in the future. But yeah. I just hope my outlook is better a couple weeks from now. I would tell the hospital about all this, but I think that could just result in me NOT being admitted, which would make me want to kill myself, know what I mean?
