IF things do not improve by Tuesday, I will end it.I have been suffering through bullying and this shitty school district. I'm near expulsion and have been trying to improve my behavior. I just got my phone taken away and can't go anywhere because I made a stupid decision by taking my old phone out of my mother's room to get a song and delete some things. I'm tired of just the issues and problems. I can't control myself, I do nothing but say and do stupid shit. I'm tired of the impulses because it hurts to stop. I'm tired of feeling stupid and feeling like a bitch and fag I've been called all of the time. I hate my school, I hate walking to it, and I hate waiting to leave to this program to get my degree. It isn't even for sure if I am going to be able to and I'm tired of waiting on jobs that won't clearly hire me. Waiting and suffering I've had enough of.

In the meantime, I'm going to deprive myself of things and try to be a good person before I die. No food is first as a punishment since I can't keep to myself or keep my mouth shut.

I'm tired of being a bother and a disappointment to my mother. I'm also really tired of everything else.

If everything fails, I'm going to kill myself, I won't think about it, I will just do it.
