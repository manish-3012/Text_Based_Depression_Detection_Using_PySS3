Lost a semester, my financial aid, and my hope all within the span of hours. I want to crawl into a hole and pull the hole in after me.This semester started out bad, but it proceeded to spiral out of control after one of my friends who I considered an inspiration decided to end her own life unexpectedly.  I pissed all over myself (figuratively) on my midterm in one class in particular and was talked out of dropping by the professor and my own mentor even though I should have known better.  My own major depressive episode flared up like crazy after this, requiring me risking a medication change in the middle of the semester.  I got sick as hell, which made me even more depressed, to the point that I had ideations of self harm.  I proceeded to royally fuck up that class AND my capstone course and only managed to succeed in the other two I was taking because they were both SUPER frontloaded, which meant that the worst of the work was well over, plus they were total bullshit gen ed courses.  I tried to get incompletes from the first two professors, but one said she wouldn't "because I deserved to have a break between semesters with no assignments" and the second said that he would plead my case to the Dean.  Lo and behold, my transcript now has a shiny F and a No-Show F from those two classes.  This would set me back bad enough to have to take high credit loads for my final two semesters, and I'm pursuing a hardship withdrawal, but my school likes the "all or nothing" hardship withdrawals.  I'll lose an entire semester, which would roll me back even farther and fuck up the graduate school application cycle.   This shit is bad, it can't get much worse, right?   WRONG.

A few hours later, I get an e-mail telling me that my financial aid has been suspended due to failing to meet satisfactory academic progress because I've exceeded 150% of the time required for my degree.  I struggled heavily with my bipolar disorder for years, leading to withdrawals, a few fails, and my having pursued a completely different major due to being manic as fuck.  I've had to take withdrawals recently too, due to the passing of my grandmother, so my academic records are a mess.  (The bullshit part of this is that a huge chunk of these credits were NOT paid for by any form of aid - I didn't even file FAFSAs because someone paid for them.)  I have the right to an appeal, but it's literally ONE attempt and if they don't like what I say, I have NO further recourse.  I now have NOBODY I can turn to for help paying for my education - most of my family has passed away, is an invalid, or in heavy debt due to their own medical issues.  If I lose the appeal, which is highly likely given that their list of unacceptable reasons includes "poorly managed medical conditions", I'm completely ineligible for aid and my dream dies.

I waited over a decade while I fought tooth and nail to recover from my bipolar catastrophe and be strong enough to even consider returning to school to be able to pursue my passion and find a line of work that I can handle with my condition.  I came back, had a kickass GPA ever since, would have been graduating exactly a year from now, and now it's likely over.


The bonus "fuck you" to all of this is that if I go through with the appeal, there's more shit to it:
* It has to be done with hard copies of letters and documentation and shit.  This tethers me to being within a stone's throw of the school.  I was supposed to go see my mom for Christmas and now I may not get to see her at all because of this shit.
* The appeal takes 2-3 weeks normally, and now the holiday week makes it worse.  My payment deadline for next semester is well before that.  They'd expect me to pay next semester out of pocket.   Next semester would cost me over 9 thousand dollars, not including books.  I have no money and nobody to turn to.
* The paperwork implies that going to want medical records from my counselors and psychiatrists, which brings my dirty laundry out in front of faculty and staff who I know through my involvement on campus.

When the full effects of this became apparent early this evening, I well and truly started feeling like I have nothing to live for and I suddenly understood what my friend would have been feeling in the hours when she contemplated the final steps she took to end her life.

If my dream dies, I might as well die with it.  I'm struggling to find reasons to keep living.
