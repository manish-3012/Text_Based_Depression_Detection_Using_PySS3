I'm empty.I can't do this anymore. 

All I do is hurt myself. I can't relate to people. Borderline personality disorder. Unstable mood. Fluctuating weight. Sleeping with guys that don't respect me. Feeling like a whore, being treated like a whore. No one has any respect for me. 

They say no one will respect you if you don't have respect for yourself. I don't even know what that means. I seriously don't know what "respecting yourself" means. So, if I don't know what that means, then I'm doomed to keep repeating these patterns where I just get incredibly hurt. 

I can't even sleep at night. But somehow I know, if he calls...I'm going to go do it again. He treats me so badly. 

This is permantently stained into my brain. It's just another one like all the others. I'm broken.

A fucked up childhood just like everyone else. Maybe I make too many excuses for myself so I let other people treat me like dirt.

I have no motivation. I believe the only reason I haven't killed myself is pure laziness.

I'm so bad, I'm not even allowed in my Dad's house. My Mother tells me it's my fault she left when I was 8. The guy that molested me just tried to friend me on facebook. 

I'm a pariah. A burden. My friends don't even like me. 

I'm in pain. Horrible pain. Emotional turmoil that never ends. 

I have no hobbies or lust for life. I'm depressed everyday.
