I detest the piece of shit that I have becomeOver these past few years, I have declined in many aspects, and rose in others. Generally speaking, I am happier and more confident than I used to be, but at the price of becoming a bad person. I have lied, cheated, stole and manipulated, and even told those who I love the most that someone raped me and tried to kill me even though that it not true. I cannot stop myself from lying, and sometimes I am caught. I push away anyone who gets close and I am just so lonely. I have nothing, and I am nothing. The whole world is around me, but out of reach. I feel like I am falling into an endless pit, and any hand reaching out for me only gets further away the more I reach out for it. I see no escape, my life is worth nothing. Why should I continue? I hate myself more than everyone hates me.
