I think i need help.I've hitted my limits last night, and went on full suicidal plans and thoughts, reached out to my buddy and fiance, but i'm still suicidal. I was sitting by the window, ready to jump anytime, but i looked at the text my love sent me, pleading me not to jump, i felt even worse, he dun deserve any of this, and the biggest part that contributes to these is my family, i'm always being put down by them, and no matter how much i do, it's nvr enough for my parents while my elder brother is the baby whom doesn't know a single thing while i have to do it for him, the only thing my parents will always fight with me about is money, the food they buy and put in the fridge, they expect me to do the same when i'm just turning 23 this year, now and then telling me about how i never gave them money when i did my best, gave them during father's day/mother's day, their birthdays and thought i could give them something better last year which was gold pendants, helped to pay bills and yet all my father asked was did i even help to contribute to household usages, while my elder brother did nothing at all, given that he's 27 and still in school, while i have to scrimp and save when i dun even nid to, sometimes i just feel like having an accident or disaster fall over me so it wont looked like i committed suicide. I've been pushing my own limits over and over but this time i dont see any meaning in pushing it further, at the same time, i have a fiance here and i cant bear to let him go through all that pain with the way he reacted last night, i'm realising that maybe i dont even have a family to begin with, any1 felt like this before?
