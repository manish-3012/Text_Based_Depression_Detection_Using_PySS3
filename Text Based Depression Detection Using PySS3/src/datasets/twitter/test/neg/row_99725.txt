I Tried My HardestI'm 20 years old and have had multiple attempts since the age of 11. The closest I ever got was at age 14. I took what was left of a 500 pill bottle of Tylenol (300-400+) Even that didnt work. The doctors said I shouldn't have lived, yet here I am.

Everyone told me I survived for a reason, and 6 years later its only gotten worse. I was kicked out of my mothers house, and was forced to drop out of high school. Ive spent the years since then moving around. I thought I had found hope. I found the most amazing person, to whom I got engaged to. Last year, she ended up having a miscarriage, and became very abusive afterwords. I tried to stay positive, but I struggled. I cried myself to sleep every night.

I thought things had reached there low. I felt I was at rock bottom. I was wrong. My cousin, who was one of the biggest influences and most important people in my life, overdosed on multiple pills. He looked like he was okay, but his heart failed on him. My roommates at the time ended up ditching me, so I had to move quickly. I ended up having to leave my job, and having no steady income, my car got repossessed. I had to leave that place, because I couldn't find a reliable job.

I've tried so hard. I've fought because everyone reassured me it would get better. Every day I fight through it gets more painful. It seems more and more hopeless. I've achieved nothing, my family all looks down on me, and Ive pretty much run out of friends and open doors. I think I'm going to try to end it again. I wanted to vent because even if its anonymous people on the internet, I at least want someone to know that I tried. I fought my hardest. I just don't think I have it in me anymore.
