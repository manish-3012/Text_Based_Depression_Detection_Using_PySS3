I can't handle the idea of covid endingI feel so selfish and heartless saying this but covid has given me the best year of my life since puberty. Every time I walk down the street on my own when it's dark, or pass strangers in a club, or am at any gathering involving people I don't already know well I can just see the look in every girl's eye that says *are they a rapist, are they gonna try and assault me* and every time it happens it just makes me want to die. 

To make matters worse I'm trans - I didn't ask for a male body, I don't want it. I want to be a tiny &lt;5' girl with a baby face that could never be considered scary. I've been on both sides of this too, I've been in positions which could easily have ended with me being raped. And at the time I was nothing but scared, but afterwards it just felt so good to know that some people look at me and see a victim rather than a perpetrator. I know that is so fucked up but it made me feel like if I worked at losing weight (I'm a healthy weight atm, but if I became actively thin), particularly muscle weight, then I could one day not be scary to anyone. 

But I'm a long way from that. Covid has been a temporary fix, it means I can hang out with friends in my household who all know me well enough to not need to regard me with caution, and no one is gonna invite their friends, who will see me as a potential threat. Everyone else likes interacting with strangers so I have 3 options: interact with them as well and be seen as potentially threatening; not interact with them and be seen as a creep; never go to any social gatherings and just sit alone with my thoughts and outside of covid social gatherings are the only way I can ever see my friends since everyone is working the rest of the time. Covid also means that when strangers cross the street to avoid me it's probably because of social distancing, and not cos they see a potential rapist. 

I know it will be a while before covid is over, but when I do lose all of that again I don't know what I'll do. Those experiences always makes me suicidal. I can't count the number of times I've left a club on my own without even telling anyone, trying to stop myself from crying because I had to walk past a group of girls to get to the group I'm with and getting the *you'd better keep moving you potential piece of shit* stare, only to get the exact same look for being on the same side of the street as someone else when I'm walking home and looking at all the buses passing me as I walk down the street and imagining just stepping out in front of one.
