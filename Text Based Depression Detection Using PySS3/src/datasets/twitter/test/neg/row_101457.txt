i dont know what to do anymreI still am in my parents' custody, and I've been thinking about killing myself. or at least trying. even if I fail at least my parents would stop constantly acting like I'm someone else so they don't realize the number of lies I had to tell them over the years.

i cant fucking keep this up. I've constantly been keeping up with this fake ass person I have no clue what to do. i cant just be honest, but they monitor all my social media so aggressively that I have multiple accounts on everything I use just so they cant see half of my stuff

&amp;#x200B;

I have no privacy. i don't know what to fucking do and I cant fucking keep this up. at least when I was in my real hs instead of online I could escape my parents for some fucking time but now its constant the only person I love in this godforsaken household is the only one who goes to work offline
