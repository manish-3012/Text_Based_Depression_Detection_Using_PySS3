Call it a day.Today I was told, to finally move on. No contact, nothing, and told that they canâ€™t wait for me to get hammered from this incident.

Now, itâ€™s time to hang my boots up. All of you are absolutely wonderful people. But maybe now, this has tipped me over. Itâ€™s been ripped to pieces.
