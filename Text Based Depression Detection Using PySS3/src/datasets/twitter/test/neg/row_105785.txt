DeathIâ€™m an NCO in the military and Iâ€™m responsible for a lot of Soldiers. I guide them the best I can through the Military/Life but deep down I feel like a complete fraud. Iâ€™m utterly miserable and depressed. I havenâ€™t attempted suicide yet but I do think about how nice it would be to never have existed as crazy/stupid as that may sound. I recently broke up with the woman I thought was the love of my life. Not only are we broken up but she has moved on to someone else. I just canâ€™t help but feel inadequate and unlovable.
