18 y/o, back home from uni, can't do it anymoreI'm struggling so much. 
Home doesn't feel like home anymore &amp; uni isn't home either. I don't have many friends. It's my birthday tomorrow &amp; im not at all excited. 

I have severe depression &amp; anxiety. I cause my family so much stress &amp; I don't know how much more they can take. I'm sure they'd get over it if I wasn't here anymore.
