I don't know if I want to do it again but I don't want to live anymoreI've attempted suicide seriously 4 times, 1/4 times I ended up on the hospital, other 3 I told my parents I was sick and was dying slowly on the inside (but sadly it didn't kill me) which lead me to attempt it again. On my last attempt I was on death's bed and some how pulled through and it was the scariest feeling in my life. Wasn't really a feeling but more like a nothing numbness pulsing through my body. I'm a 17 year old who is really having a "hard time in life". I plan on attempting again on my birthday which is in a week, really don't want to live as an adult in this cruel world, but I'm a pussy in how I do it.. I can't seem to just kill myself, I feel like I have to OD/Poison myself cause I'm too scared to instantly kill myself. Recently I keep having flashbacks of my last attempt and I feel the pain I felt and it's scaring me out of my mind. I'm a person who hardly sleeps and has too much time on their hands which is used negatively or distracting myself from reality. I want to share my story this time but I feel like it's too long to share and it's pointless cause no one will care. I have no one in my life that loves me, my life is fucked up, I'm just spiraling down hill. Help i really don't want to do it again.
