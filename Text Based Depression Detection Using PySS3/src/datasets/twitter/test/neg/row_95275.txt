Rejected by counseling.After 10+ years of suffering with Depression and Anxiety I finally built up the courage to contact an online counselor. Once I had filled out an online application I received an email the following day basically telling me I'm too fucked up for an online counselor and that I need to call the crises team/go to an emergency room. The whole reason I wanted an online counselor is because I'm way too afraid to speak to anyone in person/over the phone. This has fucked my head up big time and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do other than just end it.
