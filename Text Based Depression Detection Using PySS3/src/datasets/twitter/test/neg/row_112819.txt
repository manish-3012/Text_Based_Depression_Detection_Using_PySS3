homeless,cold,and just doneI think im done

I am now homeless

tired of the fucking struggle

everyone just put me aside

my own family doesn't give a fuck

I have 200 bucks in my pocket,what the fuck do I do with that

fml

this is crazy

but yeah I think im done,im over all this bullshit and struggle


update: me and my 2 kids still have on the same shit from 3 days ago, my storage closes before I get off work, fucking sick now from sleeping on a dog piss, dog hair floor,less than 200 bucks now, still feel like shit,BUT not so much suicidal anymore...I guess that's a plus :(
