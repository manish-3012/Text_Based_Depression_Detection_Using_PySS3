I donâ€™t know what to keep going forI feel like a zombie. Iâ€™m on all the right meds, take cbd, go to therapy, volunteer my time into helping others. I just donâ€™t feel a spark anymore. Nothing makes me sincerely happy and makes me feel like life is worth living. Everything Iâ€™m going through is not worth it. I canâ€™t find anything and Iâ€™m just sitting here waiting for it to be over. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
