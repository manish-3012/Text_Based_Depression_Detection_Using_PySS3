How are all of my fucking peers geniuses?Hi SW,

I go to a pretty hardcore university. I've been here a year, and my GPA is about average with others in my department, but I'm beginning to feel that maybe I'm pretty stupid: stupid in general, and stupid for coming here in the first place. I'm taking slightly more classes than most of my peers, and this probably contributes to my stress, but I cannot drop any of them because I would end up feeling worse about falling even further behind than I already am, having started a semester late after transferring.

The thing is, nobody else seems to have a fucking problem in the world, and the people I do know rather well are handling everything perfectly fine. Am I just slow? How does everyone else breeze through everything here like it's nothing at all to them? Was I mistakenly admitted?

I'm posting here because I've started making lists in my head of good, tall locations from which to jump in order to end it all and skip this fucking grind completely. I couldn't live it down if things went horribly wrong this semester, which has a nonzero chance of happening. I don't think I'm going to do it, but just that this is happening is scaring me.

The semester is getting worse, in terms of heaviness of workload. I don't know for sure what is going to end up happening to me.
