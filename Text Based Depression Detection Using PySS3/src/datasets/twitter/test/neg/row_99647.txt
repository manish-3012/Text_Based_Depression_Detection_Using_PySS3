I donâ€™t want to carry on.I have no idea what to do anymore, I want to give up on life, it wonâ€™t â€œget betterâ€ from here, this isnâ€™t â€œtemporaryâ€. Iâ€™m going to be a miserable bag of shit until the day I die. The second I get my hands on a weapon or at least something sharp enough Iâ€™m going to fucking kill myself. Iâ€™m considering using my hoodie string as a noose and hanging myself. My life means nothing and I bring no value to anyone or anything. No one would notice if I died and even if they did, it wouldnâ€™t bother anyone. Iâ€™m not going to be remembered by anyone.

Iâ€™ve tried counselling, Iâ€™ve called suicide hot lines, I was in a mental hospital just a little over 2 weeks ago, Iâ€™m currently speaking to a counsellor, it doesnâ€™t work, it never does. Iâ€™m going to be depressed and suicidal until I die one day. I donâ€™t want to get out of bed, I donâ€™t want to do anything; I just want to go back to sleep and never wake up. 

I want to give up, I donâ€™t want to carry on.

Iâ€™m in so much mental pain.
