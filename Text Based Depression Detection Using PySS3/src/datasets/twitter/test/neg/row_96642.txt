I want to die, painfully.Everyday I struggle to force myself out of bed and go to school, I think about just driving off the road every morning. I used to be smart, funny, and happy, but then the depression that I've been bottling up for around 9 years finally broke out again and now I can't do anything without wanting to die. All I want is pain, I want to die in the most painful way possible, like burning alive or being electrocuted. The only thing that stops me is I don't want to see the people around me hurt. I need a way for me to finally end it all and not upset my family as much, any suggestions? I've been silently starving myself to feel the pain I deserve, but that isn't good enough. Any suggestions for how I can end it without hurting my family as much?
