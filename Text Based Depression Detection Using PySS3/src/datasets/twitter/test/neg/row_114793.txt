its my time now, i guess.so ive been absolutely miserable and in pain for almost 16 years now, way over half of my life. ive tried and tried and tried and throughout all this time  shitloads and shitloads of people have told me that same old, idiotic, stupid, clichÃ©d, imbecilic, embarrassing, worthless, useless bullshit: "it gets better!". needless to say, nothings gotten any better. and the only way in which "it" could get "better" is if i somehow died. im all alone and no one could care less about me. im still trying to figure out how to do it; maybe pills. i dont know why the fuck i'm even posting this bullshit. farewell, i guess.
