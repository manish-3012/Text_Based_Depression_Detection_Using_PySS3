II don't want to talk to anyone anymore I'll only say shit that'll either prove to them that I'm just a deadweight, a failure. I can only say this here because no one knows me and no one will REALLY care if I say this because EVERYONE is saying it. My head hurts from medication but I know if I close my eyes I'll wake up again. I'll waste people's time and money again because we thought I was getting better but now here I am again

I should never have been born
Why was I born if I could onl disappoint everyone I love
I don't deserve anything or anyone's kindness 
I'm a waste of space I'm a failure I ruin everything i want to die but too scared of pain like a shitty coward 
I'm an attention whore who posted this here because I can't say this anywhere else anymore I don't want to make people feel like they're obliged to take care of me
It's ok I'm ok you don't have to care I'm fine! I promise I'm fine. I'm not being sarcastic or ironic it hurts but you shouldn't care about me because it's a waste of your time and energy to care about me
I say that, and I realize I said that maybe because I want you to care but because I know that I see that I'm nothing but vain and pathetic and you don't have to say anything to make me feel better because you're only saying it because I'm crying and you feel bad but it's ok!!!! You really don't have to care 
It hurts but I'm fine

Sorry again and thanks for reading
