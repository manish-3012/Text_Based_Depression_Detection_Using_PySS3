I can't do it anymoreI can't keep going. I am so sick of this shit. Medication after medication that just end up making things worse. I can't function on or off meds. I'm self harming worse and worse, digging into my wrists now, the legs and shoulders don't do it for me anymore. Wrote worthless pretty big on my torso, can't even swim anymore and I'm too ashamed to show up to rowing practice anymore my wrists being what they are.

I don't deserve what I've been given. I've squandered my gifts. I could've been so much better. I didn't think I'd be 24 and still be doing my undergrad.

I feel so empty all the time and I can't take it anymore. I've been going through this shit for so long, I'm not who I should be.

I have a revolving door of people who care about me for awhile then get sick of me. I don't blame them, I'm a worthless sack of shit. Maybe ill cut deep enough to pass out and see if I wake up in the morning.
