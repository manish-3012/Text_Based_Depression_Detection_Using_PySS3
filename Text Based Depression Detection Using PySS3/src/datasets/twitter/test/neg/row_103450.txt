I might do it soon2 weeks ago I made myself a promise I'd kill myself if my mom and my step dad would break up. Sure enough they did. I have nothing left in my life. I really don't have anyone who cares about me, somehow in the past 2 and a half years I've managed to lose every single person who truly cared about me and enjoyed my company. Both of my parents are selfish assholes who only think about themselves and their relationships are their top priority over their own children. Tomorrow I'm going to ask my crush out, if she rejects me I'm doing it however I'll wait 3-5 weeks so she doesn't feel guilt for it. And yeah I sound pathetic for basically betting my life on one person however thats how I am now, I attach myself to people I might not even know well at all and live in an imaginary world because that brings me closure.
