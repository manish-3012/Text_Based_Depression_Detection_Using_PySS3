Does anyone else feel like this?Itâ€™s not so much depression although it does contribute but mostly I am the type of person that doesnâ€™t fit well into society and I already know I have the potential to be forever alone.

I realize others have it worse, I havenâ€™t picked this life or given others their life so thatâ€™s not my doing. I can have a supportive family but still I am not enough for others.

I canâ€™t end it because my mom is struggling at work and my both my parents will be very sad. My sister too. I just canâ€™t live my life without a wife.

Idk Iâ€™m dead serious contemplating between doing it or not. Although I have no plans or methods. I still feel this way. Thereâ€™s no way out but to wait it out 70 years.
