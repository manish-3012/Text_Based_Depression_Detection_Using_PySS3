What is wrong with me and how to get past it?First of all, the only reason I am writting this here is because I have exhausted all other options (or at least I believe I did).

As a lot of people posting here I am struggling with heavy depression, am on medically prescribed anti-depressants and am seeing a therapist weekly.

My biggest problem is that I am extremly sensitive (not just as a guy - women can't hold a candle against how easily I get hurt by everything), which coupled with my general lack of self-esteem and tendancy to rationalize everything eventually brought me to the state I am in.

Now, through my adolescence I had the rotten luck of being surrounded by a few individuals/friends, who (for lack of better word) leeched on other peoples misery. Me being easily hurt made me a common target of their actions. Later on I had several other damaging experiences (i.e. My best friend in high school turned out to be hanging with me from the get go simply to get access to my gf, which he then proceeded to fuck behind my back - an experience I missed out on, since for some reason in the 2.5 years I was with her she never felt comfortable doing it... With me).

You probably can see the trend emerging. I am now 24 years old and I feel abslutely rejected by everybody. The latest incident which also caused my 2nd (failed) suicide attempt was when me and the people I hang out with (I want to call them friends, but you will soon see why I can't) decided to purchase tickets for a basketball game. We agreed to buy them in groups, trying to get seats as close together as possible. Needless to say, after the first friend bought two tickets (for himself and his gf), the rest of the group quickly bought tickets themselves, leaving me completely out of the loop. By the time I was told that they had bought tickets, getting a seat anywhere  close was impossible. 

I felt ( and still feel) completely rejected, for the umphteen time. I have absolutely no will to go on, since every time I let my guard down and start hoping that maybe I do belong with somebody (either romantically or as friends), an event such as the one described shows me otherwise.

Now, I would like to clarify that rationally I know that every such event on its own isn't even worth mentioning, but I can't help but feel that these events are all that is happening to me and as such are what defines me. Somewhere down the line I lost the ability to even believe anything good can happen to me (socialy).

From my therapy sessions I know that I will have to fix my own issues if I am to ever have a normal life with normal relationships. But I am afraid I will never be able to believe I am worth accepting, if I will constantly get external signals telling me otherwise (and based on my experience, that is bound to happen).

I am currently not trying to off myself again because I am calm enough to know how damaging it would be to my parents and I do not wish to hurt them. But other than that, I simply don't know what to do. I am literally crying for hours every night before I finally fall asleep and the pain I feel during the day is unbearable.

So reddit, please help me find a way to break this viscious cycle for long enough that I manage to pull myself together.
