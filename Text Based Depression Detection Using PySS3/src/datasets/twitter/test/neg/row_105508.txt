I hate myself bc I have no reason toI've never been abused. I've never been through any trauma. I literally have nothing that could make me depressed or suicidal. And yet I am. I tried to commit suicide when I was 10 and I think about it daily. The fact that I have no reason to have suicidal thoughts makes it even harder to cope. I have no reason to want to die and yet I do.
