The possibility of suicide puts my mind at ease.I'm 25M and I'm on the verge of losing everything I achieved. It's like I'm on a thin ice, it could go either way. I can't stop thinking about it when I'm alone(major portion of my day), it's hard to even get off my bed and do my chores. But the one thing that does put my mind at ease is the thought that "hey, if the worst thing really happened, I could just kill myself and then I won't have to worry about this anymore huh".
