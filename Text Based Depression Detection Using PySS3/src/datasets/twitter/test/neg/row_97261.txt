Its extremely difficult to keep on livingGuys this feeling of wanting to die is strong as fuck and very consistent. My head hurts nearly daily it feels so damn strange from when I got hurt by psychedelics. I only did psychedelics to try and fix my depression but it fucked me more. My face is so ugly, I'm so mentally ill, I'm struggling so fking much. I cant ever hold a job down or pass college. I'm not meant for this world
