Suicide as an act of honor.Not to escape pain or sadness, but merely pay your respect to this world and leave before you gradiently become even more stupid.
Suicide, because you are incompetent to a point your "struggles", ohhh, "suffering" stem purely from your own incompetence and arrogance.
Suicide, because you can't offer this life and world any more than your infinite flaws, and past that is a shitfest of wrong decisions.
Suicide, because you made yourself stupid in the head.
Suicide, because you are you.
Suicide, because I.
