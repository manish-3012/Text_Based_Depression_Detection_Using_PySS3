90 hours to go. My last post on Reddit if I succeed.Man, the last month went by quick. Thank you for everyone who shared your thoughts, concerns, and helpful or encouraging words.

I've been extremely busy getting everything ready for the big day. But I did change my mind on a few things. I had originally planned on notes and all that, but there will be none. It will be arranged as an accident so as to maximize financial benefits for the family. If I don't succeed with that, there are always backups after.

Thanks again. I hope you all find peace one way or another. &lt;3
