DoomedI canâ€™t remember the last time I lived without depression or anxiety. For a few months, I did manage to â€˜forgetâ€™ my depression and thought I was on the mend. But the last few months have been really hard and I really feel like my last hope has been sealed shut and Iâ€™m ready to give up.

I grew up in a good house with good parents. I donâ€™t know what happened to me. When I was very young, 10 or 11, I developed crippling anxiety. It first started with feeling sick. I would then be equally terrified of actually being sick and where I was/who would see. I did not know that what I was really having were panic attacks and what anxiety was until much later. Not long after this started, I began to fear losing people close to me, like my parents and grandparents. No one died or was ill, I just was so worried. It consumed my thoughts and I ended up sleeping in my parents room for 6 months because I was worried they would die in their sleep. This is where the rest of my mental illness stops making sense. I fell apart and into a deep depression. I was completely perfect on the outside though. I could never let anyone know. I attempted several times in high school, but again, hid it all. As an adult, Iâ€™ve tried treatment but didnâ€™t feel any relief. 

Now, I still see no end. I am anxious the entire day. Losing my family terrifies me more now than ever before. Often I wish they all would have died in childhood so I would be in recovery at this stage. All I want is something to wipe away every trace of me. I want to be alone. Just so alone. I would actually just do this, but I couldnâ€™t knowing who I left behind. I would just decide to wait until my family dies so they donâ€™t know, but thatâ€™s still so long and I donâ€™t want to keep going on with the loml. Weâ€™ve been together for a long time so he knows some. I just hate making any memory because I know that one day I will inevitably lose him one way or the other. I absolutely do not want that. He is my family too, so of course I also have worry terribly about him dying too. 

Interestingly, Iâ€™m also fascinated with death in the likes of forensic files, cold case files, etc. It seems very hypocritical to me and all I can sum it up to is that I fear it so I want to better understand it/lessen its power.

Thereâ€™s much more to it but basically Iâ€™m just trying to find a way to go as silently as possible. All I can console myself with is that once Iâ€™m dead, I wonâ€™t even know about it. Iâ€™ll just be nothing. That makes me the worst person, I know, but again, itâ€™s just inevitable.
