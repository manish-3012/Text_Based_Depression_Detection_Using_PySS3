I ruined everything.Things were going well. We fooled around he told me he loved me. But the next day I made a huge mistake and told his sister that he's into bdsm stuff and implied that us fooling around was consensual. It was part of a bigger argument.  This isn't the first time I've fucked him over but this may be the last. We had such a good night before that happened. And now I just don't think I can make it anymore. I fucked everything up. This was all my fault. I just can't live with myself
