3 weeksi am entering highschool in 5 days. i will try my best at school, i want it to be a place i want to go to in the morning. if I don't succeed by september 21, i will kill myself. I'm so tired but i wanna know what highschool is like, even if my expectations are on the floor. now if that's what i really expect, then I can't do it. i just can't. see you in 4 weeks :)
