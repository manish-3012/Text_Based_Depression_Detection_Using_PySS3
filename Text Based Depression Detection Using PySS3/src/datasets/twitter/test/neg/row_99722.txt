I don't know what to do with myselfI don't know what to do. For the past few weeks deep down I've felt miserable. I've always struggled with depression but recently I've come to realisation that I have a gf who loves me and my brother who is my best friend but I'm finding everything difficult. 

But still, I think it's because I do things for others but I'm starting to feel that nobody really has appreciated me for the things I've done, whether family or friends. When I try to reach out for help people don't want to deal with me. I have episodes where I spiral out of control and self harm without even realising it until after it's done.   And in spite of all that I have, I don't think anybody really loves me anymore
