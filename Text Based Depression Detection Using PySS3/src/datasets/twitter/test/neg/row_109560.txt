"keep going for your dreams"?I keep hearing this same sentiment but I have no dreams. Also people say things like "I just want to be happy" except for me I actually don't think I do; I can't imagine happy anymore and I don't think I can handle another fall.  What's another trite sounding saying that I haven't heard yet?  All I have left is that the effort to end it is greater than my available energy.
