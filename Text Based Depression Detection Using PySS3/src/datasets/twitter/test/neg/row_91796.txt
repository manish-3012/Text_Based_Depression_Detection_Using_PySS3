No one leftThe only person I have left is my boyfriend. My (ex, now, I guess) best friend of 20 years is now dating my abusive ex/rapist and won't talk to me. That ex won't even talk to me anymore, which. Wow. 
My sister cut me out of her life. My roommates will only interact with me if I'm with my boyfriend.
I stopped eating. 
I'm too depressed to even do drugs or drink anymore.

There's nothing left.
