sdfsdfi just dont care, i dont know if its a cry for help or anything, i just dont care if i live or die, and given that more than 50% of the time, i just struggle to justify my own existance i just want to give up. 

i usually dont drink, used to drink a lot, ammong other things, but not anymore, not since my kids were born, they spend most of their time with their mom, not because i treat them bad but because she lives some distance away, they will move closer soon. not sure its good or bad. 

told my girlfriend, that i probably want to die, that I will never change, i love her. but i worry all the time. She tells me i look good, make good money and have wonderfull kids, that im the best guy she had, I dont beleive her. 

i really dont have anything to complain about, but i just dont feel good and i worry all the time. And i fucking HATE myself more than antything. 

Tried making a snare out of an electric cord tonight, it was horrifying.
