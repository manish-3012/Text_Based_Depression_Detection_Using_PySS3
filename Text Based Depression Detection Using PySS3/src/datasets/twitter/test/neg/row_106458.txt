I've tried so hard, but it doesn't matterI used to be an anxious mess, I was constantly convinced my husband was still cheating on me. I couldn't function! I couldn't keep the house clean, I could barely eat! My ADHD and anxiety got so bad. But I picked myself up got into therapy and got the medication I needed. I did a 180, I make dinner everynighr, I do the laundry and keep things clean. I don't constantly question his every move anymore! I've gotten so good. But he doesn't care. There's no I'm proud of you or thank you or I appreciate you. All I get is, well you could do this. I'm not allowed to slip back even a little without being shut out and I'm done. I love him and I know he cares, but asking for recognition for this isn't the same as him just noticing. I went through hell for two years to make it easier for him and he doesn't even care. I'm tired. I work all day, I come home and clean and cook and then I go to bed while he games. I'm so tired, I tried taking time off, but it didn't help. I still feel like I'm drowning. I feel stuck in a loop. I just want to sleep. I just want to feel loved again. He's the only support I have. My family is across the country and I haven't made any friends. I feel so alone.
