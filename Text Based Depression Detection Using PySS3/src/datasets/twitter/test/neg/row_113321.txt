Thought I was getting better, think I have deceiving myself.My mood has been lower than low, and when it hasnâ€™t been, it has been unstable. I thought I was doing better last week, especially because the last weekend in March was so terrible. But this past weekend was terrible too. And now, in the middle of this week, I am trying to pretend like I am out of the â€œweekendâ€ funk; but I know I am not. I have to write a paper by Saturday so I donâ€™t look pathetic. Iâ€™m so anxious about it.

I donâ€™t feel o.k. I just keep telling myself I feel better, but thoughts about hurting myself and the desire to cry (and actually crying) happen too often for me to ignore. I am at the limit for my medication too. There is no time for me to switch medication before I go away for the summer either. What will happen? Will I stay on medication hoping it will work? Will more medication be added, as my doctor has already suggested? I thought I was getting better. Iâ€™m not. I just want to be better so badly.

Iâ€™m just so tired. Tired of pretending like I am o.k. Tired of trying so hard to achieve absolutely nothing. Tired of . . . living. . . at least the way I have been . . .
