I wishI wish to go down with the sun, 
To sleep, 
To merely close my eyes, 
And never wake up again, 
No tomorrow, no breakfast, no landlord no mortgages...
Just sleep, and let go...
And for the broken record people who say "don't do it" : I leave this world to you, YOU stay alive and enjoy it !
Me ? Don't worry about me I am at peace...
So at peace....
