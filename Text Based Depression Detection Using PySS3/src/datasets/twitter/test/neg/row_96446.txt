Hanging on by a thread, I donâ€™t really have any will anymore.Hi, Iâ€™ve struggled with depression,anxiety,ptsd and a mood disorder for about seven years now. This all started when I was 10 and now I am 17. These last seven years have been nothing but hell and have not gotten better. My problems didnâ€™t get as bad until I was about 13 years old when my father overdosed from opioids and tragically passed away. This sent me into the biggest state of shock and has triggered an absolute plague on me since then. Over the course of the years my life has continued to fall apart with me failing in school and other serious health problems within myself and family. This year has been the darkest year out of all mentally wise. I ended up falling in love with a girl online a year ago, ended up meeting twice and then on our one year anniversary she ended up breaking up over things that could of easily been fixed. She basically broke up with me because she couldnâ€™t handle how depressed I was.Ever since she broke up with me, life has been constantly taking a massive dump on me and I ended up hitting a point to where I got so depressed I dropped out of school to pursue my ged because I couldnâ€™t deal with the stress at school and at home.  I have lost so many friends over the last few years and I have become so isolated. I went from hanging out with friends every day to hanging out with them every few months because I have gotten into this state of isolation where I donâ€™t leave my room for more than a hour a day. I have my own bathroom and shower connected to my room and the only time I leave my house is to get the only meal I eat a day. My family has been trying to support me and be there for me every way they can but they can barely take care of themselves. My poor mother deserves the world and I wish I could give her the world. When my father passed apart of her died that day. She is currently struggling with major depressive disorder. Itâ€™s to a point where she doesnâ€™t do anything but lay in bed all day. I donâ€™t know what I can do to help myself now. Iâ€™ve been smoking weed every day for months now to try to numb out the pain but in the end itâ€™s just leading to a legitimate addiction to thc. And thatâ€™s something I donâ€™t want to admit to myself. I live every day suicidal and constantly putting a lot of blame and hate on myself. Iâ€™ve tried getting professional help but that doesnâ€™t even seem to help. Iâ€™ve been on medication too and that didnâ€™t work either. Iâ€™ve also attempted and self harmed in the past. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel like the only true way I can kill Myself is by  jumping in front of a train. I just donâ€™t see it ever getting better. I feel like all I do is mess up and make everyone hate me. The breakup with my ex girlfriend really set me off to be in a bad state these last few months and Iâ€™ve done nothing but beg for her back. I really donâ€™t see a future for myself. I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™ll get my ged and go to college. I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™ll be stable enough to live on my own and be successful. All I really see if myself dead. Thereâ€™s so much pain from so many things that I canâ€™t even talk about it in one sitting. Iâ€™m affected by everything that happens or anything anyone says to me. I can appear as a strong person but quickly I can become the weakest. So Iâ€™m really not sure what to do but want to die. I feel ungrateful saying that because there are other people who are in worse situations but i believe everyone has there own demons and depression. You could be the richest man in the world and feel suicidal. Everyone feels differently.
