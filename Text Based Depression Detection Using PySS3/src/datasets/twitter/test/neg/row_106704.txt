whats wrong with meI feel like doing deserve the life I have I feel like my hormones when into overdrive and made my friend  uncomfortable  they were sending a Snapchat pic and I ask for poses that are extreme sexually I feel like I don't like I should live on anymore live for what iv done to them I have said sorry and they forgive me but it feels like the second voice in my head said they will never forgive you never not until the day you die I don't know what to do anymore I feel like giving up I feel like a monster

it's funny I want to die but at the same time I'm scared
