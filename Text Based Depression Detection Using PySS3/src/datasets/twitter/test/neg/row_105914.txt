Parents are Abusive and Best Friend is UnsympatheticMan nothing like learning literally nobody in my life is on my side.  There is nothing more demoralizing than realizing literally no connection I have made in my entire existence has panned out to actually caring about my feelings. My family is abusive and controlling and the one person I thought I could trust (my best friend) has only become more apparent he literally doesn't care about me. Instead of helping me whenever I have a crisis he gets angry yells at me and blames me for whatever happened. I slowly have realized he literally doesn't really feel empathy for others. I tolerate it because I do care about him and we are similar and feel comfortable with each other. I'm extremely lonely and I struggle to make friends, he is the only close connection I have had for most of my life at this point.

I've fucked up, I walked from one unhealthy situation into another but I have no one I can turn to who will be sympathetic. I don't know that I want to off myself at this point but this has to be the lowest point I could hit.
