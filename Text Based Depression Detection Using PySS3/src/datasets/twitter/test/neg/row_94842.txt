Hey It's Me AgainIt's not like I *want* to die, but that thought is just piercing my mind. I've been cutting increasingly more dangerously (not caring about infections, more cuts at once, etc) and that's become incredibly addicting. I didn't say anything to a friend who just came back from a mental hospital. I feel like I'm losing myself, like I'm slipping from reality.

My dad can't afford anything. I hate going to my school counselor now, it has just become another chore. She isn't a bad counselor, it just never helps.

I hate myself more than anyone. All I can think about is that I don't deserve to live.

I've attempted to kill myself before, maybe I was supposed to die.
