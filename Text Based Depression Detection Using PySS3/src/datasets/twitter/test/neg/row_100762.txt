Is it worth it? Really?I've been diagnosed with it all. Depression. GAD. PTSD. Bipolar. Whatever. Whether all or any of those are true is pretty subjective. I've been to many psychologists, and have gotten contradictory opinions. Not sure where I was going with that...I suppose...I just wish I knew what was wrong with me. Is it something that with the perfect combo of therapy, meds, and support, I could have started to put behind me years ago? 

I have ups and downs. Mostly downs. Due to my disbelief in religion, most of my family all but disowned me a while ago. I had a pretty strong support system in my ex's family, but after a pretty nasty break up I've lost them as well. All I feel is lonely. I all but beg people to hang out with me, it feels like. I've pretty much just been fucking people so I don't have to sleep alone. That's not all I want. But, it seems like it's all I can get. 

I'm lying here in bed, sobbing, thinking that no one would notice I was gone. My rent is paid for the month. So are my bills. My job would just assume I quit, because people do that a lot there. In the grand scheme of things, I'm insignificant. I'm just another drain on the world's resources. Just another pussy. 

I'm rambling. 
I know.

 It would just be so easy to stop it all right now. I don't believe in an afterlife, so no fear of punishment. I don't know. I'll probably just get day drunk and black out instead. Nothing makes you forget loneliness like being unconscious. The forever unconscious just seems more and more appealing.
