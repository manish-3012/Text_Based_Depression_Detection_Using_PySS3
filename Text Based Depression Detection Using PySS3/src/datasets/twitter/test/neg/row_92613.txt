A perfect exitI literally have nothing to lose. I (23M) a grad student who has been struggling in every single aspect of life. Ofcourse, everybody is going to think that their life is the worst but you will be amazed how bad mine is. I have had no successful event in life. I had somehow been balancing on the edge of mediocracy and cigarettes to get through everyday of life. I just thought of the perfect moment where I can perfect exit and die while nobody would ever realise I am gone. My family might worry but it wouldnt be for long. Else, nothing else can notice I am gone. It could be a perfect exit. I simply want to drive up a hill and fall.
