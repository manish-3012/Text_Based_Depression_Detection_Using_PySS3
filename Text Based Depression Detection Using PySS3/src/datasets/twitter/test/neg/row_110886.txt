Smoking / self harm alternativesThe only things that seem to take the edge off at the moment are cutting and smoking. Trying to give up both but I am desperately craving a cigarette right now. Iâ€™m all out though, and Iâ€™m 17 so I canâ€™t exactly go out and get some more.  Thereâ€™s nothing else I can think of doing. What works for you guys? Please donâ€™t say â€˜go for a walkâ€™ or stuff like that because I canâ€™t - I have way too much work to do and itâ€™s quite late over here. Thanks :)
