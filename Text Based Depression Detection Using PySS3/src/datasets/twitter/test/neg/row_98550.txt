Wanted to kill myself on and off since I was 12 Iâ€™m 19 nowOnly thing that stops me everytime is I canâ€™t find the courage to do it, I want to so bad but I just get seem to get the courage. Before you say improve yourself and your life believe me I do every single day doing absolutely everything in my power to. Anyone else feel this way
