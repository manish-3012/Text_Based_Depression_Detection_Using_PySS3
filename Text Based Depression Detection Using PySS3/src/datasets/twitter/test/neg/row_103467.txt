Am I being overdramatic or should I end it all?A lot of people on here are in great distress because of their mental states and you can feel that in their posts. My case is a little different, I consider myself to be (usually) calm and rational but I just want my life to end.

Life hasnâ€™t been going the way it was promised to me by my teachers and my parents. Iâ€™m in college now and Iâ€™ve been studying hard and getting good grades but I get no pleasure from my success. I was told all my life thatâ€™s the key to success but I feel nothing.

Studying takes up nearly all of my time, which works due to my lack of social life. I spend all my time in the library, nose in book, for a subject that wasnâ€™t my first choice but my parentsâ€™. Since theyâ€™re helping me pay for school, I feel like they deserve input in what I study, but itâ€™s all I do and I donâ€™t like it, now Iâ€™m miserable.

My whole life Iâ€™ve had very few friends and was always somewhat of an outcast that didnâ€™t fit into your sitcom perception of school: jocks, goths, nerds, popular kids, I was none of. I never really dated or never found a relatable group of people. I thought that would change when I went to college but it hasnâ€™t. I know this is due to my constant studying but Iâ€™m not sure how I can change my habits (I almost feel like Iâ€™m addicted to my work if that makes sense.)

Being forced into this introverted state, I grew this deep hatred of myself for not being â€œnormal.â€ I truly believe that i am not meant to live in society perhaps because Iâ€™m too ugly, or awkward, or a billion different criticisms I tell myself daily. Iâ€™ve stopped smiling and laughing, walking through life seems like a chore.

Despite my introverted tendencies I love people. I like spending time with people but I have no one to spend time with. Iâ€™m on tinder and get a good amount of matches but those relationships are so superficial they fade too quickly. I feel as if Iâ€™m unrelatable to anyone else. This feeling of loneliness is really what makes me upset and causes me to have suicidal thoughts.

For the last month Iâ€™ve been almost entirely sober from nicotine and marijuana, what I was unconsciously using to drown out the sadness in my life. My clearer head has helped me reflect on this situation. 

Rather than live a life without human connections and relationships, without any joy, without purpose besides exams and quizzes, should I take the plunge and end it all now?

Tell me whatever you think (even if you think Iâ€™m acting like a baby, it may be justified!)

This is the lonely life I live every day so I need an outside perspective. Thanks for reading.
