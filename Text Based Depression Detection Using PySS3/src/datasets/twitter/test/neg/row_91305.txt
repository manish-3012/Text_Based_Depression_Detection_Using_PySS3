A veteran that is just fed up.I have been suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major anxiety and depression. Life is just getting harder and harder everyday I live on. Many of my issues I have caused on my own. A substantial amount of debt can't keep a job to save my life and not having friends to relay on. Medication and doctor visits only do so much. I will be fine for a few weeks and then all of sudden the demons come out to play and torture me. I have had enough of the consistent torture for the many years I have suffered. I just can't handle it anymore....... I will never wish what I go though on my worst enemy.
