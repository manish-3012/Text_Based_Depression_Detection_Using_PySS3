My exhaustion is causing my mind to tackle down the dark road.I had a really hard night last night. About 3 hours of sleep and woke up to an intense headache. Couldn't get back to sleep. My levels of exhaustion keeps building. I'm hardly tired when it's bed time and I wake in the morning just as tired as the previous day. There are also my headaches, chronic headaches. I've had some form of headache everyday for years. Today is one of my lowest.
I want rest and nothing will help. I want to drink something costic and take pills. I'm sitting in my work truck typing this nearly in tears from the pain. I needed to let this out or I might drive my 17k lbs work truck into a wall. Idk, I'm hoping for an easier day.
