I'm going to kill myself because women hate meBeing lonely and unlovable is a miserable life. I'm 30 and never knew a woman that liked me so I know I'm a fundamentally unattractive and worthless person. I'm ugly as sin and the fact no woman has ever liked me is proof I'm a bad person too.

If I killed myself the world would be a better place for everyone. I just make people's lives a little bit worse just by being around. Killing myself is the best possible thing I could ever do for this world.

I'm sick of this shit and the pain just won't go away. I can't get over it. I'm reminded that I'm worthless and unlovable everyday.
