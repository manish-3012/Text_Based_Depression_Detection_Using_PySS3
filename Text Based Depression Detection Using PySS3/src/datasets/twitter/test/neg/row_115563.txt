25, heartbroken through my own fault, no friends, no energy, no hopeI've thought seriously about suicide on three occasions in the past two months. One time it took someone coming off his shift at the hospital to hold me back as I was preparing myself to jump off a bridge. I'm scared, but I'm getting to the point that I'm starting to not care anymore as nothing changes after these close calls.

I've had troubles most of my life. My parents were quite old when they had me so I lost all my grandparents and my dad early on. I always struggled making friends, and any that I did made never lasted, in fact we usually ended up as enemies. I stayed away from school as much as I could &amp; spent most of my secondary school days at home watching porn. I just scraped the grades to get into sixth form &amp; then into a good university. Nothing really changed there either though, I always wanted more company but isolated myself and felt like I couldn't fit in. I went off for a working holiday after university and again alienated the first friend I made there and isolated myself. 

One of my very few university friends (3) said her employer were recruiting and I got a job there, where she introduced me to her group of friends. One year on, a girl in the group mentioned her tenancy was running out around the same time as mine and we decided to find a place together even though we weren't very close at all. What ensued was 3 months of finally feeling normal. She matched me in every way, religious beliefs, humour, family upbringing, down to the smallest details. She was the kind of girl that every guy turns to look at. She came from a very well off family. After flirting for months we began a 'relationship'. I didn't treat her right throughout it because of a wide array of issues and fear. But we still became the closest friends we'd ever had, we spent almost every waking moment together, so she saw the real me &amp; I knew her inside out, all the coincides felt like they weren't that at all, but rather this was a gift that was always meant to be, I loved and cared for her more than anything in my life and she did too, but the issues on my side stuck around. 6 months later, I got extremely drunk, I cheated on her, I came clean but it was the one thing she couldn't deal with, and we were done.

The last three months I spent couchsurfing near a job she started a week after my mistake, we met up and got closer occasionally but then I'd push to get back together and ruin everything again. Last weekend was the last straw where we had an event, I promised I would act appropriately but having heard the night before from her that it was best we started stepping away again (she got drunk and called me), I got overwhelmed and basically proved I was incapable of handling my drink and keeping my promises again. This was my dream girl, we both wanted to marry each other, though we never said it until after the mistake. My life felt finally sorted, and now it's worse than ever - issues with my family, a job I can't concentrate on and who seem to be losing faith in me, no home to call my own, no friends still, no energy to face the future, and really no hope. I feel like I ruined a the best thing the universe was ever going to send me, and now I have nothing, I have less than before when I was clinging on to the hope that something great would eventually come my way. I've never felt like I belonged in this world, I was clung on in the hope that someone out there would change my mind. They did, and I basically threw them away, I don't have the will to go on now.
