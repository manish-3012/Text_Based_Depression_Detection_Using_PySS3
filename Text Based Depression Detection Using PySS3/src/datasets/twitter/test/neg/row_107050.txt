I visit the bridge everyday.I wait. Ive dealt with suicide my entire life. Starting from year 6, I've tried to commit 4 times. Even when I was young, I didn't feel apart of anything. I saw and see a world of users and fucked up measures of success, love, friendship. I, want none of this. 
Night after night, I sob to myself and wonder why I'm here. 
I hate me &amp;amp; you. So now, I take a stroll along golden gate everyday. So many eyes, resting toward me, and I can't do it. I can't have someone see that. 
In childhood, I witnessed the death of a man, and I couldn't help but think "I wish that was me." No more sadness or happiness in its fleeting nature, just outside my grasp, unattainable in my mind. 
One day I will jump. One day, I'll be free.

Edit: I want to thank everyone who has been kind to me. Z, I still love you, and I'm so glad you found someone to share your life with. You are an amazing person, and I haven't been able to love someone like I loved you, ever. Mom, you did the very best you could. I'm sorry I have no children. Sorry about a ton of things.  To my sperm donor dad, thank you. I've never had high expectations, so I've never been dissatisfied with you.. My siblings, you are awesome, and I wish I wasn't decades apart from you. Keep on keeping on, do right by each other, and goodbye. You have my respect, and envy.
