I'm not sure what I'm going to do today. I want to kill myself. Here's my story.I've lived with that stone in my gut for almost my whole life. That deep sinking feeling. I get random bouts of anxiety, and I'm living a great long lie that is going to end one way or another today. I struggle with the thought that I did everything to get myself where I am today. I lied to people, ignored them, and made all the wrong choices. 

Born to a Pakistani Muslim dad and an American mostly nonreligious mom. I've always been smart in the "book smart but lazy and accident prone" way. Prone to bouts of depression since I was little, I struggled to understand what I wanted from life and reconcile my thoughts with my culture. I grew up with my dad's side, was taught to read the Quran and pray, and I vehemently hated it on the inside. I remember thinking all the bad words I knew when I was young and forced to pray. I'd just make up stuff with whatever words I knew. "Quran is a fuck" is my favorite I remember. My mom wasn't prominent in this part of my life. I didn't even know who she was until I was a young boy, not sure what age. Maybe 6. She financially nearly ruined my dad twice, and I see a lot of myself in her. Kicking cans of problems down the road until they grow into something unmanageable. There's depression in our genetics, I think. My older brother is like me as well. My younger brother is like my dad. Financially a success, sociable and well liked but has a temper. I was mostly raised by my aunts and grandmother who were all conservative Muslims and mostly the sometimes verbally abusive authority types. My grandmother is a crazy mystic ritualistic person and raging narcissist. My dad let them live with us as a stepping stone to their lives in America. 


I put up with that life until high school when I started exploring sex and alcohol. I met a girl who I eventually moved away from home with after just two years or so, after a long, bitter fight about it with my dad. I moved back after 8 months because the girl wasn't ready for life in general and we struggled to get by, and she wasn't very supportive of much I wanted to do. List goes on. Anyway I picked up a taste for alcohol during my time away, and that ends that chapter. 


Returning home I was 19 years old with a convincing fake ID and already alcoholic. I tried to talk to my dad about depression and religion. Upon hearing I don't believe he said if it wasn't against his religion he would've killed himself. Welp. I "took it back" and accepted the faith. My lying really ramped up. I lied about going to school when I was really spending my days sitting in a school parking lot drinking when nobody was looking. I kept it up for over a year until my financial aid stopped and I was eventually caught. Somebody at the fin aid office broke confidentiality and told my dad everything about my grades. Convinced I could recover, I re-enrolled after appealing my aid and seeing a therapist (once). I relapsed. Bad grades, drinking. This time my dad was watching my grades online. They didn't get really bad until the end. 


Begin final chapter. I think at the end of Fall '14 or Spring '15 I left my house in the middle of the night and bought a plane ticket to Austin TX, planning to leave it all behind and start over. Dad saw money taken out of my account at an airport ATM, came down and searched our (small) airport for me, found me. I told him why I was leaving and he assured me I could stay and be whoever I wanted and get better. I agreed. I stayed. Now with newfound freedom, I improved quite a bit. But I couldn't keep it up. I found depression and anxiety creeping back, my passion for school draining away, and drinking again. But nobody was watching my grades or attendance. I lied and lied and lied until the expectation of graduation emerged. My younger brother graduated before I did. So I kept saying yeah I'm gonna graduate. We even made invites and sent them out. Graduation is today. I'm not graduating. I'm all lies. From when I was little I lied about small stuff and big stuff all the time. I can't summon any will for continuing on. 


Only the pain my friends and family would feel has kept me from doing it until now. But now I don't know if I can face what comes next. I don't have the ambition to pick up these pieces anymore. There have been planes I've been on that I begged the universe to crash, car accidents I wished I was a part of. Only the last 2 months or so have I been seriously suicidal. I feel guilty about these feelings because most people see me as having been born with a silver spoon. Not sure what I'm gonna do the next few hours. I have a gun, but I also have an intellect and family and possibly a future if I get it together. 


I've been living the last year as sort of an audience of my own life. This is me fulfilling that fantasy before we see what happens next. Thank you for reading.
