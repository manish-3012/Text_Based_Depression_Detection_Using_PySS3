I canâ€™t stop thinking about death.Hi, Iâ€™m Kat, 16, and in 10th grade. 

Iâ€™m honestly trying to get better, but I keep getting suicidal thoughts from even the tiniest problems. I want to die so fucking bad and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this. I feel so pathetic since nobody takes what I have to say seriously and they think Iâ€™m â€œcrying wolfâ€ when I reference suicide and death. All I want is for someone to stop me because Iâ€™m scared, but I just want the pain to stop and this is seemingly the only other option. 

Iâ€™m tired, I really am. Iâ€™m over everything and if nobody believes that Iâ€™m actually going to do it, then so be it- Iâ€™ll prove them wrong anyways.
