Should I Kill Myself?I already know your answer. It's going to be 'no'. Why though? I've been molested, abused, and assaulted. Even just typing that gave me the shivers. I tried living like Elizabeth Smart- to just keep on living and to be happy. To not give those men that hurt me any more satisfaction. Any more of my time. Trying that gave me panic attack after panic attack until I snapped. I'm not her. I can't just live. I want to feel free. That's what I want most in this world. So why do people care so much if someone takes their own life? What is life really worth, anyway? We're all just people. Why do people care so much if other people cease to exist? Why am I not allowed to kill myself? Go ahead- give me a link to some hotline. I'm sorry.
