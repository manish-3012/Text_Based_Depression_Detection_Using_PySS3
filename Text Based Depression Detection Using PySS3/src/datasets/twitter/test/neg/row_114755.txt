Can I OD on 10 10mg Lexapro pills?Ive just had enough. I'm tired and exhausted. Im 19 and life has never been good. I had a ted bundy of a mother and an enabling father that was never there for us. I've been abused psychologically, verbally, physically, etc. Ive been sexually abused and raped on a regular basis for 8 years of my life. This is the 3rd time i started failing classes and it's still my first year. This isn't the first time i thought about suicide, in fact i tried committing suicide twice before, first time when i was 12, second time when i was 18 which both failed. I need to get 1650$ to pay last months rent by tomorrow, and then another 1200 on 1st to pay rent again or im gonna deal with the same issue ive been dealing with for months. Plus im in debt to the bank 1100 too. I've been a closted exmuslim for 3-4 years now. 

So as you can see, ive given up. Ive had enough of this shit. I got 10 Lexapro pills and a shit ton of prazosin pills. Will that be enough to kill me?
