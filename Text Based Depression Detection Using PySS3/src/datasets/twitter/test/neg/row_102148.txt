I have no freedom. I hate epilepsy. Drinking is the only time I'm happyI can't drive, I can't do many jobs, I have to be careful doing everything from walking to class to even drinking coffee. 


I'm 21, I can't drink (yet I still do. I drink a lot of hard liquor. It's the only time I'm happy. I drink to the point of being black out. I fall asleep at random house parties, but do I care? No. Drinking is the only time happy), I can't drive, I have no freedom. I have to have my abusive parents drive me everywhere "do you really need to go to your neurologist? Do you really need to go to your eye doctor? Do you really need to get an MRI?"


I hate not driving. I hate it. I have no freedom. I'm locked inside the house. My friends don't even see me anymore. I don't know why, granted my depression got bad but they never talk to me, we never make plans, they never see me. Now that I lost my license I lost everything.  


And the kicker is I was born epileptic and every neurologist said there's no hope of my epilepsy going away. What's the point if I have to live everyday like this?
