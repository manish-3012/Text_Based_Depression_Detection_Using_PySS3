I don't understand why I am like thisI have a family that loves me and Ive never been deprived of anything.I have friends. Nothing really bad has happened to me. So why do I feel so miserable all the time?
Why do I fantasize about killing myself everyday?
What is wrong with me?
Why am I such a failure?
