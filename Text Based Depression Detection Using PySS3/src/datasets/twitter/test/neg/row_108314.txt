Feeling HelplessI called the helpline . They talked to me a little and said talk to someone near you . I did . It did not help . So i guess nothing can be done . I would hate to be in a hospital . It will just make things worse because if i get out , i will now have a sure reason to go ahead with it . Main point is , i am struggling very much . I am tired of the pain , the suffering , the anguish . I truly believe that everything will be better if i just go ahead . I really do not have anyone who can help or anyone who understands . I am alone basically . I hate the feeling and i am tired . It feels bad when mo one gives a shit really . I just want to go away . Just dissapear.
