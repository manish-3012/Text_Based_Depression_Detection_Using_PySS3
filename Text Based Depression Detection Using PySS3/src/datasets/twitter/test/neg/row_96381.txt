Iâ€™m out of ideasIâ€™ve completely run out of money and have no idea what to do. I live in an extremely expensive city and feel trapped. I lost my job, most of my friends, my partner, and I feel completely abandoned. I have no one. 

Iâ€™m currently building an â€œexit hoodâ€ â€” it seems like the best way to go apart from jumping off a bridge into the east river.
