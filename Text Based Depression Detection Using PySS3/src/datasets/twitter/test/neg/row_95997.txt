My life nowMy mom left me when I was 14 years old and things only got worse from there. I struggled with bullying and trying to fit-in in elementary school and often fell asleep thinking it would be good if someone killed me while I slept. After my mom left my family I broke down and didnâ€™t really function as a person for a few months, my dad forced me to go to therapy for a few years and the experience was extremely difficult for me. I was also forced into one family therapy session that was so traumatic for me I still get scared thinking about it now. I feel like Iâ€™m just never going to be happy, like whatever makes other people happy is just not something I can have. I fell in love with a girl in high school and was pretty hopeful about that for a while, it didnâ€™t work out though. Still miss her every day. I am typing this in a cemetery next to where I live thinking about being one of the hundreds of bodies in the ground that surround me. My room has a window a couple hundred feet high, I think about letting myself fall a lot. There isnâ€™t any help for me, when I try therapy now I just get anxiety attacks and none of the pills Iâ€™ve been given have helped either. Iâ€™m just a square peg on this round planet and one day Iâ€™ll just fade away until no one remembers me at all. Sorry for the long story, just wanted to let it out for a minute
