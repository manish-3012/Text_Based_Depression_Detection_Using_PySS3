I've been on meds for 3 months and now they're no longer workingI actually didn't mind being alive during those months. You can even see I was doing so well, that I haven't even posted in this sub in forever, when before it would be daily. Right now, I want to stick a gun in my mouth and pull the fucking trigger. This is a fucking joke.
