This needs to endI hate everything about my life. I feel miserable every morning, why would someone waste their time waking up to the same results. Iâ€™m flunking out of college and my dad is paying for it. I feel like killing myself over this.

 I fucking hate working at that job, I feel miserable there. I donâ€™t fit in anywhere. Please tell me why a rational creature would keep living in such circumstances. Killing yourself would be a smarter decision. 


I keep wasting time on internet looking up stupid motivational videos and dumb articles on how to stop being afraid of following your dreams. Nothing works. Iâ€™m fucking unmotivated with low energy. Nothing fucking works anymore.
