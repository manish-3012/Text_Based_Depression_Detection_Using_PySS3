Should I break up now or later if I decide to kill myself?My relationship is not at itâ€™s best right now. I might kill myself in February so Iâ€™m trying to decide if I should break up with him now so he doesnâ€™t have to be close to me when it happens or if I should stay and make things better and then break it off before I do? I donâ€™t know what to do. I love him so fucking much and breaking up is the LAST thing I want but I feel like itâ€™s already unfair for me to kill myself and itâ€™d be even more unfair to still be in a relationship when I do. He also the only reason Iâ€™m not relapsing right now so if we broke up now I might just end up using and ODing whether intentional or not sooner than feb. I really donâ€™t want to break up with him. But if Iâ€™m gonna kill myself I think I should.
