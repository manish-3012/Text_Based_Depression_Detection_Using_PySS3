This world and everyone in it is fake and a lieMoney is the centre of everything, some fake made up bullshit that isn't even real, just to be able to live by working 99 percent of shit jobs, full shit dickheads for the vast majority of your life

People are all fake, a lie, they don't give a fuck about you, everyone breaks up, fucks you over, and eventually leaves anyway 

Politics, climate change, animal cruelty and a bunch of other shit should be a no brainer, but there is always some rich fucks ruining it all and not doing shit, normal people not giving a shit

I always fantasies about a utopian world where there is no cruelty, having options and choices, living in sync with the natural environment but that is never going to happen because humans are fucking plagues

I hope we get wiped out soon, I fucking can't stand modern society, full of fucking bullshit that shouldn't even matter, with extremely high standards 

Fuck this world, I'll do it and myself a favour by leaving and not coming back
