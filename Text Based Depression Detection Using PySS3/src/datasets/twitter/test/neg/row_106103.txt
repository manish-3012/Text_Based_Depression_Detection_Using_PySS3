Iâ€™m going to commit suicideIâ€™m going to commit Suicide in the next couple of days. [m17]


Last night I was close to ending it, but for some reason I turned back like a fucking pussy. Not sure if I should provide some context as to what lead me to this choice. 

 Some extended family came for New Years, and will stay for a couple of days. I will most likely be left alone so Iâ€™ll be able too leave without a question. Just wondering if Iâ€™ll have the guts to do it once Iâ€™m on the edge or, will I linger around. I have no one to talk to which makes the situation worse but, Iâ€™m committed already &amp; need to go through with this soon or, I will never do it. Hey, at least I made it through 2018 thats good enough, right??

I donâ€™t want to leave anything behind, just this post. Iâ€™m not leaving any notes. Donâ€™t want to give more questions than answers.

Worst case scenario itâ€™s a failed suicide, and I end up hospitalized or, I get the cops called on me lmao. 

Anyways Iâ€™ve been rambling for a long time, and itâ€™s almost New Years.
