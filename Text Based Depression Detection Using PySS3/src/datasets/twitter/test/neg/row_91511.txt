Overthinking and crying about it.hey, thank you for taking your time to read my story. 

so first of all i am a 15 year old boy. and my life is pretty great in my opinon; i do sports, money is fine, great relationship with my family and friends, doing good at school eg.

but my problems started in the summer on vacation. i sometimes couldn't sleep and started overthinking about everything. this resulted in me crying about because of different things like letting down people and my self and not achieving anything, me not knowing what i want to do with my life eg.

i got back from my vacation and it has been happening since but now as well in the day and even when people are around (then ill hide that i'm crying or i cry in silence). and i am so confused with why it was sudden and i dont really now what to do now.

TL;DR: i have been overthinking a lot and cry because of it and now i'm confused on what to do.

i hope someone could give me some advice on what to do or share their personal stories.

sorry if this doesn't belong here i'll remove it if necessary.
