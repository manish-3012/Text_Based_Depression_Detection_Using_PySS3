2021 might be my last yearFor a year or 2 now i have been thinking about ending all at the end of next year if my life doesn't turn around, because by then if nothing changes ill be 21, jobless and without a drivers license, and i dont think that i can handle that for another year, i dont know how ill end it but im thinking of jumping off something, or seeing if i can od on something and if all else fails ill just slit my wrists when i know no one will be home for a while so i can die in peace, 

TLDR: Im probably going to kill myself by the end of next year if i cant turn my life around.
