i triedmy girlfriend of five years told me the other day that she's "incredibly attracted to" our roomate. this is after weeks of me feeling like she's been flirting with him. yesterday morning, she yelled at me over something, and i got tipped me over and i went out on my motorcycle. and wrecked. 

but i'm still here. and i'm in a lot of pain. and i just want to curl up in a ball and die. fuck. i thought i was over depression. really thought i was okay. i wish i could talk to anyone.
