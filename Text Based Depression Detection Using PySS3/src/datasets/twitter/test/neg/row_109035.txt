Every friend I have leaves. Am I just an annoyance? Probably. Maybe I deserve to die.Everyone leaves me because of my stupidity. For some reason I manage to push anyone that ever meant something to me away. I know my parents love me, but for some reason that just never feels like enough motivation to keep on living. I always say to myself "I'll probably kill myself, but maybe not" when something like this happens. I can't tell my parents and I have nobody who actually wants to hear it. I'm mentally unstable and probably don't deserve life because of what a waste of space I am...
