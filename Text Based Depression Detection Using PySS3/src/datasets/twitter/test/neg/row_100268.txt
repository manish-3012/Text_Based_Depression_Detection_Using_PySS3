Suicidal againI feel suicidal again today.  Though I have never acted on them, I have had suicidal thoughts since I was a child. I feel like I am lost, hopeless, I have nothing positive to look forward to.  I can no longer apreciate anything because nearly every day just feels so bad.

I have bipolar disorder, so I know that even if things get better for a little while they will just get awfully bad again.  The depression, the psychosis, the awful angry spells, they always come back.  I don't want to talk to anyone in my life about this because 1) I don't want to worry them 2) this happens VERY frequently and if I came to them every time I felt this way they would burn out 3) when things get bad enough I don't want anyone to try and save me.

I have lost all of my hobbies and interests.  I was exercising every day, drawing, sewing, painting now all of that's gone. I just cry when I think of trying to get back into any of the things I used to like doing.  Anything besides watching TV is just too much anymore.   

Sure, this isn't the worst I have ever felt but I'm just so tired of feeling bad every day, crying at my desk every day.  Living any longer seems like a waste.  Some day, I know I'm going to die at my own hand, I have thought that for a long time now and don't see how it's avoidable.
