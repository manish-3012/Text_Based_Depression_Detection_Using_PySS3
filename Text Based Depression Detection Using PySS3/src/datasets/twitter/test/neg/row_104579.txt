Plan on killing myself after final grades are outYea. I know grades don't matter in general because of experience and all that stuff but for me it's bullshit. Utter fucking bullshit because I want to go to medical school. I know medical schools don't have a GPA cutoff but in general it's 3.5 at minimum and unfortunately I'm Chinese so I have to hit that 3.7 average instead. 

I'm pretty sure I fucked up my finals in orgo 2 and calc 2 (Im a chemistry major) and I'll probably end up with a 2.0 this semester which will definitely bring down my current 3.55. It's most likely my fault for not studying hard enough and maybe going back to school immediately after being hospitalized for another failed suicide attempt just months apart but ah... it's honestly because I just want to become a doctor and go to medical school. I know medical schools don't look kindly upon mental health issues seeing it as a liability, nor do they like leaves of absences and they'll question your credibility to become a doctor if you don't have certain grades and the fucking premed culture at my university is toxic as shit with back stabbing and sabotaging that I unfortunately had to deal with. Hell, fuck those med school adcoms on their high horses but I have to appease to them so I can achieve my dream of becoming a doctor and to help people in need even if it means I'll be sacrificing my own sanity and health. I've always wanted to be a doctor since I was eight, that dream still hasn't changed 12 years later even after all my previous suicide attempts being linked to grades and school performance and feeling like I fucked up my future and chances of becoming a MD. I keep telling myself it's only temporary, just hold on to these 4 years, get through them and once you're in you're in and you'll be able to erase a piece of that anxiety but now I don't even think I can hold on that much longer. I don't want to go to the mental hospital, I've been there a couple times already and I also don't have a good view of them either being abused and sexually assault in one of them as a child (still fucking pissed off the at both them and the police for doing nothing and still having their doors opened) Ah.. Im just tired of feeling this dread and never ending doom and inadequacy and always feeling like my future is on the line. Maybe I'm just tired and burned out, I just want to fall asleep forever and never wake up again. Just disappear quietly without notice so maybe I can minimize the pain my family, friends, and readers (I write draw a fairly popular webmanga that includes topics of mental illness and suicide that serves as an outlet for me as well ironic as it is)  will feel. 

If you're wondering, yes I do see a psychiatrist and therapist daily, though the meds don't do much for me other than to prevent me from being completely non-functional when depressed, and therapy still doesn't change the reality I have to face, other than to accept it or not admit it to be objectively real when it is. I just want to give up. Sometimes enough is enough and the end has come. Sorry for the ridiculous long rant, I'm just really upset and hopeless.
