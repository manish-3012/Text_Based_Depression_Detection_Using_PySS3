Why Did My Depression Come Back? How Can I Keep it at Bay?I thought I got treated for this. I thought I got rid of it but I keep slipping back into the same thoughts, keep thinking that I'm worthless, even when presented with evidence to the contrary. It sucks and I hate it. Sometimes I do want to take my own life but then I think hard about the people in my life. A wonderful girlfriend. A loving mother. A brother that I would do anything for and always has by back, even when I piss him off. They make sure that the knife, bottle, and gun stay a good deal away from my hands when I see the void yawning in front of me and begging to just release and escape.

 Not sure why I'm writing this. Maybe I just needed to vent. In any case, thanks for reading. Depression sucks, but knowing that there's a lot of people around here that also suffer from it but stay around even when the thoughts of suicide pop into their heads makes me feel like I can keep going through the slog of life.

I would like some advice though, because I'm afraid to admit my depression to those closest to me and get their advice. I thought I beat it once, but it's staying around and I feel bad for letting it slip back into my life. What do people do to keep those thoughts at bay? What can I do as a meager human in this soul rending existence to keep the depressive patterns out of my life? If no one has a solution I'll take a vague hint as to how to start. Really anything, because I'm having a hard go.
