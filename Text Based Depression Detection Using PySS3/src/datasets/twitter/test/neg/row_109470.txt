I should be grateful for what i have, yet i want to die.Im currently sitting in bed at 2am with my mind racing. I honestly dont know why my brain is so fucked up. Y cant things work out like i want them too for once. 

My family is whole and they love me, yet i feel unloved and a burden on others lives. I have few friends that are close yet feel so lonely. Robin willams said that "I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone." My favorite quote. Connects with me on a deep level. 

Ending my self seems far fetched yet it seems so close. My mind is racing with these negative thoughts and i cant get rid if them.

 I want to help others but life says no. If i cant do what i love doing why live at all. I want to say that people can have a lot if things, money, power, fame. I dont want any. Life guves people advantages. I was given a great family after another threw me out at birth. Was this the only lemon life gave me. No. I was given a lemon tree. I can understand how blessed i am compared to others who wish to end themselves. But for some reason, i cannot bring myself a reason for living l.

I know im speaking mumbo jumbo right now,  too many thoughts cross my mind and i can oy write a few. 

I just need someone to talk to really.
