honestly don't understand: why do people want to save others' lives when they want to die?If people really want to die I just don't understand why others want to save their lives. I am killing myself this Friday and I have not told anyone in my life because they would get all worried and want to save me...but they don't care about me on a day-to-day basis; it's like some sort of moral/ethical "suicide is bad" obligation. So that leads me to think, maybe it's the IDEA of death they want to prevent? I don't know. I honestly don't get it. There are a lot of really smart people on here, so I figured someone could give me some insight? Just trying to understand :) Thanks.
