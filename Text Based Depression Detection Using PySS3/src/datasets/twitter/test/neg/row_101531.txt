I finally realized that the world just wants me to goTitle. And an alt.

Anyways. I met a friend on here who I really clicked with. We talked for 8 fucking hours of VC on discord.

They asked so much about me. And I said so much about me. I felt a connection. All this came crumbling down when they said â€œDo you think youâ€™d get bored of someone even if they were perfect?â€ And I explained I may need a few day break from the relationship after a while.

He got fucking pissed. Pissed! And telling me Iâ€™m always contradicting myself and he thought we wanted the same thing. Iâ€™m now fucking crying because I canâ€™t lose someone else.

I tried to explain, but he was having none of it. So I roll over and just feel myself get tired. Weâ€™re still arguing, and he asks â€œAre you going to bed?â€ And I say no.

I kept apologizing and crying pathetically because Iâ€™m a worthless manipulative bitch, right? And he goes on to say heâ€™s going to unfriend me. My toxic bitch brain did NOT like that.

I start BEGGING him to stay. Crying and whimpering and just being gross. He finally says he will, and I kept asking him to please not lie and to promise (I think I was age regressing at this point from stress?).

Anyways, he keeps asking questions and my stupid bitch self kept replying. Cue to him asking me why Iâ€™m making such a show. I explained I had never begged anyone to stay before, and he doubted that, he doubted that even after knowing about my past abusive relationships! He also told me that the math Iâ€™m doing in school is some â€œbaby levelâ€ and regardless of my grades (I have above A- in EVERY class) Iâ€™m definitely not going to med school. Heâ€™s right. Why would they want me?

Well, he then asked me if I thought I was toxic, and I hate myself, so I said yes. He then replied, â€œYeah, youâ€™re pretty toxic, and hangs up and unfriends me. The fucking panic attack after was unreal.

I have gotten like 2 hours of sleep. I fucking cared about him. And he commented on how I clearly am not available cause my main has a bunch of vents on it. I deleted those vents. I clearly donâ€™t deserve to even be treated like a person. 

I just realized right there that the world IS trying to kill me. It doesnâ€™t want me here. Iâ€™m not allowed to be happy. Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m bottom of the barrel. Every single time I get a little nugget of happiness, the world laughs in my face and steals it, then kicks me into the ground.

This might be a note. It might not. But itâ€™s the shit that finally broke me. Congratulations. Iâ€™m sorry.
