Am I even suicidal?My life in general is pretty unsatisfying. I've got to a point where I still don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I don't seek death, but I don't seek to avoid it either. I literally don't care one way or the other if I live or die. I don't see why I should. As long as I live, dying will always continue to be an option. Once I die, it won't matter to me how long I lived because I won't get to remember any of it anyways (I have no reason to believe any sort of afterlife exists).

I don't even really know what I'm asking, I'm just really confused. I probably shouldn't even bother posting this, but I feel like I need to put some kind of cry for help somewhere.
