(21f) Playing with the idea of suicide has become comfortingI just put my age and gender for context, really, and for the bigger picture. I have a long past in depression and anxiety and self destruction and self harm. This is the worst Ive felt in a while since "recovering".

Depression feels like my soft friend, stroking my face or something. The only one that really understands when I'm lying in bed at night crying silent tears for the millionth time. I would be lying if I said I am surprised I became this loser with little friends, no job, meh grades, unable to drive... wow when you put it all together like that it sounds much worse. The only things I look forward to is stupid stuff like Rick and forty season 3. 

How to do it "just in case" has been coming back and forth to me. I finally googled if you can OD on my meds. It's hard to. I guess there's no nice way to. But as I said, it's comforting to play with when Lana is in my ears and I'm staring up at the ceiling for hours at  flashing candle shadows.

Bad stuff has been happening to me. My ex is my best friend and she is still in love with her ex. And she went to meet her and realised she still feels for her. And I texted her while she was out with a friend and she called me "clingy". On FaceTime it was dark and she was calling my name asking if I was awake and I ignored her voice pretending I was until she hung up. That's the first time I've done that. And I just feel her slipping away. My best friend. Upon other mountainous bullshit, I spend my days pretty much waiting for them to be over. Lying in bed. Watching the same youtube videos over and over again because I've seen them all, yet I have nothing else I want to do except that and eat.

Suicide is my comfort because it is my plan B. If things don't go to my plan it is comforting to know I have a get out.

I just don't think it's ever gonna stop. Not now. Not for a bit. But in the future I'm scared I'm gonna start collecting things to kill myself with leading up to December, and that I can't control it.
