To whom it may concernTo whom it may concern,

This letter will explain why i choose to take my own life. I am 19 years old and haven't had the easiest of times. My dad left 5 years ago and stole my life savings meaning I was forced to take out a loan to get to university. I have little to no money when im studying (like most students) but its made worse by the fact that i know my dad took the money and pissed it up the wall. The past 6 months have probably been the hardest i've encountered in my life and I want to see a doctor but i cannot. 6 months of being on the verge of tears and being sad and upset for no reason has been hard. The next few months can only get worse and i don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Me and my girlfriend are at breaking point and i'm ready to go pretty much. My mum is a great person and has been through cancer and depression after my dad left, leaving me to care and look after her as best i could. My mum has done an amazing job, mostly of my sister as she is now well on the way to success and enjoying the rest of her life and pursuing her dream. Unfortunately for me I don't think i can achieve this. She doesn't know how I feel and she doesnt know about the 30+ scars i have that i've done to myself to relieve the pain. Being away from home has had its ups and downs but like i said, as summer comes in and i leave to go home things can only get worse. I'm ready to go, this is what i want i think. I have concidered seeing a doctor many times but I'm either too embarrassed or I don't think i can get out of this rut. My friends have most of the time been great, as friends go, these people are the best.

 Do not mourn my passing or grieve because I will be in a better place. Even if there is no afterlife or no heaven I am better off not on this planet. 

I don't know where I will go when i take my last breath but that breath is coming soon, within the next few weeks.

To all the people that took the piss, bullied me and said i couldn't do anything or succeed, Fuck you!

Thank you
