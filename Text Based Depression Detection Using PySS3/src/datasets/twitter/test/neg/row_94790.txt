Should I stay or should I go?Today is the day. But I am having second thoughts. I have tools in my backpack to do the deed after work. I want to go though with it, because I hate myself so very much, and I feel like my life in in an irreparable place, and i just want this ball of paranoia in my stomach to go away. I am scared of the damage im going to leave behind. I have no empathy left for family. I could care less how my parents or siblings are going to feel, my girlfriend is not going to be to happy about this. I have twin daughters who are 10 months old, and they are the only people who I actually care for. They do not understand, all they will know is daddy isn't around anymore. No more playtime, no more funny faces, no more snuggles. I want to push through for them, but I cant... I just cant handle these emotions and this constant whirlwind in my mind anymore. I am such a piece of shit for even thinking about this. I am in my office right now until 5, and than i want to do it. I may go to the hospital instead, I haven't decided yet, either way, this is getting settled tonight.
