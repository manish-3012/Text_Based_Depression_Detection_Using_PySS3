Iâ€™m tired of this world.Iâ€™m so exhausted from the rat race, im so exhausted from feeling like Iâ€™m lost. Iâ€™m tired of always putting so much effort, time, care and love only for shit to blow up in my face. Iâ€™m tired of a mindless job that leaves me feeling unfulfilled. Iâ€™m tired of giving you my all only to have no respect or reciprocated love in return. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so alone even around people. Iâ€™m tired of having to do drugs just to feel somewhat alive. Iâ€™m tired of waking up. Iâ€™m tired of the news always making me feel hopeless. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like my family ignores me. Iâ€™m tired of always being in some for of physical pain. I hate my body. I hate my mind. I hate my soul. Iâ€™m tired of hating myself so much every day that I canâ€™t stop hearing a voice in my head reassuring me of my worthlessness. I hope I die. I hope I perish. Lord I hope you take me away now because this world is not for me. I hope I can die and it will all be reset so I can try again. I canâ€™t stop thinking as suicide as a reset button. I canâ€™t stop convincing myself thatâ€™s the case so that I can one day believe it and restart my life that has no gone off the rails. Itâ€™s not a good life. Itâ€™s a perpetual struggle. I wish I was somewhere else but I canâ€™t be. I wish I could start over again... Iâ€™m so tired...
