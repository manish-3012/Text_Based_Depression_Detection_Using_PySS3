I don't see the point in living anymore.I was diagnosed with clinical depression two years ago after I failed at killing myself (I was 17 at the time), and went through the standard myriad of medications and therapy, none of which worked. The past two years have been spent trying to distract myself from reality, usually unsuccessfully. Despite still being generally unhappy, I had managed to hold onto my convictions and keep a vague hope that the future would be better up until last month. Since then I've started reading about nihilism and questioning if there's even a point to continue living.

Nothing that previously mattered to me does anymore. I used to care about people, at least in theory, and I was a vegetarian and supported animal rights. Now it all seems futile since everything will die anyway. I've found myself completely ambivalent to the suffering and death of others. I've gone from complete pacifism to wanting to inflict harm on my college roommates, where I was able to tolerate them previously. I can't even enjoy my old methods of escape anymore.

I guess me typing this out means at least a part of me wants to not die, or just be proven wrong that suicide is the best option. But I don't see how it isn't. I keep coming back to wanting to not exist, to just escape from this shitty reality. Beyond that, I fail to see a purpose in life. I refuse to delude myself into thinking we have a creator, and as such we lack a specific design. Without that, and knowing everything will at some point in the future cease to exist, all we have is this miserable and brief life where we are under constant control from other, more powerful people. People powerful enough to decide for me that I don't have enough control over my own life to end it. That seems ludicrous to me. It feels like if I don't even have that right, I'll always be under somebody else's control. This line of thought always ends with me just wanting to escape it all through death.

While I've been wasting my time contemplating existence, I've had real life bearing down on me. My grades have slipped to just barely passing, and I have a lengthy term paper due next week I haven't started and I have no idea how to finish. My parents are pressuring me to get a summer job, despite me doubting I'm hirable, and I have no idea how I'll pass my exams. I hate my college, but I don't think I have the grades to transfer out, and have missed the application deadlines for next fall. Best case scenario, I manage to leave the country by transferring to a Canadian university next spring, but I doubt it will happen. I'm assuming I'll be stuck in my birth state which I completely loathe. I have nothing to look forward to except the next time I can get drunk.
