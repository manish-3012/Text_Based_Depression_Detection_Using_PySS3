EnoughDear Reddit, I'm so tired. I'm doing all of these functional, adult things and it takes so much effort for me to get through the day. Other people can do it easily. Other people can do their jobs and make friends and do whatever else they need to do. I can't. I'm only barely getting through a workday where all I have to do is type and answer phones. I'm completely out of touch with my friends and family. I've tried to make friends with precisely one person and it's worked out horribly. They see me as the "crazy" that you "don't stick your dick in", whether I want that or not. (I don't. I just want someone to talk to who doesn't live 200 miles away from me and I'm too awkward and stupid to explain it properly.)

In addition, I'm currently living with an ex. We broke up several months ago but we're still living together because of a lease. The last conversation that we had about our relationship ended up with me being unable to use my right arm for almost a week because of a badly sprained thumb and possible ulnar nerve damage in my elbow. It still hurts when I try to do my work or play the piano. I never saw a doctor or anything because I was afraid to, and because I started the argument that caused the injuries. I know all of the arguments about leaving and calling the police but... I just can't. 

Anyway, I've realized today that I don't want to go on living and I can't tell anyone who cares about me. I can't tell anyone, and I don't want to. I'm only putting this on Reddit as some kind of last-ditch effort. I don't trust it to work at all and I don't know why I'm doing it. I just can't continue living like this and if I don't get a reason from someone, anyone, to keep going, then I'm not going to.   

I guess that's all. I guess I'm just finished, Reddit.
