i really want to end it14yo female

just a few ago i took both bottles of my 20mg and 10mg fluoxetine pills. that was around 800-900mg as i downed both bottles. 

i donâ€™t know what happened really, i took my normal dose at first (one 10mg and one 20mg) and then i just... took another- and another. soon i realized i had taken both of the bottles. i panicked, i didnâ€™t realize what i was doing until it was already done. 

iâ€™m not going to get into why iâ€™m depressed/why i have trauma because,,,, no- 


but my dad walked in because he heard me crying, he saw me take the last pill because i didnâ€™t notice he was in the room and he basically put two and two 
together. 

he forced me to throw up in front of him and heâ€™s not making me sleep in the same bed as him. (again this all happened tonight) 

as of right now i snuck out and made myself a pallet on the ground in the living room so i can be alone. 

iâ€™m worried because he didnâ€™t take me to an urgent care or anything, but i donâ€™t think he really knows what to do and i think heâ€™s in denial. 

is it bad that i have no remorse and that i wish he never walked in. 

this shit sucks btw 

headaches and pains all over your body, you can get hot flashes and end up really shaky. i mean thatâ€™s what happened to me.

i just.. i want to try again.
