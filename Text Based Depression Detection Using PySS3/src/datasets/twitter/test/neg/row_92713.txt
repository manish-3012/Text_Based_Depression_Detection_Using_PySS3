Help with talking to doctors about suicidal thought?Hi. I didn't really know where else to ask this, sorry if it doesn't belong.

To put it bluntly, I'm having a lot of suicidal thoughts. I'm not going to go into detail. If you're on this sub, you've got enough of your own shit to deal with without adding mine to it.

It's more of an up or down thing. When I'm down, I'm waaaaaay down. So this isn't all of the time. But ive been more down than ever before lately, and its to the point where suicide actually seems like a logical option. Anyways, I'm scared that one day I'll go through with it. I don't want to die, I don't think. But then again, today isn't a bad day. 

I want to talk to my doctor or therapist, so I can get help. Especially because we're discussing antidepressants and I'm worried that I'll start one that'll push me over the edge. However, they're obligated to report me if they feel I'm a danger to myself. If I were to be honest with them, they would definitely think so. 

The thing is, being committed will be the end of everything positive in my life. If that happens, I won't want to live at all anymore, I promise. Does anyone have suggestions? Maybe input from being in a similar situation? How much can I beat around the Bush with them and possibly get the information out there without risking being committed? How much can I tell them before they have to report it? How much can I withhold and still receive the help I need?

Please let me know, anything might be helpful!
