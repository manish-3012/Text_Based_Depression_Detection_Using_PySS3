Lots of frustration building up.I've had this feeling of wanting to smash the nearest ceramic object for months and months. I haven't done any kind of self harm on years, but I constantly think about hurting myself. I'm 17 and in my last year of high school, only have a couple of friends, I have plans to do great things in the future but I'm barely motivated to even get out of bed or do homework now. My parents discourage me from every positive opportunity that comes my way. My grades are, um, a little underwhelming. I believe I can do well but there's just no motivation and it already feels like a lost cause. I know I just want to be done with this but I can barely even look forward to graduation now. How can I start to work towards a life that motivates me and doesn't frustrate the hell out of me on a daily basis?
