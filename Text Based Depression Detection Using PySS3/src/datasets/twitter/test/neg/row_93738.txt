I want to get admittedI need a break, I honestly do. Dark thoughts will run through my head at random times questioning my existence on this earth. Dark memories of the guy who crushed me repeaditly, feeling shame or hopeless. I went through some traumatic stuff few years back but now I'm just questioning what I have to live for. I feel numb and overworked... I'm lost mentally rn
