My mom found out about my self-harm scars and failed suicide attempt.so a couple of days ago, i posted something here about saying goodbye. unfortunately, my suicide attempt failed. my mom knocked on the door before i could consume the bottle of zonrox. i was really freaking out back then so i threw the bottle away. when i came out of the bathroom, my mom asked me why my eyes are so puffy and i didn't say anything. she stopped asking about it too.

and then just last night, my shorts rolled up for a bit so my little sister saw the self harm scars on my legs. being the innocent 7-year-old that she is, she told my mom about it. my mom demanded to show her my scars. i didn't know what to do so i told her i scratched because it was itching so much but she didn't believe me. i was having anxiety attacks back then as i saw my mon crying and trying to force the words out of me. but they just wouldn't come out.

I don't know what to do. she still isn't talking to me right now and it's already 9am. i was supposed to go to school at around 6am but she didn't wake me up. my head still hurts for crying so much last night.

Please help me. i have no idea how to cope with this kind of situation. I've never been caught before.
