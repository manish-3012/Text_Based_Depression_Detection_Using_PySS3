Canâ€™t graduate, 1 year of my life lost; I canâ€™t do this anymoreToday was revealed that I canâ€™t graduate high school because my ethics project was off 3 pages. This is an elite high school, they donâ€™t offer alternatives.  I canâ€™t wait 1 year, I donâ€™t want to be left behind while everyone around me continues on to university. Not being able to go to university for an 18 yo girl equals the end of my opportunities in my country. Not only that, I feel like If I donâ€™t kill myself now I would self harm all year until one day I would cut too deep. Iâ€™m depressed and bipolar all year around anyway, right now I feel empty and I just want that prolonged silence
