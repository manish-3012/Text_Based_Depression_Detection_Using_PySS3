I 16M Want to dieMy mom is bashing me everyday then tries to get her friend to basically gang up on me saying how I need to "change my lifestyle" and "get motivated" but the problem is that im homeschooled, have no friends because mom won't let me see them, blames my last suicide attempt/drug overdose on me and uses it as an example to everything now, I want to get my computer back? "No! you contact your drug dealers!" also she is racist, calls my friends "drug addicted monkeys" etc. She doesn't believe depression and calls it a big pharma tactic, she doesn't consent for me to go to therapy or go see a councilor to help me, she wants me to go the gym near me but it's almost always packed and kids who used to bully me in middle school go there and always follow me around and laugh/talk about me behind my back, I just gave up and don't want to do anything, I just want to die because of my mom &amp; I don't have a dad, he is out of state on work multiple years at a time. What should I do to try and fix my misfortune called life... I just want  hope in my life, Im seriously on my last thread before I let go and just commit to wanting to kill myself.
