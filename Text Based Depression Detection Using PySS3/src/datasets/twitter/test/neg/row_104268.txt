From being the one trying to help people to the one who needs help.I have told myself over and over bad shit happens to good people and all these other things to try and keep me positive and it doesnt work I am on here a lot but havent been these past couple days. I try to help people to make myself feel better or be funny and make other peoples lives great since I am depressed all the time. My life isnt even bad I am just depressed, I have money I am not poor, My family is fucking awesome and will help me with anything that I struggle with. I just dont know what to do I want to live but at the same time I don't and really am not up for fighting with everything that life is throwing at me
