I guess I just need helpMy mom is abusive mentally, physically, and emotionally. She pins the blaim on me for everything, and she has abused my dad so much that he is pretty much afraid to leave her. My dad is the best person on the planet, and he's stuck with her because he just can't leave. She cheated on him, hit him, told him she doesn't love him, and then had the nerve to ask for forgiveness afterwards. I honestly hate her. I struggle with the will to continue on. I don't live for anything. No family that needs me. Yeah, they'd be sad, but they would move on. I have been isolated for the past 4 years due to having an illness, and the only source of unconditional love is my sweet little cat, Greg. I know it sounds stupid, but he's stopped me from killing myself several times. Maybe he's my guardian angel.
