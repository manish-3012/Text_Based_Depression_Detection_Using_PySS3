I canâ€™t stop thinking about itI canâ€™t stop thinking about how good itâ€™ll feel when I throw myself off that building, I canâ€™t stop thinking about how people wonâ€™t care, I canâ€™t stop thinking about how i have no friends and nobody who cares, I canâ€™t stop thinking about it all I just canâ€™t and I know one day Iâ€™m going to snap and go jump... and Iâ€™m okay with that...
