Attempted Suicide Claim - Curious about sometingJust a quick question and hoping to gain some insight.

A classmate of my children claims she attempted suicide last week.  They were back in school 3 days later.

Does this make sense?  If a teenager truly attempted suicide, would ANY medical professional clear them to return to school that quickly?

Thank you
