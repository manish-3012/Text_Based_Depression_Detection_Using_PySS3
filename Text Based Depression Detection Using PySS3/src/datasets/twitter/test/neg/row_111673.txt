Iâ€™m exhaustedIâ€™m so exhausted of everything, it feels like everything is so damn heavy and that every time I try to make any situation better I fail. Iâ€™m just a failure and no one would care if I was gone. The future scares the crap out of me, I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just really really want to die and end it all.
