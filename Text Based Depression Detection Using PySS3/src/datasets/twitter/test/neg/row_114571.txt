I canâ€™t live anymoreI donâ€™t know how anyone does it. This is too much. I mean money and social struggles aside, I feel genuinely like I want to be a woman and not a man. Iâ€™m 21 but fuck I just feel so strongly about this. And yet I have a girlfriend who I love so much and donâ€™t want to leave, but I also donâ€™t want to stay. I want to explore my sexuality, I want to change, I want to not feel like Iâ€™m going to cry every day and then just repress it and move on as if everythingâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m so sure at this point that I want to die. I donâ€™t think I belong. Iâ€™ve tried getting work but Iâ€™ve been living off the government or family handouts for like 5 years, trying to pay rent and car bills in my sharehouse, acting like everythingâ€™s fine when really Iâ€™d rather fucking hang myself. I canâ€™t.
