Anyone else here have severe allergies?Iâ€™ve had severe allergies since the beginning of last fall and they still persist. I fear that I now have the dreaded year-long allergies. I take allergy medication but often itâ€™s not strong enough during the times it peaks and I have to take pain meds for the headaches, ear aches and neck aches (damn swollen ymph nodes). The headaches sometimes get to the point that sometimes I get nauseous. I have to sit in my bed clutching my head until the pain or spinning goes away. These bouts make me sweaty and feverish. Not to mention the constant flow of mucous. My symptoms have been so gross and made me feel so unwell that I canâ€™t even think about dating and that makes me even more depressed. Because who would date a coughing, sneezing, snotty mess? Sometimes with the headaches itâ€™s hard to get my studying for college done.  Because I canâ€™t breathe properly, I often canâ€™t sleep at night.

On top of it all, when I did consult with my mom she didnâ€™t take me seriously. Because how bad could allergies be? And thereâ€™s not much you can do to treat it, she said, even if you drop a couple thousand on allergy tests. 

To sum it up: I fucking hate my stupid immune system. And life really, really sucks.

Itâ€™s probably really weird for a person to be depressed and want to kill themselves over severe allergies. But here I am.
