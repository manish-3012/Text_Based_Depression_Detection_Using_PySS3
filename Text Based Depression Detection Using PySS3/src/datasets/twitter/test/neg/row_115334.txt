Reality is keep betraying meI've fallen inlove with a girl. I really love her because she made me feel so alive and she made me feel so safe. She made me feel safe whenever she's around. She cured my depression. This girl is also my bestfriend we've done many things together and those times where the best days of my life. She meant alot to me. But then that day comes i confessed what i felt about her but she rejected me because i didnt live up to the standards of what guys she likes and our values are not the same, i was willing to change myself to that guy she wants but she doesnt respect people who doesnt seem to themselves. I really want to be with her she's everything to me but no matter what i do nothing will work. The depression she took away from me has  been returned to me in ten fold. This pain that have been inflicted to me is too much for me to handle. And i believed that the only way to get rid of this pain is gouge out the sickness in my heart. I've got a kitchen knife with me and i'm gonna stab my heart with it after i finish my last drink of alcohol.
