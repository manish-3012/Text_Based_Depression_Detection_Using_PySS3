Why is suicide seen as bad?People always say how horrible suicide is and its selfish, but isn't it just as selfish to keep some one living who doesn't? I know some peoples' lives change, but others don't, and some understand what they desire from this world they'll never get. I've tried several times with several different methods and all have failed. I can't buy a gun or anything and i don't wanna do it where somebody would find my body. :/
