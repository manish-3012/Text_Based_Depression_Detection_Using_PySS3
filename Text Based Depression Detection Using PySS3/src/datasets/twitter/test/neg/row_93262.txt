I'm DoneSick of just living, Iâ€™m no ones first choice and no one wants to know me or be around me for who I am, I wanted to be happy instead of just surviving day by day but I know that wonâ€™t happen anymore. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for 10 years and no matter how hard I try I always get knocked back down. I need the pain to stop.
