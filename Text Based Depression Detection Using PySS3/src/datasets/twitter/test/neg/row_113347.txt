This pandemic has made me lose all hopefor anything really. All the dark stuff Iâ€™ve seen and gone through in the span of 6-7months. I was already struggling mentally, living with a  mentally ill in my family (who being around makes me more depressed), job complications, general dissatisfaction, and some romantic problems. 

I feel like whatâ€™s the point anymore. Now all of this happening all at once whatâ€™s the point of this all? What should I stay for? Last year was already extremely rough for me trying to finish my last year of school, while another family is dying, harassment everyday at school, trying to figure out my future, and just having problems with people. 

I donâ€™t see any reasoning anymore. I feel nothing is going to get better or have any idea of the future
