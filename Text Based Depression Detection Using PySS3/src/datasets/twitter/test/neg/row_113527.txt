24 and out of optionsTo cut a long story short, I went into school aged 10 &amp; said Iâ€™m not going home (because I wasnâ€™t wanted at home/treated well) andddd I never did. 

In the last 14 years Iâ€™ve moved nearly 30 times, ticked every box of abuse, and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. 
I started having â€œtherapyâ€ aged 5, from traumas I still canâ€™t remember - all I know, is Iâ€™ve struggled with anxiety, depression &amp; suicidal thoughts for as long as I have memories. 

I moved to a new country a year ago to make a better life for myself, and then the pandemic hit. I lost my job a couple of months ago (I know, lots of us did, I feel bad for you to), canâ€™t find another one and Iâ€™m just so tired of one step forward ten steps back. 

Now in a position where I canâ€™t pay my bills, scared i wonâ€™t be able to buy food soon for my cats, will I lose the place I finally made a home? 

Statistically for my childhood, Iâ€™m doing greaattt. Iâ€™m not in prison, on drugs or have 10 kids. But itâ€™s not enough for me. I strive to do well, Iâ€™m a great worker, a nice person, I want to do good, but thatâ€™s not enough in this world. 

Seems life just wants me to fail. At this point, Iâ€™m so tired. When everyone else has family, friends and support services to rely on, I do it myself - but when I canâ€™t do it myself anymore? It feels like the end.

The only thing Iâ€™ve been hanging on for is my boyfriend, but at this point, I feel like he would be better without me. (Without me, his salary is enough to live on - for both of us? Itâ€™s not, I donâ€™t want to be a burden on him)

My uncle committed suicide, my dad was murdered, so many of my friends are gone - I donâ€™t want him to have to deal with my death - so Iâ€™ve been pushing him away. 

Everyday it gets worse and I can feel myself closing down

My heart hurts
My head doesnâ€™t make sense anymore
