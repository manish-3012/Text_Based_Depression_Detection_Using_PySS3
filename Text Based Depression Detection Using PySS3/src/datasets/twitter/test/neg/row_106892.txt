Promise to Myself*What saved me is the idea of suicide. Without the idea of suicide I would have surely killed myself. What allowed me to keep on living was knowing I had this option, always in sight... But really, without it I could have never endured life.*

I am really hurting, this loneliness at this age (considering my upbringing's loneliness too) makes me feel hopeless. Perhaps my social development was stunted, I truly feel less than a normal person. I am literally worthless,  uncared for and unloved. I really want a special person in my life but the more you want it; the more impossible it becomes.

Knowing that I can pass away quite painlessly makes me relaxed. I felt this disgusting loneliness 3 years ago, nothing's changed. I'm giving myself 3 more years. If it persists, I make a vow right here and right now to kill myself. 

That is because I would not want this dreadful life (caused by either shitty, introverted, neurotic genes or stunted development or both) to go on for its own sake. 

Only my family would be hurt. I am so sorry for them (not when I imagine my death, but in general). I wouldn't fear missing out on anything, as I'd have already missed out on what I believe truly matters- meaningful friendships and relationships with people you respect and care for.

Tomorrow, for day 1/1095; I will wake up again, take my stimulant medication so that I can get out of bed, attempt doing my schoolwork which I hate (imagine being such a loser that you study engineering) and sleep. And then for days 2 to 1095, I will reattempt everyday to become sociable, positive and valuable.

3 more years. After that, if this persists- I'm pulling the plug.

3. More. Years.
