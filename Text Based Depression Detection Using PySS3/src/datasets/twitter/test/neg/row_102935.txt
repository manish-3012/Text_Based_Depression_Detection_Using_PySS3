When I wake up from a long nap in the early morning, Iâ€™m often in a sober stateLike I realized how fucked up depression makes me and Iâ€™m reminded of my old life before depression. Itâ€™s like when a drunk person gets sober really fast and realizes that they were out of it. I feel my cloudy mind and brain fog suddenly become clear with the sun showing.
