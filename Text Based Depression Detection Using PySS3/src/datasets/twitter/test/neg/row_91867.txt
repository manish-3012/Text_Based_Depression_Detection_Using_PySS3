I hate my life so much.I'm sorry if this doesnt't belong here but I promised myself i wouldn't ever cut myself again and i need a place to vent.

I hate nearly everyone in my life. my mom just makes me feel like shit. She is always talking down to me because she hates men in general. for context i'm an 18 year old senior in high school. The reason she hates men is because of my asshole dad who left when i was about 5. This eats away at me daily, which my mom knows and uses it to hurt me. for example she'll start yelling at me and when she sees i'm hurt she'll say something like, "If you don't like it here, go find your father and stay with him!" 

The reason I'm so goddamn mad/sad today though is my girlfriend. When we met we were 16 and both drank on occassion. We would also smoke weed once in a while. However, my family has and always will be full of alcoholics and drug addicts, so i never drink more then twice a week, and same goes for smoking. i've also told myself that I'd never do any other drugs, and so far i haven't. She however gets drunk all the time to the point where she's throwing up and i have to leave my work to go take care of her. today was our Homecoming celebration and she decided to get drunk with a friend in school. she also wasn't going to tell me because she knew i'd be mad. as if this wasnt enough, her friend she drank with gave her a ride back to my house after! she knows how i feel about drunk driving and this just pushed me over the edge. i love her but this along with work, school, and my great family was too much, and now im having a breakdown.

Along with all of this i have 3 of the best friends in the world. they are the only reason i am alive today. We all have girlfriends so i dont see them as much as I'd like, but when i do it just makes me so happy that they've been such good friends for so long.

like i said, i'm sorry about all of this if it isn't the right place but i needed to vent, i haven't hurt myself in over a year and i plan on keeping it that way.
