First it was the struggle, now it's the lonelinessI'm surprised I'm still here.

Over the last few weeks, I tried many times to end it all. My current trials in life were weighing heavily on me and I just wanted out. The trials haven't gotten any betterâ€”things are still just as shitty. But now loneliness has set in, and it's just one more reason I want out.

I stare at my phone, FB friends list, IG friends list and even Reddit friends list thinking of people to talk to, but I feel like there is no one. The people I have confided in or asked for help in the past are non-responsive now. I even read all the stuff they post on social media like, "Nothing matters except love... how you touched the people around you and how much you gave them," and wonder, 'If they believe that, why am I not worthy of their love?'

Is it okay to call it quits when you're broken and alone? Can it be?? I know my death will have an impact on those I leave behind, but part of me thinks that if I cross over, my passing will cause them to reconsider how they "love" and might save someone else from going through what I am.
