I became violentI was pushed hard and I became violent. I punched my ex in the face twice and in the last instance she snapped her ACL. I ran away like a coward and am trying and failing to restart my life. My family has pumped the last of their resources into me, and I spent the last five days drinking getting ready to kill myself. I have been to rehab for alcohol 4 times, and been in a psych ward over 10 times. Iâ€™ve lost count. Iâ€™m smart as fuck and nobody can reach me. I am fucking miserable. I have somehow managed not to kill anyone yet, but it feels like itâ€™s only a matter of time. I need to kill myself before I hurt someone more than I already have.
