Thinking about finally ending it.I'm just 21 but already i feel too old and wasted for this world , ive been deprived of love for a few years now both from family and love relationships. I live alone with my dog and ive always considered myself not the best but a good person atleast , ive always tried to help everyone i can however i can not only because its what it feels right to me but always in hope that something good will return to me one day. Ive had depression the past few years all my friends basically gave up on me and i did on them , i developed a drug problem which makes the whole world even stranger to me. Im not the worst looking person ever but id guess that im not attractive either based on my love life so far. Ive never had a serious relationship and barely any casual relationships because of my social anxiety and that im generally a unlikable person.Ive kinda accepted things as they but a few days ago i had a one night stand with a girl ive known for a while , it was mostly her move which made me feel something so unknown , i felt like someone wanted me and liked me atleast a bit even if its just for that act alone.Everything went pretty good and i either fell in love with her or the whole thing of having closure , im not sure.But as you may guess she has not answered my text since then and i can't help but bother withmyself with where it went wrong. I literally did my best to impress her with who i am if i can say so.And she did seem to enjoy the time that we spend and i dont mean the sexual act etc.Most likely she decide she doenst like me as soon as she got to knew me now and ive accepted that because i hate myself so much that its easy to accept someone not liking me either.I'm just lost and not sure what to do at this point , i realized how deprived i am of love while she was hugging me while we sleep , at that moment i felt like crying because of how strange and unknown this was for me and yet made me feel so alive and i miss that.I dont blame her or anything , i just dont know how to to continue with myself anymore , i barely eat or sleep because of how terrible i feel. The past 3 years ive been thinking about suicide and at this point i feel like im ready for it and that its the only thing i look forward to in my life , usually the first thing i think of the very moment i wake up is how i dont want to live.Yet i have my dog which i really love and dont know what to do with her , i cant trust another person to take care of her , i cant set her loose and i cant kill myself and leave her alone in the house.Not to mention that its probably the only creature that cares for me  and im basically its whole life. thats the only thing that keeps me around but i feel more and more tortured as each day passes and i just dont know what to do.Sorry for the bad English its not my native language.
