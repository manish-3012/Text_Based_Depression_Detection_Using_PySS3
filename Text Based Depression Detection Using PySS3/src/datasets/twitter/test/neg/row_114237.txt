Canâ€™t remember the last time I was happyThereâ€™s no one around anymore, all my friends have become distant, and my best friend doesnâ€™t talk to me anymore. I have no future, no funds for college, no job, no love life. My body is disgusting, there are scars all over. So much has been going on and itâ€™s all just piling on. I donâ€™t really sleep anymore, and Iâ€™ve reached a point where I canâ€™t stop crying. I lost my will to live. I want to just drive up to the beach and drown.
