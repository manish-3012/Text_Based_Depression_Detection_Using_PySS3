Senior project, family illness, and mood disorders make for a bad circumstance.I'm only doing this to vent. I have persistent suicidal thoughts, but I don't think I'd follow them up since it would hurt my family too much. My mother was recently diagnosed with a late stage brain cancer. We don't trust her second husband to properly take care of her.  I'm in town, but I'm miserable with trying to finish my senior year and I don't want to bring my negative energy around her.  I'm bipolar II and it isn't managed properly obviously because I spent 3 hours in my universities counseling center yesterday with panic attacks.  They suggested hospitalization but I can't afford to waste anymore time. I present my project in under a month and I need to redo it. My mentor has been a savior but I know he's getting frustrated with my personal problems. Thankfully his speciality is cancer biology so I think he respects my stresses. I see my med provider today and he'll probably want to commit me too. My racing thoughts, panic attacks, and suicidal thoughts make performing work almost impossible. I just want to talk to some people besides my school's therapists. I am literally spiraling in my head and I can't function. Typically I'm more organized and articulate in my writing but I need to go. Thanks for reading.
