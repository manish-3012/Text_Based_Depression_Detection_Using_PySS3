I've run out of energy and I can't take it anymore.After going through college and trying to make it in this world, the second I had a solid footing for myself it all went tumbling down. I couldn't afford rising rent costs and made the mistake of getting into a low cost house just to survive. Now I'm in even bigger trouble then when I started. Depression and my mental illnesses have taken their toll on me on a daily life and I can't even find the energy to fight anymore.

To make matters worse, the house I'm living in is starting to show signs of foundation issues and I have no way to afford to fix any of this nor get out of this house. If I ever have to move due to work or lack there of, I have no way out of this loan I no longer want. The longer I stay in this home, the more I want to give up. I already had a hard enough time making it before.

I don't know how much longer I can survive tonight. I picked up the shotgun for the first time and made sure I knew how to load it. I don't know what else to do. I don't have the energy to fight in this world anymore.

-edit-

I should probably mention that having a lot of my family live on the streets currently, it is a life I do not see myself trying to live. I don't even have the time to study like I should be to progress myself in any career. If I can't do any of those things and I am doomed to slowly waste away, I would rather just end it now.
