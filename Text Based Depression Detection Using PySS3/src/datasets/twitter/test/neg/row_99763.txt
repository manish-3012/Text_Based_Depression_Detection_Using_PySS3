Ive been self harming all day. I want to die. 19, balding, ugly, virgin, poor, broken dick and uneducatedThe title explains it all. I dont have much else to say.  
  
Im 19 years old and losing my hair. The hairline is very severly receded and I am starting to thin on top. I am on finastride but it hasnt been helping. Balding would be a problem if i wasnt so young. I also just dont have the face to pull of the shaved look. Every facial feature that should be small is big and every feature thats supposed to be big is small. To make thigs worse my disproportionant features are also oddly shaped. My nose is fucked. And my chin is so small and weak i cant even grow a respectable beard to hide it.  
  
Being this way has made me girl repellent. I used to have a good personality but depression has ruined it. Im physically repulsive and girls wont even look at me. In my life i have only kissed one girl and that was when i had hair. Its was a fluke thing too. She was trying to get over her boyfriend i was just in the right place at the right time. Shebdidbt really like me. I hate that girls dont fibd me attractove i aant to have sex and go to partys but im just to rough lookibg for that.  
  
My dick ia also broken. Ive always had a fairly low libido. Lately i have barely been able to get an erection let alone orgasm. It could be my anti depressiant cipralex or my bald med finastride. Both can cause ED. Being of the meds hasnt helped and my female docotr isnt taking this seriousl. Ive lost all motivation and i am tired all the time.  
  
Ive been cutting all day and i want to end my life before thigs get even worse. I hate this exiatance
