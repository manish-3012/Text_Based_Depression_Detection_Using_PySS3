Birthday.. Deathday... Idk.I used to love my birthday. Make it big every year.  People always thought it was a weird day to enjoy even into adulthood (25 now)... But the last few months have basically ruined everything.  I basically started crying shortly after midnight and I find myself here, again. In the dark. 

That, and I found out (4 days ago) that I'm accidentally pregnant from a man I dont love and really has started to annoy me with his immaturity. I cant bring myself to do the "A" word, its not something i could live with. This is my punishment for not leaving him sooner.   But now.. If I succumb to the darkness in my head.. I take another with me.  Which just makes this so much worse now.  The "okay" side of me wants to keep it anyway.. The not okay side of me knows I'm at high risk of it being ectopic.. And secretly I slightly hope nature takes me out that way.. 

I feel awful just for even thinking that..

I felt like I didn't deserve to live before, because of my mistakes.  Now I really dont deserve what I have before me.  Fml
