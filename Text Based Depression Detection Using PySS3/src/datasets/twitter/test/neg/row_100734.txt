My mental illness is ruining my relationship.I've been suffering from depression for nearly my entire life, and I've also recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder as well. 

I've always been very open with my s/o since the start of our relationship regarding my mental health, and in the beginning, he was extremely supportive. 

Lately, he's been incredibly distant and he's not supporting me at all. Due to the way I acted in the past when I was depressed, he gave me an ultimatum: either get help for my mental illness, or he would leave. 

I've been getting help, and I feel as though I've made progress, but he can't seem to get past what I've done in the past. I've apologized countless times, and tried to make things better, but he's pushing me farther and farther away. 

I don't know what to do anymore. He was my sole supporter through my battle with mental illness, and honestly, my only motivation to get better. I just feel hopeless.
