Desire to end lifeHi, I'm a 20 year old male. I've been traumatized by my past, which includes being molested, paranoid parents with strict rules such as no TV or games, and have currently given up on trying to help myself. I have tried seeing a counselor/psychologist but I'm disappointed with my failure to change because it is my responsibility. I have been thinking of ending my life for a few years, but I have not because I've been waiting for something to happen that would change my perspective on life, since I am unable to change myself. The purpose of my post here is to understand why I should continue living.
