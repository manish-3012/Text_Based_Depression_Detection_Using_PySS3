Passing on my depression to others?I'm talking about the effect my death would have a family and friends if anyone has exp with this? it's basically the only fear keeping me here right now. I know it would be tragic and painful but in a selfish way, I can almost rationalize and accept that. I'm just scared that it would too traumatic. It's one thing to feel heartbroken for a while, it's another to become overwhelmed causing them to spiral into depression (I wouldn't wish this upon anyone). Maybe I'm naive but if anyone has insight or similar sentiments, please let me know
