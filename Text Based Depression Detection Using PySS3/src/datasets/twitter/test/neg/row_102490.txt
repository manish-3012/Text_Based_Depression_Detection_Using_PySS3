Dealing with a Suicidal Girlfriend [X-Post r/Christianity]I don't really know where else to turn. We're both 17, seniors in high school, and have been together for almost 15 months now. She hasn't been herself this past month and a half. I first noticed when, due to a club she is in, she had to stay at a school football game until 10 pm. I thought I would do something nice for her and bring her dinner, however, she refused to even open what I brought her (which contained all of her favorite foods). According to a mutual friend, she did eat it after I left, so I let it go. However, these past few weeks started getting worse. She stopped being happy, which in itself was shocking, because she is the most joyous person I have ever met. I finally got her to tell me what was wrong, and she told me that she was suicidal. I begged her not to do it, and she promised me that she wouldn't. A couple of days later, it was obvious that something was wrong again, and I learned that she had tried to kill herself. After talking with her parents, she decided to go to counselling and again promised that she wouldn't do anything.
Fast forward to a week ago, she out of nowhere broke up with me because she felt that her depression was poisonous to me. I sent her an email after a day, and told her how important she was to me, and after a long discussion, she decided to take me back. We talked for a few more days, and it seemed like everything was going to get better. As of a few days ago, she stopped logging on to the instant messenger that we normally talk using, and when I talked to her, she looked more upset than I had ever seen her before. I made several propositions to spend time with her or take her somewhere nice, every single one of which she shot down without a real reason. I thought maybe she really didn't want me anymore, or wanted time alone to sort things out. I was in the middle of asking her if she just needed a break from me so she could think things over, and she cut me off, telling me to stop in a tone of voice I've never heard her use.
Last night, I managed to apologize to her, and she told me that she is tired of trying and wants to give up. She's afraid of the world after high school, and feels that she won't be able to do anything she wants, and has nothing to look forward to or to make her happy. She's also convinced herself that she will never stop being miserable, and that she can't make me happy, and that she doesn't want happiness, and that this won't get better. No matter what I said, she feels that she's hurting her family, friends, and I, by being in her current state, and that the best choice is just to give up on life. Today, our mutual friend texted me, saying that my girlfriend said that she doesn't care that we care about her. I don't know what to do. Please Reddit, give me advice, and more importantly, prayer. Thank you.

EDIT: I need some personal assurance and prayer too. I'm not planning on killing myself; even if she does, I now know what it feels like to be on the other side of this, and I can't do that to my family. But this really is taking a toll on me. I feel so frustrated and helpless, and it's a constant horrible feeling. Thank you again.

EDIT: Apologies to non-religious Redditors in r/suicidewatch. As mentioned in the title, I'm xposting and really not in the mood to change the text. Thank you.
