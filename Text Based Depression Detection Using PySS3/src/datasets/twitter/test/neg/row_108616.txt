I'm disgusting and the world hates me because of things I can't control.I'm a non-offending pedophile. I don't look at CP. I don't harm kids. Despite this, the whole world is against me. I can't say this anywhere. I'm seeing a therapist, but it still means I have to deal with the anxiety of keeping it all inside. Someone saying they know best for us and that we shouldn't have loli and shit to keep us fucking sane. Hell, people tell us to kill ourselves without a shred of remorse. It doesn't matter that I'd never hurt children to them. All I want to do is to make the pain stop, and the only way to do that seems like suicide.
