TitlelessI am staying in a hotel with my family and all I want to do is jump out the window. Its 12 stories so it would do the job. I dont know. I should have stayed home instead of coming I dont belong here. At least at home it would be quiet and out of the way unlike here. I've applied for a gun back home and am just waiting to be confirmed. I fucked up and agreed to come, I should have went with my gut and stayed.
