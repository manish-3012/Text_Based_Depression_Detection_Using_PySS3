I think I just need someone to talk to right now.Hi guys. I'm 15, I live in Canada. Shit's real bad right now. I'm so lonely. I honestly am. I only really trust one person in my life, and right now she's spending all her time with another friend who's leaving our province forever (?) in about a month. I hate trusting her. We only ever text, and even then, I have to start the conversation. My family doesn't know shit because all the times I have told them shit they hurt more than they help. Doesn't help my mom chastises me for just sitting around inside all day. I saw a therapist yesterday. It didn't help. I didn't get to tell him how close to my edge I was (on Monday I literally leaned away from a tree with a belt around my neck for a good 30 seconds). I now have to wait another month to see him again/get the help I need. I live in constant anxiety and depression and I just want it to end. Last night I just sat shaking and crying thinking about what to make a noose out of considering I gave my belt to a friend to stop Monday from happening again. I thought about the best place to jump from. I thought about where would the closest place be to jump in front of a vehicle and  do enough damage. I don't want to. I really don't.
