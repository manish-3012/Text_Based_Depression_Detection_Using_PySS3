If I end up doing it.If I end up doing it, I won't be on here to tell everyone. I don't know if I'll do it. But the word "care" just loses all meaning. Who cares is a statement, not a question. Care is not existing anymore. It's like I'm dying and then if I do it, it'll just be because I'm already dead and it's an automated response.
