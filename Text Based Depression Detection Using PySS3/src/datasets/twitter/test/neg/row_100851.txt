I won't have a safe-space for much longerSoon, the last safe place for me will be taken away - my apartment. Then I will officially be homeless. I have not left my house in half a year because of my social anxiety. My mum gave up on me and is kicking me out in a little while. I am not made for this world, it's literally not possible for me to interact with people and not feel like a disgusting piece of shit. The preparations are made, I will not live much longer. I honestly really look forward to it, I will never have to embarrass myself again. Life was worth a try, but it isn't for me.
