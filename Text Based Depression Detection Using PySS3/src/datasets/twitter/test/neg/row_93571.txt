I am afraid of my future lifeI am afraid that I'm going to end up living a shit life with not a lot of good friends or wife. All I ever wanted was to become a professional athlete. I train MMA and it seems like it is a tough road. I am 20 years old and I did not graduate highschool because I was in a lot of trouble with criminal adults. I even got good grades the first year before I got into trouble but my absent became too high. I have always had high ambitions for my life, if I can't get a good degree or live through sports I feel like I don't want to do anything. Right now I am looking for a job with night shifts so I can move to my own place and live my own life. I think If I don't become succesfull in MMA I am going to live a shitty lonely unmotivated life, where the only joy would come from working out. I don't even want to find a girlfriend because I wanted to be with someone from university and I feel too old to pursue that now as I don't even have a highschool degree. I wish the worst for the criminals that dragged me down that road and they began using me for criminal activities when I was 13 and they were 18+ I have never had good friend or a good life since I was 13. Only a dark life.
