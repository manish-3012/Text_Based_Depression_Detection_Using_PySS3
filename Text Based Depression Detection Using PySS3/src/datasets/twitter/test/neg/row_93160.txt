here goesIâ€™ve been contemplating suicide since February. It just seems like everything I come into contact with I fuck up, I tried talking to my mother about it and the only thing she did was say she could always have more kids. Iâ€™m not depressed but Iâ€™m not happy either itâ€™s a weird neutral state and Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore. Iâ€™m only ever happy anymore when Iâ€™m drunk or high.
