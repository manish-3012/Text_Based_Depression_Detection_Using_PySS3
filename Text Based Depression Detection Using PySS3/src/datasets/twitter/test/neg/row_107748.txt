From the outside my life seems just fine, but nobody really understands how I feelIâ€™m extremely privileged, as in the most privileged you can be. I am a white girl living in the happiest country in the world. I have access to free healthcare, free education and the crime rates here arenâ€™t specifically high. I live in a 1st world country in an apartment my mom pays rent for. I have it all, so why could I possibly be so unhappy?

Iâ€™m so fucking angry right now at everything. My friend and I were talking about personal shit and then he told me that his life is shittier than mine. Iâ€™m like wtf is the point of comparing our lives, but I didnâ€™t say it. He told me how he has been walked over by several people and that he got treated badly. Of course I feel bad, and his feelings are just as valid, and Iâ€™m ready to listen anytime. But I felt like my feelings were denied, also because  he doesnâ€™t know how much weight my problems actually have on me because I am so privileged. I tell him I constantly feel neglected by my parents and that I hate my body image, but havenâ€™t gone much in depth with that or other problems Iâ€™m going through, so I canâ€™t blame him of course. Itâ€™s just so annoying whenever I try to let my problems out, he tells me how great I have it and that he has it shittier. I donâ€™t feel like he understands, and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m being listened to.

And then he keeps insulting my intelligence, but thatâ€™s probably not even intentional. Thatâ€™s probably my own insecurities taking over and twisting things. And if he read this I would probably ruin the friendship. 

This rant seems so pointless and makes me look like an asshole. Boo hoo, who is the bigger victim. Who has it worse. Whose feelings are valid based on privilege. Smh my head I hate myself. 

And yeah he is right now that I think about it. I could have it so much worse WHY THE FUCK AM I SAD OMG. I would like to give people my place in this world anytime. I didnâ€™t fucking ask to be born. Yeah, people would kill to be in my shoes, but I canâ€™t control where Iâ€™m born. And yeah, I should kill myself because Iâ€™m being an ungrateful little whiny bitch who doesnâ€™t know how to be thankful for the gift of life. Kill me now pls.
