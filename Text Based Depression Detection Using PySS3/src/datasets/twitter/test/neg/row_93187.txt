i dont see a future for myself, someone to talk?i feel like im going through a path of loliness and not self-care, i mind, i care but i cant live with myself and try to be better if deep down i think there is no really good future or a peaceful life for me. I dont have too much friends, and i dont want to talk about my issues with them because i dont see the point, i dont consider them role models, i respect them, but i dont want their lifes.  
 Im not feeling suicidal, im just in the phase where you dont do anything and you dont talk to anybody, but i feel if i keep this path i would have some issues and ideas.
