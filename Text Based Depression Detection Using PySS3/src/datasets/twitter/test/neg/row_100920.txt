I wish someone would just mug me and shoot me to death, or get struck by lightning, or get hit by a bus.I'm too afraid to do it myself, I was close a few times, but couldn't do it. It would hurt my parents too and I think they would think it was their fault and that would hurt them too much. I just want someone to kill me, or to die in a disaster, so that I can die and it won't hurt them quite as much.

I've always fantasized about someone stopping me with a gun, asking me for my stuff, maybe I would rush them slow on purpose to get shot. Maybe if I walked out in a thunderstorm I'd get hit.
