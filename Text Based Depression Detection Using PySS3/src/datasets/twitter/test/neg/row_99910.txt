......First off, this is an account no e of my family or friends know about so, no one will know.


So, I'm a failure, a monster, an asshole, a jerk, a shit head, and many other things. I don't deserve to live. I don't deserve to even do anything. All I've heard for the past month is silence and I want that silence to last forever. I'm sitting here, crying, typing this because I've got no one to talk to. Everyone, minus 2 ppl hate my guts and makes life a living hell. My mom is an asshole, threatening to kill me, screaming at me for no reason what so fucking ever, and throwing shit at me. My dad? Never met the asshole. Fick das Leben, Imma bring mich einfach um! Life is shit anyway.




I can't deal with any one. I have a number of mental illnesses. Depression, anxiety, and a number of others. I can't deal with it! I just want to die!


Cutting doesn't help anymore. It only helped for like a few days, then, nothing. I just want to die. I just want to feel something. Anything. Everytime ppl ask if I'm ok, I try to smile and say "Yeah. I'm fine." but I'm not. The only people in my family I really ever trusted are dead. One died of cancer and the other died of an infection. I envy both of them. They weren't treated like me when they were growing up. If I do manage to live until 18, which is not likely, I'm going to move out and block the bitch. But the chances of making it to 18 are very slim. Next to nothing. I can't wait until the day I die, which I hope is soon.
