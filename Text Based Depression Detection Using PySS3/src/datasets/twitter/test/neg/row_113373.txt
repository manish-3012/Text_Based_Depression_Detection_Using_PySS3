Idk anymore pls help1 year old child
Angry resentful wife 
I try so hard, cook, clean, look after baby, make good money
She screams at me constantly whenever her defense mechanisms get set off by a comment or by me displaying any negative emotion about anything 
Idk if I should post here or in relationships 

She will not see eye to eye or hear me out, just calls me a goof and an abuser and tries to make out like I'm someone who hits her when I don't which in turns actually makes me want to hit her 

My son is getting scared. I feel worthless and pulled in too many directions, I'm angry, I want to hurt myself with the nearest object. Can I even post that? Idk. I just don't know

I am weak
