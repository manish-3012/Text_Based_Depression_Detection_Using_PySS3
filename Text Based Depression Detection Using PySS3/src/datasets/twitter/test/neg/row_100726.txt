I am sorry.I am sorry for the words of kindness wasted upon me. I am sorry that i could not be strong that i let this beat me. I am sorry about the love shown to me that i could never reciprocate. I am sorry my family might never know why. I can't live in fear anymore I wish i was what everyone thinks i am but i am not, the lie has gone on long enough there is no other way out. I tried to get help i want to tell people i just can't trust anyone anymore. My problems are my own they will go with me.
