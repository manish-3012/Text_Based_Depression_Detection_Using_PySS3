I cant live anymore with a small packageThis is going to seem like a troll post but I swear I'm being honest.

I (29M) have a small "manhood" and over the past year at least I've just been spending more and more time dwelling on it and just in an unshakeable funk. I sit in my room trying to study for my undergraduate degree and I just cry, and cry, and sit in silence and stare into thin air without realising that half the day has gone past. I've had girls reject me constantly, I've never had a girlfriend, or a second sexual encounter with the same person, because obviously. Lately I find myself watching a lot of brutal violence videos, and spending hours watching beheadings and stabbings/torture etc on sites like BestGore and I'm not getting any of the usual moral conflictions they would have inspired years ago. On top of that, I just watch public executions where people hang in public and I feel like I've never been suicidal before, but I have no aversion to it now. I'm forever surrounded by unbelievably gorgeous women to whom I am a pathetic loser and not worthy of any physical consideration, and I have had women who have slept with me send my private pictures to my female friends and my own fucking sisters. Women want nothing to do with me after seeing it, male friends of mine send me explicit videos of them with women not realising it is traumatising because i've never told them. The past two months in particular I've burst into tears on campus, after seeing friend's relationship statuses, and for the first time i think I can't live much longer like this, in this unbearable loneliness. I don't see any friends anymore, i dont leave my room except for uni, I've stopped going to kickboxing, and i have three essays due in three days and i have done maybe 10 minutes of work toward them. i wake up and have to piss and am immediately confronted with reality again and can't function. there's no end in sight but i can't even imagine how the fuck I'm supposed to bring this up to my psychiatrist as what's really been wrong all these years. i fucking hate this, and everyone fucking gaslights me and says just love yourself bro, just have confidence bro. Like how the fuck is confidence going to help me penetrate a fucking vagina when you need 4 more inches than I have just to enter it. I feel like Tantalus doomed, the closer I get to a woman, the further away she pulls, in perpetuity. I'm really seeing the darkness closing in slowly, and the only thing I have holding me bac from doing something stupid is my perfect little niece that I have to look after because my junkie sister left her on my and my mu's doorstep since two weeks after she was born.
