i have no friendsI really have no one lmao. I'm a last choice to all my friends, they all make plans without me and then when i find out they're like "oh you can come if you want to."

they all act as if I'm the biggest idiot, over explaining everything to me and telling me what to do and what not to do. i asked four separate people to hang out with me after school today and they all said no.

my school is small. I've asked for advice before on making friends and everyone tells me to join clubs at school to meet students with similar interest. my school is small and I've already met everyone. there aren't any clubs in my community I haven't already tried. there are only like 3 and they're all religious, which I'm not very much so.

I have no idea how to branch out. I'm desperate for friends, I'm so lonely. I spend so much time by myself thinking of what I would be doing with friends or going on drives and wishing I had someone in my passenger sit. everywhere I go I wish I had a friend with me. I'm so lonely

idk what to do anymore. it seems like I'm just not meant to have anyone in my corner. like no ones ever going to WANT to spend time around me or pick me first or notice if i'm not there
