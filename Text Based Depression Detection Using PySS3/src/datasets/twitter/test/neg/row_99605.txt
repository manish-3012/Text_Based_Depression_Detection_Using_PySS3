I was in a really bad place two weeks ago.I honestly had planned everything out already. I had a note drafted and scheduled to be emailed. I knew where to go and what to do. I was mentally prepared to go through with it. 

But the morning of the day that I planned for it, my mom and dad texted me telling me they were out grocery shopping to make my favorite food for dinner to cheer me up. They said they wanted me to enjoy it. 

I took one look at their messages and deleted my suicide note. I cried like a baby. And I swore that as tempting as life gets, as hard as life feels, and as lonely as I feel, I can get through anything so I donâ€™t hurt my parents. 

Most of the time I feel like a burden on them but that day I realized that every single thing theyâ€™ve done in their life is with me in their minds. I canâ€™t hurt them by leaving this world. So Iâ€™ll do my best and try hard to make them as happy as they want me to be.
