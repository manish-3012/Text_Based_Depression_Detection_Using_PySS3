Used and Very DepressedThis post is about my severe depression but its stemming from a unhealthy relationship or situation I was in. It makes me feel like I'd be better off dead as I have no worth.

A guy I met love bombed me with tons of adoration and attention. Stated he was serious about me and wanted a long term relationship with me. I believed him. But I later learned he has a girlfriend whom I now know is pregnant. He seems very smitten with her based on IG posts. Yet, he was keeping me on the side for sex. Initially I didn't realize he was turning me into a booty call but I figured it out. I just noticed he would never follow through on date plans with me.

He recently returned to our old job. On day 1 he approached me wanting to have sex at work. He was extremely aggressive with throwing me on the desk and was yanking my clothes off me. I just weakly and stupidly gave in. 

I feel really depressed, vulnerable and disgusted with myself for allowing this unhealthy relationship to go on for as long as it did. While I should not care...I feel bad that the guy probably thinks of me as a slut or whore. 

I already have poor self esteem and depression for other reasons like having little family or friends. I often feel very lonely. It's been really hard for me to function or get out of bed. I've missed work and school days too.

I did muster up the strength to tell the guy about a week ago that the situation was not working for me and I wanted more than sex. And we needed to move on from each other. Of course he pretended he was hurt or will tell me lies that he's interested in more with me. 

Well we worked together yesterday for the 2nd time and he said not one word to me. For some reason this also hurt my feelings. It was like he ignored me. I shouldn't care but it reinforced my belief that he sees me as worthless and just a piece of ass perhaps. It hurts because he is smart and knows what he is doing. 

At the moment I mostly hate myself for not having a backbone and letting myself get shitted on. I wish I loved myself more. At the moment I just want to go to sleep and die. Or, just end my own life because I feel things will never get better for me. The guy used me is probably a good guy and I just messed things up and wasn't good enough for him. Either way my time on this earth should stop.
