Been thinking about suicide again.I have no idea of I'd really do it or not. I'm scared but I don't see the point in living. I'm fat, ugly, and annoying, which is even worse when you pair it with the fact that I'm just genuinely dumb, lazy, and boring. I don't have looks, personality, or smarts going for me, so...what now? There's not anything left for me in the world. I don't have a future.
