LethargicI just had a positive life changing moment. I should be ecstatic right now and feel like I can conquer the world.

But....

I don't feel like that at all. Am I happy? Yeah, but every negative moment leading up to this has made me unbearably depressed. The therapy meetings, doctor appointments,arguments, deaths, medications, and losing friends. 

It wore me down to the person I am now.

My life changing moment isn't to blame for this because I realize its the feeling of loneliness, worthlessness, failure, and self hatred.

 It's just me.

It never goes away...no matter what happens, who I am with, or what I accomplish. I am always trying to find the source of my problem but honestly it's just how I am. I don't think it will,ever go away.

I'm at this point where I don't want live like this. 

What do I live for?
If I am not living for myself why am I alive?
For the sake of just existing?

Are there people who care for me?
Sure, when they feel like it.

I juggle around with the thought of dying in my head a lot. I think I'm crazy and often wonder if I should be in psych ward or something but I hear those places are essentially a prison.

My living situation is toxic and I don't have the means nor mental stability to get myself out.

My support system is a fucking joke but its my fault for trusting others.

Everyday it seems like the light at the end of the is further away than the day before.


I want to cut myself off from the world and be alone.
