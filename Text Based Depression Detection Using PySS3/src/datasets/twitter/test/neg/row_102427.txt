Not sure whyI've been holding on by a thread for a couple years, but I don't mind admitting I'm a coward. I have a 9mm. I have razors. I have ever poison you can imagine. 

I am a coward.  I can't seem to do it to my self.  I dream of car wrecks. On the job accidents. Anything. Just anything to get it over with.

Today I accidentally sliced my hand open and I've been bleeding for 3 hours now. It's a relief.
