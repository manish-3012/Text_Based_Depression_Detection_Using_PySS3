Good last word's?I just want to know how could I tell my little sister she should do the best with her life even when I couldn't handle it anymore. I only want the best for her, I want that she never struggle in life and mostly I don't want her to miss her big brother. I want that she has a worthy life, even when she is losing her only family(me).
