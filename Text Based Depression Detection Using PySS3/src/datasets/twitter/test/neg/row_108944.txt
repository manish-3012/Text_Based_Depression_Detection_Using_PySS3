A letter to the Chicken boneOh sweet chicken bone Iâ€™ve feasted in your meat
Oh sweet chicken bone Iâ€™ve broken you and made my wish
The ants have gathered around you and celebrate so happily
Iâ€™m sorry that you had to die so we could eat.

Now Iâ€™m stuffed and im going to sleep, so please wish me luck in my sleep, oh sweet magic chicken bone Iâ€™ve made my wish.
I hope all the beautiful flowers and trees will grow around my bed, and I hope their leafs will fill the boring air with lush green paint.

Oh magic chicken bone Iâ€™ve made my wish.
Please forgive me for Iâ€™ve been a glutinous and envious thief.
And now Iâ€™m tired so Iâ€™m going to sleep

Oh sweet magic chicken bone Iâ€™m such a foolish and naive kid that Iâ€™ve made a wish to you.
For those who remain awake to never tire like me... and shall they never eat alone so they wonâ€™t have to sleep.

Oh sweet magic chicken bone that wish wonâ€™t become for me.
But for someone else it will and thatâ€™s enough for me

Oh magic chicken bone now I say farewell and thank you
for my soul now feels hope for the first time in many years

Hope that the night will end after Iâ€™ve gone to bed, hope that the sun will rise tomorrow at a different time and in a different place.

Farewell sweet chicken bone and thanks for your delicious flesh 
I hope you lived a happy life and Iâ€™m sorry that you had to die so I could eat.
