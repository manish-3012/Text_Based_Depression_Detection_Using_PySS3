Countdown To Death Day: 3 - Constant Sleep ParalysisI had to post this. I just came back from minutes of sleep paralysis after having weird nightmarish dreams about whatever. Then whenever Rick from Rick and Morty would say â€œFreeze Frameâ€ Iâ€™d be frozen only barely moving for who knows how long

It was pretty interesting though. I donâ€™t remember what led to this part but I was stranded on a red planet with never ending asteroid rain. Rick called it anticipation as in never ending even though I donâ€™t think that makes any sense now that Iâ€™m fully awake. But it seem to make sense when I was dreaming. I was traveling far to see someone Iâ€™ve been messaging on Reddit right Iâ€™m front of me when a huge asteroid hit in between us and all that. I escaped with Rick and Summer. 

Then when Rick was explaining the constant meteor shower the sleep paralysis began, I was awake but couldnâ€™t move, Rick would say â€œFreeze Frameâ€ saying jug would freeze me for ten seconds but it actually did freeze me in a state of paralysis. It was like I could make myself frozen with my mind. I couldnâ€™t escape.. it was so terrifying

I tried screaming but I couldnâ€™t. I tried thinking about other things but it was like my mind was trolling me.. like an internet troll took control of my brain and kept fucking with me

Then when I fully woke up at last I hyperventilated for 30 seconds before opening my phone to post this.. 

Iâ€™ve finally gone crazy you guys.. Iâ€™ve finally lost my mind

The suicide MUST BE DONE

I canâ€™t do it anymore. I fucking hate my life

I donâ€™t know if this has some type of meaning.. Iâ€™ve never dealt with this before

Obviously I know it was because I drank coffee today and got anxiety from it. As well as my left hand being numb from having carpal tunnel on it due to lifting weights a few months back (yeah â€œworking outâ€ really helped guys..) so maybe that had something to do with it

Anyway Iâ€™m done for, Iâ€™m killing myself the SECOND my parents leave and Iâ€™ll finally experience the wonder of nothing. I wonâ€™t experience anything.. but thatâ€™s part of the experience.. I donâ€™t want to feel or experience ANYTHING

You all think Iâ€™m crazy, insane, you heard my story, I have to be put down anyway.. itâ€™s for the better

But also because I hate all of you

Thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™ll post something when I finally kill myself. Iâ€™m going back to sleep
