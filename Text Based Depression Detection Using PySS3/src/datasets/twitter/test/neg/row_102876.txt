I attempted suicide and should have died pt2I remember my thoughts as I took the pills
"Finally; no more being a problem"
"This is for the best"
"He can move on now"

It was like being asleep. Everything was far away and somehow... non-existent. I could barely feel the lamenant floor beneath me, nor the cabinet I was clinging on to.
...why was I clinging to anything, when everything was darkness? I let myself fall to the cool lamenant. It was soothing; familiar, along with the voice that said

"Babe? BABE! BABE PLEASE WAKE UP!"

... I can't.

"NO. NO NO NO DON'T DO THIS. FUCK!"

... oh god.

"Babe..." sobbing now
"Babe why?"

... I fucked up. I didn't mean it. What do I Do? I can't move

He managed to get me into an armchair; kept me focused. The EMTS showed up shortly and took my vitals, I guess. Besides recognizing my regret, i only really remember being loaded onto the ambulance.

My fiance insisted on riding with me the entire way, even though the EMTS were sure my vitals would hold up. I was made to drink concentrated charcoal to offset the acetomenophene I took. 

Even after drinking the charcoal, I felt myself getting increasingly drowsy. I told myself I had just had physical trauma, and that was normal, but as a was settling down to rest, I heard the EMT say "don't fall asleep"

I'd had instances where I "shouldn't have fallen asleep" but it ended up not really mattering, so I continued to snooze. That's when the EMTS shook me awake and said again "I can't let you fall asleep"

Edit: I guess there's going to be a part three of this, since part two is so long. I'm sorry for being so long winded, and thank you anyone who's even listening. I hope this helps I  whatever say it can
