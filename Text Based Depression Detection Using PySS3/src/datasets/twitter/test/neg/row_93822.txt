Tired of all of itI try and yet I can't fix anything. I care about so many people but nobody seems to give a shit about me. I just told my mom about my plans to kill myself and she just shrugged and didn't say anything. I'm just so tired of being lonely and pretending to be happy when I'm not. 

I don't remember the last time I was actually happy. I didn't get to experience a good childhood either, my past is fucked up and so is my present. I just want to live a better life but I can't even fucking get a job at McDonald's. Fuck this. My mom just yelled at me about some stupid shit right now so I'm gonna go jump off a bridge. I hope you guys are able to find happiness some day.
