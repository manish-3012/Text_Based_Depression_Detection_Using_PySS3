Ain't easySeem to just zombified day to day . Can't seem to hold a girl longer than a girl . When someone say they don't regret breaking up with you hurts and motivation seems to fade . Not happy with myself and my life . My world shouldn't revolve around keeping someone . It's just so painful dealing with this depression. I think about killing myself everyday . Wish I can just erase all my memories about all my ex's and just start fresh .
