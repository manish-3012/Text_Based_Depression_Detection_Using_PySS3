How come some posts get 30+ comments and some get none? They are all just as serious. You people made me feel even more suicidal, thanks.I see a lot of posts getting at least 10+ comments. Mine got one. All suicidal ideation is serious. Thank you to this sub for making me feel even more alone and pushing me further into suicidal thoughts.
