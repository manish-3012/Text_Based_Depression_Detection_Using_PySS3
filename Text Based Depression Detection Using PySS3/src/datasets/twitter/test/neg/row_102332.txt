Ruined my lifeThree months ago I was fine, doing well at uni, great girlfriend great friends everything. I was so stupid and decided to try drugs. Did MDMA four times over three months, did not do my research, just blindly followed my mates and it turns out now that they do stupidly large doses and its a miracle they are alive. On my fourth try I did way too much and now my brain is ruined. I cant sleep, I am impotent, have no memory, cant plan anything, depression and anxiety attacks, think about suicide every day as I just sit at home doing nothing as I am completely useless now. I have horrible visual problems as well, its as if I am never sober along with constant pain behind my eyes. I am on antidepressants which have turned me into a zombie. I hate myself for doing this to my family and for not being smart, I just assumed my friends knew what they were doing and they are all fine and still on track, I had always said no to them as it is so stupid! I cant go on like this for much longer, I can no longer feel happiness from anything. Thrown everything away for absolutely nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!
