I just wrote my note. I don't think i can carry on much longer.Every day is getting worse. It doesn't seem to matter how hard I try to stay positive, it only gets worse day by day. I feel i'm going to snap soon and do something. The only thing keeping me alive right now is the thought of those i'd leave behind. But at the moment i'm thinking that once i'm gone, guilt won't even exist. Nothing will exist. I won't be able to screw anything up anymore. I'm not sure what i'm even looking for by posting this. I'm just messed up, struggling, and sick of existence. Thanks for listening.
