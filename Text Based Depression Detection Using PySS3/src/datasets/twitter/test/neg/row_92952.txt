Its painful to live each fucking dayLife sucks so bad guys. I feel like I am losing everything. I have depression and anxiety which made me push people away from myself. Gf left me few months back. I consoled myself I that I still have friends. But I was wrong. I am alone in this world. It pains me a lot. Wish I was never born.
