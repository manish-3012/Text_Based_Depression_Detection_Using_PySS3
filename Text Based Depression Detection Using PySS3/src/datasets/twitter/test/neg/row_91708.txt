I hate people that say killing yourself is selfishPeople that kill themselves are/were obviously going through hell emotionally and you expect them to live just for the sake of others? Do you expect them to put others before them or something like that? Fuck you. You have no idea what they are going through. I'm not saying killing yourself is the "correct" way, but I totally understand people who do it. It can get too much sometimes and killing yourself really does feel like the only option.
