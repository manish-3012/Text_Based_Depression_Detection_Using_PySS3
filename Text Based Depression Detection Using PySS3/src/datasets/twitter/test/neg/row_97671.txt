My Sisters good friend committed suicide this week.I donâ€™t know if I should be posting this here but Iâ€™m worried for my sister I live so far away from her Iâ€™m worried because ever since her friend passed away she hasnâ€™t been the same sheâ€™s really having it hard saying things such as â€œI wish I could have saved himâ€ or â€œI donâ€™t know how to cope with this pain.â€ Sheâ€™s constantly crying at the mention of her friend itâ€™s only been three days yet her personality changed so much I guess losing someoneâ€™s so close can do this to you Iâ€™m just worried that sheâ€™ll eventually start thinking life isnâ€™t worth living and follow her friend if anyone can recommend what I can do to help her even though Iâ€™m hundred miles away during this tough time for her sheâ€™s alone and donâ€™t have anyone to lean on I was that person but I left moved away.
