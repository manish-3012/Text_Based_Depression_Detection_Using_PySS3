just got dumped by my serious boyfriend of 2.5 years with no warning signshe was the only thing keeping me stable. he told me he loved me yesterday. there was no emotion and sympathy in his voice when he ended things. i haven't been this bad since before we were dating. i literally can't feel my limbs and i haven't stopped crying since it happened. for the first time in so long, i've been looking into ways to end my life. someone please tell me there's a way to make this pain subside. otherwise, i see no other way. help.
