Finally going through with itI know that if I started putting in effort again, I might have been able to survive, but I've been suicidal from a very young age (first attempt at age 11) and I'm so tired of fighting. I can't live knowing that everyday I have to wake up and deal with depression; things don't get better and they don't get any easier. My mother hates me and my friends all left me (not due to my own doing, just circumstantial/education ect.)

Nothing's worth it anymore. I can't remember when I had a day that was just... okay. I don't need everyday to be perfect and good, I know that's not realistic, but every single day feels so incredibly shitty and I don't have any direction to go;;

I guess it just feels better writing it all out
