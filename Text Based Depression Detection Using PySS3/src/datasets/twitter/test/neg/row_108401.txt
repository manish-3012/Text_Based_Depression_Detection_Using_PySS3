Decided Iâ€™m gonna get completely fucked up in freshers week( Iâ€™ll be second year) and then Iâ€™m going to end my lifeMight as well go out with a bang. I should have everything ready after itâ€™s over. I donâ€™t want to have to do anymore exams or lectures. I just want to get screwed up and then leave this planet. Hopefully after it my anxiety will be a bit better after socialising and Iâ€™ll just go through with it. Canâ€™t wait
