I feel like I'm at the end of my ropeDisclaimer: I just really need to write everything out.. so.. here it goes

I guess I don't really know where to start. I need to get my thoughts out and have been wanting to post here for quite some time. I've been living with depression for about 12 years now. What started off as severe mental abuse just kind of turned into me never being happy with my life. I feel like there is just a constant weight holding me down all the time and that I am suffocating. Twelve days ago the love of my life left me and now she's already seeing other people. The past few years I've gradually lost interest in everything that used to make me happy (playing music, hiking, theatre) and now I'm just going through the motions. All of the friends I thought I had don't know how to handle someone with depression so I feel abandoned on that front. I've got like 3 people that have stuck with me through this and they don't deserve that. I definitely can't go to my family. We lost my sister to SIDS 20 years ago and I know that they couldn't handle the thought of someone in their family suffering.  I'm so numb to everything around me and I'm honestly just tired of living. I called a crisis hotline the other night because I was ready to kill myself, something I never thought I'd have to do in my entire life. It got me through the night, but here I am again just wishing I could disappear. For years now I've had images of my own suicide flashing through my head. Now they come every single day and I even have a plan.. and it takes so much just to push them away. I told myself that I'll try to last until May to see where I'm at and how things are going. I'm reasonably successful for my age and I've done a lot more than most, but I still hate myself and, as I've said, can't find interest in anything anymore. I'm starting to see a therapist again on Friday.. I hope it helps because I don't have the energy or the will power to keep going. I don't want to be alive.
