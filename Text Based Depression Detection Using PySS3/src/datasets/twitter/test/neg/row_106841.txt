I had the tie around my neckBut I chickened out. I pulled it tight and for several seconds it felt tight and it was hard to breath. I felt pulsing in my neck but I let go. My 7 month old was sleeping in his crib that I was using to hold the tie up while I let it choke me and my 2 year old and husband was asleep in the bedroom. That was about half an hour ago.  My husband just started a new job so I have no insurance. My anxiety has gotten so bad I have started making my toddler stay up late until 3 or 4 am so he will sleep to 3 or 4 in the afternoon and when the baby isn't awake I sleep too just waiting for my husband to be home.  I love my kids but I hate being a mother. I favor the baby over the toddler and the guilt over that kills me. If I go to the ER my husband will have to watch the kids and he will loose his job and they will have nothing. I'm too selfish to just be a good mother and stop being depressed and anxious but I'm not selfish enough to abandon them even though they would be better off without me.
