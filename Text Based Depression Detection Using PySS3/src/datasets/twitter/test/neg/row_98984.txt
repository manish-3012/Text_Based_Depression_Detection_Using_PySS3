Can't bear with it anymore.. SorrySorry for bothering this reddit so many times in a row, but I can't take it anymore. My head is aching so hard, it hurts more than anything.

In my [previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3zlwx7/i_dont_know_anymore_i_want_it_to_end/) I explained many things and I can't tell anyone, so I just use to fake a smile all day long, but it's too hard. Nobody knows how I feel.

I don't want it anymore and I even started an animation to show how I feel. Welp, here it is..

[What's going to happen tomorrow, hopefully.] (http://puu.sh/mnb5Y.gif)

I don't know what else to do than post here, sorry. Blame me all you want, but please don't hate me. 

See you.
