I need to walk through some things that I did today. PlsI apologize if i am breaking any rules. Today at work on lunch I felt terrible. Was depressed and was listening to some music and to be vague I ended up doing some things I regret. I need to walk through my thoughts and actions. If I bothered anyone with my post I apologize. Not my intention. I just really need someone right now and the people I normally talk to are not responding and I am kinda freaking out. Sorry again
