I'm losing my fucking mindI don't know what the fuck is going on. I lifted my self esteem from 0 and started being more productive and healthy with coping mechanisms but for some fucking reason last week  I just completely went to shit. I'm constantly shaking and feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown, I keep having small panic attacks, then a few minutes later I'll just be completely normal. I dont know what the fuck is happening but I'm going crazy
