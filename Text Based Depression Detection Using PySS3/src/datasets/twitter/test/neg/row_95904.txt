Scared but I canâ€™t anymore.Iâ€™ve had these thoughts since I could remember (I think it was because I was sexually abused for years as a child) - lately my thoughts are out of control. I got laid off in the summer and I canâ€™t find a job. Iâ€™m broke so I canâ€™t move from my parents. My father lives here and Iâ€™m sort of estranged from him, heâ€™s trying to reconnect with me and Iâ€™m fucking triggered by it. No one in my family listens to me because Iâ€™m the youngest and Iâ€™m a girl. I have no idea of what to do. I have no idea of how to make these thoughts stop. Idk what to do.
