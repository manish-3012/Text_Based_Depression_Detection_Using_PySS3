The End of the EndI posted earlier, but now Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to do it. Itâ€™s 1:40 in the morning, Iâ€™ve been crying on and off for the past 24 hours now, and itâ€™s the only way to make the pain end. I just needed someone to hear me during my last few days. I canâ€™t tell anyone because theyâ€™d stop me and then Iâ€™d lose my job or spot in school for sure, and that would make me want to die even more than right now. I wish there were a way to start over again, or feel less alone than I do now. Iâ€™m sorry.
