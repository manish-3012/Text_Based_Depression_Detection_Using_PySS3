Is it really codependencyIâ€™ve been abused my entire life by my family and systems/others who saw that I had no protection so they preyed upon me too. Is it so bad for me to want to have a normal relationship with another human being for once in my life? I always get told or see others talk about â€œlove yourselfâ€ but these people come from fairly decent backgrounds. Itâ€™s easy to love yourself when you were already given a blueprint by your parents or other people in your life. Its belittling when I feel shamed for wanting friends or wanting to have a partner, and feeling suicidal because I donâ€™t have anyone. We learn to love ourselves through another human being period. If thatâ€™s not true then throw a newborn baby into a cave with no human contact and see how much they love themselves 18 years later. When youâ€™re born into an extremely dysfunctional family itâ€™s like being thrown inside a cave.
