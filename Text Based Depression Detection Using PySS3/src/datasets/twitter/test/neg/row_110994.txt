Stopped CaringI'm 30 years old, and I have no friends, I haven't had a friend in a LONG time. I'm currently a student, and I only have 3 more classes before I get my degree. I just finished up a great summer internship, and I work for a professor now. I am going to have a ton of great recommendations once I graduate. A good job is pretty much guaranteed.. if I don't kill myself before I graduate. I get home from school/work, and I sit on my couch and do nothing. Every one has told me that it gets better, but when? Once I finish school, get a decent job, a place bigger than my current one bedroom apartment, i'll still be sitting alone on my couch once I get back from work. Sitting alone on my couch thinking about killing myself. The truth is, I don't even think I want friends at this point. The anxiety of trying to impress new people doesn't seem worth it. My depression has worsened significantly in the past couple of months. I don't care about anyone, I don't care about my belongings, I don't care about my professor, I just don't have anything holding me back at this point. I have had depression and wanted to kill myself for as long as I can remember. I take medication, but it doesn't get rid of the pressure in my chest that is sadness. I am positive that I am going to kill myself soon..
