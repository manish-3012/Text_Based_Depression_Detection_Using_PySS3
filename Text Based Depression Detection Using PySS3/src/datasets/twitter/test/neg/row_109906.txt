I've already taken 3000 milligrams of BupropionAs stated in my title I'm committing suicide by OD. Why should I not finish the rest of my pills? I've lost all of my motivation to do anything. I'm failing my classes due to depression. I smoke Marijuana to calm myself. I'm actually going to go do that before school. Yes, I'm going to school while I'm in the process of OD'ing. I need to say goodbye.
