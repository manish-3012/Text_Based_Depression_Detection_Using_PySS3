Fuck it, i screw up everything. Need advice on what to do.My life isn't harsh, just gloomy and miserable for the majority of the time. 
My fucking sister screams constantly and complains about her mediocre problems, to top it off she gets sympathy and im left alone.

My dad constantly says i need to get "my shit together" and always says i never try, despite the fact i go to school, work and participate in extra curricular activities.
Im never fucking good enough, im constantly reminded that im no good, that no-one is ever proud of me.
I get ridiculed for not going to school even when i'm physically sick and on the verge of suicide.

Both my parents are aware i'm depressed, but don't ever seem to check in on me, even though i'm 17 i feel like they have abandoned caring for me like a child, my father anyways.

I've always tried to follow their wishes, i am probably obedient 99% of the time and try just to make things tolerable, neverless there is always a problem.
I'm just to fucking tired to get up everyday to go to school, having to smile and act human.
I just can't make it to whatever event i'm supposed to go to.

I don't understand why i'm such a dissapointment, i've even set up plans to go to university to study pharmacy. 
What the fuck am i doing wrong? I need advice, the only thing stopping me from ending it is liberal use of prescription painkillers. 

And the worse part is, when i've been crying  horrendously holding a belt to hang myself, SUDDENLY everyone cares, dad all of a sudden cares! woah, what a fucking joke, manipulative cunt. 




Sorry if this seems self centered and attention seeking-ish i just needed to voice  this.
