Just trying to breathe and keep my eyes from swelling shutIt was this time in 2015 that I was preparing for my magnificent son to be born. Only July 23 I gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy and I was completely in love. His name was Liam James Taylor and everyone loved him.  He was planned. He was wanted. He was perfect. Was. There are all these things they tell you to do as a mom to reduce the statistical likelihood of SIDS. Even if you do all of them, even if you are are a good kind soul who loves God, you can still wake up in the middle of the night and find your son unresponsive at just 19 days old. If there is a hell it is giving your newborn baby CPR and not getting anywhere. Of course I called for help. They took him away from me in the hospital. They sent me to a waiting room. I prayed. They gave up on him. They let him die. I thought God woke me up so I could help him. They wouldn't let me hold his little body because "the police had to investigate." In shock I agreed. They investigated. Of course rhese things just happen. No fault found. Every night I awoke to check on the baby,  it is an evolutionary trait that is hard wired into the brain of women after they give birth. Some people who complain of post partum depression because their clothes don't fit and their life is stressful responding to the many demands of their growing family. Postpartum depression with no baby is strange and awful.  I try to not be sad all of the time. I try to supress my intense negative feelings. I try to control my grief. But I am so sad I often contemplate suicide and my husband often tells me contemplates suicide. When People say "I'm too depreseed to get out of bed," I  think that sounds luxurious. Im trying not to cry at my desk.
