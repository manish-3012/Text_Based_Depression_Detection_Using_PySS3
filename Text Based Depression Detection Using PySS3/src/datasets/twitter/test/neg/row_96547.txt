Hey everyone. Iâ€™m scaredIm young. But Iâ€™m tired and done. Iâ€™m pretty sure I live with narcissistic parents and a narcissist brother and Iâ€™m tired of being yelled at and told Iâ€™m wrong for doing normal things a teenager my age should do. And then my parents ARE CONSTANTLY making fun of me and when I try to tell them to stop they call me sensitive and that Im over reacting. I think Iâ€™m going to p@rti@l h@ngl in my closet and I have what I need. But Iâ€™m scared to do it. What of i fail and become a vegetable. And then what happens when you die. I also am too curious to see wether or not the afterlife even exist. Iâ€™m pagan but very new to the religion so I donâ€™t know much about the pagan afterlife.  If someone could ease my anxiety or something. I want to do it. But Iâ€™m scared. Also Iâ€™ll probably just fall into another statistical teenage suicid3. Thanks for reading I hope youâ€™re having a good day
