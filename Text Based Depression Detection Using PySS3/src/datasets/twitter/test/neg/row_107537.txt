sorry for the annoyancefriend 1 is "tired of my shit"

friend 2 told me to stop annoying him

friend 3 says i need to shut up because i'm not in debt or a drug addict

parents don't care

sister don't speak to me anymore because i'm not man enough to not be offended at her 'jokes'

brother is "too busy with his own life" to listen

maybe you won't think i'm annoying, SW. this is goodbye, to someone who may care.
