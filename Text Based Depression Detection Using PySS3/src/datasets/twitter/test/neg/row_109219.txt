â€œ youâ€™ll regret killing yourself just think of the pain that your mom will feel"istg I hate it when people keep telling me this. Even the woman that works for the suicide Hotline has told me this MULTIPLE of times, like Iâ€™m sorry Im stuck with depression and suicidal thoughts, Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™ve tried to commit multiple of times this month but stopped because of feeling endless guilt. Sometimes I regret feeling suicidal because my life isnâ€™t as bad as others.
