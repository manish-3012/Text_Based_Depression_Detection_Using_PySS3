I shouldn't live, I have no reason to.That ends up being my thoughts multiples times a day, I suppose. At the moment I can't do anything to leave this situation, I can't get out of my shithole of a country, I'm way too young to work, what is the point? having to suffer through so many years just for a slight breeze of peace?  My life has been filled with failures, even with my few accomplishments, I still feel like I shouldn't live.

I don't have a reason to do so after all,  I don't have a person that lights my day up, I don't have a future that is bright, I just don't really know anymore.
