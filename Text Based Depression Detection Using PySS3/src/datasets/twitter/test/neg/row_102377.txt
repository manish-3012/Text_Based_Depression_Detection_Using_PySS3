Feels like life in the future will be too hard for me...I am just a young man (just turned 18), but i feel like my hope for the future is dwindling.  I have so many things "wrong" with me that i feel like ill never be able to maintain a fun life or get in a relationship with anyone.

Since i was a child i was diagnosed with a moderate hearing loss and it gets worse every day.  It has affected my speech so much that many people have a hard time understanding what i say.  I fear that i may soon go deaf in a few years.  

I have been having really bad back problems in the past year that essentially renders my back a giant hump.  I have scheurmans disease which makes me self conscious to take my shirt off or even where a t-shirt.  People have been making fun of me for a long time for this and it restricts me from exercising or participating in things i really enjoy.  (like swimming)

Not to mention i am already unattractive, with glasses and pasty, white skin.  My face looks bloated while the rest of my body remains bony.  I have a degenerative knee disorder that makes it very difficult to run or squat.  

However, my saving grace is that MENTALLY, i am very sharp and quick witted.  I have often been quoted as being really funny. (Voted funniest person in class last year) and i feel like i am a really attractive person MENTALLY.

I am tired of physical limitations keeping me from doing what i really want to do, but i feel like there is too much stacked up against me.  When i read stories about a guy who has a good life but only has one thing wrong with him that he complains about, i lose hope in the fact that i have so much going against me.

I feel that if i ever truly lose my hearing that will be the end for me.

EDIT: After talking to a complete stranger at panda express, i realize that i am still a really funny and likable guy, but if i become deaf, i will really struggle. :/
