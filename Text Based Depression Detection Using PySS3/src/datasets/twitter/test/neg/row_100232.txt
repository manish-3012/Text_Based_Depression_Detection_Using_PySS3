The suicidal thoughts won't stop.I'm eighteen. I grew up in a very poor and physically and emotionally abusive home. I was neglected and to make matters worse I was severely bullied though middle school and moderately bullied in high school. I got engaged before I graduated and I was also kicked out of my home before I graduated high school. My family didn't come to my graduation, the only person there for me was my fiance. I've lived in the shadow of my genius best friend all of our lives, and she is constantly putting me down because she's smarter than me. We are roommates in college and I made the decision to drop out. We have been here for 13 days and I have hysterically cried everyday since we've been here. She only got worse when I told her I was dropping out and made me feel like complete shit. She's also told multiple people that I am leaving so my phone has been going off all day because of people texting me and facebook messaging me about how I am ruining my life, I will never go back to college, I am letting down everyone who believed in me, and I will just be another statistic. As if I didn't already feel like shit about this. But I can't handle it anymore. I desperately want to kill myself, but I don't have the balls to do it. I can't hurt my fiance like that, and I couldn't do that to my family, even though we are all messed up. I feel like I have no where to go, no one to talk to. I feel isolated and worthless. I want to kill myself. go find a building to jump off or something. But I can't. I can't force myself to go through with it and it's eating me away from the inside.
I don't know what to do.
