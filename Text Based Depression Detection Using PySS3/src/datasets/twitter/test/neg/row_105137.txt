Depression hits hardI've been depressed for months now. I had some things happen a year ago and now I'm 2 grades behind in school. I feel talentless. I have a small group of friends and every time I see them do or make something amazing I can't help but feel stupid and worthless. My family is a stressful mess. I've contemplated commiting suicide but I don't want to. I don't want to rob myself of another happy moment I may have. But im looking for some encouragement in my current situation to help me feel better and get back on track. My self esteem is basically non existent. I've been emotionally scarred so many times any time I mess up I feel like I've betrayed or hurt the other person even over the most miniscule things. I want these fears to just go away. I want to feel normal again. I want to have a life.
