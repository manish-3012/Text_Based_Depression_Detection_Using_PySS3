My brother needs helpMy brother in law talks very often of suicide. He's even told me his plan. His contends that he has felt this way since he was 10 years old, hes 24 now. We tried getting him to talk to someone.  Tonight we even got him to call 2 different suicide hotlines but it didnt help any. He is unsatisified because he feels that life has no purpose, no meaning. He wants to talk yo someone who can give him some purpose. I guess thats why the hotline was unable to help him? They can't tell him any thing. So I dont know what to do. Or what to say. Anyone have any ideas?
