I don't understand.Everything used to be so different. I used to be in love. I used to love every small thing I could. Its over 80 degrees here and I feel so cold. The colors are so dull. I feel like I can't smell anything. There was even a point where I was conceited; where I put others below me. Where I had integrity. I am a man of God. I am surrounded by a supportive family and friends. I'm (relatively) handsome, I play sports for a University. Why do I still feel this way? My hands just won't stop shaking. I bought razors and whiskey for my bathtub tonight. I even tested it out at work and realized it doesn't even hurt. I've seen death before in my night terrors. I've stared into his cold eyes. I do not fear him. I am not afraid. I'm a semester away from the real world; from pursuing my dreams. I once had a life of being straight edge. I wouldn't touch alcohol or drugs and would look down on those who did. I have a beautiful girlfriend who I loved very very much. It seemed like it was us against the world. That was many years ago. I wonder if they will show the new star wars movie in heaven. Even if they don't, I'm sure it wouldn't be life changing. I know those who I leave will resent my actions. However, their rash feelings will never be as strong as my hatred toward myself. I already have 2 of my close friends leave us. I understand why now. My hatred toward myself has grown stronger than my love for those I care about. I can't believe I'm saying that, but it is true. I really feel like I've got no where else to go.
