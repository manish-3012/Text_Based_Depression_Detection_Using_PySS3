I am all out of ideasI have been dealing with my shit for a very long time from the abusive mother to boyfriends... I thought I finally had this right when a guy comes along and helps me, makes me open up and gains my trust.... I love him still so much but he has now left me (even though he says he still loves me)...
Now I know this dont seem like a big deal but he has taken me to another country leaving all my family and friends behind with a promise of a life with him... we had kids names a wedding, house and business plan.

Im now stuck here for now with a family that doesn't like me. My depression that was at bay is now full blown kinda... I dont want to go back to how I was with the alcohol and pain killers or sleeping tablets but I think that might end up happening...
Im scared of flying on my own but I have to go back asap :(

I just need someone right now when in this whole country I have no one...
