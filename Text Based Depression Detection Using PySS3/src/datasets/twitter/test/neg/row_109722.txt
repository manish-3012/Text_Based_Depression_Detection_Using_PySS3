Non existence fantasyIâ€™ve been a long time sufferer of anxiety and depression. Iâ€™m at a point in my life now where I no longer fear death, in fact , I think about death/not existing and fantasize about it all the time. I see photos of before I was born and I canâ€™t help but get so happy an nostalgic at a world where I didnâ€™t exist. In conjunction with that, I constantly focus on ways to make my non-existence a reality. I hurt knowing I would leave my children behind, but the hurt and pain I feel about everything else is far worse and just not livable anymore. Im just tired of â€œbeingâ€ and â€œexistingâ€. Itâ€™s exhausting. 

I had hopes of when I went into surgery a few months ago that I wouldnâ€™t ever wake up again and I was so at peace with that. My doctors told me I was the calmest patient they ever saw before a surgery. Of course I was, I was so happy to be put under and escape this life in hopes I wouldnâ€™t return. But here I am. 

I also fantasize about how much shit my coworkers talk of me... rationalizing even more how worthless I am and not deserving of the life I have. My family would be fine... this I do know. 

I had a close call a few days ago when a car coming the opposite direction crossed the yellow line and I have never felt more calm than in that moment. I was so ready. 

Iâ€™m chicken shit for being a pussy about how to kill myself... but I fantasize about how I would do it all the time. It consumes any spare time I have. I intentionally block times off to think and imagine a world where I donâ€™t exist. 

I get so excited when I have the house to myself, too. I slam my head into the corners of the walls and will starve myself as punishment. It feels so good to do these things. 

I look forward to not existing. At least that is something thatâ€™s a given. Itâ€™s all I look forward to and fantasize about.
