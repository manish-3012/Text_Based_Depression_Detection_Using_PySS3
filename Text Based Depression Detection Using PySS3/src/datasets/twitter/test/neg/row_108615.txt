I really want to die but I donâ€™t know how or if I even shouldMy grades are shit. Iâ€™m in my last year of high school and Iâ€™ve got tons of missing work, depression and OCD, and likely undiagnosed ADD or something similar. I canâ€™t remember work that I have to do, and if I do I have zero motivation to get it done. My parents donâ€™t believe me when I say Iâ€™m suicidal (they think Iâ€™m trying to distract from my problems), nor do they think Iâ€™m actually depressed. Iâ€™m a fucking failure, Iâ€™m gonna fail in life. Tonight my dad called (heâ€™s stationed in Korea with the military while weâ€™re in the States) and said heâ€™s so disappointed in me, heâ€™s ashamed of me, and he feels how his father felt when his dad kicked him out. He said theyâ€™re too soft on me and they feel like they canâ€™t say anything to me that isnâ€™t super nice. I just want to end it all, I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t yet. The razor blades I have arenâ€™t sharp enough to cut deep enough for me to bleed out. I just want it to end, or I want to run away or sleep forever. Maybe I can siphon carbon dioxide in through my car tomorrow after my therapy appointment. I just wish this was over! I know my parents and my friends and my family love me and I have a lot to live for but I just canâ€™t FEEL it. I want to be gone. Please please please I want it to end.
