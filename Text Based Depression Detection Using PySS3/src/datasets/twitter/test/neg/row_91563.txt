Is this normal?[16M] For some period I am a mess, I wanna die really bad, make plans, don't sleep well, tired all the time etc. But sometime (after 2 weeks) I wake up, feeling tired and all the other sh#t, but not suicidal, and happy. This goes on for 4 days, and today I wake up and guess what. Suicidal again. Waking up with the thought "just kill yourself" is such a nice way to get started. 
I remeber when I was like 9, and had this weird urge to jump off my 6-storie balcony. I didn't have any problems, have a relatively good family, used to be a good student. Wtf happened? I guess it's in the genes. Long periods of depression and then a small happy break for 3-4 days. That's all. That's my life. 80% studying (and not doing well in school) and 20% sleeping. The only good time I have is with the guy I sit with in school. He's a really funny guy. But that's all. Its really a drag to keep on going.
