Im losing hopeMy doctor is unsure if I just have depression or if I'm bipolar. She tried me on a new medication and these last few weeks have been a downward spiral into boredom, anxiety, and a general feeling of uselessness. I've come off the med now but it has crushed my hopes of completing high school. It has crushed my hopes of feeling better. These feelings are returning that I haven't felt for 2 years. I thought I had made progress.


We're back at square one.

This past week I've been daydreaming about laying my head down on railroad tracks drunk out of my mind and just ending it. 

I have no place here
