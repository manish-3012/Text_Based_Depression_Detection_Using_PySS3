Was going to post this in NoContact/For background stuff, check my profile for other posts/

TLDR: I managed to keep alive more than my initial expectation (19 Feb). Now, I'm setting a new goal to hold out until 31st march. Then, I plan to leave on 1st of April

I just broke my NoContact this morning (after 1 month)..
Not that actually talked or interact in any ways. But I checked  my ex instagram account and found out that I just got blocked hahaha.. (I'm the dumpee btw).

Don't understand why she did that. But that's her answer. So okay.

I know it kinda sucks. Because, something that drives me to the edge is probably for many considers as not significant. I tried so hard not to let my past define me, I just had enough.

Thank you for all people who support each other in this subreddit. I'll try to live my life to the best until the end!
