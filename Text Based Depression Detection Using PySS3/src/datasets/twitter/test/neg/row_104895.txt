Today i burned my sketchbookIve been sketching since i was a child started with ben 10 naruto and moved on to real like but ive never been good but i feel happy and i always continued to do it.

Drawing doodling writing helps me keep my depression in check but today somethings happened and i lost all of my hope to get better at anything and burned the only thing i thought was good at. Its better to give up earlier than to realize that im not cut out for this. 

I dont know what to feel or do anymore.. it sucks
