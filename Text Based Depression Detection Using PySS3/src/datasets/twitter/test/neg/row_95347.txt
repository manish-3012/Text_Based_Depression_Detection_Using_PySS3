Getting help leads to more pain.About 6 months ago I met this girl and we really liked each other so the first 2 months we had this quasi relationship going on. During that time she was the first person that I could tell about my suicidal thoughts and at first it was great. The problem was that it felt a little too great and because of a couple of really pathetic reasons, I still told her all about my problems even though I knew she wasn't interested in hearing about them and now she won't even talk to me. I fucked that up, because I talked about these things. She was also one of my last friends so my shitty little social life is crumbling away.

Last december I told mym mum about these suicidal thoughts and it was awkward as fuck. She then for the next couple of days tried to talk to me about it and I hated it. I regret telling her. I still can't sometimes look her in the eyes

Then in the military I told a doctor about these thoughts and I then had to waste a lot of time to convince them that I wasn't in that bad shape, because none of them even slightly respected my need to be in the military. Just a straight up your desires don't matter to us and we'll take your freedom away if we'll feel like it attitude.

I lost one of my only few friends and will lose more if I tell any more friends, I made things more awkward with the only few who are capable of loving me purely, because genetics and I almost lost my own choice of being in the military and then having these people with no respect for my free will make decisions for me. I am completely alone and i'm uncapable of doing anything alone, hence i'm completely fucked.
