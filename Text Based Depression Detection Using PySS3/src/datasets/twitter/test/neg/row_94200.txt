Not sure if I want to shoot myselfI own a gun for some time now and I've been thinking  about using it almost every day. I didn't know it would be this easy, that's the main reason why I even tried to get one. I somehow hoped someone or something would stop me, but nothing like that happened. I just did some paperwork, went into a store and now I legally own a handgun since a few months ago. I knew it was a bad idea the second I got out of the store. Shooting myself has been my number one suicide fantasy for years, thats why I wanted to own one, to finally end it. But now I'm not sure if I'm serious with shooting myself , it scares me to be honest. I often just sit there, holding the gun or bring it to my temple but I never pull the trigger. Just holding it like that, feeling how heavy it is in my hands, gives me some kind of kick. I keep fantasizing about shooting myself but not lethal, like shooting through my shoulder or my arm, so I can "test the waters". I also own various combat knives and I fantasize about stabbing myself often, I also stabbed myself once right through my left hand but it wasn't as bad as I expected. I'm not sure if I really want to kill myself or just mutilate my body even more. Anyone feeling the same? 

I know this is really fucked up and I need to seek help but I don't have enough money for therapy and I'm also in a bad situation health care wise - I'm practically going to lose my job if I get psychological help through my insurance.
