Everybody thinks I'm a bitch but I actually just want to kill myselfI often can barely function or show any sort of emotion because I'm stuck in a loop of trying to figure out all of the variables of the different methods of killing myself. Suicide terrifies me but it seems like the only choice most days. But every time I find myself having a day where I'm just going through the motions and barely existing, everyone (honestly, just my boyfriend who I love with) just thinks I'm being rude and mean. No one ever notices there's something wrong with me. I mention being sad and angry all the time and no one takes me seriously. Everyone thinks I'm fine but I just want to die. I just want someone to notice that I just want to die.
