Is there any logical reason NOT to commit suicide?I owe money. For school, of course. But that makes it worse.

Also I'm diabetic. I've been dead since I was 10 years old and the doctors told me it would take ~$1000 a year just to live in medical expenses.

My wife loves me, but I don't deserve it, so the fact that my unemployed ass mooches off of her makes it worse.

I'm doing it tomorrow.

I hate this subreddit and everyone on it. I hate you for giving people false hope and pretending there's any reason to live. We're all slaves.

Fuck all of you. I hope you enjoy living out your pointless life in this endless hell, twice over for conning smarter people than you into suffering alongside you.

Assholes.
