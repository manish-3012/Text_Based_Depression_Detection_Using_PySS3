do you sometimes hate yourself for hating yourself?lately i have been trying to control my self and improve my self, i have been reading self help books and all books say the same thing "you are in control of everything in your life" and that statement really hurts me cuz i always somehow chose to do nothing , like my body doesn't respond i cant get off my bed i want to get up but my body doesnt want to , and when i do i always ignore things i have been  trying to do and end up doing what i have been doing for the last 3 weeks which its nothing at all.

the books say i should love my self be positive and treat my self like a king but i cant cuz i alawys chose to waste my life with nothing , therapy didnt work so as the books i bought, started to wonder if anything will work.
