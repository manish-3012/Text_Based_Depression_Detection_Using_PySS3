Weak latchI've had suicidal thoughts for awhile. Never acted on them, other than progressing a slow death by alcohol. Until last night. I was drinking alone, and my SO was asleep in bed. It hit me that now was as good a time as any to go for it. So, I grabbed my belt from the closet. I looped it, put the loose end over the top of my office door, and shut it. After a few solid tugs on it, I was convinced it would hold. Wrote a short little note saying "I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", and stood on my toes to get my head through the loop. I let my weight settle, and remember thinking it was a sharper pain than I had imagined it would be. I came to with my SO standing over me, asking what the hell I was doing. I must have pressed back against the door after blacking out, and it popped open, dislodging the belt. So, there I am on my back, trying to come up with an excuse as to why I had a belt around my neck and woke her up with my unconscious ass hitting the floor. After a quick joke about her being worried I was doing some weird sexual thing, I told her the belt was originally around my forehead as a bandana, and I tripped from being drunk. She saw the note, but luckily it wasn't very descriptive, and I could play it off as apologizing for being a drunk idiot. Can't believe I actually did it with her home. Or at home in general. It's almost hard not to laugh at how stupid the situation ended.
