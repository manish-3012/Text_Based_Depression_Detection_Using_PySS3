I'm so over this.I'm not normally one to reach out, but I am at my last straw and I dont know where else to turn.  

I have been depressed for many years. My friends, as well as the parents of my childrens friends, are in the medical community and I dont want to be branded the "crazy" one if I speak up, and dont want the stigma of a broken mother to follow my children around for life.

I have been quietly pushing the people closest to me away.  I have been sabotaging my friendships as best as I can, so that when I finally go through with my plan, it will hopefully hurt them all a bit less.

I can identify that I have a problem.  I need help.  I feel like I am slowly going crazy.  I dont know what to do to stop this spiral. The only solution seems like the most permanent one.  

Nobody seems to have seen the signs that I have gotten to this point.  Maybe they did, and just dont care.  Who knows.

I give up.
