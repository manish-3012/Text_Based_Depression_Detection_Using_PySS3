Suicidal thoughts dailyI can't stop them. I want to live. But I want to die more. I can't live a life where I think about killing myself everyday. After over a year and a half of this, I just don't know if I can keep fighting anymore. I'm ready to give in. I'm also thinking about after Christmas. Maybe even before new years. I don't think I can enter a new year feeling the way I do, knowing that this will probably be the rest of my life. Fuck "treatment resistant depression". Fuck my doctors. Fuck everything.
