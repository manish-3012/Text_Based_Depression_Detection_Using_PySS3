My ex-lover is dead but guilt holding me backSomeone I love died in a car accident a few months ago. He didnâ€™t love me back so I left him. But now that heâ€™s gone, Iâ€™m all sorts of fucked up. All I do is go on the internet at work to google stupid shit like time travel or speaking to the dead or even past life regression because my mind canâ€™t accept that heâ€™s gone for good and that Iâ€™ll never see him again. I keep beating myself up because he didnâ€™t even love me and I deserve someone who loves me. But all Iâ€™ve been doing for the past two months is think of him constantly while crying on and off. All I have the energy for is going to work and then I head straight home to bed. All I want to do is sleep and never wake up.

Objectively I have a good life and good friends (bless them: their support is the only reason Iâ€™m still alive), but death has been constantly on my mind. I know I really shouldnâ€™t commit suicide (and Iâ€™m terrified of both succeding and failing) because I know what death does to the people it leaves behind (exhibit a: my ex lover... not to mention, I met with his family to console them. What kind of a person would I be if they were to find out I had committed suicide? That I had willlingly taken my life when their son was stolen of his? Though what I wouldnâ€™t fucking give to trade my life for his.) Itâ€™s just hard to see the point of the future: itâ€™s all the same tiresome loop of disappointments.
