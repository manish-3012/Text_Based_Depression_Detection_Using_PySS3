Existential EcstasyDon't you feel ecstasy while looking at you hands and for existing in this one time in this only world  It scares me thinking that its such a short time of existence in this world and there's gonna be no  ME anymore, because I already exist that's why I can't understand it. My biggest fear is death. I don't care about daily hardships or whatever shit, maybe that's why I'm struggling right now haha :DD all i want is to exist in this world for ever. If anyone asks me to choose I would  better stay homeless (sorry maybe I'm too extreme) than die as long as I breathe. But nothing personal, just wanted to share how I feel. Sorry about my English.
