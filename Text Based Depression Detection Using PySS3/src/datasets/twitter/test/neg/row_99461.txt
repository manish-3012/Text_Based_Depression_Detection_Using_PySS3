Growing up sucks when you can't grow upJesus, I don't even know what's happening in my life. I utterly failed my first semester of college because I just got too bored and disinterested to go to class, and then the stress started up a suicidal mentality that took months of therapy to come close to breaking. My second semester I started kind of ok but the same thing happened and just by the grace of god did I manage to pass my core classes, but I'm still sitting on a shitty 1.2 something GPA that and I have two semesters to get that up to a 3.2 for desired major.

For some reason, I assume the depression, I just can't get any motivation at all and all I do is sit around the house, eating and browsing Reddit and playing games and wasting my life. Every so often my mom decides the best thing to do is yell at me for a bit, not full screaming but enough that it hurts and I just want it to stop. All she does is make me feel like a disappointment and like it's my fault I'm like this.

Part of me really wants to graduate and have a good life and finally get things together but I just don't know how and nobody I've asked has been a good support network, they just tell me what to do and expect me to be able to do it on my own. The other part of me just wants this all to end, wants things to just be easy like they were when I was a kid, and all I had to do was go to class and I could naturally get good grades and then come home and play.

After finally getting a job, I get no hours and my mother berates me for not knowing to go get a second job, even though this is completely new to me and I've only had the first job for barely 2 weeks. And then she gives me all the old, "walk in and see the manager" bullshit which doesn't work and yells at me when I apply online and then wait like you're supposed to.

Why me? Was I really that bad of a person? Did I hurt too many people? Do I deserve to always think about high places as ways out, and trees and support beams as weight holders?
