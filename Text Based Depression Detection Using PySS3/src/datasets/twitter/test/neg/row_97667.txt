Thoughts and QuestionsHey guys serious question here

For the people that are suicidal and saying they have tried did you go in with the intention of killing yourself or did you need an outlet or were you looking for attention? I ask because I have been contemplating it for a long time and there is just no easy way. I mean there's a 99% chance if you do any sort of pills you will survive and either go through some immense pain or hurt yourself permanently but still be alive. Same with pretty much any other thing. The only thing that I can think of that will result in a 100% death is if you jump off somewhere that is extremely high or the exit bag. The biggest fear I have would be surviving and having to live the rest of my life with serious mental or physical pain and problems. 
I mean I want to end it so bad but I'm always left with a hesitation like I'm sure many people here have. Yes I've heard the ppl that survive the suicide always have that last second regret but I think it's just your body isn't suppose to die and it's a subconscious survival tactic. I feel I could probably jump off a cliff if I get a running start and just do it. Or if I drown myself while tying a weight on me or something. I dunno thinking and writing out loud because I don't where else to go. Nor do I want someone to make a bigger effort than they have to hearing what I have to say and going to drastic measures. Looking at and talking to me I don't think I'd be your stereotypical suicidal person, tbh I'm not even sure if I'm suicidal but I want it to end and it sounds so relaxing. I mean looking at me I'm in great shape, have decent looks from what I've been told lots of confidence. I have friends and family that support me and I can talk to. Maybe I'm just a big pussy because most ppl here have it way worse than me.I'm decent at getting girls and conversing with people but I am so sick of the pain the last few years. I've had depression for atleast a cpl years and never really noticed it until my gf broke up with me thinking I was depressed and there was nothing she could do to help me anymore. Well it all kind of sunk in, from there then on top of the previous depression I lost the love of my life making my depression worse. I have bad anxiety where I have no fucking clue what I want to do with my future, so much that it was all I thought about and I'm still nowhere better. I'm now lucky enough that my ex is 90% of my thoughts now tho. (sarcasm) I now can't get over what I want to do with my life and I've also lost the love of my life and have no money. It's not like I'm young either I'm 30 years old and completely lost. Sure I put pressure on myself but I want to be successful and proud of myself and my life. If I can't do that I'd rather be dead. I'm doing counseling (it's been about 4 months), I've been doing yoga for about the same. I eat healthy, go to the gym and try and be productive but nothing helps. Absolutely nothing and in fact I feel worse now than I did 4 months ago. I'm so sick of all this but ending it is next to impossible. I've done all the research and nothing really works and if I do it there will be a 100% chance I'm gone because I'm not risking the side effect. Anyway that was long and I guess these are my questions and thoughts.
