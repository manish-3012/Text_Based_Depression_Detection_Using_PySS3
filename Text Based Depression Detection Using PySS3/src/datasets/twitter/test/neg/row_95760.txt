I have wanted to kill myself since I was 14And now I am 24 and all I think about is killing myself. It's like a comfort at this point.

that even if things are terrible and even if i'm terrible, at least i'll have the comfort of dying.

I feel so utterly alone. I am alone and I've isolated myself to the point of loneliness. I am also too fucking mental and socially awkward for anyone to be friends with me.

Even if i do become friends with people, I am a people pleaser. All i want is the other person to be happy.

I am not happy, I want to die. I always want to die. I want to die when I wake up, I want to die when I sleep, I want to die when I work.

I want to die.
