I don't know if I'm at risk, or if this is just a hormonal thing.I was redirected here after posting in /r/AskWomen. To begin, I am 16 and I have been on Zoloft since Nov 2014 and had two suicide "expressions" (I would not call them attempts because they were not attempts, they were more like heightened thoughts that scared the hell out of me and put me in the hospital.) I have been depressed for maybe two years and have what you might call just passing suicide thoughts? I mean, I think about it like I would think about the taste of a food or the appearance of a flower. Just little tidbits of thoughts. These occur I would say 2 times a week on average. But I noticed they get to be almost daily/5 times a week during the few days leading up to my period, and for pretty much the duration of it. I can't say how long for sure because the thoughts AND my period just started. They scare me, and I'm afraid to say something to my mom because she might freak out and cry which stresses me out. And to top it all off last night I had a vivid dream that I was going to shoot myself in the head. I didn't do it, because in the dream I realized I have things I want to do in life and dying would take away those things. I feel the same way in real life. I'm just scared of these thoughts and I don't want to go to the hospital again.

I don't see my psychiatrist until later this month and I don't see a therapist at all. How do I go about explaining all of this so these thoughts can be stopped?
