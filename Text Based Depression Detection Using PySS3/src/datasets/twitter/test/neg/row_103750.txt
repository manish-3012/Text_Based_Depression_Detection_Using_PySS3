So many people are killing themselvesIm just waiting for my grandmother to pass and I already know how im going to go.  I see so many posts of people who are used up and done. The world will be a better place without us. Literally the genetic washout, maybe if we all die and cv kills a good chunk of the population the human race can last a little longer until the climate turns us into another extinct species.
