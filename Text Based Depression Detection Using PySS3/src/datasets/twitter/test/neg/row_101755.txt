I need helpI need to get this off my chest. I'm so tired of this daily routine of just moving along with everything. I'm so worn out mentally. I think about suicide almost every day and until recently it's stayed at just thoughts. Recently though i've become just so empty. I feel like an empty husk. I cant tell if I just stopped caring what other people think or if I've grown numb. I have always been anxious but lately i'm over thinking everything. I have nobody that I feel I can really trust, and the place I live is just making it worse each day. I've started drinking more daily and I find that I just dont care when i do it. I dont care about me, or what I do. 

Counseling is tricky because its hard to find something that works around my work schedule and frankly I dont know if it would help. Therapists often come off as just wanting another paycheck. 


I just read everything I wrote, and it looks like jumbled ramblings.
