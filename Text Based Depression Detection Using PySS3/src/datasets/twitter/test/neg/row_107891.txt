Ready to end itMy fiance and I are both transgender (I'm ftm she is mtf ). Neither of us will ever be able to afford to transition. My whole purpose for existing was to serve my family, and because I came out as trans they won't have anything to do with me. My fiance has major depression. I do too, but mine responds to medication and hers doesnt. I feel so guilty for that. Nothing I can ever do will make up for the fact that I'm a tranny.  I failed as a woman and as a human being. I just want this to be over.
