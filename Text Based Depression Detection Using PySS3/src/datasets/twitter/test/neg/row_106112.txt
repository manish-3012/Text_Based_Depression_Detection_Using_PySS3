I need something to live forHi, I have been thinking about suicide since my girlfriend broke up with me. I can't find a meaning with life anymore. I can't concentrate in school anymore. The only thing going through my head is her. My friends keeps asking me if I am fine, and I say yea. I don't want them to be worried about me. 

Before I found this girl, I was very sad every day. I became happy at the time I met her. She is so beautiful and sweet. Now I am deeper down than ever before.

Sorry for my english. I am from Denmark
