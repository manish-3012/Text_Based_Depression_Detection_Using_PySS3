I think I am going to kill myself tomorrow.Tomorrow the winter break will be over and everyone in my house will go back to school/work, so I will be home alone for 7 hours (I dont go to school anymore). During that time frame I could kill myself. I know how to do it. I have everything I need to exit this life.

I will write a note detailing what to do in the event of me "surviving" and entering a coma (you can guess what I would want them to do). I have a journal in which I will write my final words and thoughts. I will leave a message in that journal for everyone I love and care about, and my parents. I have a lot of writing to do between now and tomorrow because I want this to be done well, I really care about these people. I will also probably make one last post on this subreddit, thanking everyone who tried to help me. 

I am still hesitant though, my mood swings so much I dont know what is real. It's difficult because I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mood disorder so I dont think I am getting the proper support. What I do know is, I hate who I am and I know that I will never be the person I want to be. I am so unhappy and anxious. Sometimes I'm euphoric but those moments are short and fake. Everything I do reminds me how much I hate myself, even seeing my hands or hearing my voice. Sometimes I like the way my voice sounds, and sometimes I also find myself very attractive and I feel happy during those times, but I know those feelings are unrealistic. I see myself die everytime I close my eyes.

I would appreciate anything at this point. I dont feel comfortable talking about this kind of stuff with people that I know in real life. I'm sorry for rambling a bit near the end; I am still putting the peices together in my head and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.
