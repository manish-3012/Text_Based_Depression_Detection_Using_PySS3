I tried to strangle myself last nightI wasn't trying to kms (at least I don't think) I was just using my hand, but I was squeezing really hard and my throat still feels weird today.

Idk why I did it, and this isn't the first time it's happened either. I really want to tell someone and get help but I'm super scared to do so. What should I do? I'm really scared that it's not safe for me to be alone. I self harm and have constant suicidal thoughts. Someone please help...
