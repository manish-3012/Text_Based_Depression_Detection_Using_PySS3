I am more of a burden long term then my death ever would beI can so easily disappear into the shadows. My death would result in me no longer be a fucking burden to everyone. People would only get emotionally effected in about a year and I would make it clear that my death isnâ€™t their fault. I canâ€™t ever get the life I somewhat wanted and Iâ€™m losing everything I cared about. I donâ€™t contribute to society. People barely notice Iâ€™m here and when they do I hurt them. I canâ€™t keep spiraling in a depression and slowing disappearing, that just hurts everyone more.
