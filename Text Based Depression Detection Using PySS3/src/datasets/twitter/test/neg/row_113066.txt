Help me help her...My best friend I've known since we were 4 and in Kindergarten (we're both 15 and sophomores in high school) is deeply depressed and the only reason she doesn't commit suicide is because she texts me all night every night. I don't want to seem like a dick, but that really doesn't help me live my life. But I do know that I love her, as in LOVE love her (I AM a guy, and we are both hetero, so that's not an issue). I can't let anything happen to her. She was starving herself for months when she was actually dangerously close to being underweight to the point it would affect her health, and this was before she even starved herself. She also cut herself for a year, stopped for a month, and cuts herself again. She has also been molested, multiple times, which is the only reason I have never intervened in person, because she was traumatized. I just don't know what to do. I'm one of two people who know all this, and I can't bear to tell because I promised I wouldn't and I know it would be almost as bad as her killing herself if I said anything. I also know if she kills herself, I will definitely kill myself.

Also, I'm new here and I'm not sure how this place operates relative to using "god" as an answer, but I'm atheist so I don't care for that.

EDIT: She just texted me saying she's pretty sure her friend just killed herself and it was her fault. I NEED HELP NOW!
