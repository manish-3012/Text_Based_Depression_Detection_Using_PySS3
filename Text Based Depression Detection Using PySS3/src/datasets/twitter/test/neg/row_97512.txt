Iâ€™m hiding in an empty room on a Christmas Eve get together and nobody has even noticedOf course they wouldnâ€™t. Theyâ€™re happier without me. This just proves I wouldnâ€™t be missed if I did kill myself. Well at least now I know that no one would care or mourn. Theyâ€™ll still carry on. I feel stupid for having thought Iâ€™d be cared about or noticed.
