I just can't anymoreFor the last 3 years, I have been working and putting myself through school. I sacrificed my time, my money, my self respect.... everything. I managed to finally land my dream job, which will start after graduation.... I just have 6 more months to go. I thought I could just try to keep the income coming in by working two jobs, but I couldn't. Now I'm heavily in debt and I can't even pay rent or the remainder of my tuition, and I need the degree in order to start the job. I have tried finding more work, crowdfunding, making my own website, even resorting to porn and the darkweb, and now I know won't make it. I just want to die, I just can't do this any more. No one will loan to me just to get to the hump, and my friends and family can't help, and  I can't believe this is how this ends. I'm sorry I let everyone down yet again. 

I'm so tired of asking for help and no one hearing my prayers or my pleas. 

I just can't do this anymore guys.  I'm at my end.
