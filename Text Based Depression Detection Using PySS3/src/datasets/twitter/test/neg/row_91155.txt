I'm going to kill myselfI have no one I can call a friend. No family I am close to. No ambition or purpose. My girlfriend doesn't love me, and has left. I have nothing. I think about killing myself every day. I'm going to jump in front of a train or buy go out with nitrogen. I'd use a gun but I'm from the UK so cant really get one, or at least I'm not sure.
