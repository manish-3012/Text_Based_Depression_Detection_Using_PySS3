Each hour seems like a stupid amount of time to waitaThings will get better. Whatever. It's now obvious this is is a problem in my head that won't be getting fixed. I have to live this long shitty life one minute at a time. Each day brings a non stop joy ride of chores, pains, problems. Every moment is a "what now". "What now?" What next? It will be something. Going to sleep brings no rest. As soon as you've gone to sleep, you wake up again to face more. Every second is an easily conceptualizable time frame, usually containing a chunk of suffering. But to go through that 3600 times an hour, and that quite a few times a day, and enough days to make a life feel like an eternity, I want to kill myself. Every hour I'm awake I'm here for people in my life. But it's an hour that I'm here supposedly for myself, just existing to be here for others. Giving an hour of my time to supplement an hour of theirs sounds fair. But a whole life, when all I want is to be gone? Can they not just learn to get by without me?
