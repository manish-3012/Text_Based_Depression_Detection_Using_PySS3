ComfortingHere it is again
like a warm blanket pulled over my shoulders 
It presses hard and keeps me still

I knew youâ€™d be back, dear one
Though I moved feigning absence of you 
I could sense you lingering

Behind each door I shut
Posed in the backseat
To swallow swallow down into the depths
Into heavy, comforting deep.
