online video of me shared on facebook harming myself - wont be removed well I've had 40k view of a video of me on social media. I threw myself at a car and others in an attempt to harm or kill myself. Most on there think either I am on something or that I am doing it for a fake accident insurance claim. out of all the comments, only a couple have said it may be mental health, and well no one has realised it is me, but I am sure someone will soon. I have been laughed at called horrible things and everyone seems to think it is funny. I can't even describe how I feel, I don't even know why I am posting. I suppose I want to know why people are so cruel in this world to put a person through the shame and humiliation of putting up a video of someone online when they are at the lowest point in their lives. :( I've tried to get it removed but the social media site won't do it
