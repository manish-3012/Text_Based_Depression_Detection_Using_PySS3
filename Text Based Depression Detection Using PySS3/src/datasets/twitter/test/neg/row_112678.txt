Not depressed, but in a very-very bad situationWell, I've never had an easy life (none of us ever have), but now the situation is an inch away from a disaster. I'm 22, and only now I've matured enough to understand what the heck is going on. And the situation screams red alert. My whole life I've been oppressed by my family who treated me not like a depressed teenager (back in the day when I was 12-15), but rather a vile and sleazy liar and evil-doer. Looking back, I still don't understand such an attitude. I was a goddamn child, why was there such an intimacy? Right now I'm sitting on a bench typing this out with my old iphone4, I'm afraid Safari will crash, so I'll submit the post now and update it further just in a minute, sorry for such an inconvenience.
With that treatment I couldn't study and do things very well. There was always a chance I can get in big trouble because of some little thing which I didn't to because I was too depressed and anxious to think about it. My head was always in those clouds of depressed state, only now I'm able to think straight. So here were my teenage years, sometimes I effed up really bad and was punished for it. I finished high school and was looking to study in a university. I didn't plan too much, I didn't know what I was good for and let my folks choose it for me. It's only now that I understand I should've started English courses (I'm russian, by the way, so forgive my possible lack of needed English) or programming. Not journalism. I'm not good for it. So I didn't attend summer internship or whatever it is called (when you work for some real newspaper or journal) and it was mandatory. Right now the university wants full report of it and I can't hand them one 'cause of obvious reasons. I stopped going there a week ago. My parents pay for that course and I've been living with my abusive older sister (we both own the place we live in), her PoS husband and their kid. 
I know I shouldn't talk like that, but a month ago her husband attacked me physically, sister kicked him out but then let him back in, I don't contact him anymore despite living under the same roof (he's gone for two month now working, thankfully). And it has always been that way that I live with someone despising me. I want out. I thought A LOT about running away, but where? Don't have money for that. Even if I found where to work right now, I'd have to live in the streets anyway. It's going to be a disaster when my family finds out I'm on the verge of being expelled. So, with that suicide seems like an only option available. I don't even want to live in hell that my life will inevitably become. I don't want to die, I definitely don't, but it seems like the only way out. Unless magic happens and I'm transferred to some other city or country with a place to stay. The end.
