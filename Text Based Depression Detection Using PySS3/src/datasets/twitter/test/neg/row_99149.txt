I'm 30 years old and I want to kill myselfThe worst year of my life. I lost my job and flat due to having 700 pounds stolen. Lived most of this year at my mumâ€™s. Grand dad and step dad died within 6 weeks of each other. I have accepted my aspagerâ€™s syndrome, something ppl have said Iâ€™ve had all my life. I have been suffering my violent triggers for most of this year. Iâ€™ve lost friends and people donâ€™t want to know me anymore. My ex is pregnant with her new partner. Itâ€™s like the world is erasing me. Iâ€™m thinking about drinking myself to death.
