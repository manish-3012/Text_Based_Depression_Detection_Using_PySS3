So hereâ€™s a â€œsuicide watchâ€ room. Is there any room for â€œwatch a suicideâ€?I was depressed and i belive ive been good now. And the thing is, with my sanity, i now can decide why death has been the wisest decision i can take within this life

May i find any room for ideas on a responsible suicide act?
