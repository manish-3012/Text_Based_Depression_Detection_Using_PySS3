I feel so alone and scaredI don't know what to say or where to start other than I feel absolutely terrified and so utterly alone. I tried to tell the closest person to me how I was feeling and they thought I was just manipulating them. I'm so sad and alone and I only have that one person.  I don't know what to do, it's excruciating to know my pain isn't beleived
