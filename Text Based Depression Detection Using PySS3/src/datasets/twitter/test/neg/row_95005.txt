It's amazing how awful suicide deterrents areI called the suicide hotline, and the girl helping was just awful. Not on purpose, but she reminded me of how few friends I had, how much I dislike this world, and helped reinforce my belief that I don't belong on this world... I know they are not supposed to be therapists, but she increased my desire to kill myself. Then I come here and try to seek help in the way that I  would like, but I read the side bar and realize the way I would like help is against the /SW rules...... awesome. Fuck it i'm drinking myself to sleep.
