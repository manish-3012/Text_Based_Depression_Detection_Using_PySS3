Feelings/ rantsEverything is corrupted, and shattered. I hate it so much, I've never been actually happy. Whenever I do feel actual euphoria and happiness for some time, It ends and I get worse. I'm not trying to be some edgelord dipshit, I can't express this to anyone irl because they'd think that I'm 'going through a phase' or 'doing it for attention' (I'm a minor btw). 

I hate when people try to make suicide/ being depressed as an 'aesthetic'. It's not a motherfucking aesthetic (I'm not talking about this sub in particular).
