why cant i just die?Let me start things off with this, i've had suicidal thoughts for almost a year now but it only got severe these past 3 months. I can not enjoy anything i used to enjoy before, i tried everything to give my useless and plain life an excitement factor to it, but as always and as the fuck-up i am, i would fail. I feel like everyone i know hates me even tho they probably dont, but they should, i am an asshole that deserves to be hated by everyone. All what i do is watch anime in bed, wishing i would die when asleep. I just feel so alone in the world, and it hurts. Even that one friend which i always cared about, doesnt even like me anymore, i would always call and message her, it would be brief conversation that'd end quickly. I feel like nobody understands me and that everyone is stupid and that life is utterly pointless and meaningless and if it werent for my fear of the unknown i would've already killed myself, which i currently am considering, all what i want is to live normally but i just can't, i will always be an asshole who is hated by everyone.
