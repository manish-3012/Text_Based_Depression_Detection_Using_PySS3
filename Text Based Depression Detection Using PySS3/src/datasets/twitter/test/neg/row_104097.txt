Revisiting the thought, not necessarily by choiceI'm not sad. I'm comfortable being alone now after all these years and the thought of living alone forever no longer depresses me as it used to. I can still smile and laugh. I really have nothing to be upset or depressed by at all, to be honest. I'm probably happier now than I've been in some time. 

Mentally, I'm sound. And maybe that's why I'm revisiting this escape. My conscience knows it's wrong, but the rational side of me knows it's probably the only option left on the table. 

I can no longer afford to survive. Simple as that. I've lost my job and can't seem to find another. I'm exhausted in trying. Health insurance is gone, which means now I get to feel every single pang my withered body endures. I can't medicate to keep the migraines away. I can't continue the physical therapy that allows me to do the things I enjoy doing. No more playing video games or guitar. The things that keep me happy. And even if I didn't have to sell them in order to eat this week, I still wouldn't be able to physically pick them up and get lost in another reality for a while because the pain in my hands is unbearable. I find little joy in anything else that doesn't require physical exertion. Hell, even my TV is gonna have to be sold soon. Won't be able watch that to pass the time, even if I could afford another month of electricity. And when I inevitably lose my car and my home, what then? If I couldn't get a job now, surely it'll be impossible to get one without those things. I don't know how I'll even eat. So maybe that will be what will kills me. The thought of starving to death frightens me though. Seems very painful. 

I just can't wait another month for the state to make their decision on my unemployment/disability benefits. Besides, someone else is probably more deserving. Someone who has a family. I'd rather they get help than myself who means nothing to nobody. 

So when everything is gone, and I find myself unshaven, dehydrated and starving while roasting on the hot summer street... I'll look back and wonder what this life was all about anyway. To die? I'll have slaved away all those years for someone else's benefit, never having anything to show for it for myself. Surviving all this time while never figuring out what the hell it was I was surviving for. Well I'm done surviving. Not so much emotionally, but literally. Done surviving. Like a stray cat thats too old and ugly to be taken in and cared for. Too weak to hop into a dumpster or chase the mouse for its next meal. What a waste of life. Born into poverty, and will die as such. Should have never been conceived to begin with. What a joke it all was. And yet there are people in this world who are in worse positions. Respect to those folks who don't take the matter into their own hands. For me it'll be easy. The choice was made for me.
