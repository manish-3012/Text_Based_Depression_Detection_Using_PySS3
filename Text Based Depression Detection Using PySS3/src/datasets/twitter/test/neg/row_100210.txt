Looking for some help for my friendI have a friend (26m) who has been unhappy ever since his gf broke up with him nearly two years ago.  He seems to think he needs a gf to be happy and I've been trying to get him to see that his happiness is up to him and no one else.

He's been disturbingly depressed lately, even more so than usual and has said he wants to kill himself.  I was talking with him today while he was implying that he was going to hurt himself tonight, but I talked him out of it and am trying to get him to go to his family, a hospital, a mental institution, anything!  Just get help.

I had no idea where he was today.  He was out driving somewhere.  If this happens again what should I do?  I don't know the numbers of anyone in his family, he isn't friends with them on Facebook and I only know his approximate address, I just drive there by memory and it's out in the middle of nowhere.  How well can 911 help me if a situation like this occurs again?
