Better dayssLiving it up, decided I'm finally calling it quits. Just want to enjoy another 48 hours or so of hedonism with my boyfriend. But I'm not really happy and that's the problem isn't it. At least I've already pulled this stunt before on everyone in my life so I don't need to send no sad texts no more. Everything I've needed to say, I have. Think I'll miss them all, but I suppose the grim reality is that I simply won't be around anymore to miss them.

Someone tell me a joke. Or give me your favorite episode of your favorite show for me to watch. We're on a tight timeframe so if u gonna suggest a movie please recommend a good one :) Or just tell me what you been up to and what's going on with you. I don't have many friends, would be nice to just... Talk.
