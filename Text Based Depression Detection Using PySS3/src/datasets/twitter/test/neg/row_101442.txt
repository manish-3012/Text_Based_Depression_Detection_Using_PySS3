I Have No FriendsI have no friends. It's my senior year in high school and I have no friends. I have people I talk to in class, but we would never hang out in real life. I have people that know me, but we aren't close. We don't make plans or talk on a regular basis. My real friends are all gone. One drifted away, the other moved, one pushed me away and the other lives on the other side of the planet. My girlfriend is my "friend" but we cant hang out all the time. People say I'm funny. I'm in great shape. I dress nice. I can play all types of different instruments and I'm good at video games. The only thing I can pin it down to is that I am just a miserable person to be around. When I go off to college, I will have no friends. I will go to class and I will write papers and study, but I will have no friends. I will sit quietly in my room and than eventually, I will kill myself. And that will be the end of my life.
