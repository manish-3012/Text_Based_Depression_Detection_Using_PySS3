I don't know when I stopped dreamingI can't think back and find a spot in my life that I just stopped dreaming about the future. I don't remember if I ever did to begin with. I have no direction in my life I don't remember if I ever knew what I want to be when I was a kid. When everyone else was saying "I'm going to be a fireman!" I don't remember if I wanted to be anything. My whole life I've just drifted through till now, and as I look back I have done nothing with it thus far. Sure I have my whole life ahead of me but looking back on nearly 20 years with no achievements is depressing to say the least. While I sit here writing this with no achievements, no friends, and a NEET (Not Employed, in Education, or Training) life I watch as everyone around me has jobs, is going to university or college and I'm here stuck in my room, a NEET. I want to break the cycle and become a better person but I don't want to put myself out there because of my lack of social skills and excessive blushing. I know that things only get better with experience but I just can't do it. Even though I know what to do, I don't know what to do. Life is meaningless. We live just to die, and then we don't exist at all (unless you believe in an afterlife of some sort). Any happiness is fleeting and any purpose is useless in the long run. I don't know. I just needed to get this off my chest. If anyone has any advice or how they got out of their ruts please share. Seeing someone for this and/or getting medication is out of the equation.  I don't really want to die, but I don't want to live either. The mystery of what happens after death scares me so I keep living. But I don't want to live because they is no purpose to it. Thank you for reading this badly formated rant I guess. 

Also this is an alt account and I most likely won't reply unless asked a direct question.
