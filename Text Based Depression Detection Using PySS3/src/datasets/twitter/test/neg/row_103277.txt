I am reaching a point of no returnA few years ago I was driving home from work and I have been going through a rough time with losing family and no fulfillment in life. As I was driving I took my hi point 9 and put it to my head. I say there driving a few miles and thought to myself. "What reasons do I have to live?" The only thing I thought of was my younger brother. Today I am having those thoughts again and I feel that if I put that gun to my head again. I won't be able to ask myself that same question... All I am thinking about now is finishing work and going home and grabbing my gun...
