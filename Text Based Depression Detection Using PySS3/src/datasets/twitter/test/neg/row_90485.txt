Is this the opening I needed?Failed my EMT exam today, a test so simple an ignoramus who didn't finish high school is designed to pass it, moreover it's in the examiner's best interest to pass as many people as possible. And I thought I got into a decent college because of my intelligence, lawl. So I come home and try to play some TF2 to unwind, suddenly my desktop goes apeshit for no reason and won't poweron. This is adesktop that I spent probably about 1200 on and 20 hours assembling from scratch. I need to leave it at home before I go back to college tomorrow.

So I never got to unwind and ended up taking it out on my parents. I kept trying to leave the house to drive back as soon as I got home but they wouldn't let me, understandably how angry I was. I think I'm too autistic, that's the problem. rubbing my junk while I write this, cause hey, I don't know social customs and I have no self control. I just don't understand people, I just do things, like a robot. A friendless, unhappy, virgin robot. I wish I could completely stop caring.

And there's a whole host of other problems that I can't be fucked to mention, but are not affecting me at the present since i'm a nearsighted douchefag that can't manage any long term planning. SO much so that I purposely got myself kicked out of school on a medical leave so I could spend an extra semester in school, away from the scary real world. I don't give a fuck, my parents are completely paying for everything.

If I wasn't so passive-aggressive and could obtain a gun, I'd turn it on myself in an instant, no question. Until then, I'll just suffer and watch my life, which had so much potential, crumble.
