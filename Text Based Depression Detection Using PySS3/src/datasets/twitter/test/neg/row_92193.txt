My Story and why I want to kill myselfWhen I was 12 years old, I was bullied a lot by many classmates. They made fun of me. They called me fat, gay, ugly and stupid. I had few friends. But, They were good friends and they still are. When I was 13-15 years old, I got new and more friends. But, Also more people that bullied me. People talking about me behind my back. In the last 7 years, I been bullied a lot by people around my age and cyberbullied. Now, I'm 22 years old and I'm suffering even today. Today, I was cyberbullied by someone. The worst is that I feel ignored by so many people. I don't know what I should do. All of my friends work many hours almost every day. I got much support from them in the last 10 years. But, They can't help me if They're working. I feel so much pain and suffering now. I want to end it now. I tried early today. But, I was too weak to do it. I tried kill myself with a very sharp and big knife. But, I couldn't do it. I cried instead.
