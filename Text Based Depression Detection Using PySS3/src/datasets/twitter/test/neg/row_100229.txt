I'm ready to head off in my car and just drive offI can't keep dealing with this shit anymore.

I have a full tank of premium fuel, with enough cash on hand to fill up a few more along the way. Car has been serviced and I've just put new tires on. I'm ready to hop in and drive until I give up or have had enough to turn back.
