.Someday i will snap. Me and my crush (hopefully) would do it. I really hated the society, i just want to fit in. All I've ever wanted, is to be loved. I just want to experience it. But i know i can't. I had no chance of having someone to love me. It's because of me. I am a fucking ugly little piece of shit. I hated myself. Thanks "god".
