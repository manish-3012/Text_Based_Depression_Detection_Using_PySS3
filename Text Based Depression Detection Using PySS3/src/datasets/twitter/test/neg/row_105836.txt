Iâ€™m the shit you scrape or your shoeI get smashed at 10:00 am.... because 7am is too early. But I canâ€™t wait until noon, and Iâ€™ve got half a bottle of vodka hidden under my sheets. 

I COULD go for a walk. See my family members. Do my taxes. Clean my room. 

But all of that is a reality check. 

A REALITY CHECK... should be a good thing, but to me... itâ€™s hell on earth and I just donâ€™t wanna be there but I have to be there cause everyone says I have to be there and apparently my family would die if I wasnâ€™t there even though they donâ€™t really seem to care if Iâ€™m there and I have to be there according to articles and gurus on YouTube cause life is a gift but wtf kinda gift? You mean like a $10 gift card for iTunes or fucking socks? What Iâ€™m saying is if itâ€™s a gift it fucking sucks. And why so people say suicide is selfish? WTF?! Oh yeah, cause itâ€™s not selfish to make someone live a painful, miserable life that they decided isnâ€™t worth it because itâ€™ll hurt you?!?!? Bitch, suicide goes against our natural survival instincts. If they kill themselves.... think about how the FUCK THEY FEEL!!! 

Jibberish but posting anyway cause Iâ€™m drunk and donâ€™t care if I die ðŸ˜Š
