extreme heartache after break upThe love of my life just broke up with me last week. Coming to terms with this new reality is damn-near impossible. It's killing me. I've just been drifting through this past week with my sanity dangling by a thread. I want to kill myself. I have no one to confess/tell this to. No friends. I don't care what happens to me. It's the first time in a long time that I've fallen back down into my suicidal tendencies/behavior and actually not being *too* scared to do it.


&amp;nbsp;

Bottom line is: I don't really know why I'm writing this, or where my head is right now. All I know is that I don't want to be alive anymore.  When I go drinking away my sorrows tomorrow night, I don't care what happens to me. Idc if I end up missing, dead, dismembered, ect. Whatever. Fuck it.
