I guess I needed somewhere to go.Hi, I've never posted here before. But I guess I've never been as bad or as close to the edge as I feel right now and it's shitty and I hate myself and pretty much everyone around me. And I just feel so broken because this year has been a God damn nightmare. I've spent the better parts of six months experiencing sexual harassment from a co-worker from a place of previous employment. My significant other, who I thought was my soul mate, left me due to the people who sexually harassed me telling him I was having an affair, going so far as to doctor text messages and Facebook messages, even though I was faithful. For a month I have pushed through because I was graduating college and I thought things would pick up and I'd be happy. Even though I've cried myself to sleep for a month. This week I have done nothing but lay on my couch and cry while watching Netflix. I haven't eaten, or showered, or even brushed my teeth all that often. I should be packing things up to move into a new apartment and I can't even find the energy to move from my couch. I'm just... I'm so tired. I just want to eternally sleep and never wake up. I feel like I've lost so much. Friends who were originally supposed to be on my side, someone who was supposed to love me and would rather believe a rumor, family members who won't talk to me. I'm just ready to never wake up again. A part of me hopes that ghosts exist so I can come back and see how things are when they realize that they're all terrible fucking people to hurt someone so much that they're ready to stand in the middle of the highway. I just wish I had somewhere to turn without someone telling me I'm being over dramatic or stupid or anything else that means that they aren't listening. I guess that's why I'm here after all. Just to get out some thoughts.
