One WeekTitle says it all - if I can muster the strength (physical, mental won't be a problem,) I might be dead in one week's time.

I'm done with this. The pain, stress, anxiety, and nihilism is too great to bear. I've wanted to kill myself for years, but only now do I have a realized opportunity.

Until then, I'll continue suffering, silently, and make sure nobody catches on. My note will be brief, darkly humorous, confusing, and most of all completely apathetic.

If anyone is willing to talk or try and convince me otherwise, feel free. Until then, I have mountains of school work to attend to. I must continue this ruse to the end!

EDIT: I'm not getting anywhere - this is pointless. I'm going to kill myself in 3.5 days, and nothing will stop me.
