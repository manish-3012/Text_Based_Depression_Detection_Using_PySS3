Would rather be dead than stuck in poverty foreverI was born poor and had a shitty childhood because of it, and things have never gotten better. It makes me so mad to hear people talk abotu how poor people should have kids because they â€œdonâ€™t need muchâ€ or â€œlove is all they need.â€ Yeah, love will fix their fucking rotting teeth when you canâ€™t afford to take them to the dentist, or prevent them from dying when they have a 105 fever and you canâ€™t afford emergency room bills. 

I was always hungry as a kid, tormented by other kids for the weird clothes I wore, got to see a dentist all of two times during my entire childhood, and had agonizing pain from having to wear shoes that were several sizes too small. I still donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to go on a real vacation. Everyone said that I was smart and could work hard to get out of poverty, but it was a fucking lie. 

Now Iâ€™m an adult and struggling to pay my bills while working on a premed science degree, but it seems like Iâ€™m always going to class hungry, one disaster away from homelessness, and no matter how hard I work, itâ€™s never fucking enough. Everything takes me 5x as long as it would take someone else to do something. I donâ€™t have a  computer and printer, so if I have a paper or assignment that requires more than a phone, I have to do it at school around the computer roomâ€™s limited hours. I have to take buses everywhere, do laundry at a laundromat far away from my apartment, wait in endless lines at free health clinics and food pantries. I can barely afford to keep my lights and gas on. 

I canâ€™t get food stamps in my state because full time students donâ€™t qualify, have no family that can help out, canâ€™t find a cheaper place to live in my overpriced shitty town, and commuting from a cheaper nearby town isnâ€™t an option due to lack of transportation. The waitlist for campus jobs and housing is so long, Iâ€™ll probably graduate long before seeing the end of it. I am at the end of what I can handle and my university has done fuck all to help me, short of referring me to worthless counselors who look at me with sad eyes and give me the same canned bullshit about how it â€œmust be so hardâ€ to feel stuck. 

I sell things on Ebay to pay rent and have had the worst month. Normally I sell dozens of things a month and itâ€™s enough to scrape by alongside my loans. Out of hundreds of listings and hours of work, I sold just 8 items this month and Iâ€™ll have to refund one person $20, which is nothing to so many people but made me cry for hours this morning because Iâ€™m so broke. 

Even if I graduate, Iâ€™ll probably never make it to medical school. No matter how hard I work, thereâ€™s always some rich bitch whose parents have groomed her to become a doctor since childhood and are footing the bills for MCAT study prep and private tutors. Those people will get the seat in medical school in the end. 

Poor people are fucked from birth. There is literally no way out of this if youâ€™re born into it. I decided a long time ago that Iâ€™m never having kids. Iâ€™m so sick of hearing upper class politicians who never had to struggle for basic needs talk about clawing yourself out of poverty. Iâ€™m having a hard time seeing a way out of this hell other than ending my life.
