Everyday on my way home from work Iâ€™m met with a fork in the road. Everyday Iâ€™m tempted to hit the divider full speed.When approaching it youâ€™re supposed to slow down to a 35. Today I swerved through it at 65 . Itâ€™s this game I play with myself. How much faster can I just nearly miss it. Iâ€™m just so tired of my job and so tired of my home life . Iâ€™m just so tired .
