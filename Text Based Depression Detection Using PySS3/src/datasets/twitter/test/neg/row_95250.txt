I haven't wanted to cut in such a long time....So yeah, basically, as the title says, I really feel the ***need*** to cut. It's been... Christ I don't even know... 5 ish years maybe? Since I last cut. I solely cut my thighs as I, ironically, don't want people to know that I'm generally fucked in the head. I know the bullshit about life not being so bad. I know that it's not worth doing. I fucking know it, ok? I fucking know. The only thing that has prevented me from doing it in the past 5 years is my 6yo daughter. I don't want her growing up and seeing this shit. As it stands I have 30+ visible scars on my thighs, but, mercifully, most can now only be seen if you know they're there. I'm a 27 yo male working a shitty minimum wage job as a bar tender with a track record of stupid manipulative relationships where I give all and receive nothing of value. I genuinely don't have anywhere else to turn so fuck you auto-mod for saying I don't comply with some bullshit rule that I didn't fucking read because I actually, right this very second, couldn't give a flying fuck about obscure rules that reddit gets a hard-on about. 

Sorry. I may not be technically suicidal but the only time i feel any kind of peace is when I cut. 5 years man.... 5 years .... FMAL
