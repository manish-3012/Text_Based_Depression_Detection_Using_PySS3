Help pleaseFirst time poster on a throwaway. Iâ€™m extremely depressed and suicidal. However, I am to scared to actually do it. Is there any way to get over it? I hate having the suicidal ideations but not being able to go through with it. Going on 2 years with no relief, just ready for it to end. Not looking for comments saying â€œnot to do it.â€ I just want help ending this pain.
