I just can't do thisI'm a recent graduate. 25. Single. Virgin. Barely any friends. Severe social anxiety. I feel like I just can't do life. I can't handle other people.

I was fine a couple of days ago but soon I have to start working (a job that I will probably hate: I just can't figure out what I'd like to do in life). I started to think about the rest of my life. The past few months I had loads of free time, I just sat at home, feeling comfortable. No pressure. No responsibilities. Noone judging you. I won't amount to nothing but noone will know. I barely got out of my house anyway. But now that I will have to go to work all day every day the responsibilities and expectations are slowly creeping up to me. I just can't handle them. I feel overwhelmed. I live at home at the age of 25. Twenty-five. Everyone probably thinks I'm a loser if I don't move out soon, but I don't feel like I'm ready for that. I just want to go back to like high school; you barely had any responsibilities. Why do I want to work from 8am till 10pm for like 50 years in some job I don't like? What's the point? 

I feel like I'm wired to lead a life in solitude, but at the same time I crave normal social interactions. I want to have friends. I want to have a wife and kids. If only I'd be able to feel comfortable around others... If only I wouldn't be so socially awkward and know what to say once in a while... 

It would be easy to just end it right here and right now, wouldn't it? Sorry for this rant. You probably don't care anyways.
