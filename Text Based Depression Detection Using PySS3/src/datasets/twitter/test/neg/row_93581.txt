Absolutely hopeless and may have just lost the one person who keeps me goingHi, I'd like to start off by saying that I'm 20 years old and male. I'm by no means a good looker, and I have been struggling with depression for years now. I developed a crush on this girl a while back and it's only gotten bigger. Whenever life pushes me to the ground and starts kicking me in the privates, I just think of her and I can get through no problem. Today, she came over to hang with me and I made my move on her. I went for a kiss, and then she blocked me and excused herself. I feel like I may have just lost her forever, and that hurts so much more than anything else has hurt me. I stopped crying when I was 13 years old, and I am pretty damn close to right now. I don't think a shitty guy like me can find someone like her again... I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. Right now i'm hopeless, can anyone offer any advice or any words of encouragement to keep me going even just another few days? I'm at my wit's end right now, like I feel so empty and I'm tired of bouncing back. I'm just so tired of having to get back up to let life shove me down again, this isn't a superhero show where the main character just has to keep standing up again and everything will be ok. It sucks, I don't want to try anymore. There's no point.  


P.S. Sorry if it's all over the place. I have a concussion and everything is going all over the place. I'm just so lost.
