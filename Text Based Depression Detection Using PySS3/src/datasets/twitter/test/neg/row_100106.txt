Add an interesting titlei'm so tired and i can't do shit and i'm so fucking tired. it's like every time i meet the slightest problem or feel a little bit of stress there is a voice appearing in my head that says "just kill yourself already" and i know that's not me, that's just some mental disorder but it's still tiring. (not the real voice tho. i have problems but i'm not hallucinating yet.)
i mean, everything is more or less fine with my life. my relatives are still alive and i have some wonderful friends and girlfriend and that is already a lot. but it just doesn't help 
i know i should go see a doctor and try some medication and therapy and all that, but all i can do is lie on my couch and be miserable on reddit and even that i can do only with the most basic english because i no longer can remember any tenses besides simple and continious because i'm slowly falling apart and now i'm hysterical again.
i don't know. i know that i will never have the balls to actually kill myself, but i just don't know what else i can. shit sucks, guys. please, take care of yourselves. try not to fall into this pit, because it's just sad and boring down here and nothing much else
