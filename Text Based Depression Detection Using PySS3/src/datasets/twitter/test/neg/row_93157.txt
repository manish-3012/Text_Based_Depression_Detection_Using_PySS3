Problems between friends struggling with suicidal thoughts(posting on behalf of a friend)

For a while there has been some friction within my group of friends, particularly two members who I'll refer to here as A and B for the sake of semi-anonymity and making this a little easier to write- B is a very close friend to me, practically my older brother, and A is my boyfriend of almost five years now. They're both near and dear to my heart, and for a while I've been trying to mediate between them whenever problems arise, but things have escalated to the point where I no longer am capable of doing so on my own; however, if I leave the situation as it is now I truly fear things will just continue to worsen and I don't want either of them to suffer for it. So, I was hoping I could get some input from an unbiased third party on what exactly can be done here.

To give some background on the main parties involved, B has been a part of our social circle for coming up on a year now- less than all but one other person here, and while none of us think any differently of him because of it I'm sure that the difference in the length of times we've known each other has been exacerbating some of these problems. He joined us on an invitation from A, right on the heels of leaving the latest abusive friend group in a string of them he's been through, and he has the usual terrible cocktail of depression and anxiety on top of that abuse, along with being autistic and recently having come out as trans. A is also somewhere on the spectrum, also trans, and also a survivor of pretty severe abuse, and struggles with anger issues on top of his own depression and anxiety. B has a therapist, has tried getting on medication, and has tried to seek other means of fulfilling his needs; A is attempting to seek therapy and has recently started on medication.

As for the problems we're dealing with, to start with what I find the most pressing matter, B is fairly frequently stressed and very suicidal, and deals with that by seeking reassurance from his friends- he's very much an extrovert, and needs regular interactions with multiple people he's close to in order to recharge, and on top of that due to his anxiety and past abuse he has a hard time remembering that people care about him when he's in the middle of a breakdown, and as such needs to be reassured explicitly that he is still cared about while he's doing badly. A is also frequently stressed and suicidal, along with being on the extreme end of introverted, and deals with those feelings when they come by avoiding further stressful situations- and of course, a friend saying that they want to die is a pretty stressful situation, particularly so as A's abusive ex used to weaponize self-harm and suicide threats against him (and while I fully believe and trust that B has no intentions of being manipulative and is merely expressing his feelings to try and help them rather than keep them bottled up, trauma doesn't necessarily see the difference). While I have not been able to discuss matters with him as much as I have with B, as his home life has been stressful enough that for quite some time now he hasn't had the energy for handling any external negativity or heavy conversation, he's expressed to me that he feels like everything he tries to do to help only winds up making things worse, like he isn't good enough for B and like he's doing everything wrong in his eyes, and so he's begun defaulting to silence rather than forcing himself to deal with situations he doesn't know how to handle and doesn't have the energy to try- which of course unfortunately directly conflicts with B's need for people to talk to him and reassure him while he's breaking down, and leaves B feeling like A doesn't actually care about him.

Compounding this is how recently everyone has been vastly more busy with school and work stuff than they have in the past, and there isn't as much talking going on in our group chats as there used to be as a result- and save for B and one other recent member I don't know as well and can't speak on the habits of, we are a group that is very much used to our communications being exclusively in the public channels. We simply don't contact each other one-on-one on any sort of a regular basis, it's how our friendships work. But B needs more interaction than that, and specifically more directed interaction than that, and the fact that I'm the only one recently who has been taking the time to personally message him and check on him has been taking a great toll on him. I think it's entirely reasonable for B to ask that the rest of the group make an effort to reach out to him rather than him having to contact them first every single time; I don't think it's too much to ask that people accommodate a small change in their interactions to avoid hurting someone they care about, and it seems to me like a single message of caring daily would be fairly simple to integrate with their schedules and would go a long way towards helping B. However, B has also said himself on multiple occasions that recently he has been too worn down to think of anything to talk about besides how bad he's feeling, and in my personal experience and from what I've heard from others when someone messages him he generally wants to talk further, and I don't think it's wrong of people to be worried about initiating a conversation that they believe is going to go to territory that they are uncomfortable with or simply don't have the spoons to handle. Even so, I still don't think it's fair that their solution to that seems to be simply not talking to B at all!

As previously mentioned, A struggles with anger issues- this has led to him snapping at B a handful of times before. In one particularly bad incident recently, A ended up blocking B from most platforms they share and made some posts/spoke to people venting about the situation- posts which B later saw. They reconciled a few days later, but B is still feeling very hurt from the incident and doesn't feel like it's been sufficiently addressed or made up for. In addition, the times B has been snapped at by A and another friend who struggles with similar anger issues have left him feeling hesitant to speak with them, or even talk in group setting where they're around. And this just exacerbates the care issue- and it seems to have led to a vicious cycle where A withdraws because he doesn't feel trusted and that hurts him, B feels like A doesn't care about him and needs more explicit reassurance to keep from being hurt himself, and A feels less trusted and more hurt and the cycle continues.

I thought I would have more time to work through everything relevant to the situation, but as I write this B's moved into being actively suicidal again and the whole reason I'm writing this is because I'm worn enough I don't think I'm able to help him through it for very much longer and I do not want to see him die from my failures so I just have to hope I've provided enough background already to be helpful. Tl;dr- one friend needs frequent reassurance and attention during frequent breakdowns and another friend cares for the first but cannot deal with that kind of stress and they're both hurting each other badly, what do
