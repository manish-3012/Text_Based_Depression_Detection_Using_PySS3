I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I know I basically can't do it because my parents hate the idea of giving up so "easily," but I really don't know how much longer I can do this. At one point, I had a desire to see some good things happen, but now I feel like there is no hope for the things I desperately want to happen to actually happen. I try to make things better, but Im sure my efforts will never come to fruition. I feel so hopeless and so alone. Nobody wants to hear me complain, and all my friendly aquaintances have proved that they don't have the time of day for me at all anymore, and my family has proved the same notion years ago. I'm trying to find motivation, but I'm just so exhausted - more exhausted than ever, and I just feel like I'm falling apart completely. I was forcing myself to keep going and to be somewhat happy, but it feels like nothing is working. My chest just feels so hallow, and my body is shrinking. I can't keep any food in my body for longer than 30 minutes. I feel sick constantly. I feel like the walking dead. Nobody loves me, and it's understandable. I'm more miserable now than Ive ever been in all my years of living. I'm a waste of space at this point, and I just don't know anymore.
