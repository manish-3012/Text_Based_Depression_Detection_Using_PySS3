If things don't improve I'm going to kill myself on New Years DayI can barely handle my personal life and constant anxiety, depression, and anger. The state of the world and the way it keeps getting worse and worse is too much for me to bear and I don't think I can take it, I'm already at my breaking point and there is no end in sight. I don't think I can survive under this constant stress.
