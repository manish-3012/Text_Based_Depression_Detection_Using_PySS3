I'm going to give myself one yearI guess I'll start off by saying that I feel guilty just typing this... I've read through lots of the posts on here and it just makes me feel pathetic, but I guess we all have different tolerance levels.

I first had suicidal thoughts around the age of 13, I was bullied, got into a lot of fights and my parents got divorced; and they've come and gone ever since. 

These past three months have been the worst, though. I'm twenty years old, I've been unemployed for a year and a half, I don't have a single friend, hell, the only person I see on a regular basis is my mother, and that's only because I live with her. On top of that, it's looking like I might have Crohn's disease.

And I don't really see it getting much better, I don't really have any skills so I don't see the job issue being resolved any time soon; I've had four interviews in the past six months or so and I'm applying for hundreds.

On the friend front, well I don't get out much. I used to enjoy my solitude especially back when I was still in high school, but these days I find myself just staring into nothingness wondering whether what comes next will be a relief, wondering whether there is anything else, whether or not I'll get another chance.

The only relief I ever feel is when I'm running, playing video games or reading; and even these have been losing their effectiveness. 

So; I've decided I'm going to give myself one year. I'm going to try. Not really sure how I'm going to proceed, but I am going to try and improve.

I've got to admit, typing that out was rather therapeutic.
