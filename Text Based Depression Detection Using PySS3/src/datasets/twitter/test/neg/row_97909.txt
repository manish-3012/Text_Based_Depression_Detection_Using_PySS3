Idk Iâ€™m planningI already had a failed drug overdose a few months ago, I want this to be effective and stealthy this time. Iâ€™m getting a carbon monoxide cylinder, with me alone in my room and Iâ€™m done. In January most probably, I thought of getting a puppy then. But I donâ€™t want it to suffer with living in a family like mine, so I decided Iâ€™m not gonna adopt any. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be successful this time and no one will find me until Iâ€™m done. I want to donate my organs, so Iâ€™ll fill an application on the New Years. I just wanted to clear my thoughts, since I have no one to talk to , I am here. Have a good day.
