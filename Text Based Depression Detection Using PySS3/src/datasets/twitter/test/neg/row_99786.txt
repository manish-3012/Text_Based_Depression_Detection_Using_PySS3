I'm alone...and dead inside anyway.I've posted here twice before and deleted them because no one cared to even say anything after a few days of leaving them up...I'm back again because before I was just suffering and surviving because I thought I found hope...

I don't have hope, I don't have what I thought would hold me close..my parents are divorced and can't even take a few minutes of their time to say hi to me in the morning or evening's..

My girlfriend of a year and a half  broke up with me...I planned my everything for her, I know what our wedding would be like, I knew our kids names...What our house would be like...I thought she loved me but instead dumped me and only comes around when I'm convenient for her...
Now she's with my best friend and pushed me out of my friend group...

I don't want to BE anymore...I don't want to deal with these stresses that I cry about like a Bitch every night that no one cares  about..I don't want to worry about anything I just want to be gone...I just want to have peace...

I have several plans and I'm not sure why I'm still here...last ditch effort I guess...
