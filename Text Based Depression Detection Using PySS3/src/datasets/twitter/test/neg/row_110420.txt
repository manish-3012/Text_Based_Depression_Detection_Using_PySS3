17 year old with multiple comorbid mental illnesses, seeking euthanasia or hanging myself for good probably after I'm done raising my younger brother.Hi all, I \*thought\* I'd reach out to others here for the "heck" of it. Honestly, I have a history of making abrupt debacles out of racing thoughts that have cost me "some", but here goes once I guess. I hope my age doesn't throw anyone off who aren't trolling.

I'll try to pace my thoughts and keep things simple, simply because I feel uncomfortable elaborating everything too literally or politically correct and am prone to delusional word salads. I prefer an anecdotal approach in words as I have had some successes with finding a few very relatable people who I have strong relationships with. I also value my privacy as for that. 

Anyways, I'm 17 and I've been contemplating suicide for many years now. I will make it clear that I have **NOT** been officially diagnosed primarily because I **CANNOT** afford it. Fortunately to some extent, I however have had multiple second opinions and have been particularly referred to a well-appraised psychiatrist who decided to titrate and prescribe me medications based alone on our sessions. ( antipsychotics, antidepressants, SSRIs, mood stabilizers, ADHD medications, etc ) over a couple of months, and am currently not on medications for months. I have been straight with my psychiatrists and have gained their trust, and have been welcomed to believe I am prognosed with an impending diagnosis of ADHD, OCD, Bipolar 1, GAD, paranoid schizophrenia, DID and BPD. I have also a past case of anorexia, bullimia, and body dysmorphic disorder, severe enough for instance, till I underwent mild plastic surgery as a means to end my completely obsessive-compulsive regiments after losing sleep all night. 

Well, I could keep going all day and night about my vast experiences with these individual disorders, but that's not the point as I've already mentioned I'd expect responses from those who ACTUALLY understand, as opposed to being poked around or possibly guilty tripped over the integrity of trivia/privacy and preferred candid responses. It would also make me feel far more alienated as I know I already am for probably 99&amp;#37;+ of the mental-illness threads out there.

**I am however truly sorry if I appear overly defensive or passive-aggressive**. I'm confounded with the idea that near to nobody would care about or understand me because I'm known to get by a lot by being invisible and empty, I am conflicted but truly am adamant about killing myself ultimately over my existential insignificance. 

Anyways, well I guess I'm just open to hear if anyone can relate anyhow, some advice possibly, or more interestingly, if there's anyone out there too who are relatively high-functioning, somewhat enthusiastic yet nearly or completely suicidal like I am. My mood's like a 0-100, I can cry, laugh, kill, pretty much anytime off the bat. 

Thanks for reading.
