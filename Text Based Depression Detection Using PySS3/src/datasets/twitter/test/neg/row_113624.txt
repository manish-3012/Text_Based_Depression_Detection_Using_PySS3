25 year old friend, with kids, living at home, controlling parents, threatened suicide. Help?(x-post from AskReddit)

I have a friend in a serious, serious pickle, and I have no clue what to do, or how to help.

She's 25 years old; I've known her for 12 years now. She moved out when she was 18 because her parents were obscenely controlling, and moved in with her-then boyfriend. She got involved with drugs, partying, sleeping with randoms, the whole nine yards... there's pretty much no drug she hasn't had in her body. She got pregnant, and tried to raise her kid with her then boyfriend, but he cheated on her, and things fell apart.

Then he took her to court for custody. There was a pile of evidence that was in his favor, but her rich parents then stepped in and got her a rich lawyer. Racked up about $50,000 in legal bills. Her parents were awarded guardianship, and her parents forced her to move back home; otherwise, she wouldn't be allowed to see her kids.

She's been back home for 3 years now, and has been doing well; she has a decent job and is going to school. She doesn't smoke, drink, and hasn't touched a drug in 4 years. Her kids are her life, and she would give up the world for them! But, things have gotten toxic to the extremes! Her parents completely dominate the shit out of her life. They take all of her money and decide where she's spending it, without letting her have a say (taking a large chunk of it for themselves and refusing her access). They decide who she's allowed to hang out with (me being the only), what she's allowed to wear, where she's allowed to be, and even where she's allowed to work. They even restrict her computer access, and have a piece of software installed that severely limits anything she can do. They also use her as their personal errand runner, making her do groceries, deliver stuff for them, pick their friends up, etc. They've even limited access to her kids as punishment for "falling out of line." It's gotten so bad to the point where her kids don't identify her as "mommy" anymore; they've started calling their grandmother and grandfather as mom and dad! They even force her to let them accompany her to her counseling meetings that she requested in case she "says the wrong thing about them." On a number of occasions, they've threatened to kick her out without access to her kids. She loves the little darlings, and can't do a damned thing in the world about it!

Tonight, my friend threatened to kill herself. I don't have a clue what to do!! She can't move out despite having enough income to do so (but doesnt have savings because her parents eat up all her cash). She can't stay home for obvious toxic reasons. If she moves out, her parents will refuse her access to her kids.

Reddit, any options, legal or otherwise? It's worth mentioning we live in Ontario, Canada.
