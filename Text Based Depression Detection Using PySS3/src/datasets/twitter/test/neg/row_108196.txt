Sanctioned sites?Anyone here on that site or similar sites?

I don't understand why they didn't accept my reason and denied me an account. 

I am physically disabled.  It also affects me cognitively too. 

I need to plan it. It's the only type of site that won't try to talk me out of it and allows discussion. 

I don't want to suffer anymore.  I have severe chronic physical pain as well.

I don't want to jump off a building but I am getting close. I don't want to risk being paralyzed but everything I do is being denied and rejected.
