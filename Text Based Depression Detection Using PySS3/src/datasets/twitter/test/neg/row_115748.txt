I don't see a point in 'family.'I never understood family, and I was never close like how some people are. I feel 'family' is just a limitation, "oh don't talk to your aunt/uncle/cousin/mother like that!" I've never been close to my family, I guess I never just clicked in with them. I don't feel that 'family bond' that a lot of people talk about because to put it frank, I find them annoying and unnecessary. All the memories I have with my mom is her yelling at me, telling me that I'm a failure/devil's child, or her crying about how hard her life is. Her life is hard, and she does love me but every time I try to talk back she just says, "You can't yell at me but I can yell at you, you don't have the right to but I do because I'm your mother." Which is a crappy and bullshit answer. (She actually says that) She just finds reasons to yell at me and when I say she doesn't do it with my brother she tells me that I complain too much. I think I do complain too much but what else can I do? My 'family' just gave me the physical needs to survive but didn't give me enough mental/psychological needs. My dad doesn't know English and just gets bullied by my mom a lot, I feel sad for him, he's a good dad. He thinks things logically but he's too nice. My cousins are just people I have to get along with because I'll be seeing them for the rest of my life, same with everyone else. I think the main problem is my Mom and I can't wait to get them out of my life. Maybe then I'll start being grateful, miss them and start remembering the good times I've had with her instead of thinking she's the worst. It's an emotional roller coaster with my mom and I feel like she's a narcissist/she is very entitled/egotistical because she just guilt trips me and because she's my carer I can't do anything about it. She claims it's for the better but I think she just does that to make herself feel better about how she's treating me. Recently she forced me into a program, said I didn't have to do it because she's "opening doors" for me, so I quit (because I didn't want to do it and she told me I didn't have to), she then gets mad at me for not "consulting with her," forces me back in and now she says, "I changed my mind, you don't have to do it anymore." AFTER I finalized everything with that program. What the actual fuck? I can't fucking take this mental abuse anymore, I want to end it but I'm too scared to die. All my efforts to be successful will go to absolute waste because I was destined to fail no matter how good my grades are and no matter how hard I've tried, and the reason is, is because I will end my life by my own hand one day.
