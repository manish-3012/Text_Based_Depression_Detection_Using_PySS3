I'm a pussyI, like many others, put on a mask so people can't see that there's something wrong with us. Well, I don't wear a mask anymore. I'm sad 90% of the time and it shows. Clear as day. My mom notices that I'm sad, asks if I'm okay (rarely) and all I end up doing is brushing her off like a fucking idiot.

She doesn't think that I may be depressed and need some fucking help. She learned I wanted to kill myself a few weeks ago. She doesn't actively try to help me. And I'm too much of a fucking god damned pussy to just outright say "Mom, I'm depressed and I think about suicide everyday. I need help." 

*sigh*
