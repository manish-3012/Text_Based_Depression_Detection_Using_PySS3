overdosedi odâ€™d about two weeks ago and my sister found me in my room. i was resuscitated unfortunately.   
you would think the trauma i put on my sister and family would be enough to make me rethink suicide but itâ€™s not. i need to finish the job this time 

itâ€™s pointless. life is fucking pointless. iâ€™ve been raped, sexually assaulted, bullied, dropped out of college. i tried to find joy in the small things, tried to enjoy just waking up everyday.  but itâ€™s a chore. my mind is working fucking overtime bombarding me with all these thoughts and anxiety. itâ€™s never ending and i need it to be quiet 
please let my world be quiet. please let my attempt work. i just need for this to be over. 

iâ€™m sorry for ranting, i just had to tell someone so why not some internet strangers. 

good bye and thanks for listening â¤ï¸
