Almost did itI was so depressed for the past couple of days and I took a break from work today and stayed alone. Went into the kitchen and saw a knife. Took it to slit my wrist but couldn't. Then thought of just cutting a little, but even chickened out of that. I'm sorry for asking this, but is there a way to find out how painful it would be?
