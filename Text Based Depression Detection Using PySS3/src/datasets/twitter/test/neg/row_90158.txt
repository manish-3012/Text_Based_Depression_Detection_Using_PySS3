I stopped meeting my good friends.Just that when I kill myself, it will be easier for them.. maybe? I donâ€™t know. I feel like such a burden when I talk about my feelings and depressing shit. I can see that they are done with it and they canâ€™t help me. Itâ€™s sad, but i think itâ€™s for the best. I just want to disappear like I never existed
