I want to try commit suicide againSo, um yeah I am 14 year old girl I have been diagnosed with disordered eating, Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety, Body dysmorphia and Anger Issues. I have tried to commit suicide a few times, but they have always failed, One was overdose (Which put me in hospital), One was jumping off a bridge ( I was aiming for these rocks to land on but I just missed them by a tiny bit, and I got sent to a clinic). I am thinking of commiting suicide again, I really just don't want to live through the painful process of life. Life is hard for me, I have been bullied my whole life and I started smoking weed and self harming to get the pain away. I am thinking of killing myself I just want to die. So yeah, It felt better to let that out thanks :)
