Maybe someone can help meHi there! I have had a fucked up day today. First of all, my mother told me that I have a shitty personality and also used my psychiatrist's words as a way to make her sayings even more hurtful. I also had a horrible panic attack over my ex. She just posted a Instagram story about the sky and all I could think about was how she has moved on and maybe is there even with a new bf/gf. That hurt me so fucking bad. I'm still in pain because of my ex and how everything ended. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I should starve myself. I just wanna die. This feels like hell.
