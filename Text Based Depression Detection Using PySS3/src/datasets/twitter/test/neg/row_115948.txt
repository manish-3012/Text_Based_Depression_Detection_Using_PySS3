I think tonight will be the night.I've been waiting for an opportune moment to leave this place. I think that time will come tonight. I've been held together by threads for a few years now, and those threads have become unraveled.

The main thing that triggers it is isolation. I was safe when I was with my girlfriend because she was always around. So the thoughts would stay at bay. Now I don't have her anymore, and despite my best efforts to surround myself with people, tonight everyone is busy/occupied. I don't have anyone to latch on to, so I think I'm going to let go.

I don't know why I'm posting here. I never post anywhere. I guess part of me feels like I should make a responsible effort to try to make it not happen. I've been close enough to this moment in the past to know what comes next. Don't bother commenting with any of that pick-me-up bullshit; it's only going to aggravate me. If someone has a solid idea for how to make it through the next 12 hours, I'd like to hear it.  Thank you.
