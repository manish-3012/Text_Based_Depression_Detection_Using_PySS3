No way out, i guessIâ€™m absolutely fucked.. Iâ€™m struggling with borderline personality disorder for some time now but nothing helps... The medication Iâ€™m on is making everything worse, even though Iâ€™ve been on it for some time.. Half a year ago I survived a sucide attempt. It only got worse since then.. Few days ago I wanted to jump in front of a train but a security guy kicked me out from the rails. I went home and tried to hang myself on my belt but the belt tore. I popped about 500 mg atarax with some codeine pills woth a bottle of vodka. Even then I woke up the next morning, and had to go to school like nothing happened, even tho i had to vomit every hour. Iâ€™m just so sick of all those failed attempts and sick of me, so i made a big cut on my cheek when I was feeling really lost but now I have no idea could i do something like this. Sometimes I donâ€™t want to kill myself in the moment, i just want the option to do it, but suddenly my mood switches and my my brain just locks in some sort of psychosis, nothing feels real so i have to cut myself to make myself sure iâ€™m still alive and i just canâ€™t take it, i want to end it all.. I knew for some time now that i will end my life one day but now i feel like ending it every few hours a day and I just donâ€™t know how to succes or how to beat this feeling.. I just feel like thereâ€™s no other way but even suicide seems impossible and I hate myself for not being able to just kill that piece of fucking trash that I am.
