Quarantine is gonna kill meParents arenâ€™t allowing me to leave the house, they take my phone every night, limited to 2 hours of video games per day, so there goes basically any contact with people, the only thing getting me through quarantine was FaceTiming all my friends late at night but there goes that, I have to wake up at 7:00 am every morning for online school. So theres all the reasons for my suicide, thanks
