Doing a Little BetterFolks on here have been an amazing support so I want to let you know I am... doing a little better.

I am still experiencing very severe shock and trauma but I am no longer actively considering suicide. (I am not against passively not preventing death but I will not be taking my own life.) When the time comes for me to join my love, I will go happily, but I will not force Death's hand.

I am with my PTSD service dog again and she has been doing her job at making sure I am safe. My heart swelled like the grinch's when she inspected every room for me and then inspected me for safety. Separation from her was probably a significant reason I was so low so fast.

Thank you to everyone who was supportive. Thank you for your kind words. Thank you to those who were more helpful, significantly kinder, more understanding than either the people on the suicide hotlines or in the psyche ER. I strongly believe you have probably saved my life. Thank you.

I will probably stick around here and keep talking to people. This is a very kind board and I know intimately the loneliness that comes from being at the bottom of the barrel, especially when the supposed social safety net doesn't work.
