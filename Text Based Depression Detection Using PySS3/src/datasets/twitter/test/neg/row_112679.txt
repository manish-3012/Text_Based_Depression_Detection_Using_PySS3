Please helpYou know how your chest gets heavy before crying? Iâ€™ve had that each night for a week straight, but no tears follow. Its maddening. No matter how hard I try to cry and get it out, it never happens. I feel like my body is forcing me to hold on to all of the emotional pain I have endured. What did i do to deserve this bs for what seems like all 22 years of my  life? Why wonâ€™t my body let it go? I need help, please, i am going crazy.
