I am borderline socially retarded.I have good days and I have bad days. Today is a bad day. But even on the good days, I can't socialize with people very well. When I do try to socialize, my brain completely fries after about an hour of giving it everything I've got. I absolutely hate the experience, but I feel better afterwards knowing that I've taken a step in the direction of becoming normal.

This is made worse because I moved to a new area four years ago that is hard to make friends in. I don't have a single friend. At all. I want to go make friends but there isn't a store you can go to and pick up a friend. And it's not like I'm weird or anything, I go to the gym 5-6 times a week (male) and am actually a fairly cool guy once people get to know me. I'm not macho at all - androgynous mostly. I use to have good friends, notsomuch anymore. I really cannot think of a way to meet friends, and imagining a life of another 40 years without friends is worse than death (hence why this is posted here). 

I actually thought I was getting better, but relapsed today because of the realization that I'm stuck in this rut. Exercise has helped tenfold, but without friends the weight is still weighing me down to the point where I cannot do anything but eat/work/workout/sleep, wash/rinse/repeat. 

I posted under [this name](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b4r35/how_do_you_deal_with_social_anxiety_disorder/) about a year ago being completely suicidal, and I can say that I am much much better now than then, but I still don't understand the ways of making friends. Please help me obi-wan kenobi! You're my only hope!
