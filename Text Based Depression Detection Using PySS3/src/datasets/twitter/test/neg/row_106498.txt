"we assumed you were sleeping it off"I'm struggling with alcohol addiction. I hate it, I feel like a piece of shit. I'm trying to get better. Staying with my folks for the holidays.

Woken up yesterday in the early AM thirsty as hell so went up and downstairs a couple times just to chug a bunch of water. Chose not to drink anything, went back to sleep.

I slept crazy late (side effect of new meds) and asked my parents why they didn't knock on my door since we had breakfast plans (and mum had offered to come give me a wake up call the night before, since she knows I sleep hard.)

"Well we heard you up and about this morning so we assumed you got drunk and were sleeping it off."

Thanks Mum! I already know I'm a drunk piece of shit but now I feel an extra level of worthless. Even when I'm not drinking, I might as well be, right? This just gets to be my identity now.

I hate myself, and everything I'm doing or not doing in my life. I wish I was dead. Thought about knocking back all my depression pills with a nice big glass of vodka and just passing out. Never going to amount to anything from here on anyway.

JK, I'll probably just get completely wasted instead because that's apparently all I'm good for and I'm too cowardly to do anything else.
