Boyfriend cheated, got rejected from 3 masters degree programs, donâ€™t have friends, no job. Iâ€™m seriously considering the possibilityI had depression and anxiety for the last months. I called my boyfriend names and was mean to him. Itâ€™s totally my fault that he cheated on me. He was the love of my life and my family. I canâ€™t even get accepted into a university. Iâ€™m so worthless, living at home with my mom at 24 and canâ€™t even get on my feet. All my friends ignore me. I canâ€™t go on another day. Iâ€™m so desperate. Itâ€™s not even that I want to hurt myself, I never did that. I just want to sleep and never wake up. Thereâ€™s no such a thing as therapy or a suicide line in my country. God I couldnâ€™t even afford therapy if I wanted to. My mom loves me and sheâ€™s the best but I know sheâ€™s disappointed, she wanted me to marry this guy one day, she wanted me to graduate and have a better life than hers, a happier life. And I just donâ€™t see how. Every bad thing that could have happened to me happened in this week. Even the girl she cheated with was kind to me and itâ€™s much prettier. I am just a piece of garbage in my momâ€™s house. I canâ€™t hold a job and will probably end up homeless like my dad. I donâ€™t have worth. I really just want to sleep for good.
