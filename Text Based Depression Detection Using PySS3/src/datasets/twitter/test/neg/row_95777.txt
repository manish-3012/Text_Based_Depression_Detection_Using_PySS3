The only reason I don't want to die is fear of hurting or disappointing other people.I've been depressed for the past... most of my life. I also have pretty extreme social anxiety that I didn't have this bad until getting fired from my first "professional" job last year for the simple reason that no one in the office liked me. Like that's literally what they said to me. Now my social anxiety is so intense that a lot of the time I'm too scared to leave my house and the only thing I can manage is going to work. 


My self-esteem is so low that I just don't want people to look at me or notice me. I've scared away all of my friends. Not only do I live in a small town with like no people my age, but I'm too afraid of even being alive to make new friends. Who would want to be friends with someone who's so broken? 

So my life feels super pointless. I work at a dead end part time job that exhausts me now. I'm too scared to leave my house most of the time. I have no friends. I hate my appearance and mostly everything about myself. I have a boyfriend of 6 years who I live with. He's one of the only good things, but he has a lung condition that requires a lot of emergency hospital visits and I'm always paranoid about coming home to him dead... His mom is also absolutely nuts and hates me. I have family, but my dad and my stepmom are getting a divorce and splitting up my siblings. 


So the only reason I'm holding onto life is out of obligation, and out of fear of hurting people. I'm still gonna be here tomorrow. But I feel like I'm just surviving and not living. Every day feels like I barely made it to the other side. That feels like I've already died and I'm in hell...
