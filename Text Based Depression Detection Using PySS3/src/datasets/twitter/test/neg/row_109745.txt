I am ready. It's not an easy decision, but it is the decision with the least risks.When I say risks, I mean mentally and emotionally. I am not a risk-taker, and that I have to live on for another day, risking that things will get worse and worse, terrifies me.   


I have seriously and genuinely sought for help from most everywhere and everyone, and the only one who can change my mind refuses to help me see the light at the end of the tunnel (and he is aware of that). I have talked to people from different helplines, been to therapy sessions, shared my stories with friends, etc. As I thought things couldn't get any worse, they did. Despite my wish of keeping my struggle with suicidal thoughts privately, a friend of mine outed me on social media, along with my mum, and as a result, I have been bombarded with messages and visits from people and the police, and it's been nothing but triggering, scary, uncomfortable and exhausting for me to endure. I think this has been the final push that I was searching for.  


Looking at my life, I am no longer looking at what the future holds anymore. Instead, I look back at my past, and I am satisfied with what I have been able to do, experience and achieve; and for that, I feel content and ready. I understand that people who know me will be upset and devastated, and I can do nothing but feel sorry for them. My entire life up until now, I have loved everyone with all my heart, and cared for everyone with all I have, so I hope people can see me as that person instead of as someone who has to take the difficult way out.  


Determination can be powerful, and after having no determination to live anymore, I feel more determined than ever to end it all. Obviously, this is just part of my story, but I thought I would vent somewhere, because I don't want to have anything left unsaid. My journal will, in addition, tell everyone about who I am, so I guess this is some sorts of a final goodbye to the world.   


I have not had a set date yet, but it is really bizarre feeling that I know that the day will come sometime very soon. Now that I have had all of my affairs in order, time to watch the final season of Gossip Girl.   


XOXO,
