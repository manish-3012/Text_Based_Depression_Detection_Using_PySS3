i want people to just let me do it and leave me aloneHere i am, in a neuroscience clinic and have suffered from depression for 2 years. I have made the choice to kill myself this week. But parents and friends found out and force me to endure even more torture. can't they just fucking understand i want to die and no longer have to suffer living? Parents are so damn stubborn and are keeping me under watch like a fucking lunatic. look I want my life to end and its MY choice. So fucking stupid people think they are helping and i know they care for me, but all they are really doing is prolonging and suffering but the outcome will be the same.i am going to kill myself
