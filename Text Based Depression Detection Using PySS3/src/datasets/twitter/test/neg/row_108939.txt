Why should I even live?In a few minutes, I'm going to pick up charcoal from the store to end my pointless life. To sum my life up quickly, I dropped out of school because of my dad's cancer which would eventually kill him, I work a tedious, mind-numbing physical dead-end job that I'm probably going to be stuck with for the rest of my life, I'm an emotional abusing piece of shit to my girlfriend who just broke up with me yesterday and I just found out five minutes ago, she's been cheating on me with someone else for over a month at least.

Give me one good reason why I should even continue going on.
