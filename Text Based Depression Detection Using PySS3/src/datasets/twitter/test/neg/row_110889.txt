Even with no current struggles or burdens in life, I still wanna dieI had a shitty childhood. Born 2 weeks early addicted to meth, heroin and alcohol. Fetal alcohol syndrome, autism, bipolar, anxiety. My family is mostly made up of drug addicted rednecks. Iâ€™ve lived in so many roach/mold infested trailers, stepped on so many needles and broken meth bowls, been abused by family and partners. Bullied and ostracized because Iâ€™m awkward and donâ€™t understand social cues. My learning disability and anxiety have made keeping a stable job hard. I cried every day as a waitress. I hated customer service because people hated me. 

But now Iâ€™ve got a great paying warehouse job that I like(not LoVeeeEee, but I like it) great boyfriend, and weâ€™re about to get a new car and rent a house in my hometown so Iâ€™ll be closer to friends/family that I do like. But Iâ€™m still so sad. I have nothing to be sad about. Now Iâ€™m going to have to wait even longer to off myself because I have to isolate from everyone to make it easier, idk where Iâ€™ll go. I work with my boyfriend so I canâ€™t keep my job anyways. I was gonna OD on dph and alcohol because I used to be addicted to it and seems like the most hellish way to go. But Iâ€™m so scared it wonâ€™t work and Iâ€™ll have to go back to the mental hospital. I need to get a gun somehow but I obviously canâ€™t legally buy one due to my illnesses. 
Thinking about it has become a daydream, a sweettt escape. Iâ€™ve been eating so much melatonin and Benadryl(but not enough to get high bc itâ€™s obvious) to stay a sleep but after 48 hours of straight sleep minus like 20 min increments itâ€™s so hard to sleep again. Iâ€™m trying so so hard to leave my boyfriend without him thinking itâ€™s his fault, but heâ€™s also depressed so itâ€™s hard. 
He has a noose from his last attempt, and itâ€™s still sitting out in the yard(people must think itâ€™s a Halloween decoration) 
Maybe I can take that, go to my dads, and do it in the woods. Of course heâ€™ll report me missing immediately but I canâ€™t think of more than 5 people who will actually care, so I hope itâ€™ll be a while before they find me so they just think I ran away and maybe itâ€™ll soften any grief.
