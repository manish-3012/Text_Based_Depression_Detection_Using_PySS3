Why do I feel this way?My life has been a nightmare these past few months. Some days, I'm woken up by the sound of my dad yelling at my mom. He's a really nice guy, but does have anger problems. My mom is no angel either. She always complains and whines about her life as if she expects my dad to suddenly become rich and buy a fancy house. Now every time something that involves me goes wrong, I cry in my bathroom and contemplate death. I want to be an animator. I've wanted to make cartoons that entertain people and make them smile. Because that's what cartoons do to me. Every time I'm sad or angry at the world or myself I watch them. It's the only things keeping me going. My cousin used to make want to live life, but recently she'd been ignoring my calls. I didn't even say anything mean. She was the only person I could vent to. Now I just keep my feelings bottled up. I'm afraid the day will come when all my favorite cartoons and anime end. (I was anime singular because I only watch AOT) And if that day comes, I'll no longer want to live in this world. I do appreciate for you reading this far if you did. I just don't know if I want to live or die.
