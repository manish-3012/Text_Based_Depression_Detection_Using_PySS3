I'm a worthless personI have paranoid schizophrenia and it makes my life fucking miserable. I lost my pilot's license, the only thing I've ever accomplished that gives me joy. I'll probably be grounded for life. My fiance spends so much money on me and I wish I wasn't such a burden on him. It would be better for everyone if I just leave. I'm sure they will grieve and cry but in the end, they will move on and have a better life without me. I want to be with my dad again. I love him more than anybody else in the whole world and I am still suffering from his death - I cry every day still. Every single day. Something tells me I will never move on from him. I belong with him in the afterlife.

The part of me that wants to live is dying, although I guess it's still there or I wouldn't be posting this... but I'm just done. The only thing that gives me joy is thinking about my impending suicide. I am excited that soon this will all be over. No more schizophrenia,no more cutting, no more burden, no more missing, no more pain. I wish people could see how badly I want to be with my dad again. I wish I could show how much it hurts that he's gone every day. He was my soulmate, my best friend, and without him, this life isn't worth living. The world feels so empty and cold now that he's gone. 

I work in hospice so I am very familiar and comfortable with death. If I could take one of my patient's disease so they could live, I would. But it doesn't work that way. I feel so close to death every day, more than life. Death seems so beautiful and peaceful to me. I'm so close to ending it.
