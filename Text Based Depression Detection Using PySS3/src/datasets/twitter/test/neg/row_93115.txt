I'm out of answersI attempted in 2019 
It almost worked and I had %70 chances of dying and 
Just... It only gave me liver disease.. It was OD by paracetamol 
I was 18 at the suicide but  I lived long enough
I really do think that changed my life forever 
The moment my fiancee left me 
We dated for 4 years.. 4 fucking years.. 
How.. 
Why did I lose everything 
Why is life.. Like this 

Would it work if I just jump off?  From a very tall building m. No chance of getting into an ambulance right?
