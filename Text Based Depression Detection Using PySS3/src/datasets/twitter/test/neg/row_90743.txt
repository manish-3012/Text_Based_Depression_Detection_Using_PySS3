I have too much internal conflict. I hate fighting myself on everything. Please kill me.I feel like those failed Sigourney Weaver clones from Alien: Resurrection. Just kill me. Everything hurts and no one understands. I will never be fixed. PLEASE end me. I have no right to complain either, nothing in my life is wrong. Others have it much worse. I just want to lie down in traffic.
