I feel aimless because the things that are making me delay/cancel my suicide &amp; keeping me alive are (1) future Marvel movies/series, and (2) the fear of hurting my grieving friends/family. Other than that, I mostly feel dead inside and just winging it.I feel happy sometimes when I'm with friends though. But sometimes the postive feelings feel fleeting.

I'm in the closet and surrounded by a religious Catholic family and some friends are Born Again Christian and a few friends/former-classmates are hardcore anti-LGBTQ+ Reformed Christians.

I made 3 notes for 3 people only so far. One for a friend/former teacher, one for an old friend I used to be close with from church &amp; haven't talked to for a long time, and one friend I've known since 5th grade I think. (too tired to link the post so just view my profile until you see a post from r/UnsentLetters.)

There are times when coping mechanisms no longer work. Naps and music no longer work to make the feeling pass. Food/drinks aren't enjoyable, appetite sucks. Coffee doesn't give much joy like it used to, and only makes me palpitate. 


Like said, the main things keeping me alive are:

(1) future Marvel movies and series or music

(2) the fear of hurting my grieving friends/family. Also I'm afraid my depressed friends will become even more depressed. I'm also afraid that I might also trigger someone else to end their life as well.
