I am pathetic. The "real world" is driving me insane. And I'm driving my friends away with my insanity.I graduated in May and moved in with my boyfriend. He's wonderful and I love him so much. He and my mom are the only reason why I haven't tried anything yet and maybe I never will.

He doesn't make a lot of money. I lost my job (it was a contract) and I don't know when I'm going to get another one. Living off of his paycheck is really hard. Neither of us are good with money and I have 50 dollars in my bank account right now. His coworker has kids, makes less than he does, and somehow he has a new car? Sure, his coworker is married, but what the fuck are WE DOING WRONG!? I feel so upset and lost. I want his support and don't know how to ask. I don't want him to feel like the bad guy. We need to get our shit in order and I don't know where to start.

I don't even want to start. I honestly want to give up. He's in debt and doesn't want to discuss it with me. I'm about to go into debt because I want to go to grad school. What the fuck is the point of any of this shit? To be in debt that we apparently won't ever be able to pay off because we can barely afford to feed ourselves on his salary?

The "real world" feels like so much pressure and my anxiety is driving him nuts. He's suggested before that I move out so I can get chill out over it. But moving out won't solve anything. I just want everything to stop.

My friends are tired of hearing my complaints. I'm tired of being anxious all the time. I'm tired of hating the body I live in (I'm also overweight) and I'm tired of constantly worrying about my financial future which seems like will never be remedied. 

Like I said, if it weren't for my boyfriend and my mom, life would be pointless. He's the only thing that makes me happy anymore. Without him, my life is dull and pointless. I have no friends here (I moved states). I hate this. Life itself is too stressful.

I used to think I wanted to have kids, but now I don't because I can't imagine ever affording them. It seems impossible.

That's all. Fuck this.
