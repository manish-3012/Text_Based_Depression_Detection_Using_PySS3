Loneliness is killing me.I don't know how much longer I can feel this way. Life wasn't supposed to be this way, it's not meant to be lived like this in isolation. The majority of my day is spent fantasizing about how great life could be if I just had some friends or a girlfriend, how great life would be if I wasn't me. I just want friends, I want a girlfriend, I want to hang out and have fun with people, I really want to cuddle with someone, I want to go to the movies on a weekend instead of a weekday because I have to go by myself. I want a hug so bad. I just want to be a normal fucking person. This pain is so awful and I'm tired of it.
