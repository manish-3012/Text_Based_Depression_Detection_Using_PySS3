Another fun hotline experienceThought I'd call while on a walk as it's the only privacy I get from my family outside of work.

I call and get connected pretty quickly. The lady I spoke with rarely talked, interrupted me when she did, and had an odd fascination with my location. ("Are you familiar with X county?") Also literally everything she said was a question that started with "I wonder if" i.e. "I wonder if you're calling because you miss your ex," yeah, no shit, I've only been talking about her. The interrupting thing didn't strike me as odd at first since I was nervous and I'm generally kind of inept at making phone calls, so I left longer pauses between my thoughts to give her time to interject. Dead silence until I spoke again, at which point she said something else. So I decided, after a little bit of this, to wait and see just how long that pause could be. There must have been fifteen, twenty seconds without her saying a damn thing and I hung up. Fucking sucks working up the courage to call and getting someone who doesn't give a shit what you've got to say.
