PTSD, OCD, and moreI have PTSD, OCD, and other illnesses. It's hard to get a prescription for benzos for my anxiety, unfortunately, so I resort to heavy drinking to calm my anxiety down for a little while. I feel like I bother everybody. I have flashbacks every single day, and have fears of abandonment because of my childhood issues. My significant other is just busy with work, so I feel bad when I bother him with my problems. I don't see my psychiatrist until February, and even then, I feel like he doesn't listen to me. Everything hurts.
