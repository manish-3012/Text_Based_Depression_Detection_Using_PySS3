I just want to end itI've been bullied all through My childhood, there isn't a single day that i dont think of the past and how it fucked me up, i'm tired of having these memories, i'm tired of sleeping just to have nightmares, and waking up just to be in pain. All i want is someone to hear me for once, I want to stop being so fucking invisible, I want to be at peace for once, i'm just so tired.
