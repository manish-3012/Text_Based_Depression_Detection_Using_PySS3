Not suicidal. Yet.I'm a senior in Highschool. All my friends are leaving for college, and I'm pretty set in on going to get my pilots license and then college, and then join the army. I'm just not ready to say by to my girlfriend and friends. Our friend group is lighting in a bottle. I just try to make their lives better and in return they do the same whether they know it or not. After they leave I'm not sure if I'm cut out for the world. I'm just waiting for life to get good... but it's just not happening.
