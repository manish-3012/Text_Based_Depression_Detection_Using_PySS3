My friend killed herself and I don't know how to process itShe was extremely unwell, running away at every chance she got, self harming several times a day, refusing to eat anything, exercising compulsively, I have no idea why she wasn't in hospital. I know it wasn't my fault but I can't help but think I could have done more, which I know is a common feeling after something like this but it sucks.




How have you dealt with the loss of someone you know to suicide? Are you okay now?
