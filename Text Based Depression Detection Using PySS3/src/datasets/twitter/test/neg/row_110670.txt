I might have made a mistakeHello everyone, this is my first post on reddit. :) 

This is the first time I feel like I've got something relevant to post and I need to get this off my chest, so here we go.

I think I've made a mistake because I wasn't thinking ahead. I've never attempted suicide, but I think about it a lot. I definitely wouldn't mind dying. Actually, if I knew that tomorrow was the day I'd die, I wouldn't try even the slightest to stop it - what's more, I'd be looking forward to it. At this moment, I can't say that I'm certain to commit suicide some day, but neither can I say I'm certain not to do it. Now, where I think I went wrong and what's often on my mind is that me and my friends often make suicide jokes (and I know we aren't the only ones who do it) which aren't supposed to mean anything - we're just fooling around. However, I find myself contemplating suicide really often, despite only mentioning it ironically and in a humorous context. If some day I decide and kill myself, I feel like my friends might feel guilty for not doing anything about it. What if they start blaming themselves for not recognizing my jokes as a warning and stopping me? I can't blame them, because, as I said, many people joke in this way and not every single one of them is suicidal. My friends are all very good people and the last thing I'd want is for them to feel miserable because of me. And honestly, this is the only thing that keeps me going. I feel like I've trapped myself in here; just because I was recklessly fooling around with those things...and I regret it now. 
What if things don't get better and I won't be able to endure it any longer? What if I just lose it some day, give up and decide to take my own life? Is there a way to avoid them feeling responsible?

If you've read the whole thing, thank you :)
