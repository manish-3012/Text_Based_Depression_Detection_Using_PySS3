Thoughts on ObsessionThis is a reply I made to a post on this sub which can be found here: [Is anyone else obsessed with suicide?](https://reddit.app.link/2njWamJCA3). I thought maybe it could help some people think about things in another way, maybe it won't help anyone ðŸ¤·. I am not an expert on anything besides Guitar Hero, and this is mostly Google-Fu. I encourage everyone to do their own studies on these topics and don't take anything I say as hard fact. I'd urge you to please go and support our friend, who this comment was made for. Good luck everyone!

I'd say a lot of people on this sub **alone** are obsessed with it, but that doesn't mean you have to bend to it, right? We have a remarkable ability to get **addicted** to pretty much anything and everything in life, anything that fires off any sort of signal of "pleasure" in our egg salad **can totally be addictive**.

They make T.V. shows about it, check out the IMBD description for "Strange Addictions": **"Strange" doesn't seem to adequately describe some of the addictive behaviours profiled on this series. Dangerous, even life-threatening, come much closer. Each half-hour episode features two adults who resort to extreme compulsions in an effort to soothe their emotional demons.**

Of course things are going to be "played up" for T.V., but that doesn't mean theres no truth to the topic. Just a quick Google search will show you how many people struggle with coping in a harmful way, certainly with harmful thoughts...

**"Almost 21 millionÂ Americans haveÂ at least oneÂ addiction, yet only 10% of them receive treatment. Drug overdose deathsÂ haveÂ more than tripled since 1990. From 1999 to 2017, more than 700,000Â AmericansÂ died from overdosing on a drug. Alcohol and drugÂ addictionÂ cost the U.S. economy over $600 billion every year."**

...and that's just **my** country. Yes it's referring to **drug addiction** and not **suicidal ideation** addiction, but I'd wager that **many** if not **most** people suffering from long-term depression, probably go through their share of suicidal thoughts, would you agree?

**"According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), across the United States, 8.1 percent ofÂ peopleÂ over the age of 20 haveÂ depressionÂ over any given 2-week period. For someÂ people,Â depressionÂ might only be episodic and overcome within a matter of weeks or months."**

2 weeks doesn't seem like much, but that's over **any two week period** as in, **at all times**, and these are just what's **reported**. 8.1% of the 330 million people in America, would come out to something like 26.7 **million** people, **at any given time**, who are struggling with depression **enough** that they sought help for it.

But for a tobacco smoker to "quit smoking", to **free herself from addiction**, she has to go through her days, for months, **constantly bombarded** by her addiction trying to retake control. Pretty much every moment of the day for a couple weeks at least, her mind is constantly making her [feel like shit](https://youtu.be/whbhunRApSU) for not **doing the thing** it has grown accustomed to over the years.

I would argue the same is true for your suicidal ideation, you have to **actively fight** not the urge to use a drug, but the urge to think of suicide in a positive light. This is from Tha Wikipedia: **Most people who haveÂ suicidal thoughtsÂ do not go on to makeÂ suicideÂ attempts, butÂ suicidal thoughtsÂ are considered a risk factor.**

To stop **obsessing** over something that your mind has grown accustomed to, you have to actively fight the urge to equate it to positive feelings: "It would be great if I were dead" &lt; "It would **not be so great** if I were dead, look at all the bad stuff that would happen!"

I would also argue that you are definitely not **wasting your parents money**. That money they're spending is likely the greatest investment of their lives to them, don't believe me though: ask them! We can spend money on all sorts of trivial things in life, but the well being of a **human person** that we **care about** is a greater use of our green than any other.

If you'd like to, I'd love to hear back from you and continue the discussion. You are as important and worthwhile as anyone else and I know **you believe that** somewhere **in the mind**. Please don't hurt yourself, and good luck friends!
