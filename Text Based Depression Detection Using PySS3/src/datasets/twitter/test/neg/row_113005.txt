I wish I was deadKissless virgin at 21, barely any friends, nobody has ever loved me. 

I was rejected by a girl I really liked two years ago and I'm still not over it, my studies are going to shit because all I can think about is the fact that everyone is happy and has a boyfriend or a girlfriend while I have to rot in loneliness. 

I'm a pathetic piece of shit, I will kill myself soon, life is utter hell and I want it to end.
