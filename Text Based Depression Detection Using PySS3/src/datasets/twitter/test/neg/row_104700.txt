I've been rehearsing my suicide when my girlfriend leaves for work.I keep my rifle in the basement with the bolt and spring disassembled. I want it to be something I'm sure of and not on a whim. Every morning I go down to the basement and reassemble the pieces, lay my head over the drain and click the empty chamber. 

The only step I am missing is adding the bullet and I don't know if one of these days it will happen.

I had initially done this to prove to myself I really didn't want to do it, but I've grown really comforted by going through the motions.

I've been staving off getting help because this seems easier or what I really want.


I never thought I'd be here.
