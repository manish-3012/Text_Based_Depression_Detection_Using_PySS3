I dont want to live.I'm 22, my body is fucked. Both of my wrists are destroyed from my minimum wage jobs, my spine is always screaming at me to not do anything.
I have depression that can cause me to have worse health problems than i already have. 
I dont want to see my 23rd birthday.

Ive been to countless councelors, psychologists, therapists and doctors. Yet i am still broken. I've been on most if not all anti-depressent pharmacy pills, that did nothing but made me feel worse physically.
I feel there is no hope left for me.

We live to die, but i dont want to work until i die. i dont want to produce offspring into this bleak and fucked world. So there is no point to me being alive anymore.

I know i shouldnt, because I dont want to harm my friends and my sibling.
I'm not living for me anymore, im living for them and its just wearing me down. 
I just cant do this anymore and im sorry for it.
