It really sucks but it could be worse alwaysBack 3-4 years ago when I first wanted to shoot myself my mom found out and told my dad just a bit of backstory my mom left my dad when I was 5 my dad was a very angry person anything could set him off I never wanted to go over there but I would he would scream and yell at the slightest things back to a few years ago my dad found out me wanting to kill my self went to my dads house for a short time and he said Gage committing suicide makes you a quitter in life maybe itâ€™s just me but that seems wrong to react about that I used to look up to him and think he was cool but I just want a father that I could talk to Iâ€™m almost 15 and I still donâ€™t trust my dad itâ€™s really starting to tear me apart though Iâ€™m getting closer to a point
