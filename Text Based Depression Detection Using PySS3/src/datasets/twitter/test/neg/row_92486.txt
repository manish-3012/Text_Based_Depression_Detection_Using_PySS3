Death just seems preferable.My wife kicked me out today, and it was my fault. I've been without work for months and she caught me in a lie about money. I'm sitting here in my car, too ashamed to ask for a couch to sleep on, not feeling like I deserve one. Life has been so so hard, and even if it gets better later, I just want to stop now and give up. Nothing feels worth staying for.
