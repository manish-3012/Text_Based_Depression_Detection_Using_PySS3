tired as hellfuck, i posted here almost a month ago and i'm embarrassed that i'm back here again, feeling even worse than last time. but i pretty much don't have anyone anymore.

my life is so fucking messy and i really don't think anything's getting better. i tried killing myself last night and i'm trying again tonight. i have literally no reason to live anymore and i don't know why i can't just...do it. i'm surrounded by my closest friends but i can't even talk to them about it cause they don't care. my best friend has been ignoring me and he was my only reason to live until i realized he doesn't care.

i have so many reasons to end my life and no reason to stay. i probably just might kill myself hours after making this post i don't even know anymore.
