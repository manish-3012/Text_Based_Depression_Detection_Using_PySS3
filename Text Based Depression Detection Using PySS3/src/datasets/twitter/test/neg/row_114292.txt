Time to throw in the towelI'm 41 and have struggled with depression for nearly 20 years. When my dad died last year I lost it and basically abandoned my dream job. Moved across the country to be closer to family.

I've burned through most of my savings mostly on lawyers. Fighting over my dad's estate and trying to get child support modified so I can afford a roof over my head. Then a few months ago I was diagnosed with cancer and had to have surgery. The chemotherapy side effects are so strong that they make it almost impossible to keep my current job.

So I get the message the universe is sending me. Time to exit. I've priced a small revolver and plan to put it in my mouth. I'll do it outside so that nature will take care of most of the mess. Really wish it didn't have to be this way but if I lose my job I will fall behind on support, my credit will be ruined and I'd probably end up having to move in with my aging mother. And my car would be repossessed.

This went longer than I expected. Thank you for reading it. Hope this new year isn't your last.
