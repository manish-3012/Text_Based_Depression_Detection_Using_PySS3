I want to escape EasterBut I donâ€™t know how.
I want to die peaceful, not feeling any pain, just feel myself slowly fading away. Like when your drunk, you donâ€™t feel anything expect that everything is a little bit fun 
I canâ€™t swallow pills, I have never been able to, and thatâ€™s shit because that would be a great way to disappeared  

If Iâ€™m lucky I can find drugs and overdose on them, but itâ€™s much harder then it looks to get something. Iâ€™ve tried to ask some friends that I know have a connection with an seller but they just ignore when I ask or donâ€™t answer.
So now I have to go out there and try to find something myself, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s dangerous, I will happily let them stab or shoot me.

The other options are my least favorite, hanging or jumping. Both two options that I know I can chicken out, and even worse is that itâ€™s getting lighter outside, which mean that more people will be out later and might see me do something 

I donâ€™t know what to do 
I want it all to stop, and I know that I wonâ€™t be able to make it this week
Cause no one will talk to me for a whole week
And I canâ€™t deal with being alone anymore
