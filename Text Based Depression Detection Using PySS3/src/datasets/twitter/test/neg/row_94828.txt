I Am Going To Kill Myself August 12thI do not know why I am posting this.  I guess it's my final plea for help?  You know, half of me does want to live...It's not like I don't know that life is a beautiful gift.  These urges are just so strong, even on my best days I'm flooding with suicidal urges.  See a car?  I want to jump in front of it.  High place?  I want to jump.  Taking a bath?  I want to drown my self.  The list goes on. I cannot escape it.  
So, August 12th, I plan to sneak outside bright and early to pick some poison hemlock (which conveniently grows in our yard) and save it for later.  I'm going to spend the morning hanging with my family, having fun, living to the fullest, than, when my mother leaves to do her PT, I'll eat the hemlock.  I'll be dead in 3 hours.
You know, it's strange, the thought of dying gives me a meditative calm, mixed with a heart wrenching sadness.  It really does feel like two conflicting people inside of me.
