I may have about 64 hours of life leftIts Sunday evening in South Korea. Tuesday morning I get to shoot an M9 at a range. This will be the best opprotunity I've ever had to kill myself, which I've wanted to do frequently forabout eight years. Obviously if I was fully decided about it I wouldn't be posting here, but here I am. The cleanest break from conscience I've ever been offered is less than three days away. I always hesitate to do things like post this or look for "help" anywhere else because I feel like I'm taking time and resources away from people who need it more than me. But again, here it is. Peace Love etc.
