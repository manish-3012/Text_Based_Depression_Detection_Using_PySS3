Iâ€™m desperate for a reason to keep goingI have been having these rough nights where I think about doing it, I wonâ€™t, but every time it happens I get a little more serious about it.  Iâ€™m tired of explaining my situation and Iâ€™m looking everywhere for a reason to live.  I canâ€™t seem to find one.
