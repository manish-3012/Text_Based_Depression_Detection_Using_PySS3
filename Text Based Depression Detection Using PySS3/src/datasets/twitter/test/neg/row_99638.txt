Only staying for my sisterIâ€™m so sorry if I end up killing myself one day and she has to go through that grief. Sheâ€™s always been here for me and has guided me through all the bullshit and tough stuff when my mom constantly beat me down. I think the world of her but my world is falling apart.

Iâ€™m lost. I have nobody else but her and Iâ€™m in such a bad state that Iâ€™m afraid of killing myself and sheâ€™ll think that she could have done more.

But I donâ€™t want to be a burden anymore.
