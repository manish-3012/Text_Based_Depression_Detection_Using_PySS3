I give up. This is my note.I always thought about my note. I mean, this thing paper people leave after they die so they can tell about their life and what they want of their body disposal.

I give up. I'm too weak for this. I thought I had the force and my ambitions high enough for this but no. Over 10 years of philosophy, reading books and thinking deeply. Nothing helps. I was wrong all along and I cannot bear it.

I will die. Death was my greatest fear but it's the only one I will overpass. I cannot suffer this life anymore. I cannot take it anymore.

My note:

The password to my computer is L1f32142. In it, as well as on my desk and in the shelf in front of my computer, there are tons of papers and few notebooks. I think most if not all of what is hand written on the papers can be found in the folder My Documents. The latest writings I have are in the big blue notebook on my desk.

All I have written, I want it to be published. Whether it be on my personal website, which can be found in my computer as well, or in paper book. I want these notes, writings and thoughts to purdue and I will live through them.

My money, or what is left of it, can go to my school as a donation.

I want to be burried in a cemetery. I want to be burried in France. That's where I come from. If it's too expensive, then burn my body and burry the ashes in France.

Give all my books to my school. I hope they will serve someone else better than they did to me.

Give back my instruments to my adoptive dad. Tell him I love him and I'm thankful for his involvement in my life. The best is kept.

Give my childhood toys (including the legos), to an association for children in need.

As for everything else, it can be sold and I want the money that comes from it to go to my school again. I do NOT want my mother to touch a single penny from what I own and from this money. In fact, I do not want my mother to keep a single thing I own. From me, she must be left with nothing.


Now for my aquaintances, family, friends and people:

I have nothing to tell my family. I love my grand mother and I wish her well. Grand dad is already keeping an eye on her. I don't have any family except her.

Friends, my best friends. Especially the two girls who hang out with me most of the time at school. The two girls who went with me eating chocolate downton, who laughed at my jokes and who accepted my friendship and my presence with them. I love them. I want them to know I am thankful for their allowance of my presence, for their smiles and laughs. They will be successful. They will succeed in life and I am happy about this.

As for the others, as all unique every one of them is, I will simply thank them again for letting me in their lives, for letting me know them and making them laugh. It was great to know them. It was great to feel the distance between them and me, it was also fantastic to admire them and for me to fail at getting their admiration from me.

Following, I will leave a word about my love life. Ever since Z. disappeard from my eyes I never managed to get over. I met other girls but nothing happened like I wanted. Today I saw a lady I always wanted to get to know and I failed. Today I also saw another girl I dated once who never answered me since that day as well. I have no problem with that. Everyone has their own choices of heart and I have nothing against this lady. But today made me realize that nobody is for me and I cannot keep on living as an admirer of beauties. I want to stop loving myself, I need someone else to share a life that needs to be lived and I never found that person since Z. A life without a woman's love is a life made of bitterness and wasted loneliness.

Personal details, names, and information are not written here. I will write the url of this post on a piece of paper and leave it on me. I do not want you to be searching for me. From wherever I will be, I want to admire and contemple the world injurying me as it knows publicly that I failed. I'm writing this here so that the world knows I failed to live up to my ambitions. I cannot leave my town, I cannot leave my mother, I cannot give myself the success I want. And most of all, I cannot live by my beliefs and reason anymore. I am tired, wasted, and exhausted from this. I cannot endure the suffering mixed with pleasure, and then suffering coming again onto me.

Love life, and life will not give it back to you. I made mistakes. I had my karma. But overall me loving life and wanting to live doesn't work.

I will now listen to Chopin and think of how I am going to end this. I am afraid of death, and I do not want to suffer, and still this is what I have to go through in order to get rid of this waste and unbearable life. Perhaps I'm a coward, but I tried my best. I tried to be a philosopher. I tried to live and feel myself. All I have I got it by myself. Now I cannot work for myself anymore.

This post might never be answered or read from myself or potential readers.

One more thing, on my grave I want my stage name, which can be found on my personal website, followed underneath by this quotation:

"Proche, je n'aime pas mon prochain. Je veux qu'il s'en aille, loin, et s'Ã©lÃ¨ve ! Comment sans cela deviendrait-il mon Ã©toile ?" - Nietzsche
