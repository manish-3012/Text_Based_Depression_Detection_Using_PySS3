just wanted to chatfor background, i'm a 21yo woman, unemployed and in college. so i know some folks swing by to help when they're feeling good/better and are in a clearer space of mind than i am in the moment so i'd just like to kinda have a conversation or wtv with someone who's not doing it out of a sense of obligation or worry (ie, well intentioned twitter buddies who worry when i vent, which is uncomfy and embarrassing for everyone).

I'm just wondering if anyone's got tips on how to keep being productive or going abt ur business when existing is objectively not-good. Like, it's not the worst it could be, but there seems to be no point when you're stressed more often than not and "suicide isn't the answer" means nothing bc no one can really give better alternatives and the conversation just sounds like "it's better for you to accept living in constant pain because your death or your desire to die makes people around you upset".

I'm just not satisfied with any aspect of my life, i hate what i'm doing and honestly feel like i would hate to be doing anything i can realistically acquire the skills for (which is a difficult thing for me in itself with my financial situation, intellectual limitations, little emotional stamina and discipline). It's difficult for me to connect to other people so I'm also very lonely.

I have no intention in life, and even things i think i would kinda-like to achieve (getting more conventionally attractive, getting a so, getting my degree and a job) not only imply more work than i'm willing to do but also don't seem like they would feel that great. I have bad trust issues that makes the idea of having a meaningful relationship (a good friend or a date or wtv) too stressful. I imagine a job i could realistically get would be as stressful and challenging as going to college - which i'm not great at. there are limitations on how attractive i can get at this point in my life too, and it wouldn't quite make the cut with most people either way.

no healthy coping mechanism seems to work. it's actually kinda stupid and attests to the meaninglessness of life when everything that makes you feel better in any quantifiable capacity (drugs, alcohol, high fat + high carb foods, even sex) will slowly ruin you. Anything in an obnoxious self-help blog, like journaling, exercising, meditating, "indulging in the arts" - whatever the fuck that means, stresses me out more than helps (feels wrong, actually bad, or stupid) or is a huge waste of time when I should be doing coursework or chores or anything actually productive that alas, makes me feel like shit. Not that I /do/ any of that, my house is nasty rn and I'm absurdly behind in college shit and I've just been reading fiction and playing window's solitaire all weekend.

tldr, i guess i'm not the worst and just generally unlikable or at best uninteresting, and dont have the drive to pursue anything worthwhile in my life. I can't imagine a reality in which i'm not-sad-all-the-time and all coping methods that do anything for me are self-destructive. I need something that will make me continue on with life and do the senseless shit i should be doing, but i don't think it exists so i kinda hoped anyone had a more positive but rational argument as to why i should keep living or how to do it despite being unable to ever be satisfied with anything ever. I'm sorry for being kind of a downer, have a nice day.
