I just canâ€˜t deal with my life anymoreEverything fucking sucks. No one gives a shit about me. No one. All they want to do is use me as some stupid emotional trashcan because they saw I always allow them to rant and invest more time into them than I do to myself.


Iâ€˜m fucking tired of being rejected. Iâ€˜m fucking tired of being taken for granted. Iâ€˜m fucking tired that they only want to listen to me for A LITTLE BIT when itâ€˜s positive but the second I tell them I canâ€˜t keep up anymore, they ignore me.


Iâ€˜m just so fucking tired for being there for people when they are not there for me yet decide to lie about how Iâ€˜m not alone. Iâ€˜m always alone, Iâ€˜ve always been alone. 


My family doesnâ€˜t care about my mental health, they just blame me for showing symptoms. My friends ignore me while they always come crawling when they need to rant.


Iâ€˜m tired of always having to suffer. Iâ€˜m 24, since Iâ€˜ve been 6, I struggled with depression and suicidal ideation. No one ever understood me. It doesnâ€˜t matter how much I tell them anything, they will never understand what Iâ€˜m going through.


I fucking hate myself, Iâ€˜m a loser, Iâ€˜m useless, Iâ€˜m garbage. Iâ€˜m weak and Iâ€˜m tired. I want to give up. I just want to give up, nothing I do makes my life better.


Iâ€˜ve been in 2 therapies so far, Iâ€˜ve taken several medications, Iâ€˜ve had a 10 week clinic stay, I stanged my majors but I still struggle to get my degree.


Recently Iâ€˜ve been reminded of how fucking ugly and dumb I am. Also my friend got a job, I told her about and we both applied for. I feel happy for her but it just proves to me that in comparison to others, I will always lack. 


No matter how much I try and think it gets better, life just throws another curveball. Iâ€˜m tired of them. Iâ€˜m tired of feeling my past trauma over and over again.


No one ever really loved me, all I experienced was sexual abuse and men taking advantage of me not being able to say no. Iâ€˜ve been bullied, Iâ€˜ve been raped, Iâ€˜ve been hurt over and over again. I just canâ€˜t deal with it anymore.


I donâ€˜t know any other solution that death at this point. Iâ€˜m tired of myself, I will never get better. Iâ€˜m fooling myself if I say Iâ€˜ll be happy at some point because I wonâ€˜t. 


I am just so tired and iâ€˜m bawling my eyes out writing this, Iâ€˜m just so useless and stupid. Why canâ€˜t I be normal and different??? Why do I have to be me. I really want to give up
