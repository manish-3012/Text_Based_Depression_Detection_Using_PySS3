Painless exit, please?I can't go on living like this anymore. I just want the pain to end. Why did I have to be born with NF1 and Pectus Excavatum? What kind of god would let this happen? Everyday I live in fear of the possibility of my condition becoming a severe case. All I wanted was great health. I don't want to have these tumours and defects on my body. I already have zero self-esteem. I am a hypochondriac with a fear of doctors which makes it even worse. I have been depressed for a long time now and am literally friendless. I have no one in my life. The suffering wouldn't end. I prayed and prayed, but almost nothing is happening. I'm losing my sanity. I just want a fast, painless, exit. Or at least a better life without the disease crippling me.
