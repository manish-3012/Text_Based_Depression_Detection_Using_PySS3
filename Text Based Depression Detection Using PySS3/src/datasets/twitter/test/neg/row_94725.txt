I broke up with my boyfriend and now I want to die.I thought I would be okay with him doing drugs but turns out they ARE a deal-breaker for me, after an anxiety-induced weekend worrying about him and worrying about a future of drugs. I really really cared about this guy, and I broke his heart. He chose drugs over me but I feel like absolute shit for forcing him to make that decision, and now he won't respond to my texts or calls and I'm worried that he's gone off and done something harmful to himself. If he hurt himself I don't want to exist anymore--I'm tired of breaking hearts. Since it was a new long distance relationship I have no means of contacting his friends or family, so I have no idea if he's even alive or not and it's destroying me. I already know I won't be able to sleep tonight--I'm desperately waiting for at least a read receipt to show up on Facebook but I know it probably won't. I'm missing him already and even though I know I made the right choice to break up, it's killing me that I hurt him so badly and I don't know what to do. I'm trying not to feel guilty because it's honestly a situation out of my control, but I can't help hating myself for everything. I just want to die, too.
