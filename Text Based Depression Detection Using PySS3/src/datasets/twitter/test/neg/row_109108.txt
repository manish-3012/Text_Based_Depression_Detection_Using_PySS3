Do I admit myself or just kill myself?Last night I was set on going today to a walk-in clinic to get a new anti-depressant to try. I was going to give it a month to work.

I had a sleepless night and lost all motivation to do that. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried that enough times (Iâ€™ve tried six different anti-depressants. Itâ€™s hard to go because the doctors really donâ€™t seem to care or try to be helpful) and that my only options now are to admit myself to a psych ward or just finally kill myself. Iâ€™ve always felt like my depression was terminal and it was a matter of â€œwhenâ€ not â€œifâ€ I committed suicide. 

The only thing holding me back is my dad and sister (Iâ€™m married but my husband is fed up with dealing with me. I know my death would be a relief to him) but I feel like putting them through the stress about having to worry about me if I did admit myself is worse than just killing myself. At least death would be final. If I try to get help theyâ€™ll just worry that I will kill myself eventually (which I will) and that seems unfair. Better just to get it over with?
