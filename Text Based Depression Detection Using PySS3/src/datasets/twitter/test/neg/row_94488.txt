Does anyone else subconsciously internally glorify suicide when they are in physical pain?For a period of a few days that lasted two weeks ago, I found myself in serious, sudden physical pain that is now largely over. I wouldn't call it unbearable but it really sucked. At it's worse I would stay up for hours until I simply couldn't sleep anymore (thank GOD that the pain wasn't so bad I was unable to sleep).

But something happened that has happened to me before during periods of intense pain - internally, in my imagination/mind, I glorified suicide as an escape from the pain. I imagined just how damn nice it would be to painlessly end it all because then I could end the pain. I wanted so bad for it to be over that the idea became palatable to me on a subconscious level. Thank God I was consciously aware that it was a horrible idea; a permanent solution to what I knew would be a temporary problem.

And this phenomenon has happened to me before when I was in horrible pain.

I've considered becoming a gun owner in the past as I actually generally do support gun rights (in fact financial issues are the only reason I haven't yet), but these extreme, pain-induced mood swings makes me afraid of it because I can't be sure that I wouldn't have done something to myself if the pain was much worse. I think I'd just get some non-lethal defense options like pepper spray or a stun gun because I'm horrified that if another pain flare comes then I might lose self-control and end it all if I had a gun.

Now fortunately, I can promise that I am not actually suicidal - now that the pain is largely over I don't feel any of those thoughts anymore. But it really does concern me and I'd love to get an idea of how (ab)normal this is. Has something similar ever happened to you during bad flareups of pain? Where you subconsciously, involuntarily think of suicide as palatable and a relief from physical pain, even though you consciously know that you shouldn't do it?
