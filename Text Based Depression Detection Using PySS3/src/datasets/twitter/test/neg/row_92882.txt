I don't want to be here anymore.I wake up everyday to nothing.  I'm medicated. I have no friends or family left.  I go to work everyday to pay for an apartment I hate, because its all I can possibly afford. My schedule makes it impossible to do any kind of schooling to restart my career.  I work 10 hour shifts 5 days a week, 2 overnights, 2 3-11s and one random one I get to find about the week that schedule begins.  One missed check and I cant afford my apartment.  They provide raises only when the federal salary minimum requirements allow it.  Why am I afraid to die? I am so inconsequential. I am so worthless.  I just want to fall asleep and not wake up.
