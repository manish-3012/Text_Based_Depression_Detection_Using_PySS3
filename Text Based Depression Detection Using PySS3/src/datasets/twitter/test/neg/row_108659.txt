I feel like I'm definitely going to do it or go to a hospitalWhat happens if I go to a hospital for being suicidal? I have a job. Will I lose my job? What if I get put in a mental hospital? I don't know how to explain that to my boss so that I can keep my job even though I will have at least missed 3 days of work because of it.

Either I go to a hospital and say I feel suicidal, or I hurt myself and then go, or I just kill myself. 

I feel like everything is wrong tonight. I've called the suicide hotline 5 times today. Just to talk and then agree on a safety plan, but I don't feel safe. I can watch tv or take a walk or draw but I still feeling like taking all the medicine in this house and going away. 

I'm hearing voices, I got new meds for that and I think they're seriously fucking me up. Since I've started them I've felt like offing myself and I think I'm either gonna OD or cut badly enough to get stitches.

What do I do? If I'm not gonna die I don't want to lose my job! But I can't stay in my house alone all night I WILL hurt myself.
