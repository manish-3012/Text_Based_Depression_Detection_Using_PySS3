More than i can take.So, i just found out my girlfriend is pregnant with someone else's kid. He doesn't want it, she does.. and she also doesn't want a relationship with me. She wants to raise it on her own. What the fuck do i do? i just stopped in the middle of attempting to hang myself with handcuffs on. i had everything in place except the last cuff but i couldn't bring myself to finish, but i can't stop thinking about it. I just don't know what to do
