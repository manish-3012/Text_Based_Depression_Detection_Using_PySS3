My ex and I are both suicidalStarted dating February 2018. I attempted in October 2018. We broke up in October of this year. We still text, just because we have a safe place to share our suicidal thoughts. I can share things that arenâ€™t safe to tell anyone else. It hurts me to text him, but I know he wonâ€™t judge. Iâ€™m finding myself texting him just to make sure heâ€™s still alive. He said he probably wouldnâ€™t be here without me. I never thought out once perfect relationship would turn into this. This is never what I wanted. No matter how big a grudge I hold, I never want anyone Ive ever loved to feel the way I feel.
