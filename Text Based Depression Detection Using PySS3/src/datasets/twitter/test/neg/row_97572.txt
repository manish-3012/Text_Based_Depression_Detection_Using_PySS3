Reckless actionsI keep finding myself taking increasingly risky actions in the hope that it's taken out of my hands, I feel cowardly, why cant I just do it myself. It's been a long time coming. Had car crashes that I somehow walk away from fine (no one else was involved in the "accident" only me I wouldnt involve anyone else in this).

It's to the point I recognise I'm just trying to push everyone away just for the chance that there will be one less person that gets affected, it's to the point now where I have 2 friends and a family that are rapidly growing very tired of me, everyone else is gone already. 

All I know is, by hell or high water, I wont be seeing my next birthday. If the universe hasnt done it for me, I'm resolved to do it myself. Even got my preferred method picked out.
