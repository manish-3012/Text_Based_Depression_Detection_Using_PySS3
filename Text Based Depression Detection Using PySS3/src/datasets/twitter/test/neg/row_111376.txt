I know no one will probably read this, but I made a post on r/depression saying I'd kill myself tonight...still thinking of tying the noose but not there yetStill there's no one I can call...all my "friends" have helped me...I have unread messages on facebook - people who haven't spoken to me in a while asking me if I'm okay...not going to reply because I don't want to lie. Abusive mother after me and I don't know what to do...don't want to get better, not after trying so many years and failing...all I have is regret so I wish I had the courage to go, but it's probably not going to be tonight. All I can say is there's a lot of valium in my room and I'm thinking of doing it in my sleep. I just want it to be painless, that's the only way I can think to go.
