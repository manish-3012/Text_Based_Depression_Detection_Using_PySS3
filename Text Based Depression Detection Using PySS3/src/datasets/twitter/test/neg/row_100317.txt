i feel so guilty for wanting to die even if i know there are a lot of things to live fori've been struggling with depression for a long time, and i honestly never thought id make it this far (i thought i would die by 17 but i'm now 22). for a while now i thought i had my suicidal urges under control. my life used to be so shitty but recently its been getting a lot better. i was doing well in school, i started exercising, i have better relationships with my siblings, i made new friends, and i also have a boyfriend now who i love very much. then the pandemic hit and i'm stuck at home with my verbally and emotionally abusive parents, and the stress of school is really getting to me. i feel so burnt out and hollow, and some nights i cant sleep because i just think about how easy it would be to just give up and finally die. 

the thing is, i know there are a lot of things in my life that i love, things that i'm so thankful for having. i have a wonderful boyfriend and group of friends who try their best to support me and to cheer me up. i'm even thankful that my parents are paying for my school, despite everything else. this is why i feel so guilty for feeling this way. i wonder, does this mean that my feelings for them aren't as strong as i thought? do i not value these relationships that i have, these blessings in my life? am i just lying to myself? do i really care about these people if despite all their efforts, i still find it hard to keep trying? do i really appreciate the fact that they care about me and love me, or that my parents still support me financially?

i don't know what to do or how to feel, any advice on how to deal with these feelings would be appreciated.
