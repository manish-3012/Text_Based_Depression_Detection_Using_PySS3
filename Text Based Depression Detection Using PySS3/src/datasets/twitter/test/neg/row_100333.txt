Numb and nothing to live for so this might be a goodbyeIf there was a button to press that would instantly end your life, I wouldâ€™ve pressed it years ago. Iâ€™ve come to the realization that my life will never get better. I will never be the weight I want. I will never be off medication. I will never find someone who will love me for me. I will never have a father who didnâ€™t molest me. I will never have a mother who I donâ€™t have resentment towards. I never had a choice about my past, but I will make a choice for my future- and that is to not have one. 

Trying to come up with the best ways for it to happen. Shotgun would be too traumatic for those around me. Same with hanging. Debating carbon monoxide. My moms co-worker did this recently and it ended successfully. Any tips?
