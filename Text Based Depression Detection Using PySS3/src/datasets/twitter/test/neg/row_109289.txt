How can you tell if your friends love you if they never say it? Can somebody say it through their actions?I'm feeling really lonely and I need my friends to tell me that they love me to make me feel like it's worthwhile to keep on trying and moving forward. 

Do your friends say it? How do you tell if somebody loves you? 

One of my friends said it to me like a year ago but he wasn't sober and I'm afraid that something's changed/I've become a burden but I'll never know.
