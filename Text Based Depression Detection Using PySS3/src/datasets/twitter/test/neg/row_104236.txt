I don't want to dieIt's not that I don't want to die or anything, I just want out. I just have this feeling deep down of just sadness. I don't have a horrible life. I wasn't beaten and abused as a kid. I don't have any sort of tragedy except my parents' divorce and a couple deaths (my dog, my great aunt). I'm usually resilient with emotional things, but I can't shake this. It's just a deep angst with a melancholy feeling where I just want to sleep my life away. Anyone else experience this before?
