Wellness check needed to be done in BirminghamI currently live in the United States and my sister in law who lives in Birmingham can not be reached by phone. Packages have had to be sent to neighbors house due to no one answering door. She has been going some tough times lately. Does anyone know how to do a wellness check there or what can be done?
