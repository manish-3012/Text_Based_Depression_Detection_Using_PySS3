Sometimes I think the Buddhist monks did it correctly.I'm an extremely intelligent person, with an extreme interest in American politics. I feel a sense of clairvoyance when I look at the actions of politicians today and I know the real world consequences of their foolishness. It causes me unimaginable pain to see years and years of progress flushed down the toilet by our broken political system. I fear massive civil unrest in the future and maybe the rise of Neo-fascism in the US. Sometimes I just feel like setting myself on fire on the National Mall just to relieve myself of my sense of hopelessness and to protest the way our government is being run by both parties. It either that or pursuing a murderous campaign in the future against all those that I perceive as enemies of the State, but the truth is I don't want to kill anybody, I just want to alleviate my suffering. The only two options I see in front of me are either erasing myself or erasing those people I see as a threat to progress. To be clear, I'm only 19 and have no real power to execute anyone yet, but one day I fear that I will have that power and that I will use it. Sometimes I think it is just better to kill myself and be a cog in the political machine rather than live and be tortured by the world I perceive.
