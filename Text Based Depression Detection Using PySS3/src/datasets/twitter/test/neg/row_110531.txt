Experience with Celexa?**BIG AND BOLD SO EVERYONE SEES IT: I'm not asking for medical advice, only personal anecdotes and experiences.**

I'm on Celexa for anxiety.  I was on Paxil, but even at the lowest dosage it killed my sex drive completely and it still hasn't recovered.  But as shitty as the Paxil was, it *did* something.  I could come close to functioning as a normal human being, albeit one who could not get aroused no matter how hard I tried or wanted to and could not perform sexually at all.  

Celexa ... it doesn't feel like anything is happening.  It feels like I'm back on no medication, except I still can't perform sexually.  It's the worst of both worlds.  I'm panicking in the mornings, panicking during the day, losing my shit in front of my students and colleagues, getting reprimanded by everyone (students included), wanting to die or quit even more than ever (at this point I'd take either, except I can't quit so I would prefer a sudden and violent death all things considered), and on top of that I can't even perform for my wife, who already has to put up with so much shit from me as it is.  

If anyone else has even gone from Paxil to Celexa, about how long did it take for you to notice the Celexa taking effect, anecdotally?  Did you ever notice one?  How about the sex-drive-killing parts of Paxil?  Anyone go through that?  

Thanks.
