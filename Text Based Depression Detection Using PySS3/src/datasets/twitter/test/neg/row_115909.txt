itâ€™s my birthday and no one will respond to meno ones told my happy birthday, i invited the â€œfewâ€ friends i know to come over for some snacks and hang out; they never answered.

iâ€™ve been left on read.

iâ€™m alone

why do i bother always being nice to people and surprise them in their birthdays but no one ever wants to do the same.

no one ever treats you like you have treated them

maybe i am a piece of shit 

maybe i donâ€™t deserve anything nice

iâ€™m 26 and i no longer want to be alive

i want to be set free

i canâ€™t stop hurting...
