I'm going to try again. Please, SW, you may be my last hope.I've tried to kill myself 9 times, two of which I asked for help here. Last time, I was sent to a mental hospital for six days. While I was there, I found out my girlfriend had also tried at the same time(and failed). She was an outpatient while I was an inpatient. 

I got help there. I learned to cope. I was prescribed to depression, bipolar, and ADD medicine, which has improved me in leaps and bounds. But for the past month, I've been pissed off for no reason. I finally broke today, and formulated a plan for my next attempt.

In two hours I will take half of a bottle of Prozac. I will wait thirty minutes, then call the police. If they get me to a hospital in time, they win. If they don't, well, I guess I'll win.
