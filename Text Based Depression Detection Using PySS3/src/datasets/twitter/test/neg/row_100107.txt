I got very drunk and had an existential crisisI only drink a few times a year maybe 2-3 times... this night was one of those few times and I drank more than ever. About 8 shots worth of vodka. When we had all settled in for the night sleeping at my friends house, I slept on his couch, but I kept waking up at various times in the night. And at some point I was laying there in the dark and realized that I couldn't remember anything about myself. I cried. I realized that existence is a human construct and the fact that my entire being can be completely dismantled by a few beverages proved that. I already had depression before. But I kept going hoping to find some meaning. I know some people can be satisfied living their lives without meaning, but I can't. Nothing matters. It truly doesn't. I don't actually exist. So I don't see the point of going on anymore. I can't live knowing this everyday. It's too empty.
