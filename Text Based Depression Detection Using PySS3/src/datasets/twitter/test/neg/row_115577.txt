My sister tried to OD on her antidepressants for the second time in the space of 12 monthsWhat should I do? Is this more a cry for help than anything else? She wonâ€™t speak to me or my other family members about her problems. (I fear some situations in our family may be a contributing factor to her depression but Iâ€™m just surmising)

Itâ€™s clearly obvious the therapist sheâ€™s seeing  and the medication sheâ€™s taking is not working, I feel helpless and frustrated about the entire situation. What should I do?
