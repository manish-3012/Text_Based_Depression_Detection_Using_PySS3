So lonelyI'm a lonely 19 year old male who has no friends. I have two jobs (Starbucks, and GameStop) but no one at either job really ever wants to hang out with me which makes me think that I'm just unlikable. No one ever seems to like me or wanna be my friend I'm not sure if I've ever had a real friend. I just wanna end it all but don't know how yet...
