I dont knowI don't know what to do anymore. I feel static in my head and buzzing and it hurts. Everyone hates me and I'm hurt everyday by my brother. my brother said he'd wish I'd just kill myself and my step dad says depression isn't  a real thing.  I just want to end it all. I just cant handle it anymore. I hurt everyone and I just don't deserve the privilege of life.
