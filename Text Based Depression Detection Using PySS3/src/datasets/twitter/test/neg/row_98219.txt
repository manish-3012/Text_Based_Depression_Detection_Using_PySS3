I feel useless...All my life, my parents have been VERY overprotective of me. While I appreciate and love them for that, there should have been a limit to their overptotectiveness. I understand that they just wanted what's best for me, and that they must have been traumatized because my eldest sister died back then from health issues. I get it. But they raised me to be very dependent on them. I remember my mother wouldn't even let me hold a knife and cook for myself. Nor would she let me go outside on my own. I thought nothing of it when I was younger, but I'm now 24 and she still treats me like I am 4.

It's starting to affect me. I've become very dependent on them. I'm scared to go outside of my own, talking to people on the phone scares me. I get easily nervous. I can't drive and take myself to places I need to go because, like I said, going outside makes me nervous. It's just so hard, I feel helpless and I couldn't do anything on my own. What's worst is that my parents are disappointed in me for not being more independent now that I am older. I know they think I'm worthless. I can read between the lines. 

I started working at our family's company as a secretary and I just sat there at a table like an idiot. My mother expects me to already know what to do in the office even if I have absolutely zero experience. I asked her to train me but she doesn't. She expects me to go around asking people what I should do. I felt like an idiot just sitting there. Even now, she just gives me small tasks even a small child with basic computer knowledge could do. It's a part time job, I get it, but even the unpaid interns were given more work than me. I felt ashamed because there were people YOUNGER than me in that office who do more important work than what I do and I still get paid for it. They think I'm worthless. i am convinced I am worthless. i can't do anything right. I'm too dependent on them and it scares me. They can't live forever, my dad's 74 already damnit. It scares me that they'll leave me and I'll be nothing. This has been bothering me for a while now and I keep wishing I could just wake up dead. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but I am sure I will never actually do anything to hurt myself. But these thoughts just won't go away... If I tell my parents I am depressed, they'll just dismiss it as a tantrum. I cried in front of them back then, and told them about everything I felt like how helpless I am and how they keep treating me like a child. They played victim and said 'you can't get mad at us, we're old already!'. I don't know anymore.

I know there are people suffering more than me, but I just don't know where to go to at this point. No one could understand me. I am still very scared for my future and I always wish I could die before my parents.
