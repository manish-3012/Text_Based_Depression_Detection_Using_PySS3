Itâ€™s been a long eight years.Hi, Iâ€™m Michaela. I have diagnosed depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Currently taking meds for all three and theyâ€™ve been helping a ton. 

While Iâ€™ve had really good days, Iâ€™ve also had really bad days. Iâ€™m currently 17 days clean from self-harming. I have 200 cuts on my body that are slowly healing. 

But I havenâ€™t been feeling great lately. 

I started writing a suicide note on February 8th. Just to see what I would say to the people I love. Itâ€™s over 12 pages long so far. 

I canâ€™t get the thought out of my head anymore now that I started writing the note, telling them how I have been feeling. Itâ€™s been really hard to write and Iâ€™ve cried a lot. I mean, A LOT. 

I had the thought of where and how I was going to do it. I keep thinking about it. I donâ€™t the when. 

I want to finish the note, and give myself time to process what Iâ€™m feeling. Maybe once the note is finished, Iâ€™ll feel better. Writing has always been my favorite thing to do. The best way for me to get my feelings out. 

Hope everyone is having a good day. If you made it this far reading, thank you. I really appreciate it.
