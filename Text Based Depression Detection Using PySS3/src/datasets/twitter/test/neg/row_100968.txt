wish I'd never been bornThrowaway account I use for very, VERY few purposes.

I doubt I'm actually suicidal right now, but I don't particularly have any place left to post.

Should be easy to guess that I'm trans, and while browsing /r/transgender today, saw this link:

which linked back to this thread:

And all I can think about now all day is how absolutely useless my life is, since I'll never be attractive, and being trans, can't have kids, so the likelihood of **not** being single forever, is extremely low.

I know I have depression on some level, but anti-depressant medication (zoloft) didn't work when I tried it years ago, and neither did several months of CBT (cognitive behavior therapy.) Yes, I know therapy can take years to work, but at this point, I really don't see the point. (And I can't afford it either.)

I'm unimportant and unremarkable, arguably a genetic mistake (because I'm trans) and a guaranteed reproductive failure. And in addition to all of that, I failed out college a few years ago, I'm unemployed, and all my friends are systematically abandoning me.

So I'm perpetually alone too... and I'm a terribly weak person, and can't deal with being alone anymore.

And I just want it to be over now, I'm tired of waking up everyday know that I'll never just be **normal**.
