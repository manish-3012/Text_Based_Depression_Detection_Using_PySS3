Molested as a boy, suppressed my emotions all my life until now, just broke up with GF of a yearI recently â€œrememberedâ€ that I was molested as a young boy by three different male relatives, over the course of ~8 years. Sometimes my sister was involved. We never talked about it and I think she suppressed the memories as well. I think it subconsciously fucked me up throughout life as I constantly have drastic mood swings. Iâ€™ve had a GF of almost a year and was the first person I told about this, aswell as my frequent suicidal thoughts. and we argued so much but we loved eachother, or so I thought 

She went to a house party while I was in San Francisco with family the week of Christmas and I had this bad feeling in my gut so I told her I didnâ€™t want her to go and she promised me nothing would happen. I just saw a short video a few hours ago of her kissing another guy with his hand between her legs. Iâ€™ve been crying off and on ever since, started taking some pills but pussied out as usual. Seriously contemplating shooting myself with my uncles pistol tomorrow. Most likely Iâ€™ll pussy out again though

I just wanted to type this out,
