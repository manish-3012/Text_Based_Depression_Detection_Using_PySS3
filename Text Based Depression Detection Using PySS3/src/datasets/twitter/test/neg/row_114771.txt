I failed. Again.I failed my A levels. I reapplied, a different college gave me a second chance. And I'm failing again. The easiest exam I didn't understand half of it and ended up panicking and I didn't even write enough to get the marks to pass.

Failing the first time destroyed me. I had a second chance and I did it again. For american, this is high school. I'm going to be a highschool dropout. I'm that stupid.
