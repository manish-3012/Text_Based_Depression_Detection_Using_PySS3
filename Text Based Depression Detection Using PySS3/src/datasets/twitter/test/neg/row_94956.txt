Fired from my job, bills and no savings. Need someone to talk toMy life has been turbulent, last year I had a great relationship that ended after almost a year. It was my fault and I realize that now, there is no contact between us as it ended on bad terms but I still think of her everyday... itâ€™s what keeps me motivated, she told me things would get better and whether she meant it or not it gave me a sense of hope.

Yesterday my boss called and told me my employment was terminated. Someone at work overheard me and a coworker talking about hobbies (guns) on a break. Someone who wanted me out of the way called it in and set me up to be fired. It was made clear that no threats were ever made and I would never threaten anyone, I am not a violent person in the least bit. Itâ€™s a hobby Iâ€™ve always enjoyed and never thought it would end up destroying my career. I appealed it but I doubt Iâ€™ll ever hear back, all because one or two people wanted to advance themselves and X me out of the workplace and they succeeded in doing it. I was absolutely floored, how could this happen?.

I have no trust in anyone at this point. Not a soul. This taught me that you cannot trust a single person in life. I never wanted many friends to begin with and now I want fewer and fewer, I have zero trust in anyone. 

Iâ€™m just upset and feeling hopeless, I have been applying to places left and right but know I wonâ€™t hear back. I am not college educated and I am competing for jobs that require little skill, and the hundreds of others applying for those single openings. I donâ€™t know what to do, I just want someone to tell me everything will be okay and work out... but at the same time I donâ€™t believe things will be okay and I sitting on bills that my job would have paid, no savings and selling of my material possessions to keep the lights on. Iâ€™ve never felt so wronged before in my life.

I just wish I could talk to someone, anyone, and try and keep myself from feeling more down and out. I have no hope at this point, canâ€™t even stomach food without throwing up. Iâ€™m a wreck but I try my best to hide how much this has hurt me from others. I hope the people who did this to me face the same thing down the road and experience what itâ€™s like to be without money or food because of hearsay. Iâ€™m not religious but if god exists I hope he delivers them a lesson.
