Currently drunk, trying to come up with good reasons not to hang myselfSorry for the crappy user name, I didn't want this to be under my main in case I man up and execute. Bad karma to lead any investigation back here

Also plz forgive any typos I'm sort of drunk right now.

I am in my early thirties. Tried to kill myself in my teens (botched, internet info on drug lethality not as readily available back then) then again in my late twenties (also botched, tried a jump when someone was nearby; if I'd been thinking straight I would've waited till they left)

Had a lot of treament. Medication, multiple hospitaliztions, ECT. Tried to kill myself IN the hospital, chickened out because I felt bad about my roommate finding me (she was going through some tough times already). Still got caught at the end of the attempt and was stuck inside a stupid long time.

I don;t want to go back to hospital. It does no good. ECT is also terrible, lost several months of memory. 

Problem is I also don't want to live anymore. I tried changing jobs, moving different places, improving my lifestyle, but it's all crap. In the end the problem is me and I'm not changing. I've tried, because there are a lot of things about me I know need fixing, but I keep messing up. I have anger problems, very blunt, often upset people without meaning to. My anger is usually taken out on myself, never physically attacked anyone else, but I can definitely be verbally hrash even when I'm trying to be better. I cuss and drink and I'm blunt. Just not a nice person to be around.

I iused to self-harm but gave it up, got lots of tattoos to dissuade myself. I feel like even more of a failure for considering going back to it.

I'm in a relationship, but we argue a lot, I'm always causing problems. He finds it really hard to deal with my anger. I get it, anger is not acceptable like passivity or withdrawal or sadness. Unfortunately almost every negative emotion I feel comes out as anger (it's what I knew as a kid) and almost always at myself. I'm not in contact with my family (bad history) so he is the only person who is likely to be affected when I die. I've tried to make new friends since the last move, reach out to people with shared interests, even offered to help ppl move apartments. Sometimes it works, but I get rejected a lot. Maybe 15% sucess rate? I have to figure it's something in my personality. The few people who do seem to like me don't know anything about my history and I'm too ashsmed to ask them for help.

I have a good education (doctorate) and an alrightish job, so that's good, but - doesn't fix who I am and how much I mess up. Not enough to live for. 

I'm not sure antyhing is enough to live for when you slog through each day sick to death of yourself and your own bullshit. Things get a little better, but they always ALWAYS get worse again. The highs usually turn into paranoid, psychotic lows of their own. Even if they don't, they;re not worth it.

tl;dr (because I'm fucking boring myself) Right now I am sitting indoors, alone, trying to think of reasons not to go and hang myself in the garage.
So far I have come up with: it might go wrong.
Fortunately, I'm both reasonably sure I know what I'm doing by now and that it's worth the risk.

But I also know I've been here ebfore, I didn't die, and a few fun things happened in the better times. So I wanted to post in this sub and - actually I don't know. I feel like a huge attention seeker, really close to CTRL-A-DELing the lot. But maybe hearing from people who've been there too would help
