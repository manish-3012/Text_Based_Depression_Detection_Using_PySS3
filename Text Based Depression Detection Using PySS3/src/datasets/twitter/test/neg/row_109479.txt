so much painso, so much pain. so much hate in this house. everyone hates each other. everyone yells but no one listens. no one wants to be here anymore, but no one can leave. we all hate and resent each other so much. soul-crushing poverty wherever you look. i can't believe that a person is asked to live this way. pumped full of medications to keep living this way. told to shush and to pay for more to live this way. i won't live this way. goodbye.
