A very moving tale of despair and agony. (x-post from /r/psychology)I was surfing the web, as usual, and I found this story of a man name Clayton Atreus.  In his last days he wrote a fairly lengthly note (essay style) to be his final words.

Here is a message board where he last communicated with his followers (read pages 1-13):

And here is a link to his essay and final words (quite lengthly but very intelligent writing and heart wrenching):

I would like to hear a few opinions on Claytons absolute choice and the "moral" implications of his actions.

tl;dr : Man goes on epic bike trip for first time, ends up parapalegic in Mexico. Ends up commiting suicide a year later after he was pushed to the edge emotionally
