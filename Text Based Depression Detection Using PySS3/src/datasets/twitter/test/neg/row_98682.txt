i cant talk about itwe may not spend a lot of time together but the only people close to me are the ones who can help me feel better and i feel like.. if i were to tell them about.. it would kind of damage the relationship if that makes sense? not necessarily ruin it but hanging out with them would definitely be different and i dont wanna lose what we have but if this keeps going on i will lose it anyway
