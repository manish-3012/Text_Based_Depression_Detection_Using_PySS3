Losing someone physically is a better problem to move onto than losing someone you still see everydayI hope I was better, she changed for him because I made her change for me, but she found something in him she didn't find in me. So basically, I made my loved one change for our relationship to be better, but she brought my lessons to someone else she found something I didn't have.

Losing someone physically, like dying, is easier to cope up with because you know they'll never come back ever again, but losing someone you can still ses everyday, with memories day after day, you'll just get more and more depressed and suicidal, although this is life, more and more permanent damage are coming to me that people around me will feel the same thing if I'm just lost, and they'll know I'll never come back, they'll never hopr it up, unlike me, so I'm planning on killing myself.
