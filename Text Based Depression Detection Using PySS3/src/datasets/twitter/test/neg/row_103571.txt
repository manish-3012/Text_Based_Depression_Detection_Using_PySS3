I ran out of reasons to liveTo an outsider I have a ton of things to live for. I'm in law school and I have my 'whole life' ahead of me. Reality is I'm turning 28 next week and I have nothing. I have no family and no friends and a pile of mental health problems. I'm on medication #9 which is supposed to help me get better but really its just another collection of side effects. My anxiety makes me irritated by everything to the point where I can't even hang out with other humans without being annoyed. What is the point of living like this???

I'm sick of being here but I'm too scared to die to do anything about it. I'm tired of being a burden to everyone I know
