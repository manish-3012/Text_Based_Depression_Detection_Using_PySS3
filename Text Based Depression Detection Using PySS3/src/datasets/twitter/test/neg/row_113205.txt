I feel like my mind is fading at an extraordinarily high exponential rate.I already made two posts related to this issue, but I feel like it is getting worse. I mean no one, not even a single soul out there seems to take my issue serious. No matter who I talk to, itâ€™s always the same. My parents, my therapist, my teachers, my classmates, my friends. They all say that Iâ€™m fine. Theyâ€™re trying to tell me that Iâ€™m just as smart as I have been, but thatâ€™s not true I can feel it. My brain is just a ruin, with a few slowly decaying leftovers from the times where I could still easily do all the things that I now canâ€™t. I cant properly describe it in a way that makes sense, but you have to believe me. My former cognitive functions and capabilities are on their way to demise, I can feel my intelligence deteriorating. Itâ€™s a horrible feeling. I simply want to stop it, and reconstruct/recover/return my former brain. But since I know that this wonâ€™t be possible, death would be the only option left. I canâ€™t live with this condition and if I have to I will bring an end to this the hard/non-therapeutic/lethal way. I know doing so would hurt those who are close to me, but I canâ€™t take this any longer.
