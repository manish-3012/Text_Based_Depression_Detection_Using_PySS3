I can't even remember being happy\[16M\] I have been depressed for as long as i can remember. This isn't some sort of over exaggeration - I can remember thinking about hanging myself when i was about 2nd grade. I used to beleive everything would get better eventually, tried to change my life and failed every time and now I have really lost hope it will get better and even started to research on ways to kill myself in the last few months. I also used to beleive i would never reach the tipping point where my fear of death gets outweighed by my unwillingness to live, but I have reached the point and the only thing stopping me now is the unavailability of means by which to kill myself (A firearm or poison for example) . I also don't beleive anyone would be negatively impacted by my death. Quite the contrary actually, i beleive i would do most people a favour by ending my life - I have nothing and nobody to continue this suffering for. It feels counterintuitive not to commit suicide.
