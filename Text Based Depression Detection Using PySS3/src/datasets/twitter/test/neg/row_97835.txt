I want to kill myselfI've always had the thought in the back of my head but I think about it more and more often. I don't have a bad life but I am still not happy. I live in a comfortable home with people who love me but I am under extreme pressure to succeed. My parents are always pushing me to do better but I am happy with the grades I get now. This is my first year of high school and it is allot harder then middle school. I expected there to be a change but I was not ready. In middle school I could not study and get strait As but no I'm getting cs, While this is upsetting, it is even worse because my parents are on my back making me study hours every night and making sure I finish everything on time. I know they want the best for me but I'm fine with who I am. I also don't have many friends. This is a new school and almost all my friends from middle school went to a different school so I feel alone. I'm feel so deep in depression that I only eat 1 meal a day and most of the time I don't finish it. This isn't everything but I don't really know what else. I'm really depressed and the only thing that cheers me up is watching my fish swim in there tank but I am at school from 7 to 5:30. I don't know how to stop thinking about suicide.
