Why should I liveAs a kid I was sexually abused by a family member, that I still see. I have never told anybody about it.

My mom is a sociopathic manipulative pill popping alcoholic, that has made my entire life hell.
As a child my mom would leave us for months at a time without saying anything, she would forget me at school, and she would always get wasted.

When I was 13 years old I found her in a pool of blood (she tried to kill herself) and I had to save her.

My mom has tried to kill my dad, and she has been cheating on him for at least 19 years. Everybody knows my mom is a cheating whore, and it affects my life a lot, because I don't want to be associated with that.

My brother is also a sociopath, everything always revolves around him, and he gets away with everything. He has threatened to murder our entire family multiple times, he has stolen everything of value that we have, and broken the rest of it.

All the negative impact that my family has had on me has fucked me up. I am a shy introvert and I have a hard time making friends, never had a girlfriend, never kissed a girl, and I'm still a virgin. I had friends,  but due to my depression all of them have left me.

I have a best friend but she has been mostly ignoring me the last few months, and won't tell me why.

So essentially, I have no friends. All of my other family members have pushed my fucked up family away, so I never get to see them either. I only sit in my room the whole day and I never socialise with anybody.

I am 20 years old now, and I couldn't go to university, because it is too expensive.

I can't find a job, because nobody wants to hire somebody that doesn't have experience. Even if they would, the youth unemployment rate in my country is at 56%, so it's just about impossible to find a job.

I would love it so much to move out into ,my own place, but I don't have a job, and rent is way to expensive where I am at.

I've been on 3 types of antidepressants now, and a few weeks ago I decided to stop taking them, as they weren't helping anyway. I used to drink heavily as well whenever I could find alcohol.

I've tried suicide before, and sadly I didn't die.

I just don't fucking know what to do anymore. I'm trapped in this fucked up position where I don't have any friends anymore, I don't have family to depend on and I can't find a way to be independent.

I think I've lost all faith in God, and I really don't know what to do anymore. I've wished so many times that I wasn't born.

I don't even know why I'm posting this to a bunch of strangers online, because nobody gives a fuck in the end anyway..

I'm just going to kill myself. I just need the easiest most effective method
