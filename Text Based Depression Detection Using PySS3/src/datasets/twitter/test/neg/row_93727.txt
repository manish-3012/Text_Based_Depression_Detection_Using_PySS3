I don't even know anymoreHey guys and gals. Sorry to bother you here but I've been sitting here talking to myself for the past half hour and I thought maybe it would be better if I talked to a computer and didn't look totally insane. So...yeah. I've been thinking about killing myself a lot lately. I'm not really sure why but it seems that my life is falling apart a bit. I just ended a  year long relationship (it was mutual, we had been going on for too long with neither of us getting anything) and that in and of itself was pretty hard. I feel really stressed but at the same time unmotivated to resolve any of the problems that are stressing me out. I've returned to self harm recently and I don't even know why. It doesn't make me happy or sad, it just feels like nothing. I feel like I could drop off the earth and nobody would notice. And that's a stupid thought I know but I can't help it. I recently talked a friend out of suicide so I'm trying to keep an eye on him while at the same time feeling so guilty about my suicidal thoughts. Like, if I can't control myself, how can I help my friends? I've been having weird flashbacks to my sexual assault which isn't helping matters and sometimes I think I'm going crazy. I think I'm starting to hear voices in my head, but I know it's my own voice. I know it's my voice telling me to jump into the middle of the road or self harm or anything else really. And it's also my voice telling me that killing myself is a pretty stupid idea. I think I'm going insane and that's freaking me out and I don't know what to do. Seeking professional help isn't an option at the moment and God knows if anyone will see this. Sorry for taking up your time and sorry for rambling but hopefully posting this will help me feel a little bit better
