I'm not sure I'm strong enough to keep livingI just bought half a gram of heroin and about half a gram of coke, so I could do all the heroin at once and then all the coke and enjoy the feeling for an hour and then pass away.


I just dont know anymore, I don't think I'm strong enough to keep living. I tried to do the same three days ago, but a friend came over and I ended up just doing a regular speedball. Two days ago I was almost raped, I'm just so tired. The only thing that gets me up in the morning and the reason I'm still here is because I've been through so much worse. I've been trying to reach out to my friends, but its tiring on them and I understand that. I guess I'm writing here as a call for help because I don't know what to do. I was at the psych ward today, but they don't want to admit me because they're worried I'll be a chronic psych ward patient or something. Whats funny is that I feel so close to being a chronically dead instead. 


Please let me know if this violates any guidelines or rules here because thats not my intention.
