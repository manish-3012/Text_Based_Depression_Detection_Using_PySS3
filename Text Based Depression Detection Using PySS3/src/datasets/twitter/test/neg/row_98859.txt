Are you guaranteed to die if you jump off an overpass?https://www.google.com/maps/@38.3615735,-121.9692266,3a,75y,67.1h,93.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sDqbAKXiFVarDgMf4YhlkDQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DDqbAKXiFVarDgMf4YhlkDQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D392%26h%3D106%26yaw%3D81.93121%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656 right here is good example of an image. First off, is it possible to climb up one of those fences, and if so, if somebody were to jump off, is it GUARANTEED they'd die instantly?

Please help me. I'm new to Reddit (though I've been using it for games over the years) and no one answers these questions on Yahoo. Thanks.
