Iâ€™m Giving UpToday Iâ€™m giving up on my fight. My struggles in life. My health issues, my abusive parents, my never around brother, my hurtful boyfriend, my lack of freedom as an adult. I waited until I was 18 to move on from the toxicity with my parents. But itâ€™s never ending. I waited for some semblance of connection with someone. But they always end up hurting me. I donâ€™t have the strength anymore. I know if I stay life will always be this way. I canâ€™t run away from my parents- I have no where to go. I canâ€™t run away from my health issues- theyâ€™re stuck in me. I canâ€™t find connection- I feel like I have no one. I donâ€™t need anyone to tell me not to do it. I donâ€™t want any random reddit advice telling me â€œitâ€™s all going to be okay!â€ I donâ€™t need anyone stopping me. Iâ€™ve been a coward to do it for years. I just want peace during the last few moments I have on earth. Someone to tell me something supportive or pretty. Give me a good last few moments.


And if anyone finds this on my reddit- donâ€™t be stupid and share it. Youâ€™ll only be furthering the damage. You have no clue what my parents would court order my life into for the rest of it if they found this. And it wonâ€™t stop anything. Itâ€™ll just slow it down. Make it more miserable. Let me find peace.
