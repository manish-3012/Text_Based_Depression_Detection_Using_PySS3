I truly believe I am a person that cannot get better. So whatâ€™s the point?I have a pretty good life, but I canâ€™t stop wanting to die.

I have pretty much anything I could want. My boyfriend is lovely, I have friends, my family loves me, Iâ€™m an intelligent and successful university student, and I have the basic needs like food, shelter, etc. I canâ€™t find any reason to be feeling this way. It started in seventh grade, and itâ€™s only been getting worse.

I donâ€™t know how to stop thinking negatively. I can even see how irrational my thoughts and actions are, but I still canâ€™t stop believing them or doing them. Iâ€™m starting to negatively affect my relationship with my boyfriend, because every time he talks to me it turns into me talking about how badly I want to die and heâ€™s starting to be overwhelmed by it. Iâ€™m turning here in hopes of receiving some sort of help in order to prevent any lasting damage, because heâ€™s the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me. I donâ€™t want any more people to abandon me for being so fucking mentally sick.

To provide background, I have depression, anxiety, OCD and an eating disorder. Iâ€™ve been in therapy and on medication. Nothing works.

Please help.
