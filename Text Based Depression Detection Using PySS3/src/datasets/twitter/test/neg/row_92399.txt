Eternal Oblivion is Calling my Name. . .The last few nights, my sleep has been filled with dreams about a darkness that consumes everything. I know this place; it is oblivion. I don't believe in an afterlife, so my thoughts are fixated on the idea that once the trigger is pulled, that is it. No thoughts, no feeling, no consciousness, awareness. . . simply nothing. I won't even know that I am dead, so there is no fear, just like how there is no hope. We all die, so I might as well be in control of my own destiny and end it the way I want it to. Fair enough? I think so...
