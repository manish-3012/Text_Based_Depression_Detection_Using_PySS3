It's my fault she feels this way.I dated a girl for four years. We dated all through college. We both had issues with depression and anxiety. We broke up and got together about ten times. One day everything just snapped, and we broke it off. Since I'm not an emotionally stable person, we kept contact. 

Fast forward a few months and I started dating someone else. I told her I liked him and that I was going to go out with him. She just got in her car and was crying. I didn't know what to do. I figured the best thing to do was give her space. If I was going to start dating someone else I should probably distance myself from her. I texted her every day for a few weeks, but she never responded. I took this as a sign I should just leave her alone. Maybe she was trying to get over me?


I knew her tumblr and she kept posting suicidal and depressing things. I resisted contacting her because I thought that me being in her life while dating someone else would be too painful for both of us. 

A few months later and the guy I was dating had to move away. We broke it off, but still keep in contact. I guess at this point I should explain I don't have any other friends. I also don't have a job, and I'm done with school. I just sat at home for two weeks reading the things she posted on tumblr. I also just lost the person that I was dating and was really hurt. I know I shouldn't have done this, but I tried contacting her again. 

We hung out and she told me she still loved me, and would never stop loving me. She said the only time she's happy is when she's with me. She said I broke her and that I cheated on her for dating someone else. She said she already tried killing herself, and had been really depressed and I didn't even care because I was just with someone else. Every time we hung out she would suddenly get sad and say, "You held his hand here" or "you kissed him here." And she just kept saying how I left her. I told her if she couldn't handle what had happened then she shouldn't be around me, but she just kept insisting that I was the only thing that made her feel better. 


Then last night we were on the phone and she kept saying how I broke her and that I can't handle what I did to her. I dot defensive and said that how she responds to my decisions isn't my responsibility and that she needs to be in charge of herself. She just hung up. I called her like 30 times, but it just kept ringing. I texted her that I'd call the police if she didn't answer. I would have called her family but they hate me now. So I called 911 and got them to do a welfare check. 

I found out she's okay now. But now I don't know what to do. I shouldn't have even made contact with her again. But I can't change the past. I just have to figure out my course of action now. I feel like I can't just stop trying to contact her because last time I did that it was apparently the wrong thing. Since that's what made her spiral down in the first place. But I'm obviously just making everything worse. 

I still care about her. I really do, but there's a point when I have to worry about myself too..  
Anyway, I apologize for the long wall of text. I mostly just needed to vent. If you managed to read all of that, thank you. Any advice?
