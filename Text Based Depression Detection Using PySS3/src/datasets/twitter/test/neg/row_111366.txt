I don't know if I should keep going to workMy mom has stopped me from ending everything twice this week. I have to put up this fake bubbly personality at work and I don't know if I can do it at this point. I'm being called lazy by a couple of people and it's far from the truth. My meds are out of wack, and I have to have neurofeedback done soon to get some official diagnosis. I'm trying to set up an appointment with a trauma therapist as well. I just don't know what to do. I love the job, but I can't handle it at this point in life. I feel like a disappointment to my parents if I quit. I know they'll support my decision to quit but I still feel like I'm going to receive some sort of backlash as I just started this job 3 weeks ago. Applying for the job was a huge step for me considering my severe social anxiety. I don't know what to do.
