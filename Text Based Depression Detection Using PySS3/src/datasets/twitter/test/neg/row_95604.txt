embarrassed I'm still aliveI have a helium tank kit all set up. Tried putting the bag over my head and just got scared.

I am so embarrassed that I am still here, that I can let myself be treated how I've been and be turned into no one with nothing.

I wish I could just have one moment where I can cry and feel like ppl would care and die. 

I can't cry when i feel like ppl hate me or don't care
