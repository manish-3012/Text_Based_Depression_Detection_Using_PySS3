ThoughtsThe only reason why I'm still here is because of my family who loves me so much. I don't want them to be devastated. Being forced to live by my own emotions, and not wanting to hurt them by me leaving is just extremely painful. They think I'm happy and fine. And I don't want them to worry about me. I want them to be happy and not bother with my emotions. They are proud of me, and proud of my school. They think I will reach many good things in my life. I don't want to reach anything. I don't have the motivation to do practically anything in my life anymore. It feels pointless. It feels painful. But I cannot end it. As long as they are here, I will stay too. Besides them I don't have anyone. I don't talk to anyone and I'm locked in my own world, with my own emotions that just tear me apart right from the start of a new day. I'm lost, I'm depressed, I'm insecure, I'm weak. I just want to leave badly, but sadly I have emotions. I wish I could leave without anyone noticing. Like I have never existed.
