When people tell to forward to something all I see is death."Where do you see yourself in ten years?"

Dead

Fucking Dead.

I've tried so many times before. A few would have worked if it weren't for those meddling paramedics. 

If you want a tattoo when you are a kid they say,"wait until yours ten years older". Well it's been 14 years and I still want to die. 

In those fourteen dreadful years I've made countless attempts. My dad nearly did the job for me a few times, but he never finished it. Just left me bruised and swollen, sometimes bleeding, for next time he needed his precious little stress doll. If you rely on something, don't break it. Good lesson, not so good execution, literally... 

Here's another one liner I'm sure some of you can relate to,

"You deserve better."

Bullshit.

What have I done to deserve better than what I've gotten. All I've ever done was waste other people's time, money, and energy. Still doing it to this day. I'm a parasite. Sapping people of their well being. Eating away at all they have until it is mine. And when it is mine it's just gone. Unusable. Takes time for some people to learn that, but they always do and they always run. 

I do have a friend currently though. Guess where I met this poor chap. The mental ward. Ah yes one of my many suicide prevention methods. Not my chosen route, except that one time when I still had at least a small sliver of hope.  Why is it that people who don't care, or who don't like you, or just have nothing to do with you try to stop you from disappearing. Are they preventing my death just to spite me? So you have plenty of time to visit me in the hospital, and you said that you'd come up to see me, yet where the fuck are you? Not here that is. 

I tried to pass on to the unknown two days ago, but was stopped by my fellow mental patient friend who I now live with because I'd be on the streets in this glorious -3 degree Fahrenheit weather. Run-on.

I think he cares, maybe. I wouldn't put it past him if he didn't. I certainly don't fucking care. I look forward to death. Can't be screwed in the head if there is no head. 

I can't even afford to be better. I have 10+ prescription meds for my mental issues and I have no income and no money. It's only a matter of time before I'm off my meds again. When that happens I won't be posting here anymore.

Because I'll be dead.

Fucking dead.

Good night....
