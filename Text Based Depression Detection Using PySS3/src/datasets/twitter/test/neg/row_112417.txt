I don't know what to doI feel like I've been depressed as long as I can remember. I've occasionally had friends, but never consistently. People tell me I'm funny and good looking, but dating never seems to work out for me.  I feel like people don't want me around. Last year I had four hospital stays from suicide attempts and they were because I was feeling lonely. I've had years of therapy and having been trying different meds for years, but nothing has worked. I don't know what do at this point as nothing is getting better and everything is getting worse.
