giving away my things in preparationi realized i am the only person who can do this for me. broke up with my boyfriend but he didn't love me anyway, if i decide not to go through with it i'll probably get back together with him. my birthday is in 3 days and i'm thinking about doing this then. i've been talking myself down for years but there's only so much someone can take. i feel like i'm defying divine order by not committing suicide, because i know i need to do it but i'm scared. i'm so fucking selfish for staying alive so long at everyone's detriment.
