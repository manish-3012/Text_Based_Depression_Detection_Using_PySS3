I've finally started planning it. I dealt with extreme child neglect and abuse and domestic violence, as well as bullying. I am extremely depressed and anxious.

Senior year was good. That Summer I went on a cruise. Freshman year of college was okay. Went to the hospital second semester. Turned 19, and wasted that entire year away being sedentary, depressed, and anxious, although I did work and continue college. My only good memories were going to California. This summer has been nothing but depression and anxiety, and so has this semester.

I've turned 20. The clock's ticking. I'm an adult now. I'm not young. I wasted my last year as a teenager being depressed and anxious and now I'm wasting this year. And the next one will be wasted as well, and then the next, and the next, and before you know it I'm 27, 7 times worse than I am now. I'm already expected to do so much that I'm not doing, I can't imagine how I would feel in 10 years. When I was 17, I thought I was in hell. I was, but this hell burns more. And the heat will only go up. It does not get better. It only gets worse.

I can't take it anymore. I do not want to be here any longer. I'm going to commit suicide after my dad remarries, luckily that is before my 21st birthday. So I will still die relatively young. 

I fucking hate being alive. I don't want it anymore. I wasted everything. I don't want to get older. I waste every second, and the passing of time hurts.
