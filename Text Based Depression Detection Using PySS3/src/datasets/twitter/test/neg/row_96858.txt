I'm doneI don't care whether anyone sees this or not, I just want to vent. As the title suggests I'm done. 

My mum has just tipped me other the edge by saying she doesn't want my mothers days presents and praising my oh so perfect sister for her lovely better handmade presents.

Life has been shit lately, doing absolutely awful in my a levels, people at college think I'm a weird loser, spoiler i am. 

I'm sick of planing another person's life. Like hell I'm going to do well at uni. Like parents will want someone as mentally unstable as me teaching their kids.

To summarise, anyone who has kindly read through this crap. Be happy for me that tonight i will end the life that should have never have existed. 

Well at least I'm an organ donor, here someone else please take my life. I don't want it anymore.
