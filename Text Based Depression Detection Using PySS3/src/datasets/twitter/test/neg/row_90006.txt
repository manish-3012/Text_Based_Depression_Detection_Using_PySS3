Just why?Basic story of my life: my childhood sucked, but it got gradualy better through the years. Currently, Im the last yeah of High school. I used to have no friends, and always wanted to die because of that, but I didn't. Eventually, I managed to get some true friends, stll, my wanting to die continued. I don't want to tell my hole life here, but basically, it doesn't matter my situation, Im always sad and unhappy.
Still, I haven't kill myself and don't plan to, purely because of my family, they don't deserve the pain
If everyone has the right to live, why don't we have the right not to live? People like me and others are always sad and would rest in peace, but we can't do it because others will suffer. Why suicide is not socially accepted?
Like I said, I wouldn't kill myself, but if I got something like cancer, I wouldn't be sad, it would be my gift to rest in peace. Alternatively, if my whole family died in a accident (I do not want this), there would be nothing stopping me from doing it....
