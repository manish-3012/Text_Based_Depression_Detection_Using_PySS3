So I guess this is rock bottom.Over that past few months Iâ€™ve managed to fuck up every friendship and relationship Iâ€™ve ever had. 

My cousin and best friend was the only person I could rely on for comfort and some release from this shitty reality, and he wants nothing to do with me. Wonâ€™t respond to any of my texts and the last thing he told me was how much of a loser piece of shit I am.

Iâ€™m starting to grow apart from my family, seems like none of them even really want me around anymore. Iâ€™ve got no-one in my life to turn to, Reddit has become my escape.

I recently mustered up the courage to ask out the girl Iâ€™ve liked for a long time, after she had led me on for a while, and got immediately rejected. I freaked out and told her I never wanted to see her again. Yet sheâ€™s still friends with my sister, so no help there with the relationship between my sister and I.

Iâ€™ve also recently decided to get a chin implant because Iâ€™ve always HATED my chin/jaw. Itâ€™s been 1.5 months since then and I fucking hate it. I look terrible and Iâ€™m scared it will never be how I hoped for it to look.

I have no motivation to do or try anything. I feel stagnant. I feel hopeless and quite frankly suicidal and done with life. If youâ€™ve made it this far I appreciate you taking the time to read about my current shitty situation and I hope this shows that if you feel like youâ€™ve hit rock bottom, you can know that thereâ€™s someone else out there who feels the exact same way you do. Someone who feels just as hopeless, lost, and too far gone as you do.
