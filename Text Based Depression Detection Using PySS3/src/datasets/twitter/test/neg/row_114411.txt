Could someone try to explain this to me...I feel like most of my emotions are very... suppressed. I felt depressed, angry, and sad, but as depressed as I possibly felt, I felt like it wasn't nearly as severe as other people's feelings. I am a pretty apathetic person. I have a hard time concentrating and focusing on things, if that means anything.
