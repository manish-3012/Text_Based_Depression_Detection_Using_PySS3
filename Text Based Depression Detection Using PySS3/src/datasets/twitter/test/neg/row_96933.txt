Im conflictedIâ€™m too lazy to actually kill myself, so itâ€™d be really nice if like a truck or something was to run a red light while I was on the crosswalk, you know in an oh so unfortunate accident. Iâ€™m in so much pain but I have no doubt in mind it would crush my friends, girlfriend, and family
