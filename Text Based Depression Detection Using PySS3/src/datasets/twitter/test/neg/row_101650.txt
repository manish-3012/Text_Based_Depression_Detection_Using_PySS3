My only happy thoughts are of dyingThe past twelve months have been pretty bad for me and it is time to end it. For the curious, here are some details.

I was in a relatively long relationship that ended a little over as month ago. Throughout all of last year, we were both unhappy. I felt taken advantage of and resented her for it. Near the end, I could tell that something was up and she started dating someone else. Her life is wonderful now.

I tried dating again, only to realize that I have no social skills and I am a very awkward person. I try to act like I can be social, but they see right through that.

Early last year, my job wasn't going well, so I switched to a different company. The new job is wonderful for showing me how much my work skills are lacking. I have very few good days at the current job and usually wonder why I haven't been fired.

I'm sure these sound trivial, but I now see no reason to continue. Why stay around just to see what a failure I am and feel completely alone?
