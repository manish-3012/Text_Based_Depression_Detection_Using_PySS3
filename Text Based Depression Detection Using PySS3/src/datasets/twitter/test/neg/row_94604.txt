My brother just saved my life and he has no ideaPill bottles in my lap, Googling to make sure I have enough to overdose because last time I just put myself in a coma and ruined my brain. I am not leaving a note this time, at least for my family. I am not doing it at my house,  I plan to drive far enough from the city but not so far it's a pain for my husband to retrieve his truck. I have my passport and ID with me and a note to lay on the dash that reads "check my ID and Passport, please don't make my family identify my body."

Phone rings, it's my brother. He usually only calls to ask a favor so fuck it, let's see what he wants. 

M- "Hey bro"
H- "Hey sis"
M- "what's up?"
H- "idk, you tell me... what's up?"
M-  *thinking my husband called him because we got into a huge argument* "why are you talking to me like a child?"
H- "I'm sorry, I called just to talk but it sounds like you aren't up for it. I'll leave you alone."
M- "No, No, I'm sorry. I'm just having a bad day, what's up?

*we talk for about 15 minutes, he talks about the kids, his fiancee who's dealing with mental health issues... we just talk about life. Without realizing it I have put the pills back and began snapping back into reality. My kids, my husband, my Dad, my brother and sisters. I would be leaving so many hearts broken in my wake. In the moment it didn't feel that way. In the moment I couldn't stand the thought of existing any longer. I could not bear the weight of my own mind battling to kill me. In the moment, the only logical way to stop this blackness was to sink into it. Let it consume every bit of me until I was dust once more.  A phone call, about nothing in particular helped pass that moment. I expressed to my brother that I was not doing well, something I couldn't hide in the sound of my voice. He asked if I wanted to talk about it, I declined. He told me he understood not wanting to talk about it but that he had seen the notes of positivity posted all over my room and told me he was proud of me for trying. Proud of me for not just letting it take over. (I have been struggling with my mental health since my Mother took her life when I was 10) Then, he just started talking. We decided he was going to make a frozen dinner for his family because he was too exhausted to cook, we talked about how my Dad is sick and can barely talk, we just talked about the little things in life. 

It saved my life,  the only people to know this will be you and I. Hopefully, one of you may call friend or a sibling just to say hello for once. Maybe you will read this and find you are not alone. Maybe it will mean nothing at all to you. For me, it means the rest of my life that otherwise would have ended today.
