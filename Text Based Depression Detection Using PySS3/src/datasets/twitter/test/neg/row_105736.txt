Tbh, i don't think it does get better.I've lurked on reddit for a while now, often looking through these threads when i hit a low point to bring myself back. And yeah, I'll admit that it really has helped me once or twice - probably even saved my life. But I'm tired, tired of the same cliched comments and all the samey advice that gets flung around. There really just *isnt any point* to my fucking life. No siblings, no surviving parents, no loved ones to leave behind or hurt. The career I chose was an excruciatingly boring one, and so I have handed my notice in. 

The weird thing is, I'm not feeling like I'm at a low point at the moment. I actually feel really bloody good. Better than I have in years, in fact, just knowing that my swift departure from this world will have almost no negative effect. I mean, I barley even have an internet presence for God's sake - I am but a reddit lurker. 

So I say to you all, "Cheers". Can't exactly say I've enjoyed my time here, although I am going to endeavour to make this last day an enjoyable one. Maybe I'll have one last pint. Goodluck everybody, I hope you all can find some purpose in life.
