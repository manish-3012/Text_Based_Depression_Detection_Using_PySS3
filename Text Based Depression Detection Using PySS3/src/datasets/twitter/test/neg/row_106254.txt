I will always be miserableSometimes I feel like I can make my life better and be happy. Then I remember some people who were successful in life but still committed suicide. Robin Williams, Chester Bennington, Kate Spade, etc. They were loved by millions of people. They were very successful in life. They had a lot of money. But they were still not happy for some reason and decided to take their own lives. The way I see it, I will never be happy. If I don't kill myself now, I will probably kill myself later. If I don't kill myself, I will still die anyway. Why be miserable for decades just waiting for death?
