What lessened the blow for you?Game's over, everyone. It's time.

I just have one thing to ask: For those of you who have lost a loved one, what was the most helpful thing in the aftermath/that the person who died did? This is going to happen no matter what and I just want to make this the least bad situation it can be for those left behind. 

Is a note better than no note? What content is helpful/unhelpful? Are there any comforting and meaningful gestures?

I'm not here to argue about living or dying. I'll ignore all posts trying to talk me out of it or whatever. I just genuinely want to know what the best things to do are to make the trauma perhaps a little less so.
