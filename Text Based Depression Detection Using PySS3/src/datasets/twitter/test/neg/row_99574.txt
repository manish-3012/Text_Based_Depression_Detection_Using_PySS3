Stay away from drugs, kidsI'm an ex-addict (heroin), and I've spent a few years dealing with the associated problems: self-hatred, depression, debt, loneliness, and of course drug cravings, and it's becoming too much to bear. None of these problems are likely to go away any time soon and it's 100% my own fault. I keep thinking about how different things would be if only I hadn't started using. 

I've always had depressive tendencies and suicidal thoughts but recently I've been experiencing scarily intense urges to act and thinking of specific ways to die, as well as the usual a low-level 'I'd be OK with dying'. I've been referred to a psychologist by my GP but it will be a few weeks before I hear anything.

I'm not really sure what response I'm looking for, but with no real friends to speak of, reddit is my only real outlet besides my husband and he has plenty of his own shit to deal with (he also has problems with addiction and trying his best to quit, but it's not going to happen overnight) so I'm trying not to lean on him too much. Talking to my family isn't really an option: they don't know the full extent of my problems and it's hard to admit how badly I've screwed my life up.

I am slightly apprehensive about posting this but I am really struggling. Can anyone relate?
