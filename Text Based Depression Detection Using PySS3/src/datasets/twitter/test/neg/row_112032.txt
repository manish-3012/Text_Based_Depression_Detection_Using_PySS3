i feel like i don't matteri have been extremely depressed since i was in 6th grade, i'm 22 now. i thought i had finally found happiness, this is going to sound cheesy but i lost her. and she wouldn't even give me a chance? i havent had many friends in my life, but she was my absolute best friend of my life and ...my gf... and now she hates me seemingly for no reason, blocked me on all social media, blocked my phone number, my mom already hates me and ive had to move around so many times because she keeps kicking me out for no reason, and i honestly mean for no reason when i say all this, i never lie or steal or do anything horribly wrong. The girl and i had a few arguments over SMALL THINGS!! And she said she completely lost admiration for me and dropped me like i was nothing.. like our 2 year long relationship meant absolutely nothing to her.. years of friendship gone like its nothing.. I dont have any friends now, i dont ever want to have kids (im gay a nyway..), my family hates me, i dont see any purpose in me living. there is no light at the end of the tunnel, i dont care if thats cliche, i dont care about anything anymore, i dont want to exist anymore. no one wants me around anyway and im worthless human garbage to everyone. i know people tell me i should just move on from her but before her i already wanted to die and she just made me forget that for a while... i dont know. i dont know what to say. im tired of living. my peers ignore me when i try to talk to them (im in cosmetology school, very close to graduating, but i feel no excitement or joy or anything. once i graduate it will be more of the same, more of my life, more misery. I dont know. im really vulnerable right now and i just had to say all of this to someone i dont care if it seems whiney or like rambling. im so close to giving up
