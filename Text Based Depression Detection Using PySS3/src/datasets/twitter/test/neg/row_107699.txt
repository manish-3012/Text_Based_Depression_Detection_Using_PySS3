It's been almost two years since I had a genuine friend.And even that only lasted a few months.

I have nobody to talk to right now and even if I did somehow meet someone they wouldn't be someone who's been around and known me for a long time.

The only other thing approaching a close friend turned out to be a catfish. I didn't even care but then she ghosted anyway.

I recently met two women I thought I'd hit it off with but they both blocked me immediately. I have no idea why.
