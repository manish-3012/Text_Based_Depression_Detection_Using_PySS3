I don't know what to do.I've been just looking up depression crap for the past couple of hours and I think that it is making it worse. My two finals are on Monday and Tuesday, and I know that no matter what I get on either of them I am going to fail. I literally quit my job this semester just to make sure that I pass these two classes, yet I still fucked up and failed. This will be the second time I've failed a class twice and have had to take it a third time, and I've retaken to many classes already. I've been in college for nearly 4 years now and have not made any progress. Suicide is constantly at the edge of my mind no matter what I'm doing, and I know that if I go to my parents for help it will probably make me commit suicide faster. I'm thousands of dollars in debt and can't afford to go further into debt.

I also feel as if I'm just making up these suicidal thoughts as an excuse to not get yelled at by family and friends for fucking up this badly.
