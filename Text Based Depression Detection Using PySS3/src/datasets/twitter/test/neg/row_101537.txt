I want to kill myself. Please help.I'm 21 years old. I can't stop looking for tall buildings in my area that I want to potentially jump from.  

I would say my suicidal thoughts are rooted in two things: my constant disappointments with my grades in school and my ex-girlfriend.  

I'm a computer science student but whenever I try to study programming, I often don't understand something and it just eats me alive. When I look at the assignments I have to complete, I just feel overwhelmed and hopeless looking at them. I had to drop a Calculus class which was just another added disappointment. Even more, since I dropped it, I have more idle time which means more suicidal thoughts.

I broke up with my girlfriend more than a year ago. She has a new boyfriend and it kills me to see pictures of them together. I do my best to avoid her social media but I can't help but bring myself to it. Knowing she doesn't give two shits about me anymore makes me feel worthless and I ruminate all day with thoughts of her. I know there are other fish in the sea, but I can't see myself meeting someone new in the near future which is also very depressing.  

I've been on several different medications. Prozac, Wellbutrin, and more recently I was prescribed Lexapro a few days ago. I'm not very hopeful with antidepressants anymore but I have a little bit of hope for Lexapro.  

I have no motivation. No desire to see what will happen in the future. My life is just full of disappointments, one after another. Ever since I was young (elementary/junior hs) I always just feel as though I've always been a sad person. I'm fearful that my time is running out. Help.
