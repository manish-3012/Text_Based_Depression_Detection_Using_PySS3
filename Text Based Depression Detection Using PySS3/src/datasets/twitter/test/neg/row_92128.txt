just a ig goddamn rant with a need for helpsince i already posted something on r/depression i am going to make this short

i have been framed repeatedly by my brother and now i have the threat of being arrested for taking food? like seriously? what the fuck!

i know our budget is low

 and we just divorced and also spent 10k+ on court case to put an end to our abusive dad but since when did it occur to him (brother) that framing me for stuff is a good idea?

like, he will eat sweets and foods that he knows i like then act like lil' sweet ol' sugarplum kid and yes this sounds stupid but as a 16 yo junior in high school with my chance at college and/or any normal life not relying on welfare on thin ice WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!?! 

and to make matters worse my mother eats up every word! and my littler brother just backs him up because guess what...i am the only biological and white boy in our family. coincidence?  i don't fucking know

i just want it to end and maybe i don't know i can borrow my dad's revolver or something 

i had one shot at life and now it's fucked up because of a selfish, narcissistic, FUCKALL! THAT SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE MAKING SURE HE WAS ON GODDAMN TOP

and THE ONE TIME I SHOW HIM THAT I DON'T TAKE SHIT IS WHEN HE FUCKING MAKES SURE THE ENTIRE GODDAMN SCHOOL KNOWS THAT I'M A PUSSY

even if i show my face to the school again now people only recognize me as "the kid that got beat up by his brother" and if that is bad  try having **fake friends** people who act like you are their friend but BAM! "fuck off cocksucker you aren't black so you can't be part of our group anymore" (end quote) 

and as i write this i fear for my goddamn life! i am horrified as to what is gong to happen so i ask you guys for help i feel like i'm losing control of my life and i can't control my own choices anymore!

don't worry i won't make any plans until i get some feedback it might be nice to get some help and maybe save my goddamn life.
