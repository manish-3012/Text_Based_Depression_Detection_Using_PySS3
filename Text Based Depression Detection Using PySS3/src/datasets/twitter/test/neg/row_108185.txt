Losing faithPeople around me has started losing faith in me. I want to keep on living, but i can't live and socialize with other people. People who used to be nice to me slowing distancing themselves from me. I loved myself and i believe that better days will come, but i keep crying myself everyday, even in a public. Sometimes, i feel the only right decision for me is suicide, not for myself but for people around me.
