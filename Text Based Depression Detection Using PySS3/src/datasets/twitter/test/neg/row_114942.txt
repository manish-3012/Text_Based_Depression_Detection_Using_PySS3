I might be done...I don't want this anymore. I'm sick of living in a superficial contentment created by pills, they're making me lose myself... not just one type, but every single time it's been changed, it's been the same. If I can't live my life happily as me then what's the point? That doesn't work though, when I'm off them I'm a fucking volatile mess. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm supposed to graduate this year... guess what? That may not happen. I can't find a job, I won't be able to get into college, and after this year I wouldn't even know where I would live... I have absolutely no talents or positive traits, I'm an absolute shit-hole to the people around me because I can't force myself to care anymore. Nothing seems to make a difference, no one seems to matter... I have zero ambition. Like I said, I've lost my sense of self, who I was, who I was going to be... 

I've tried talking to certain friends but that's not working... My guardians found out I cut, and I got yelled at and punished for it, they don't want anything to do with anything like that and when I tried reaching out for help they reacted the same way. I've tried therapy but I got nothing out of it so I stopped going (after the first few days we would just sit there in silence for the hour because there was nothing to say).

It feels so selfish when they say "You'll be hurting the people that care about you", why should I have to put up with this shit just so someone else can continue to live an enjoyable life that I only play an extremely small role in? What about what I'm feeling for once? 

I tried this morning... I could only get a bb gun but I had it to my head and if it didn't kill me I was going to use the pain as a drive to OD on morphine... I was shaking so bad that I missed though and after that I didn't have the nerve to try again... I'll get it back though, maybe I won't be such a fucking clutz next time...

I don't exactly want to talk to someone, I just really needed to get this out there...
