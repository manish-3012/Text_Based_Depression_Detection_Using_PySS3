Suicide out of necessityI consider suicide because if Iâ€™m alive I will have to work and I donâ€™t want to work because it is depressing and it feels like slavery. It makes me feel trapped and exhausted in every possible way. I love myself too much to put myself through that. Itâ€™s out of compassion for myself and necessity that I think itâ€™s better not to exist. 

All jobs are a no go and Iâ€™d definitely end up killing myself if I had one. 

There is the benefits route to consider in the UK, but its a huge hassle and it would hardly cover my expenses. 

Iâ€™m antinatalist and I think the least my parents should do is pay for my life since itâ€™s because of them that Iâ€™m here and I would have chosen not to be had I had the option. But they â€œcant affordâ€ to, so Iâ€™m sort of out of options once my savings go. How depressing!

Anyone else considering suicide out of necessity/practicality?
