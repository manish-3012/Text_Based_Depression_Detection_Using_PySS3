The thought of suicide has never been so clear til nowSomething today happened, I can't understand when or what but something made me think deeper and made me cry 2 glasses of tears, the only thing that separates me from the noose is that my parents and maybe my brother too or my friends I dont know actually, I think they will feel really sad but although they just need to get over it, it isn't that hard when it comes to someone's death imo, maybe it is because im jealous of all those people who die, but I can't get over something more stupid like idk sorry if you're reading all these messed up words that don't really makes sense it is like a foggy message sorry you probably wasted your time honestly, so I dont even know why I posted it, maybe a part of me wants me to stay alive and that part is looking for help somewhere, so yeah I guess, I feel like my brain is playing chess against himself and if he lose I die if he wins I'll continue living hope you understand what I mean, today it should have been a good day but I felt a little meh and from the meh I went to the sigh sigh I guess I'll end the post now.
