how do I tell my family it's not their fault?I have a loving family, both parents and an older sister. Still I feel like i don't belong with them, I don' belong here, I'll never succeed in life. I blame the fact that I've always been trying to be like my sister, even though nobody ever expected me to be. They just wanted me to be the person I am, that's a simple task and I failed miserably. If I kill myself my family will most likely think it's their fault but it's not.
