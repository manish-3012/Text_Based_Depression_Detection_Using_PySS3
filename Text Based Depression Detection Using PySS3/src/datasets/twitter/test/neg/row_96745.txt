My life is a mistakeMy parents and grandparents almost lost their job for my birth, and thatâ€™s why they abuse me in a really tricky way......punch me in public, slap on my face, and tell everyone Iâ€™m mentally handicapped. I have to prove Iâ€™m worth living, and I donâ€™t want to do that anymore. Thinking about a practical suicidal plan.
