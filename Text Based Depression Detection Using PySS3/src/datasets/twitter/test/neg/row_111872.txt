My life is about over.I cant  even describe what has happened because it hurts too much, but the bottom line is that I have no future. Maybe once I did, but not anymore. I really donâ€™t want to die, the world can be so beautiful, but I cant live like this. 

I just wish someone loved mefor who I am, but nobody does. I will never be who I wanted to be, that was taken away from me long before I even knew who it was. I never had any choices. I need more than anyone can give. Iâ€™m exhausted. I cant stop crying. To quote, â€œI donâ€™t know how to live in a world where these are the choices, where everything gets stripped away.â€ I canâ€™t even watch the news wthout wanting to die.

Idek why I am bothering to post this. I guess I just donâ€™t have anyone left  who can hear me, who I trust to hear this. 

You probably wont hear from me again, but thank you for listening. Thank you.
