I'm thinking about ending it but when I'm ready, I doubt I'll post here.Its just really irritating to see so many posts that say "this is it" or "Its' all over for me" etc. Look I get it, suicide attempts are a cry for help... sometimes. For everyone that this is the case I got your back. Do not attempt suicide if you're not ready but also don't be whiny. I don't have the necessary materials for my self deliverance (I'm working on it) but when I do I'm not going to post a 'save me now post'. If anything I'm going to post a goodbye post. Look I'm not trying to be a jerk but for someone who is not only contemplating suicide but actually taking steps to end their life quickly and painlessly I find it a little insulting. 

That is all.
