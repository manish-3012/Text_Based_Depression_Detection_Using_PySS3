I can't stand thisI don't want to live
I have reasons that I typed up, it was long as fuck frankly, but through some kind of keyboard glitch (bad usb port) it all got deleted and I don't even remember what I said

I don't want to be coerced into being okay with living
It's all just slavery from the ground up
We probably died before and this is hell, the good shit only exists to tempt you into staying, carrot and stick

I need advice on one specific thing
I don't understand why people think suicide is wrong, or bad. There is one thing holding me back (well, two things, but one is an inevitability though I fear it). It would hurt someone who I love a lot. I don't understand it. From my perspective, it seems as if I'm forced into existing, then when I take initiative to leave, they are forced into feeling pain because of it. Everything is fucking forced. See what I'm saying? We're all fucking slaves. I don't know how to change this but it's the only way because one day I'm going to snap and just do it anyway, and that would be very, very wrong. It's going to happen. How can I make someone else not hurt because of it? I don't get it, they should be happy that I'm doing what I want and that I'm free from a life I will never understand. But grief is such a deep, visceral thing. It's just the fucking cherry on top. Entering hurts, exiting hurts. It all fucking hurts. I don't want to leave some abyssal void behind me but I feel like I AM one already, and if I were to force myself to not be one then I'd just be going along with the coercion because it is not who I am (which was never my choice anyway!).

What do?
This honestly might be the wrong place but there's never anywhere anymore where you can have a serious discussion about this shit. It's all -controlled- like everything else.
