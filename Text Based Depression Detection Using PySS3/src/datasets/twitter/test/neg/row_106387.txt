Crisischat.orgI work as a crisis chat counselor on crisischat.org. It's a new organization that typically works out of already established crisis call centers. Currently, there are 5 crisis/suicide hotline call centers through the US who have added crisischat into their facilities and more coming online soon.  All of the volunteers working on crisischat go through the same training as phone counselors, and then some. I worked as a crisis phone counselor for over a year before I trained for crisischat and I've been working here for over a year.  

It is completely confidential and there is no way we could track you down through your computer -this is a common misconception.



Things you should know before you log on: 

1) This is a very new movement and is functioning well above capacity. Since counselors are only on one chat at a time, people often have to try back later. Please don't be discouraged! Try back later, or if you need to talk to someone right then you can call the national suicide hotline at 1-800-273-TALK. 

2) When you log on and talk to a counselor, they are devoting their entire attention to you! Counselors are only on one chat at a time and there are always people we are unable to help due to capacity issues, so please no multitasking! 

3) Using cellphones, Ipads, etc often leads to connection issues. If possible, please use a laptop or computer.

I'll try to answer any questions if I can.
