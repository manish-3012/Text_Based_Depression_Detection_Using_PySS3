Feeling extremely suicidal for the first time in a yearIâ€™ve just moved to uni. My parents left about an hour ago. They had a huge argument and my dad threatened to kill my mum. Now im scared for her safety and feel guilty about leaving her with him. I also saw the new place I was working and its so depressing. Everyones at least 30 years older than me and they all look miserable. I dont have the energy to say hi to my flat mates after all the arguments today. Im so lonely already and Ive been here for 2 days, i already want to drop out.

I feel like just fucking ending it all right her right now. I want to go home, take care of my mum, be with my family and work at my old store with people my age who I considered close friends. I really think uni is going to take a toll on my mental health and if its this bad on day 2 i dont think iâ€™ll be here for long
