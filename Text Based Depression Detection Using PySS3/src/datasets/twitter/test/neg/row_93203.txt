I used to have passive suicidal thoughts in the winter; now it's happening year round.Prior to moving to Maine, my bp 2 was well-controlled with medication. The harsh winters here, though, with the problems they bring (in particular, high heating costs, snow removal, and every senior's worst nightmare: slips and falls on ice), have caused me to go into a tailspin as soon as temperatures start to fall.

My mood swings were aggravated by the fact that life here has been, for the most part, one crisis after another.

Prior to this year, though, life was easier during the spring, summer, and fall. Even the back-to-back crises that occur during winter seemed to decrease in both frequency and severity. Not this year. The weather may have improved but the crises are coming like a runaway train. Health problems, losing my health insurance, my roof developing a leak and other home repairs I can't afford, and problems with neighbors (I live in a low-income rural area and half my neighbors are borderline career criminals) have all contributed to severe mood swings. When things are really bad I experience mixed states. And lately, my life is one long mixed state. I don't remember the last time I felt even slightly stabilized.

Since I don't have insurance, I can't even talk to my pdoc about adjusting my meds. 

A friend asked me what a mixed state felt like. I told her to imagine having her skin peeled off and surviving only to be attacked by a swarm of hornets. That's what the inside of my head feels like most of the time.

I'm 62 years old. These should be my golden years, but instead I feel like I'm in hell. I can't bear the thought of another decade or two of life like this. I just want it to be over.
