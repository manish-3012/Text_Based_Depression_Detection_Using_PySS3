Left with my own thoughtsHi everyone, 

To start I'm not looking to injure myself or attempt anything at this point in time.  That being said suicide is something I think about on a regular basis.  I don't really have much to complain about, I have a decent job, good friends and a supporting family.  However, when left with my own thoughts my mind quickly rushes to the idea of suicide, of which i'd probably have attempted by now if it wasn't for the guilty conscious of how my family would take it.  

I don't feel comfortable nor do i think i can afford going to talk to a therapist, but i'm generally just not happy.  I've tried taking up new hobbies, being increasingly more social, doing charity... nothing seems to fill what i can only describe as a lack of enthusiasm to see tomorrow.  I drink and occasionally turn to stronger, less legal, substances to help remove these thoughts, which works short term.  

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this thread, but hoping someone who's been in a similar situation or event could shed some light on how they got out of this slump or stopped turning to suicide as the long-term answer.  For now my mind is continually thinking of how to properly seal my garage to prevent exhaust from leaking out.
