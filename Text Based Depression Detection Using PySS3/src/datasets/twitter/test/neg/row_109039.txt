I'm just so doneI just can't keep doing this anymore. No one cares about me, my bf "is tired of hearing it" and I'll probably lose my insurance now because of Trump. Not like I can see a therapist more than once a month anyway since no one has appointments. So tonight I'm going to step in front of a train and be done with it. Goodbye.
