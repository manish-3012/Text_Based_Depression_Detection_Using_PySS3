Everything about being trans sucksAnd I can't handle it at all. 

I'm trying really hard to pretend that I'm okay. I'm resisting the urge to just end it right now. My family and friends still haven't recovered completely from my previous attempt. Ugh

The truth is, I know that suicide is not something that I can avoid. I can put it off for a year or two, but that's it.

I can't live like this, with my body and my mind permanently disfigured. I don't want to be a fake for the rest of my life, hiding behind makeup and padded bras. I don't want to see a guy in the mirror every single time. I don't want to feel like a pervert every time I try to wear womens underwear. I don't want to shave my fucking hairy chest and nipples every single day. I'm sick of having basically zero options when it comes to dating and making friends. 

I have no money for the surgeries I need, I have no money to change my documents... It's just all pointless.

I just don't get it. What's the point of coping with this shit when I can just end it?
