Went to the ER yesterday after an overdose. Told I was seeking attention and liked being admitted to psych wards before being discharged.Fuck doctors. Fuck meds. Fuck psychiatry. Fuck hospitals. Fuck everyone and everything. I'm done with this shit. I don't deserve to be treated like this. Especially after I told them I was scared I'd do it again. Nope, just attention seeking is all. Got it.
