I donâ€™t want to die but I want to tryRecently everything has gone to shit. My relationship with the love of my life fell apart because of me. He moved out of the place we were living together. I raged and put a lot of stupid shit on social media which made everything worse. Now my life is at the low that it always ends up at. And I think I am going to do it. I have some SSRIs and I plan on taking about 30 of them. My mom refuses to let me get help because I want to die so I really donâ€™t have any other option. I want to be sick and hospitalized and I want to feel everything and nothing. Anything other than this deep deep deep pain and self hatred. I want to be alone forever so I can never ruin anything ever again. I have been such a coward my whole life but I think Iâ€™m finally strong enough to try to die.
