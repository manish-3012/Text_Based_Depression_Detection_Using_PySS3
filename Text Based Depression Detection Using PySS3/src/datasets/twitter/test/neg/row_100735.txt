I've grown so tired of existingAbout ten years ago I got it in my mind I needed to give it all up and head out into the wilderness and try to survive. I was 22 at the time. Couldn't understand why I never felt like making the choices that made my life better, that got me what I wanted. Everyone else could do it, not me though. Didn't understand the difference between everyone else and me. Just decided they had the will to live and I didn't. Didn't make any sense though. How could that be a thing that could be missing. 

Within civilization getting what we need comes easy, so we strive to get the things we want. When we don't make the choices we need to in order to get what we want we simply just don't get what we want, no big deal. Within the wilderness what we need has to be earned. The choices we make out there have to be about what we need or we die. 

That was the idea. The idea on how I would find out if I actually lacked the will to live. It was ok to not make the choices I needed within civilization. I'd continue to live on if I didn't. I wouldn't out there though. There'd be no question whether or not my life mattered to me living in the wilds. 

Due to shit my mother was going through my journey into the wilderness by my lonesome became a cross-country biking trip with her. We made it to a town 50 miles north of where we were. Happen to have some family there. Stayed with them for a couple days. Couple days turned into a couple weeks, couple weeks into a couple months, couple months into a couple years. 

Never got to go on that journey of mine. Never got to find out if I had the will to live. With no answer to that question I needed answering and the desire to go out and force the answer upon myself gone, stagnation began to set in. I became trapped in a perpetual state of waiting. Waiting for my answer. Around 24 - 25 I begin to start imagining ways of killing myself. 32 now and I never stopped. At one point a couple years I whenever I'd recollect an experience that was confusing I wouldn't be able to help myself and just blurt out "I hate myself I want to die all day every day". After saying it so many times I started to paraphrase it and just parts of what seemingly became my mantra would come out. Recently within the last few months the words that come outta my mouth during those times stopped being my mantra and ended up turning into a question, "Can I die please?". 

Might be hard to believe me when I tell you that despite countless of times I imagined killing myself, despite the amount times I've asked no one if it was okay for me to die, I was never suicidal. Tired of living sure, but I never wanted to die. You'd think all these things would worry a person who didn't want to die but because I knew what I felt, for me, it was never a concern.

I became concerned ten or so months ago. That was when I realized I didn't want anything anymore. Whenever I would imagine what all would need to happening in order to make one thing happen - it just feels like it'd be so exhausting. That no matter what I'd be getting, it just wouldn't be worth the effort anymore. Never felt like that before, but that's what it felt like then and what's it's continued to feel like since.

That concerned me because before I only imagined the result of a situation. Now, I could imagine the situation that would lead to the result. The situation, my ability to sustain myself within this society degrading away due to my apathy. Degrading to the point of me just not being able to. At that point I'd be looking at surviving on the streets or killing myself. I knew then what I know now, that I'm just too damn tired for the survival. As long as it was easy I could stick around. 

The frustration of all the bullshit I had to deal with while working became too much. I stopped showing up. I now find myself within the possibility that felt so probable in what felt like a lifetime ago. 

I won't lie, there is a sadness that comes with accepting this as what's most likely going to end up happening. It's not overwhelming thought. More like a blanket keeping me warm by numbing everything else.
