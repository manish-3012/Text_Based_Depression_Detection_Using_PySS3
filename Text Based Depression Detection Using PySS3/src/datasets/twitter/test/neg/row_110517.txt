I should have killed myself soonerIt basically feels like I'm living on borrowed time. Life hasn't improved, it's not getting better, and each day is getting progressively worse. The only thing that has stopped me from ending it all isn't some profound sense of there might be something better round the corner... It's cowardice. I'm that much of a pussy.
