If i do ... how do i say sorry to youShe walks through the door placing her keys on the table
Had a long day so she really wants to lay low
But everything she knows is about to go the other way tho
Calls out the name of the one she wanted to see when she came home
She listens out but she gets no reply
Takes a step forward she wants to know why
Just out in the the driveway she saw a second car
Now shes runnin through the house tryna find out where you are
In her mind you're still close and you couldn't have gone far.
She dashes up the stairs and down to the end of the hall
She pulls out her phone and its you she tries to call
Ring ring ring she can hear your phone ringing
She opens up a door and the neighbors heard screaming
Under a black veil she can hear the choir singing 
There's your lifeless body laying right there on the floor
She never thought she was coming home to a corpse
She doesnt even know if she can love you anymore 
She planned a whole life with you whatchu throw it away for.
On the bed all you left was this note
But she cant even bring herself to read what you wrote
You took everything she ever loved and she forever feels broke
Afraid to love anyone else or let anyone in
Scared to see it all come crashing down again
A beautiful girl confused about what shes doing
All because i was weak and now she's forever ruined.
Im so sorry i just didnt know what to do
The last thing i thought about was would you forgive me if i do? 
And if you you dont read this then how will i ever say sorry to you ?....
