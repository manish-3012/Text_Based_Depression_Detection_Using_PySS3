Feeling lost in college and death seems like a super nice option 

I actually made a post like this for the offmychest thread but I'm not sure if it's completely appropriate there since I am feeling extremly suicidal though I don't have a plan or anything, just intense feelings of wanting to die so I've decided to post what's causing me to feel this way and maybe get some advice or just not feel too alone in what I'm going through. just a note, SUPER LONG rambling ahead 

Hey, I just made this account since I've been dealing with a lot of personal issues lately that I don't know where else to release where I'll be comfortable with so I decided to post here cause anonymity and the community here seems alright.

I'm a college student, sophomore, studying chemistry (trying pre-med cause I still have interest in to becoming a doctor) and I came to realize I hate my major. I started to stop going to my classes (most which are major specific) this semester because I find it to be a chore and I'm just trying to get a good score on the exams for a good grade. I still go to my labs but I hate it and feel like I'm about to face some unimaginable dread for no reason. I'm assuming its probably partially due to my anxiety disorder but I also dislike the lab work because it's solo rather than what I thought to be partner work or at least be a little more "people interacting". In fact, the only major specific class I actually look forward to is the physics lab because it is partner work and I get to interact with another human being.

I guess the craving for human interaction is also because I feel lonely af at my school despite trying to join clubs talking to people in class and other "socializing advice". I have been diagnosed with severe social anxiety since I was a child due some childhood events but I have improved with social skill classes so I can at least make eye contact with people and hold a somewhat alright conversation without freaking out too much in 1-1 interactions and small-medium sized groups. I had always thought I was an introvert because I thought I liked being by myself. I came to the realization once coming to college that I was actually an extrovert as I wanted to be with people, I wanted to go to the large events and just interact and talk to everyone and in cases where I am comfortable with a group, I find myself happier and more "in my element" than doing things alone. I realized most of my alone time, really stemmed from me being afraid of working with other people because I thought they disliked me/ fear of I will do something that make them not like me. I realized this with the assignments I get in school between those done by yourself vs group projects/work, I actually really enjoy group work. Problem is, I hate the group selection part because I find it so hard to put myself out there and insert myself in a group since I feel like such an outsider. I already see so many people have their own friend groups and cliques and I just feel like i'm being intrusive when inserting myself into an already established group. This is the same thing I'm facing when trying to put myself out there to socialize.

During my school's housing selection for upperclassmen (since I'm going to be a junior next semester) I wanted to live in the apartments but to do that, you had to find a group of people to apply with. So I asked my only few friends and acquaintances if they wanted to make a group but it turned out they already had their established groups. I was upset but not too much as I just thought to myself I'll just go and ask other people on my school's facebook page since there were a lot of posts for looking for roommates to create a group for the apartment application. I messaged as many as I could and got rejected over and over again but then I found a group who accepted me only to reject me later for a different person. That honestly destroyed me beyond belief. Never had I felt so alone and unlikable in my whole entire life. I just kept thinking "what is wrong with me?". I eventually found a group and they only accepted me because my lottery number was low enough so I just felt convinced I was a person no one wanted unless I give them something in return as in material or academic goods. I know i have some talents and good qualities, like being a good listener and a pretty good artist, but I guess that means jackshit since it requires a person to actually invest in getting to know me beyond short conversation that gets shutted down pretty quickly even if I try to find a way to continue it somehow but I have to accept defeat and just feel rejected all over again.

I don't know if this is the right place to say it, but lately I just feel like I have absolutely nothing to offer and no point in my life and I just want to end everything. I actually attempted suicide last year for similar feelings though it more related to grades since I was so obsessed with them being a premed and I thought a 3.5 year average was the end of the world for me. Now I'm actually a huge decline after getting another breakdown over grades and I failed my calc final since I took it in the midst of a panic attack making my gpa drop by .4 points. Now I'm currently on the path to failing most of my classes because I have no motivation, I'm stressed beyond belief, I feel lonely as hell, I hate my major and I feel like I'm damned for a miserable life in all ways and most of all I hate myself for feeling this way when so many people have it much worse and not being disciplined and just being a failure to everyone around me and my dreams.

I've been struggling with these kinds of feelings and issues for over 10 years now, been in and out of hospitals and tried so many different treatments for my mental health which I know is fucked up and needs to be treated but I'm just so tired of this. I just want the ceiling above my bed to fall on top of me and crush me to death or get hit by a damn car so I can end of all this.

for those of you who took the time to read all of this, thanks for you time and I feel little better after getting all of this out.
