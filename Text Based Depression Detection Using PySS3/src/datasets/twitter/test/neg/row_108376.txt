Suicide is a test of how far we're willing to go.It took me years, but I finally made up my mind. 76 days are left. I've tried everything that was available to me, but life isn't worth living. I'm preparing all my plans for the final journey: the crossover.
I feel like an idiot for what I've done. I messed up enough times already.
This isn't the first time I set a date, but it shall be the last.
