I'm at the point where I'm genuinely not sure what to do. I'm exhausted.Hey

 **&amp;nbsp**; 

I don't feel like I'm going to say anything new here. I feel hopeless, lost, alone, hurt, worthless, any other adjective that has been used to describe the feelings under depression. Today has been the worst of the flare-ups so far though. I'm sitting in bed and I have a handgun. I couldn't go through with it because I don't have a back-up plan for my dog. She deserves the best so I want to make sure I find someone worthy to take care of her when I'm gone. Hopefully that will happen sooner rather than later.

 **&amp;nbsp**; 

I've tried reaching out to whatever acquaintences I had, but no friend should be required to take on the role of a therapist. I don't want to burden anyone.

 **&amp;nbsp**; 

I've tried the National Suicide Hotline. I was on hold for more than half a day and the conversation didn't feel natural. I felt worse afterwards. 

 **&amp;nbsp**; 

I'm running out of distractions and "mindful exercises" to keep distracted. I don't know what to do. All I know is I feel with every ounce of my body that I need to off myself.
