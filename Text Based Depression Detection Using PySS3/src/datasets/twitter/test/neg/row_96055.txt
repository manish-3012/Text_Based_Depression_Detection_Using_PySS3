How do I carry on?Last ditch attempt here to get something to stop me. Have everything prepared I am ready to go. I have a partner he is keeping me here but he's been so depressed and I think he would be better with me gone. He is my carer, what kind of life is that at his age looking after his mentally ill girlfriend. Been out of hospital for two months worried I'll go back in. People want to hurt children if I die I can stop it all. So how do I keep on going and why where am I who am I. What do I give to the world I am a parasite a drain of resources and all this just to have someone dead. I am turning 30 this year I said I wouldn't live past 25 really need to go now I have been struggling on too long going nowhere. All I do is suck the l life out of everything. Can't work can't help just suck. Sorry the text is so rambly, thoughts are rushing hard to order.
