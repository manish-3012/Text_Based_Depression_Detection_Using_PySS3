Why are people so fucking mean all the time?I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore I hate everything and everyone Iâ€™m leaving this stupid place forever as soon as my semester is over. I feel like itâ€™s not that hard to be kind and empathetic but so many people just seem to go out of their way to be cruel. The last thing I want to say is to just please just be nice to each other and think about how your words/actions might make someone else feel. Seeya.
