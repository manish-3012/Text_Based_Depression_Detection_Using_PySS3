I'm a kid stuck in an adult bodyI'm 29 and living with my mom and brother, I only exist because... well, I don't have a choice.

I'm still enjoying my hobbies whice are gaming and watching tv, but I've got nothing else and whatever should make me an "adult", I just don't have it.

I'm stuck in the past, feeling like a 15 years old in the inside and just acting like an adult when at work or with other people.

People at my age have families of their own and have studies in university or college and I'm just having my pathetic job that, to be honest, I don't really need, I don't need any money since as I said I live with my mom and my hobbies doesn't cost any money, I just put it aside for.... literally no good reason.

The problem is.. I don't want anything, I know I'm too sad of a person to have a family of my own and on top of that I can't take care/be with a woman since I'm a kid in the inside and I have absolutely no idea how to interact with woman at my age, I feel like a children next to people at that age.

I have the exact same routine for the past 10 years.

I wake up late, go to work or whatever (working evenings), come back home and play games and watch TV, then masturbate and go to sleep. 

And the days I don't work I just wake up and do nothing or pass the time then repeat..

I know it's pathteic but I've got nothing else to do since I don't want anything else.. I don't want nothing I have no dreams, just that glimps of hope I'll magically me a mature person one day but I just can't fake it anymore... it's exhausting.

To be honest I just wish I didn't exist, but I won't kill myself so don't be alarmed.
