I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still aliveI was able to tell that my mom never liked me since I was born. Sheâ€™s always with my sister doing what a mom and daughter would do, while Iâ€™m always at home just thinking why she never wants to spend time with me. She yelled and hit me a lot as a kid and nothing I do seems good enough for her. I told her today what I wanted for Christmas which was some clothes which happened to be black. She then proceeded to scream at me saying Iâ€™m just gonna be a criminal and Iâ€™m nothing more than a school shooter because I enjoy playing video games. Iâ€™ve been crying for almost 2 hours and still why making this post. I really donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to so I thought I should talk about it here.
