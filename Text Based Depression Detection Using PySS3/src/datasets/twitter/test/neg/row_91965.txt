I canâ€™t take it anymoreI am 20 years old. I have been fighting depression for 3 years. The only girl i have ever truly loved left me in december. My mom wonâ€™t talk to me anymore. Lost my grandma last week. Was alone Christmas eve and new years eve. And today my dog died. Since my girl left me i have been taking xanax and percocet everyday. January 21st is my birthday and the day i will take my life. 

Have nobody left to talk to so had to get this off my chest
