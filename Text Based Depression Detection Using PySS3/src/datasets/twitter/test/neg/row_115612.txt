I think I wanna kms tonight...I feel like I canâ€™t go on anymore, I canâ€™t process my emotions and I have no idea how to cope

Itâ€™s hard to pick a starting point for this post, considering my long history of failing in absolutely everything. But right now I think Iâ€™m at my breaking point. I just transferred this semester to a new school, and Iâ€™m having a terrible time. My car battery died last night, and I have no friends who can help me. Iâ€™m probably going to fail 3 out of 4 classes, and if I canâ€™t finish this 5 page paper (which I donâ€™t even know how to start, and Iâ€™ve never written anything more than 3 pages) Iâ€™m going to fail all 4. This isnâ€™t my first time failing out of college either, I flunked out in 2016 when I was 18, and I failed a semester of community college last spring. And academics arenâ€™t even the worst part of my life. Iâ€™ve made no friends in school, and my only 2 friends from back home are 5 hours away from me. Iâ€™m feeling so disoriented right now so Iâ€™m sorry if this is disorganized. I feel like I have no future and my life sucks. Iâ€™m never going to graduate school, Iâ€™m never going to find love (Iâ€™m a gay 21 year old whoâ€™s never been in a relationship, or even a second date), Iâ€™m never going to get a job paying slightly above minimum wage, im never going to be able to afford to move out of my parents, and Iâ€™m never gonna be happy. Whatâ€™s the point of going on if I know Iâ€™m going to be miserable? Every day is agony, and Iâ€™m an unlovable unbearably awkward ugly pathetic sad piece of shit. Wtf do I do?

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this, I feel inconsolably depressed and I donâ€™t think anyone can say anything to make me feel better. My lifeâ€™s a mess, and it seems like killing myself is the only solution. But at least here I can anonymously post my thoughts without any filter. Lol. 

Thanks for reading!

Sincerely,

Me
