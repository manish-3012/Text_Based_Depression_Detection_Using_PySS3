I need companyI don't want to be around anyone because I can't hide hot bad my depression is anymore but it feels so lonely. not to mention that everyday it gets worse somehow despite my best attempts. 
it doesn't help that I never learned how to properly express myself or talk about what's going on because no one believes me anyway. I just have to bottle everything up. it feels like life constantly hits me with some traumatic shit and before I even get the chance to process it, there's more I have to deal with and it all keeps pilling up. I feel like I'm suffocating, everyday just feels like a fever dream I wish I could just get away from here. 

itd be nice if anyone is down to talk so I could just get my mind off things. I could use a distraction.
