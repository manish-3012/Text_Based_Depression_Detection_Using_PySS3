Its time to sleepIm 16 yr old in his 3rd year of highschool.. I used to be partially depressed but now its progressed and has gotten worse. Im tired of fighting n running. Tbh i should have killed my self in middle school but a lil late for that now is it. Im not happy i never was i dont even know what happiness is, ever since i lost my dog who i grew up with becuz as a kid i had no friends n she was my only friend i ever had and when no one was there she was there for me. She gave me a purpose to live but now shes gone n i have not a single purpose to live, nothing to lose at all. Im single been that way for a while. Im not ugly but im no girls type atleast thats what i think. But ill probably be a guy who has mail order bribe or something but ill likely kill my self on my birthday which is in june during the 1st week. Today my depression is at severe levels so i may kill myself today. Everyday theres a pain in my chest that comes from my heart its the only pain i can feel, it gets worse as i live on and im tired of suffering. 
I have 3 options
Pills 
Gun
Carbon monoxide i have access to all 3 of these things
