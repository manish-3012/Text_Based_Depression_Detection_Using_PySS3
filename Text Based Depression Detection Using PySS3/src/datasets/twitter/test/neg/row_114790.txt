I'm planning my own funeral so you(*my family) don't have tothis month and the next are the only month that isn't a siblings or family members birthday (well that's around now) and God knows I have the will to do it so I'm planning on strangling myself, I'm kinda heavy (under 130lbs)  and there's nothing I can hang off of so yeah. I'm just putting it all into place, making sure my loved ones are taken care of.

ik the timing is inconvenient, my family can't afford a funeral or anything so I'll work out that, and really I don't have any other loose ends so yeah. it's oddly peaceful knowing it's all going to be done soon.
