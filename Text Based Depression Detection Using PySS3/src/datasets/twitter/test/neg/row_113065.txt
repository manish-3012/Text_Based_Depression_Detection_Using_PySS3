Thanks.I feel the days are slowly getting there. I feel the weight is getting lighter. I first regretted going into the ward at first. I'm still a bit annoyed I couldn't go through with it. But my time here has given me that much needed break from the world. I'm okay with that. I think that bring okay with how things are helps. Reading people's post and replies have helped me past the time and relate to many of you. I might be back here. But hopefully to help someone. 

Thanks.
