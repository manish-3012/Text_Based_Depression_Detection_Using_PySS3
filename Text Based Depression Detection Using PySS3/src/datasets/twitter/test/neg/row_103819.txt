I don't belong in this world..i never have to begin withI'm tired.  I've been actively and passively suicidal since I was about 15. 15 years is too young to be thinking about taking yourself out.  

I want my end to be as violent and disturbing as my life was, growing up. I want to do it where no one will find me; somewhere in the forests of Montana or by a lake in Colorado. I always wanted to move there and I think that's where I'll find some sort of peace. I love nature more than I've ever loved anything in my entire life and I want to be surrounded by it as I die.  I want to be given back to the earth,  not put in some stupid box and thrown into the ground.  It was a gift to come from the earth and that would bring me my last bit of peace to be able to give back to it. 

I'm sorry,  I can't do this shit any more.
