I can't make it through thisIf not for COVID, I know it would all be fine. As difficult as things were, I had a way out. Every time I got knocked down I got up and started trying again. But I'm stuck living in a house in which I was essentially a prisoner until I was in my late twenties. Waking up and interacting with the people here saps my will to live. I had everything lined up to get away in March before the lockdown.

This is just too much for me. I cannot do anything here, I can't concentrate, I can't think clearly. I can't meet new people or make connections on the internet, because being here so thoroughly warps my perceptions and my way of communicating with people.

The people I'm living with are especially vulnerable to COVID, so I've had very little contact with the outside world since mid February. I'm reverting to the feelings and reactions that I developed in order to survive the worst of my isolation and abuse. 

I keep trying but nothing changes. I have no one waiting for me on the other side of this. I don't have happy memories with people to lean on and buoy me through this time. I think I'm ready to die. At this point, I'm not sure that this is worth keeping up for anyone else, or if there is any good reason to prevent whatever pain they might experience from my passing.

I don't know why I'm writing. No amount of text communication makes a dent. It doesn't feel like anything to communicate to or with people I've never met and never will. I don't want to be stopped, I don't care about feeling justified in doing it. On some level I know there's hope, but it's never materialized. I want to be a part of the world, to be seen as and to feel like a person, but I don't think that's something I'll get to experience again before I go.
