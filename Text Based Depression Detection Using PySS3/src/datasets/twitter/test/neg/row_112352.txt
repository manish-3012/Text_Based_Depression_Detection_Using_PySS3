tried everything to get better and its not workinghi im 32 and have been battling depression and anxiety disorders since being a young teen. ive been on antidepressants for a while, gone to therapy, exercise, tried real hard to be employable but i struggle. i cant imagine any scenarios in which i can feel ok in the future. i cant find joy in anything at all. i live alone and dont have any friends or family in this state. ive been hospitalized for attempts two times. ive had suicidal ideations probably 100-200 times/day for about 10 years that i used to be able to distract myself from, usually with exercise and smoking some weed, and its harder and harder to avoid those thoughts as i age. i got so close today to ending things but my cat jumped on me and calmed me down but i dont know if that will help next time. ive tried calling suicide hotlines but they seem to make things worse.

has anyone been in my situation and found help?
