I'm just so tired of everything.I don't know how much longer I can go on. I have no friends, except my cat. I cAt afford his food or anything, I can't even afford to feed myself. I have no job, though I've been searching and applying and trying since August. I have till Tuesday to be moved out of the apartment I'm staying in. My mom can't help me, I have nothing to live for anymore. I feel so worthless and terrible. I hate myself... I just can't do it anymore. I can't. I'm sorry
