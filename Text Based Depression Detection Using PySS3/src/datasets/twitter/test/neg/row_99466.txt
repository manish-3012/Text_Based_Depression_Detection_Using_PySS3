The voices are telling me toI don't even know why I'm writing this.

Well, I know why I'm here. Same reason as everybody else I guess. But I know the replies to this are going to be exactly what I expect; people saying not to do it or whatever.  But honestly I feel like that won't do any good. I know I shouldn't do it. 

And yet here I am. I made this account last year sometime to try and figure out what to do because I was hearing voices. If that sounds interesting or whatever just look in my history. It's there. Thing is, I still hear them all the time. I went off any meds because I didn't feel like myself, they somehow made things worse instead of better. But these voices tell me what to do, normally something about hurting myself. Normally I can suppress them, but I'm done trying. They're in full force tonight.

I asked my boyfriend to wait 15 minutes after smoking weed before driving. What can I say? I worry. But he refused, even knowing that it means a lot to me. I'm not even worth a 15 minute wait for him. We live very far apart and I was going to move out there in a few months. But that doesn't matter anymore.

I'm not happy anymore. I haven't been for a long time. Sure, some times are better than others, and I have a couple friends I guess. I can go out and it seems like I'm having a good time. I'm not complaining about my quality of life. I know some people have it worse than others. The problem is when I'm not distracted by things like that.  Some people get depressed because of the situation they're in. If this was something like that I could try to work my way out of it, but the voices seem to be here to stay.

The voices are much worse in times of stress or exhaustion. I know this. But I get stressed, I can't help it. I've looked it up, it's something to do with CRH (Corticotrophin-Releasing Hormone) in the brain. At least that's what I've gathered. So the stress about all the little things that shouldn't stress me out won't stop. 

This leads to less sleep. The voices aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

I've even tried a philosophical approach in an attempt to relieve the stress that I know is unnecessary. I believe it is Stoicism that says you should learn to accept external factors. "It is what it is." I've tried this. No dice.  I think it was also the Stoics who taught that if somebody is in extreme pain, suicide is acceptable. This probably meant physical pain when they were teaching it, but I've reached that point mentally.

And I think I'm just done with it all. I think it's time I just give in.
