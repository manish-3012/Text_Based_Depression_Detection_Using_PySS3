Alone. Done.I just can't breathe. I feel like I'm drowning in pain.
I've struggled with depression for years and I've reached the worst of it at this stage.
I can't see a future. And living with my mom is unbearable.
I did one last thing and reached out to someone I thought is my friend and he didn't even answer me.
I blocked the only person who cares about me because I'm a worthless piece of shit in this world and he doesn't deserve having to put up with me. Not that he helps. No one helps.
I'm just alone. No one clearly cares about me. I'm just so tired of constantly trying.
