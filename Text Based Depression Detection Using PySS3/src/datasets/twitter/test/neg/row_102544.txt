12All I want to do is die. I haven't been happy in years and my self harm has already gotten to the point where I should be getting stitches (but I'm not). I hate school. I have to listen to the other kids talk about how 'AMAZING' trump is and how lgbtq+ people shouldn't exist. I'm taking high school level classes and I have social anxiety, and it's killing me.
 
My mom smokes and drinks and when she's drunk she tells me about how useless and mean and selfish I am. I've already tried to kill myself multiple times. I'm so close to doing it again. I guess the worst part is that I'm only 12. My 13th birthday is in November. Happy halloween, hopefully I'll be dead soon. 

Sorry, I know you guys will either not read this or only respond because you want to 'save' somebody. Nobody cares until you're on the brink of death- other than that, I don't matter.
