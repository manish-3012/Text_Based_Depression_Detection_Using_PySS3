lonley and i feel worthlessSo i (m/17) recently moved to a different state and now live with my mom, little brother, and my moms boyfriend. I feel so lonley because i dont know anyone here and i get sad at times. I dont know how to explain it but it comes and goes. I graduated high school a year early and been trying to find a part time job ever since we moved here. Everytime i fill an application i feel pathetic because of how my application looks. I dont know i just feel sad and worthless. I dont think i explained it good but i just dont know. I dont want to kill myself i just want to talk to someone.
