If ever there were a day that I would do it..Accepting myself as trans is one thing(though gender dissonance is excruciating), having a friend die is another, being a broke jobless college student is another thing- but this.. I don't know if I can handle this..

I have a rectal prolapse- it's extremely uncomfortable to pass bowel movements, and the only real 'cure' is a surgery. I would not be able to participate in anal sex again.



I don't want to be here anymore. Anywhere. My heart wants to rip itself out of my chest, and who am I to blame it?
