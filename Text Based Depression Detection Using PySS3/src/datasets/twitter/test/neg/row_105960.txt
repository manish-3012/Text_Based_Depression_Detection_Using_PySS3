The rain.Wrote this when I was on the verge of ending it all. Feel as though I'm slipping back and felt like sharing. Writing it seemed to help so hoping coming back to it helps again.

The rain.

I don't know what's up with me lately.
Everything seems against me, the world, people, just.. everything.
Am I crazy? I don't think I've ever felt this alone, which IS crazy, because I know there are people who are there for me, who want to help, but I can't let them in. I cannot think of a way to explain what I'm feeling without them thinking I'm just a little sad, or seeking attention.
Because I'm not. This has nothing to do with attention, this is the opposite. I'm pushing people away when we get close, because I don't want to hurt them, and more importantly, I don't want to get hurt anymore.
I don't feel.. alive. I feel like a thing. Not a person, just a thing.
A thing that walks the streets, works, eats, sleeps, and repeats, day in, day out.
Nothing feels real, I don't feel like me anymore. 
Until tonight. Tonight, I felt more alive than I have done in a long time. Why?
The rain.
Tonight, walking in the rain, no coat, just a shirt and pants, and my thoughts, I felt alive.
Most see rain as sad. Sad scenes in movies, music videos for sad songs, it's depressing. 
But it's not, it's refreshing.
When it's raining, most people want to curl up on the sofa with their loved ones and watch a film. That's beautiful. And that's what rain is, beautiful.
And tonight, walking in the rain, I got that same warm feeling as those curled up in front of the TV.
The longer I walked, the better I felt. Only the sound of rain drops bouncing off cars and into puddles, which sounded like a symphony to my once closed ears.
Each drop sent a wave of positivity through my body. For the first time in a long time, I felt happy. I felt alive. I felt like me.
On those streets, all alone, I suddenly didn't feel lonely anymore.
People spend their money and travel the world and experience once in a life time opportunities to feel the way I felt tonight.  
But not me.
All I need is a cloudy night..
My thoughts..
And the rain.
