Fuck this I'm doneFuck this place. The one time I really try to start living in spite of everything that's happening in the world, the fucking worst year ever happened. And now I've lost the best thing in my life thanks to my own fucking bullshit negativity. It's been two months, and despite covid getting notably worse, he's out there chatting and making friends and getting over it. Good for him. He has no idea how much I just want to let go of my own negativity and be there with him.

Having misophonia should be a sign that someone is supposed to die. Life is not worth living with this disorder. Fuck it
