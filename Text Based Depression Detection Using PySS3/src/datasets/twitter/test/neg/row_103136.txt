Depressed.throwaway, i guess. i don't know if this fits here.

i've been dealing with major depression since i was at least five. i used to tell my ma how i was planning to commit suicide. i've been in and out of hospitals and tried quite a few anti-depressants.

i've tried committing suicide only a few times. the first when i was nine, i tried to hang myself but my mom walked in. a few times after that by cutting. i self-harm every day (cutting and sometimes burning if i'm *really* upset), i feel like i'm addicted. i always see other people in public with the smoothest wrists and i wonder what it would be like to have that.

i'm posting this because i just reached out for help (anonymously, on a site similar to how this is) and the person kept asking why i wasn't dead yet. because "*it's easy to kill a human*" and if i really wanted to die i'd be dead already. i just want someone to listen. i don't want them to try to fix my problems or come up with solutions on how i could be happy. i just want to talk and i just want someone to listen. i thought i could find that 'someone' here.

my names is miles. i turned eighteen last week. i've never felt emptier.

**edit:** i don't think i'm making myself clear enough -- i've been suicidal since i was five and i have been dealing with depression for over a decade. i'm not showing improvement and my mother is overwhelmed. i don't want to be given suggestions on what to try to make myself better. i've tried everything and i'll keep trying. but i just want to talk. about anything. my life, my feelings, or happier things, i don't care.
