nothing is fun anymore.i dont enjoy anything i do. every minute of my life has been a bore. i dont have many friends and am a total dick to the ones i have. my old best friend hates me because i smoke too much weed and am getting into harder shit. life feels so pointless. whenever im with someone i just cant wait until they are gone. i dont enjoy being around anyone ever. i lately have pretended to be happier because my parents stop pestering me about how they "worry about me" you just get sick of such stupid repetitive sentiments. i wouldnt have to worry about the pressure to get into a prestigious school if i was dead. i wouldnt have to save any money or work for any money. i just dont see where im even going with this. no one will give a shit. just some stupid forum on the internet.
