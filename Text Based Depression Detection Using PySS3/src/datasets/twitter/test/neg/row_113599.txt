I don't know what to doI'm just a 14 year old boy. Just a few months ago I found out my mom has been cheating on my dad several times pretty much since I was born. My dad got kicked out and I barely ever got to see him. A few months later they got a divorce. Whenever I visited my dad he would just sob in my lap. My dad lived in a small apartment and I started living with him but now we are in our own house and I haven't seen my mom in months. My mom ended up getting with a new guy not even 2 months after her divorce, and she tried forcing him on me. I told her I was uncomfortable around him but she didn't care. My mom accused my dad of being emotionally abusive their whole marriage and they absolutely despise each other. I'm with my dad in our house now but with online school its just getting worse, my grades are in shambles and I can barely even get out of bed in the morning. I wish I could just go ahead and end it all but I can't stop thinking about what it would do to my family and friends. I sometimes wish they would all just forget who I was so I could just end everything and they wouldn't be affected by it. I'm so hopeless at this point in my life. I just started high school and I'm not sure if I'm even gonna be alive by the end of it. I can't end it all so I just have to sit through the pain every day of my life. I see no future for myself and I don't look forward to anything thats ahead of me. I just don't see my life going anywhere.
