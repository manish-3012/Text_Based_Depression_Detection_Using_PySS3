I got a raise recently, and things seem to be looking up, however I still feel the same.Iâ€™m still Suicidal, and I still spend most of my time thinking, and looking up ways to kill myself. I try to distract myself, I try to focus on the positives- yet at the end of the day when itâ€™s time to sleep my mind run rampant. Iâ€™m not sure really whatâ€™s keeping me here, as I donâ€™t feel like I have much to live for. People at work are starting to remind me everyday that I need to go to college, and not work a 9-5 the rest of my life- even if Im content with that 9-5. It makes me feel really dumb, and unsuccessful compared to other people my age- and people I went to school with. 
i get reminded of how much everyone in my family relied on me to do all these amazing things in life because i was â€˜extremely smartâ€™ and then i feel like i disappointed everyone and thatâ€™s all iâ€™m ever going to do. i get asked a lot what i wanted to do with my life, and i never know the answer because all i really want to do is just die and not exist on this shitty planet anymore. in a lot of ways the thought of enteral darkness and nothingness makes me feel warm n happy inside.
