tired of trying for a dumpster ðŸ”¥I have had two suicide attempts in the past. I failed both times because I caved and told my fiancÃ© those were a little more spontaneous. I have a plan this time. Iâ€™m not really writing for help. Iâ€™m more or so just writing to get this feeling out of me. I have a plan for New Years. It makes sense and it will make sense to the people I love. I have written letters to everyone important to me and one with my last wishes and sealed them all in envelopes. New Years last year I was violently raped, so it figures I wouldnâ€™t react well to this New Years. That isnâ€™t the main reason Iâ€™m doing this though. I feel I just keep trying and failing at everything. I have worked four temporary jobs in the last year and not one of them hired me on, but none of them had a negative thing to say about my work. My fiancÃ© resents me because my sex drive is shitty and my sex drive is shitty because one I have zero self confidence and two because I resent him for not working and being a video game addict but I canâ€™t tell him that because heâ€™s sensitive and it will crush what little self confidence he has. I also have tried to loose weight and I canâ€™t itâ€™s fucking impossible. I eat 650 calories a day, mainly veggies, fruits and nuts. I only drink water and milk. I run two miles everyday. I lost 20 pounds and itâ€™s been 3 months and I havenâ€™t lost a single pound since. Iâ€™m behind on rent, phone, electric, and water. Iâ€™m about to loose my health insurance again which means Iâ€™ll loose access to my therapist and my bipolar medication. So the feelings Iâ€™m having right now will only intensify. Iâ€™m just really really fucking tired of trying so hard to keep my shit together and pay my bills, and keep my fiancÃ© happy, and pretend to be happy for my friends and family, and go to jobs and improve companies Iâ€™m not getting hired at or paid well at. Iâ€™m tired of trying to loose weight, be healthy, work, pay bills, socialize, love, feel, talk, fucking all of it. I just try so hard all the fucking time and never get a god damn break not one in the last six fucking years.   
Honestly the world is a giant hellfire anyways our president is an idiot, our government is corrupt, our media is sickening, people are generally bad, the earth is dying and no one cares. So yea I just donâ€™t wanna try and honestly I donâ€™t wanna be apart of this fucking dumpster fire anymore. 


Alright thatâ€™s it. Thanks for coming to my fucked up ted talk.
