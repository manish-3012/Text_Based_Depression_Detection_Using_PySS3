Anyone ever feel like just totally fucking their life on purpose?I feel like at this point I have absolutely nothing to live for. I have no desire to work, complete my education, or continue on with the inevitable failure.

That being said, there are still things I want to experience before I go. For the past month or so I've been really considering trying the likes of heroin and meth. I think it's likely I won't live long enough for this to have real consequence. Anyone else have similar lines of thought?
