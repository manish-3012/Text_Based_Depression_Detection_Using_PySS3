Financially destroyedGot forcibly admitted and now have over 4K bills to pay that I canâ€™t pay. Iâ€™m in my early 20s and I must say is this how we convince people to go on living? It wouldâ€™ve been over 10k if I didnâ€™t have health insurance. This is just crazy.

I have a good job for someone so young and I canâ€™t even pay that off.
