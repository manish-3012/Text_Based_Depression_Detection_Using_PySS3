Things will never be better.There is no help for me.  I've got my psychiatrist in one corner saying that I just need to find the right drugs.  I've got my psychologist in the other corner saying that the only one that can make me better is me.

Drugs are a laugh.  It's like lobbing pebbles at a water-skimmer. Sure, you're gonna make the water move a bit, but you'll never hit your target.

I'm incapable of changing myself. I don't have the willpower or energy to sustain changes long enough to make them stick.  And all changes that I have tried, didn't do any good.

The old happy capable me is gone, never to return. I have trouble finding joy in anything anymore. The moment I get close, something will always knock me right back down.  The best I can do is just lay in bed, watch porn, and sleep.

I just don't care about anything.  I suck at conversation because I really, really, just don't care. It's all pointless. There is no conversation that I will ever have that will make any lick of difference.

Bah. There's so much more that's wrong with me. But none of it matters. It's never going away anyway.

I can actually picture myself jumping off a building right now. But I know that wouldn't fix anything.  I'd survive. Nothing will ever kill me. All anything can ever do is make my life more miserable. There's always extra room at the bottom.

It's all my fault anyway.  I've just hurt too many people. I deserve all the pain this world can throw at me.
