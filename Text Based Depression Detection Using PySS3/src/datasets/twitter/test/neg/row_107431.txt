someone want to talk?I don't know if I am actually going to do it but i have a plan to go get the shotgun out of the closet and eat lead. I bet it will hurt for a second but its gotta be better than this. No one has ever loved me. Not anyone ever. I've never been kissed and I have never held anyone's hand. All I want is for someone to look at me and say the words and I believe them. I'm sort of Gay, well, homoflexable and living in the south. Save me the "It gets better" nonsense. Life has gotten much worse and it is getting even suckier as time goes on. I don't know why I'm posting this but maybe someone wants to talk or something. I used to believe in true love and I really don't now. The man i though I loved went and got some bitch pregnant and now I'm here all alone with a shotgun a few feet away. Four years have passed and i still feel like shit about it all. She got what she wanted, the man I love, and all I got was heartbreak all because I'm not a woman. Fuck women. Not really but that is how i feel. To add insult to injury He pretends we were never a thing and everyone we knew calls me a liar now. I need someone to love me for me. Or at least I need someone to know the truth before I do this. Believe me or don't at least someone knows.
