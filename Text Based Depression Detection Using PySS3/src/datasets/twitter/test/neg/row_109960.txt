12 and about to attempt suicide for the 4th time.I'm done living. I lost everything I had except for one friend who I'm not sure is a real friend. I've tried killing myself 3 times and about to try again.  I can't stop myself from self harm. I know we will all die at some point, so why delay something that will happen anyways when you feel like getting out of this horrible place some people somehow call home. Suicide hotlines have hung up on me and my parents don't talk to me or care about me. I've asked for therapy and I get declined. My only friend I can't figure out if he cares about me or not. I have nothing left.
