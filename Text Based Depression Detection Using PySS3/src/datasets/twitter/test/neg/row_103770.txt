I was typing my suicide letter and literally just 5 minutes after it my teacher asked me how I was doingI said "I'm fine" when I actually wanted to open up to her but it's difficult and nope, it's something I can't bring myself to do. At the same time I felt relieved when typing because writing my feelings down has always helped when everything seemed overwhelming but maybe it's time I just got it over with once and for all; I don't know when yet. I've gotten back to making myself throw up and I'm tired. It'd been a while. Every day I hate myself more. I feel fine some days but the dark days always come back and I don't want to feel like that for the rest of my life. It's very tiring.
