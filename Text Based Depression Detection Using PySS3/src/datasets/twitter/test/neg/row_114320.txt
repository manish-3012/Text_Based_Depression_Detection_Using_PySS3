Please don't click me.I don't want to waste your time.

I helped about 5 people today with various issues but failed to find help for myself. Nobody, not even the people I helped would spend time with me. I don't want to kill myself but if it is the only relied, an escape from the constant loneliness I have been feeling for a number of years.

I wanted to love myself but I can't. I'm too exhausted. If I wake up feeling bad tomorrow I'll just get it over with. I'm sorry I failed you, me. I will forever cherish the hope in your eyes and justice within your heart. Maybe I can try enough for another shot, but I'll leave it up to the universe.
