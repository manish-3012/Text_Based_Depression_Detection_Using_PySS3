Seriously thinking of suicide but know I don't have the balls to do it. Crushed by student loans I know will never go away, minimum wage job, ugly and fat as shit, knowing no one want to be with me.There just isn't a point anymore. I can't get ahead in life. No one will want to be with me with a 350 credit score, 100k+ of debt and being ugly. I'm only 24 and I'm done with everything. Fuck it.
