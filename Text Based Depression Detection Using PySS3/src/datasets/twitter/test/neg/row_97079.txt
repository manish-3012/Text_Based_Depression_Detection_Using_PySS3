tonighti'm done. i lost most of my friends to my abusive ex boyfriend and also recently broke up with my recent boyfriend because of issues i was having with MYSELF. i'm a terrible fuckng person. today is the day. i've been planning this since october (and attempting since i was 14 lmao). the date just kept getting pushed back. i'm no stranger to attempts so it'll be a little less difficult i guess. i'm sorry. i just don't know what to do anymore. i promised my boyfriend i would stay. but now i don't even know where he is and it's so fucking hard to control. i feel terrible. i know there are people who love me and who i can depend on, but i just don't love myself. to everyone i'm going to hurt, i'm so so sorry. this is no one's fault.
