I die on Tuesday. Help me plan my weekend.Nothing will change my mind and I've already set plans in motion.

All I need is some help planning a weekend. I was thinking of going for a walk through my local park, maybe going out for some really expensive food, maybe a movie (something good please I don't want the last movie I watch to be horrible), and maybe something to go visit (I live in the Northwest USA, Portland area so pick something grand or beautiful around me.)

So help me decide.

* Food? Type of food or place in particular.
* Movie? Something good and exciting.
* Somewhere to visit.

Thanks for any replies I get. **&lt;3**
