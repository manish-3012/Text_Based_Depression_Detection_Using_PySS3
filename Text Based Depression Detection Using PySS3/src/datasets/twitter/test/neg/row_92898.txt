Feeling sad/ hopeless (f17)LSo Iâ€™m generally a pretty happy super extroverted person and being locked down without having anything to look forwards to was hard enough but now with school being hell online, and I go in two days a week, I just canâ€™t find any motivation. Iâ€™m behind and feel lost I know I have a future but just canâ€™t see past life always being hard and not worth it. Iâ€™m trying to sleep but all I can think about is weâ€™re all my pills are the only thing stopping me is the idea that I might be happy in the future and that I donâ€™t want to hurt my family. Iâ€™m not depressed I donâ€™t think, I take care of myself, showering, eating, interacting with family. Idk it just I donâ€™t know what to do.
