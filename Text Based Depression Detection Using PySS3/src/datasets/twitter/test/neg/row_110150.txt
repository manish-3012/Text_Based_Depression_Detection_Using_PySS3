Can anyone recommend a OTC drug which I can use as a anti-depressant while in Greece?So I'm severely depressed so much so that I'm on the verge of suicide and am going to go see a doctor when I'm home however I'm currently on holiday and need something, anything to tide me over for the next week I was thinking Tylenol?

Anyone got any suggestions?
