Wanna hang myself when my family leaves to the mallI've always been alone and heavily bullied. I was beaten and bullied aswell a lot by my charismatic psychopathic stepdad. It's killing me to see him get away with it and have a perfect life with a trophy wife and a big house while I'm still stuck on the past. I never had a friend and was heavily bullied. I changed schools a year ago but I can still recall everything they did, people in my new school are nicer but usually dont speak much to me because I'm too shy. I got pushed of stairs, was fasely accused of stealing my bullies money when litteraly she used that "stolen money" to buy snacks later. They'd gang up on me. Give me false overly sarcastic conpliments about my body and laugh if I believed it. I tried to befriend my bully but I was too shy to aproach. So I kept following a nice girl in school during breaks and she took that as me being a stuck up bitch despite me trying to be nice. I really wanted to be her friend, my bully seemed like a cool person to be around when she wasn't mean. I don't know why she hated me so much. I really wanted to be friends. My stepfather always knew how to get in my head and i desperately wanted his affection always. He cheated on my mom twice yet blamed me on the divorce and beated me for it. I used to blame myself for it, still kinda feel like it's my fault.

I can't go outside without thinking about it. If people laugh I think it's because of how ugly I look. And yes I've seen a therapist but my mom doesn't want me to take my medication and takes it away when she can. She always gets angry when I'm sad. They say depression is for the weak, I can't get along with my mother too well because she has big mood switches which makes he entire family miserable. 

I keep having thoughts about the past and today I just feel numb and empty. I wanna hang myself once my family goes to the mall so they can't stop me, and finally rest. Everything hurts too much. Thank you for letting me vent, I just am at the end of the line. I don't know what to do anymore. My life has gone to shit.
