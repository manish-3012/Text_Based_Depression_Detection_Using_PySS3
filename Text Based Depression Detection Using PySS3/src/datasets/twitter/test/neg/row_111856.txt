I am the family fuckup.I don't know how else to put it, I am the family fuckup.

I am 31. I'm married, and I came from a 'normal' family. My dad was an engineer, my mom a teacher, my sister works in the pharmaceutical industry, and my wife is a lawyer. I am a college dropout who is consistently un/under employed.

I'm a fuckup. I'm a failure. I know it. Everyone else knows it. I walk the dog, I clean up the house, I make dinner. Otherwise, I... sit. I stare at walls. I dream about killing myself.

I've taken jobs, from menial to semi-professional. I've spoken to doctors. I've taken medication. I've exercised. I don't know what else to do.

I've tried all the 'normal' things to improve my life. I'm not 'serious' enough for doctors, I guess, and nothing else seems to help.

I've tried, and I've run out of ideas. I drink more and do less. My self harm increases. I try to work up the courage to cut my throat or hang myself.

I am fairly sure that unless I try to kill myself and fail noone can be bothered to help me, but I don't have the courage to try seriously because I might succeed, I guess.

thanks for reading.
