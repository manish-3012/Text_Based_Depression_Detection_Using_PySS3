HappinessEver since I can remember iâ€™ve never felt true happiness, iâ€™ve felt small bursts of joy here and there from natural things like doing good on a test and things like that but here I am at 17 almost 18 and I havenâ€™t ever actually felt happy. Friends, Girlfriend none of them make me happy, I never had family really and Iâ€™m adopted so this void always sits inside me that I truly belong nowhere and am always alone. I shoved everyone away from me, cut bonds with everyone I knew, gave up school, gave up trying to do good in life, stopped eating, stopped working out. Ive never felt empathy or sympathy for others, I donâ€™t understand what love is because growing up I never really felt it. Idek where iâ€™m going with this post. I guess I just wanted to put this out there that true happiness is something you should treasure. some of us canâ€™t find it and probably never will, iâ€™ve been thinking more and more of how to end it and I think iâ€™ll do it on christmas because it seems fitting. The day of happiness maybe then i can die happy. no more pain. no more emptiness. no more loneliness. also idk if saying that is a no no in this reddit thread but if you delete itâ€™s okay, iâ€™m just venting anyways
