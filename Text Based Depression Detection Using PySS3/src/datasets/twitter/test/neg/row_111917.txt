Perfect lifeI suppose this is very ridiculous to insinuate- but basically, I've had such a wonderful upbringing that well, I don't really see the point in living on. I've hit the genetic jackpot and experienced almost all there is to experience on this earth. I feel like people are happy because they have a sense of purpose, like they live to earn wealth and use it to experience new things. So as long as they don't fall into poverty or encounter major pitfalls during their pursuit, they're happy. 

And yes, meanwhile I'm just sitting here whining about how my life has been so perfect, that everything has become meaningless to me. Whatever wealth can unlock, I have unlocked. It's like everyone's still running a race, and I'm sitting alone at the finish line. What's the point of living when it's only going to get worse from here on?

 I used to say that school or work or whatever commitment, made me so busy with no time for me to catch a breather. Then I realized that wasn't true. I gave myself no breathers. Because now is the "resting" period and I'm spending it shut in and crying my eyes out. 

My SO just left me recently. Or that's what I assume, he just stopped talking to me altogether. Romance was the one thing I didn't have, and I told myself that I'd stick around and live as a moral duty- to make him happy. But I'm a terrible person and he left. 

The only logical step from here on is to die, but I'm too much of a coward, I fear the pain of falling too much.
