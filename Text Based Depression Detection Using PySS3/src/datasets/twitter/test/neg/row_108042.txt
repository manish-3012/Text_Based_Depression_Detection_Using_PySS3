Gf makes me cry all the time, but i love her a lot.She is very irritable at times, though she can also be very loving and intimate. Yesterday, her washing machine stopped working, and she went mad at me when i asked her to check how old it is, and which company it is...she told me i was only making her angrier. 
She also has a new guy friend whom she goes out with quite often, but blames me for being insecure if i object. 
I know you will all ask me to leave her , but i still love her a lot, and i feel intensely sad whenever i think of happier times, and all that we planned together. 
I often feel suicidal, but im not sure if killing myself is worth it. I dont give a fuck about my own life, death can hardly be worse than my present state of living, but i somehow feel that it may make my gf and my mom sad. I do care about them. :(
