I dont see any other choiceHello, let me give you a quick walkthrough of whats happening. I am a person i think, i lack alot of qualities that makes someone human. I have no ambition, i have no dream, i have nothing i can pursue, i just labor away hours and hours, day after day. With nothing inbetween, i have no love life, why should i? Im boring, ugly, fat and lazy, and all that stuff, and thats one thing, but i also have no friends so i spend all of my free time either alone or with strangers on the internet. I dont know how to go on like this, im so lonely, my family cant care less, along with that not only am i too tired to do anything, im too scared, i cant strike up conversation, i can barely mouth out a "Hello" most of the time. Also a angry miserable person, i have caught myself badmouthing people more than i am willing to admit, because i cant stand seeing others going "Life is great!" or anything like that, it pushes me into a literal rage, as does playing games, drawing, and even doing nothing, i am a angry angry person, i put holes in my walls for no reason, i have inflicted self harm but im great at hiding that, bcuz im fat and wear a sweater 24/7. So yeah, if nothing comes from this im going to jump out of my window. Thanks
