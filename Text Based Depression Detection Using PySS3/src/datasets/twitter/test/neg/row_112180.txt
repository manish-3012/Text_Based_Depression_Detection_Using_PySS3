The last few weeks have been rough.I came here to try and discuss through my thoughts and behaviors recently. I donâ€™t want to take away from the people who are really close to suicide. 

The last few weeks have been rough. Iâ€™ve been asking myself â€œwhatâ€™s the point?â€ every time I look at my future, and I know there is a point, but I just canâ€™t see the value in it. 

I held an unloaded gun to my head just to see what it would feel like, several times. Iâ€™ve thought about loading the gun and doing the same thing, but I havenâ€™t had it in me to do that yet.

I self harmed for the first time in five months. 

Iâ€™ve felt like I have no control over myself, and that Iâ€™m a burden to my family Iâ€™m living with. 

Iâ€™ve hit a few points where Iâ€™ve felt that the only thing I enjoy on a daily basis isnâ€™t my life, but things like video games or reading, things that get me away. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m always sad. Iâ€™m just concerned I guess. Does anyone have any support? Anything to say?
