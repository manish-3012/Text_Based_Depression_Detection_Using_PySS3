I want to give up but I don't have that option.Back in August my little brother hung himself. Just a couple of weeks after my birthday. And what they say about the risk of suicide feels true because today I woke up after a heart-breaking night and all I want to do is die. But he took that option from me. I want to hurt myself so that I don't feel like this. Fuck him.
