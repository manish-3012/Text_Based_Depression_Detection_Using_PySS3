Thoughts but no intentHas anyone ever had suicidal thoughts... to the point of writing a letter, loading a gun.. but knowing they were too scared of dying to even do it as they did it?   This was me last year and I have no idea why i did either if i knew i didnt want to die. I knew i was too chicken to do it. So why did i write the letter n load the gun? 

Makes no sense.

P.s. im on the upside of my depression now. Thinking clear. Suicidal thoughts are gone. Just looking for support and answers for my once hard time
