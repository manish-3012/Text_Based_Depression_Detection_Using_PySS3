Too stupidI've not had a hard life and I'm in one of the best positions I've ever been in. Good job with good pay and colleagues that are intelligent and kind. Parents and friends that love me. 

My father offered me a gun for protection and I'm thinking about taking it but for a different reason. I realized over the course of the past few months that I'm not on the same level as my colleagues. I stumble and am stagnant while they kick out fast fixes for issues. My senior dev rewrote a flow with 25 files modified and created  in 2 days, my sophomore colleague has had his nose to the grindstone with data management, my direct colleague kicks out fixes and closes bugs daily. All while I sit staring, failing to get environments running, testing and retesting only to find results change likely due to my negligence the first time around, wondering how I could be this pathetic. I've got the looks of a homunculus, the personality of a ramp moldy towel, the dexterity and strength of a jellyfish. I grew up being told I was smart and I breezed through school, and I always believed it up to about 6 months ago. If I don't have my intelligence I have effectively nothing, so maybe with nothing left I'll be finished soon enough. The only thing keeping me here now is how much I desperately don't want to let all those people down further

I'm even making this post just for the sake of getting it off my chest and maybe gaining some validation in the process, and I find that so vain and shitty.

Regardless of your response,thank you for your time.
