Please help me help my brother (x/post depression)This is a bit long and complicated, but basically my older brother (23) is in his final year of college and having a massively awful time. That's an understatement though, from what he tells me he lives in constant fear of his grades no matter how hard he works, suffers from panic attacks, loathes himself, has no real friends (only "placeholders"), and tells me that if it weren't for his family and solace of home he would have killed himself already... 

I only learned about this today though, before I knew him as somebody who pushed through any circumstance no matter the challenge. He's highly charismatic and loving, and seems to make friends quickly when he's in new workplaces. He's very hardworking at work, but seems to struggle in other areas of casual life I guess. He always came across as level headed and ambitious, but now it seems like he's afraid all of his work will collapse at any moment. He says that no matter how hard he works his grades seem to be unsteady. I believe everything that he told me, but now as his brother (20) I feel helpless.

 I want to do everything in my power to show him that he can do it and he has the strength. He's always been an inspiration to me, which I've told him. But I don't want to sugarcoat it and tell him he'll make it through that last year of college, because I can't tell the future. 

What can I do? What should I do? What shouldn't I do? 

please help
