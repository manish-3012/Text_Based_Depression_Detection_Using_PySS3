I finally found something to live forA few days ago, I went out and adopted some guinea pigs! If I kill myself, who will feed the guineas? Who will play with them? Replenish their water? When I get the urge, I think of my guineas, and I begin to cool down. I'm feeling greater than I have in a while, too. :\^)
