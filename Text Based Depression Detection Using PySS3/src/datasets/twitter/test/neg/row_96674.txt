Best friend attempted suicide using Xanax?Background: He's suffered from mental illness (Bipolar II and takes Latuda) and suicidal ideation for awhile now. We've both had Xanax issues/ dependencies.| He's been placed under the Baker Act about a year and a half ago for having a manic episode at my house. Luckily this occurred while he was with me because I work at an inpatient psychiatry facility so I knew how to go about this.| I was placed under the Baker Act for suicidal ideation about a year ago. I didn't have to stay fortunately because my father is a surgeon at that hospital, and they released me to him. I am currently on Cymbalta.| We both joke about suicide (IT IS NOT A JOKE. WE PROB JUST USE HUMOR TO COPE.) We've even researched the lethal dose of Xanax, which was soooooo high that the site said it was a relatively safe drug in terms of suicide (obviously not in terms with risk of dependency and addictions).

We bought "the things" from our usual guy. He has an actual script from a psychiatrist, so they are real. After we obtained the "things", my best friend and I hung out that same night... watched YouTube videos, laughed, talked about how we're going back to school, want to start going to the gym, etc. He took 6mg and I took 3mg. I am a 5'2, 105lbs 22 year old girl while he is a 6'2, prob 135?lbs 23 year old guy. There is no romantic relationship at all. He is not attracted to women.

Monday- I heard nothing from him all day, which isn't a big deal. We usually text/ talk every day but I wouldn't be shaken if he doesn't reply one day. I woke up at 1pm on Tuesday (yes, I'm very lazy lol) to 2 texts. One at 8am, "So I somehow took all the pills on Sunday... then just totally slept through work yesterday and i'm just now coming to" then at 12pm, "So basically I tried to kill myself and it didn't work :)" I thought he was joking. I said, "Uhh... why would you take them all just to fall asleep when you could've just taken a few? lol" and he said "Bc I was trying to die?"

That's when I became very worried. I made him call his psychiatrist and his dad or that I was going to pick him up and go to the hospital immediately. He called his psych and dad, and then they drove to the hospital. He is currently placed under the Baker Act now.

I guess I just needed to vent. I know that when a person attempts suicide, they become desensitized and more likely to attempt again. He left no suicide note and even had plans for next week.

Anyways, yeah. Just needed to vent to anonymous people, I guess... I just can't vent to my friends or family because I don't want to reveal that he had attempted because that's not their business. Yeah so just don't mind me... 

Thanks if you read this all... If you have any comments or stories you'd like to share, please do. I'm bored and stressed and would love to get my mind off this and vent.
