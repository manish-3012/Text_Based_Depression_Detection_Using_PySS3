No one cares about me so whatâ€™s the point of living?I have no point in living if no one is going to give a crap about me. No one even wants to do anything with me. I never had any irl friends, Iâ€™ve never had a girl friend, online friends always leave me, the best online friend I ever had left me over a month ago, people that say they want to be my friends just abandon me, and people hardly respond to these posts anymore while everyone else gets dozens of comments. Why does everyone hate me? I didnâ€™t you anything to them. I just want people to care about me but everyone refuses to. No one will even care if I just kill myself and people who say they do r just lying because they would have said that before.
