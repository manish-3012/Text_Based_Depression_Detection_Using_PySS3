I ruined my life a year ago. Now I want out.About 18 months ago I decided I was trans and started the process, even changing my name. I've never been less happy. I want my old self back. I no longer try to pass myself off as a woman but I have already changed my name and body. I am horrified at having to spend the rest of my life like this. When I see myself in the mirror I feel both a sense of immense detachment, scientific curiosity, horror, rage, regret...

In retrospect I did this because my life was already sucking severely and I was (and still am) totally empty empty inside. I just had nothing else to pursue and I think, in part, I wanted to make myself interesting someway. I didn't do any research and just jumped right in, with nothing to lose I thought. 

This is only one of the reasons I am getting close to suicide. I don't have any friends, career, or anything to fill this void. I have one hobby (music), but I am a hack and I think I'm too insecure at the core to really make anything resembling art . No confidence, no attention span. However after work I basically spend all day singing and playing and recording myself, much to my frustration as I sound flat and awful. My guitar hasn't ever helped me and this weekend I am planning on selling or donating all my gear.

Recently my mom came to visit me and she stayed with me in my motel room that I live in. She seemed desperate to take me back home to the Midwest and turn my life around. I didn't go back.

I really hope I can find a way out of this. To be honest I wonder if I'm just supposed to commit suicide. Perhaps my brain, already afflicted from chemical imbalance and lack of stimulation, staged its rebellion against the circumstances to push me to the brink. 
I've definitely been prone to some self-destructive behavior in the past, but never went about something so impulsively before.
