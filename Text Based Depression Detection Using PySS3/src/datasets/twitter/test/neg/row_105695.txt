Think I am ready to die.I suffer from Aspergers and likely to suffer from bipolar depressive and recently I decided to drink my self into oblivion whilst using drugs (can't remember what they are). I passed out but sadly I woke up and now I think I am ready to die. 

I don't know if I can fully go through with it though.
