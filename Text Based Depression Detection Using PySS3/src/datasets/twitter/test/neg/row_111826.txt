I'm ashamed, I'm scared and at least I know whyYou can describe me as depressed, suicidal, and queer. 

I'm privileged and I do nothing with it. I'm the worst kind of person because I can't even stand up for who I am. I am part of the problem and I am doing nothing. I don't know how to get going or if I even have the strength. If I don't do something, I will keep in this cycle of shame and depression as long as I can handle. I'm reaching my limits.
