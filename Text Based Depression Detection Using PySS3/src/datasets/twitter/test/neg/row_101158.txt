Bipolar disorder is causing me to witness my own decay.I, for a long time have been dealing with bipolar disorder. While the up's are divine, the low's are too horrible to even describe. My depressive phases tend to last from 2 up to 4 months. 4 months of ineptitude,tiredness, boredom, sadness, psychotic symptoms with the cherry on the top emotional numbness. On the top of that i have unconsciously spiraled into nihilism and i feel as nothing but a disposable commodity in the eyes of time. Life became a chore.
