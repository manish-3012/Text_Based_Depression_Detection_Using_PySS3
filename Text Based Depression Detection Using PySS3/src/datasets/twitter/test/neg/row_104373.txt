Feeling BurdensomeI"m quitting my job this week because my fibromyalgia and mental health are making it impossible to do. This means that at 25 I am going to be fully supported by my parents again. I'm beginning to feel as though I'm an immense burden and that with my mental health and chronic pain I will never not be one. It's bringing up some thoughts that my family would be better off without me. I don't believe I will act on it, but having the thought in my mind is causing me a lot of distress.
