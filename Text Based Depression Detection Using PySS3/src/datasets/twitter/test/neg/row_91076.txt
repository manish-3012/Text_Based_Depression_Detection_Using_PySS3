I'd rather be dead than deal with this.I'm young, yeah, I fucking get it. I'm so sick of hearing that, like "Oh you're young! Once you actually move out you really won't want to." Seriously? When I hit 18, I'm getting the fuck out of here. I'm literally close to fucking killing myself because I'm sick of this verbally abusive household. I want to fucking slit my god damn wrists I'm so sick of this. Why am I even writing this, fuck this 
Goodbye old friends.
