Running out of hope for the futureHello all, as I'm writing this I currently have a crypto-currency trade open, as soon as it auto finalizes I will be sending the funds to a different wallet so I that I can purchase a fatal dose of fentanyl. My girlfriend of 2 years left me a few months ago and I have been staying at my parents house ever since. I have a long and very shitty relationship with my mom for years now (25M) .My mom is a narcissistic bitch whom kicked me out of the house as an adolescent for wanting to have friends and for wanting to go out and be a kid, when I was about 5 years old my mom left my father and re-married. My whole life I have literally been the family punching bag, they used to make me do all of the household chores and they would never split the work up between my brothers, fast forward to a few years and to this day these kids (my half brothers, stepdads kids) have never picked up a fucking sponge. Instead my parents have a maid that comes and cleans the house but still if there is anything that needs to be done like the dishes or etc I'm the fkn dish bitch that they call to come clean up the mess.

When I was about 14 years old I remember one summer they woke me up and sent me outside to go into the backyard to clean up the pool, I was out there all day in the heat and they wouldn't let me come inside until it was done, my step dads stupid ass forgot to put the cover on the pool so for months it had been rained in, leaves had fallen in, mosquito larvae out the ass and there were even a few snakes. They gave me a rake and had me rake up all of the wet, nasty, mosquito infested leaves and then bag them up into yard bags. It took me the whole day.

Now really that story wouldn't be a big deal if my parents didn't have so many fucking kids!!!! Still to this day these kids are spoiled! They have everything they need and they've never had to do so much as to pick up a fkn sponge or load the dishwasher.

My step dads kids will never know what its like to be kicked out on the street, they will never know what its like to not have a loving father figure, they will never know the pain of being mistreated because you're mother remarried and "these bad ass kids arent mine"

I have 1 full blood brother who has the same mom and father as me but unfortunately he passed away 2 years ago at the ripe age of 19 years old. My mom kicked him out at 18 years old, he didnt even last 2 years on his own.

My mom told me to kill myself already just the other day. I will be sure to let everyone know why I turned out the way I did
