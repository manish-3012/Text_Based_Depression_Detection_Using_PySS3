Been suicidal for the last couple months. Just want to put an end to my painI have been chronically depressed and anxious for over 4 years now, I am 22 and I donâ€™t have any friends, my first girlfriend who of only 4 months dumped me a month ago for me not being social and now is with a guy better looking than me, Iâ€™m still a virgin at 22, Iâ€™m in my 2nd year of community college. Looking at me you probably wouldnâ€™t think I was suffering the way I am because I am a decent looking guy who is in really good shape but I am crippled my depression and social anxiety. I even am on Zoloft and see a therapist every couple weeks. I am boring, not funny or charismatic and I live life in constant disarray and struggle I have been strong for so long and donâ€™t know how much longer I can go. I donâ€™t like to go out and party like most 20 some year olds and I have been a loner and I hate it . Itâ€™s been a battle with myself and being in my head for many years now I donâ€™t have any hope that things will change I feel it would be so much easier just to end it you know?
