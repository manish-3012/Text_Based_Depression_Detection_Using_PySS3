Someone to talk toMy family and friends have left me feeling trapped. I can't talk about my suicidal thoughts to anyone, because I have been told by my parents, cousins, friends, and therapist that they would immediately send me to the hospital if I mentioned anything. At the same time, they told me to not be scared of telling them. My feelings fade in and out, what if I feel fine an hour later and I'm being thrown into a hospital? I can't trust anyone I know to know how I feel. I am scheduled to kill myself tomorrow around 11, but I'm on the fence about it. I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I just want to talk to someone. I've talked to a few people on this subreddit in pms, but communication either dropped off, or the questions were getting way too personal. I just want someone in real life to know how I feel without trying to lock me away.
