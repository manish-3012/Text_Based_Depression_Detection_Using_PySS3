SAD!I want to write a suicide note and just leave it somewhere in my room, so that if i die from some random accident, everyone will know that i didn't try and stop it and that i'm not some poor soul who was taken tragically. I'm not some idiot who messed up and died, I'm someone who wants you to feel true sorrow for pushing me down this far.


                                                                  Sincerely yours, 
                                                 The Failure Drop-Out Son
