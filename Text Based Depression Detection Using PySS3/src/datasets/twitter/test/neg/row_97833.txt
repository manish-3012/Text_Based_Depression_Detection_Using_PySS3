Part of me doesn't want to die, but I feel like I have no other choice.I'm going to fail two classes this semester, I owe my old school over 3000 dollars, I owe my current school money as well and can't register for classes. 

I fucking despise the person I am despite trying to change. sometimes things will be good for a couple days or weeks even, but I always go back to this state, it's been like this for over a decade. 

I always have anxiety. both my parents suffer from mental illness and not only do I think it's hereditary, I also think it's rubbed off on me in an irreversible way. I can't remember the last time I was happy. my anxiety is so bad that I won't do homework assignments or other things because I'm worried I can't do them, before even trying. I know what you're thinking, I should just do them, but my brain is broken and I can't take it. 

everyone has cut off contact with my dad so I'm the only one who talks to him and he suffers from worse shit than I do, and it all gets out on me. 

I can't sleep at night. I'm always worried or panicking or crying or hating myself. mostly because I know its my own fault and I can't fix it. 

I have started writing my note, which is basically just an apology to everyone for wasting their time and money. 

I think I am going to buy a helium tank from Walmart and try to make an exit bag, I just need to find the right place where I won't be disturbed. 

I've always fantasized about dying, I think my time is up. I can't do this anymore.
