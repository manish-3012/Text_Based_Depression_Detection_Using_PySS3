It wont leaveI started off depression due to me not being able to be happy with myself when i cant be happy about a certain thing about me i would find some thing that did make me happy but through time i would relieze that the thing that made me happy was just a lie which i told myself and so it leads to the same severe depression this has happened for 4 years and its never gonna get better i dont wanna die just severely injury myself and get out of life for awhile
