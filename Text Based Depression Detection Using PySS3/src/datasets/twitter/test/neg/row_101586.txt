I feel lost and desperate. Failed to kill myself once and I'm very close to trying it again.So, my life since around 2008 was just a never ending snowball of poor life choices.

I met this girl online. She was amazing and 110% just like me, we seemed like the perfect fit for each other. The problem is that she lived in another country. We were determined to make it work though, so we went on. After 1 year, the opportunity arrived and she took a trip to my country so we could meet up. We immediately confirmed what we already felt. Since her tourist visa wouldn't let her stay here for more than 2 months, we made a decision. We would get married right away, if things wouldn't work out for some reason, we would just get a divorce. 



At the time it seemed like a good decision. I inherited a home and lived in it by myself. I had a decent job and I was going to college to fulfill my dream of becoming a Doctor. 

It was wonderful for an year, until things started to go to shit. Due to a lot of issues, I wasn't able to continue college because I didn't have the money for it anymore. My wife was having issues with learning the language, so she couldn't work. Since I wasn't in college anymore, we tried to move into her country because it is an english speaking country and we could both work and I could hopefully resume my education there.



Well, this country had ridiculous immigration laws, so we could never find a sponsor to help us out. Her parents promised to help, but only if I could go visit them first. We did so, and they didn't like me. They never said why but the truth is that they just didn't like that I was a foreigner and thought that I'd eventually keep their daughter away from them forever (already had done so for 2 years), so, the move to another country plan was busted.


Fast-forward another year, and my wife was very depressed. I could tell that her only motivation was her love for me and how great we were for each other. She had spent 3 years on total not working and struggling to speak to others. Looking back at it, it was my fault. I should've helped her more but I was so focused on work at that time.



I ended up losing the job I had. We struggled financially for months. I had to sell my car. We had constant arguments and the entire situation was grinding our relationship a lot. I was desperately looking for a solution but I couldn't find it.



In the end, we had a huge argument. It turned violent, I broke a few things and yelled a lot. I said a lot of things I shouldn't have said. I tried to kill myself by jumping off the building I live on, I actually barely did so but my wife and a neighbor pushed me back when I began leaning forward. They called the police, and I spent 3 days on a suicide watch facility.  In the end, just by looking at her face I knew that it was all over. She packed her stuff and told me she was going back to her country and that we should divorce. I didn't try to resist or to protest. 



The last bits happened around 7 months ago. Now we are trying to deal with the divorce. She still wants to be my friend, although I can barely handle talking to her.
I feel defeated. I feel that my life is a failure. 


I'm almost 30. I have a very shitty job that barely pays bills. I lost what I still consider to be the love of my life. I don't have a vehicle anymore and going back to college now looks like a very distant thought out of a madman's dream. I think that my ex sees this and that's why she is trying to help me.


I feel truly lost reddit..I feel that I had EVERYTHING and that little by little I lost it all. If only I had the chance to be with that person with nothing external in the way, I'd be so happy. If only I could've had finished College. If only I had never met anyone to begin with. I really just want my life back but I know I can't have it.



I really just want to end this. I had a chance in life but it was taken from me. There is nothing out there for me anymore. I'm stuck having a shitty job and a lot of debt. I've tried to look for a way out but truly there is none. I'm at my wits' end and to me suicide looks like the only way out for me. The only thing keeping me back is the divorce process, I don't want to force my ex to come back here and deal with everything by herself. When that's out of the way though, there will be nothing else in my mind.
