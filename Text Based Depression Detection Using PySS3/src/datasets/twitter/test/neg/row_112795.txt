I'm scared shitless of ever opening up again because of thisSo, last semester up at college, I had a terrible situation that happened. I've been struggling with depression for almost my whole college career, due to a lot of shit that happened in my past - and sometimes I just have some pretty rough days. Suicide has always been an option in the back of my mind, and there are a few times I've actually thought about it pretty seriously. But I've never actually attempted it.
Anyways, I've found that talking to people anonymously on the internet is really helpful for me. It's a way to get my feelings out there without burdening my friends, and without having to worry about being judged. And several times, I've talked about suicide. This last time, I guess I took it a bit too far. I made a post on Yik Yak that was along the lines of "pretty serious about actually doing it tonight" - but I was really just looking for people to talk to. Apparantly though, the police found out about the post. They showed up at my doorstep the NEXT DAY, when I was feeling much better, and started questioning me. They didn't listen, and weren't respectful at all. And they ended up putting me in handcuffs and taking me to the hospital. I ended up hospitalized for a week, and it completely fucked up my life. Because I was taking a heavy courseload, I ended up having to withdraw from the semester. This caused me to lose several student leadership roles that I had worked very hard to achieve, and it messed up my plans of graduating this spring. Not to mention, it humilated me in front of my entire neighborhood. The whole situation was completely unneccessary, and now I have a record of this shit that'll follow me for the rest of my life.

The only thing this experience has accomplished is showing me that I can't trust ANYONE. It's made me even more closed off from the world than I already was. I'm afraid to even get close to people because I'm worried they'll label me as "mentally ill." And I know I'm not the only one. Why does our system have to be this way? Isn't it your life, and can't you end it if you want to? I feel like treating suicide like a crime actually makes the issue worse.
