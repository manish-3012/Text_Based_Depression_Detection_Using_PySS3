Can't Trust Myself TonightI've been back and forth about committing suicide all day. It's now 5 PM and dark. I know it'll be another long night because I can never sleep. When everyone else goes to bed, I feel so alone...

Don't know if tonight is the night... I really wish I could see a way out, but right now I'm not able to. It's too painful...
