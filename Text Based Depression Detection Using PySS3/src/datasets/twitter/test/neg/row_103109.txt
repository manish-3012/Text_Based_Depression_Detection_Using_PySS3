Living in constant pain and sadnessEveryday starts the same way and it ends the same way.I am afraid to get out of my bed in the morning because there is no reason for me to get up.Everything I do is mediocre at best and that hurts me,I have no achivements,I suck even at the things I like the most.

I have no friends ( past 20 you canâ€™t really create the same bonding with people like you would in middle school or highschool ) , never had a girlfriend, I am an ugly lonely man that is afraid to leave his house.

Victim of bullying,social rejection,poverty,broken family and lack of stability.I wish I could end it all but for some reason I grew up to be religious and I am afraid of how that would affect my after life (silly right?)
