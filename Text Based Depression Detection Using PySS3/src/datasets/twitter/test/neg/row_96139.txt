Yay, it's me again.Only this time it's goodbye. I tried to strangle myself again today and made it further than last time. I either put the laces too high or didn't go tight enough because I was still able to pump blood fine except for when I gulped. Then my adam's apple pulled the laces really tight and I could definitely feel like that was strangling me.

Oh well, lesson for next time.

I've decided to throw everything away and go be homeless for a time. I've got to try something new because I just can't keep going on like this.

So I'm sorry SW, you guys were some of the best people I've met so far. I really regret that I cannot be here for you anymore.

EDIT: Well I'm back. Or more precisely, I never left. I missed the bus I was going to take because it took longer to get to the depot than I thought. The next bus was at 10 pm. I waited, I got bored, I went walking. It was really beautiful out. The wind was warm and gentle, it was sunny and there were trees that were starting to bud. It felt like spring and it was really calm and soothing. The kind of moment you can live for.

I decided that I can always be homeless later. It's probably going to happen anyway because I've not had much luck finding a job. Might as well take advantage of a good situation for as long as one can.

Normally I would put something in here about seeking help but to be honest I'm not going to. I've always resisted going to the counsellors. Even if I do manage to get myself there I always stop going after awhile. There isn't really any reason for it, it's just an impulse that I've not managed to resist. I have little discipline or willpower.

Though part of it is this idea that the healthcare system is overburdened and that my problems seem so little and stupid compared to those in the hospital it seems right to just manage as best as I can.

I was thinking about it a lot last night and I think another reason is that maybe I like a little drama in my life. There is so much pludging through day after day that I feel a little crazy after awhile. I think I want to scream and storm, that I've been holding these things in for a whole lifetime and have never had an outlet and it always comes out eventually somehow doesn't it?

So I'm still here. I will do my best to grow and to listen to others. I will study some philosophy in the hopes of distilling some wisdom useful to me. I will continue to program and study math because it makes my mind sharper.

I think I grew a little a bit. I think I'm a little stronger. Somebody posted a quote from Micheal Jordan about how he succeeds because he repeatedly fails and I think I'm ready for that.

â€œI have missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot .. and missed. And I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why... I succeed.â€
