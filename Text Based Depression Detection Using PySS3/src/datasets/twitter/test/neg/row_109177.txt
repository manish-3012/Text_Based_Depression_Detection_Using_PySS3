Suicide?So my "friend" sent me pictures of her self harm my, girlfriend tried to kill herself last night  and it's breaking me  I know she's bad for me she's self harmed in front of me before and had multiple break downs in front of me where all times the police have to be involved so she gets sectioned  I've had enough of evreything death just feels so inviting I've got so much going on in my own head and I don't know if I can truly live I even visualise feeling alive tomorrow
