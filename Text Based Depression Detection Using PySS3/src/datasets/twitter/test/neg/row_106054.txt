Whatâ€™s the Point?Iâ€™m Minx and Iâ€™m a 16 year old that has everything but no point to live. Iâ€™m so sick of all the people that look at me sitting alone when I could be sitting with them. I drifted from the real world and brought myself to my real passion which was gaming and online friends and for now the second time Ive cause the group I looked forward to playing with everyday and Iâ€™ve fucked it up. Iâ€™m fucking worthless and everyone says it. Iâ€™m just a tool people get to blame things on and I donâ€™t even know what they are blaming me for. My cuts are getting deeper and deeper. God Iâ€™m a fucking worthless person and I donâ€™t belong here I donâ€™t know why I am even typing this I mean itâ€™s not like anyone actually reads these anyways. Iâ€™m even more worthless for that. I just wish I could go back to the good olâ€™days. The world is evolving and Iâ€™m stuck. Maybe itâ€™s better if I just leave this awful world because like I said â€œWhatâ€™s the Point Anymore.â€
