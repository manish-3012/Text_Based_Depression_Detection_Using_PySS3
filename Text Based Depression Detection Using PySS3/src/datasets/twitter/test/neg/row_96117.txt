I keep fucking up and being burdensome when Iâ€™m not that interesting to begin withI have no aspirations or goals that feel worthwhile. Every day itâ€™s harder and harder to get out of bed and today I just feel like I hit a tipping point. None of the jobs Iâ€™ve been applying for have called back and I always fail the interview. 

Iâ€™ve just been screaming and sobbing for hours thinking about how I just bum out the few friends I have and even when Iâ€™m stable I donâ€™t talk about anything interesting. I feel like my entire personality is through the media I consume. Thereâ€™s literally nothing else.

Iâ€™m trying to find ways to self sabotage myself instead of doing anything else because I love my family and close friends and. I want to call a helpline but am terrified Iâ€™ll get police called. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m just rambling and Iâ€™ve never even posted something like this before. Iâ€™m just home alone today and canâ€™t think of anything else
