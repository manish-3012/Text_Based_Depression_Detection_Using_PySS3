I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI feel so trapped. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™m in my early 20â€™s now and I feel like life is just getting worse by the day. A few months ago, my cousin who sufferers from a severe mental disorder tried to kill me. He broke in my door and I was very fortunate to have my boyfriend there to defend me. This is just one of the most recent incidents. 
My entire life I have been verbally abused by everyone in my household. I alway tried really hard to save money but my mother always took it from me. This added to my everyday stresses. I feel like I can never get out of this house. I have told my mother and my aunt that I want to kill my self for years. And all I was told was to just do it. I have 2 dogs now and theyâ€™re the only things keeping me going. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t know how I feel and I canâ€™t tell him because he said he doesnâ€™t want to hear about my depression. I am so tired everyday. I hate my job, I dropped out of school because I am too tired, I pay too many bills and I canâ€™t save enough to get out. My entire life I looked forward to being 18 so I could leave. That came and went. I have no friends. I am always broke. It seems like no one cares for me. I have tried to reach out, and I get no response. I wrote my note. But I feel like throwing it away since it doesnâ€™t matter and no one cares. Iâ€™m trying very hard. But if I canâ€™t figure something out Iâ€™m gone soon. I tried to hang myself twice and stood up. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so depressed always. I got professional help at one point but it didnâ€™t work for me. So do I just deserve to die? I mean I have nothing, I do nothing except work 6 days a week.
