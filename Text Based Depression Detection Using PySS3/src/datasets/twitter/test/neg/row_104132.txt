I should be fixing my resume and looking for a new job. instead I've been writing suicide notes.I've been emotionally bouncing up and down the last month or two, but I'm back to feeling like a waste of potential.  I'm a first year teacher that had a rough year, and I do/don't have a job next year (technically do, but basically been assured I'll be given a "do not rehire" at the end of next year if I stay in the county I'm in).  Trying to transfer in-county, but my principal won't recommend me so no one will take me and she said that no one is willing to take me on, which just affirms my feeling of being a failure.  I mentally committed to killing myself a few weeks ago but promised that I wouldn't do it until school is out because I couldn't do that to the kids I taught this year.  I've got a couple other things planned for the next couple weeks that I feel like I have to do, so I'm still biding my time.  I still don't know how I'm going to do it, but right now I just feel like I'm a walking time bomb that will go off at some point before August.

The bottom line is I have never had a strong drive to do things, and lately I have had practically no drive.  It's maddening to know the potential I have and be unable to achieve it.  I just can't take being a failure anymore.  From a hypothetical standpoint, I completely understand all the logistical reasons for not doing it (I'm only 28, still lots of life to live, etc) but in practice I just can't convince myself that the world is better off with me in it because I don't believe I can be fixed.

Additionally, I'm incredibly lonely - even when I try to confide in friends, I never feel a reciprocity which always leads me to feel like I am a burden and that they don't really care about me.  Trying to recover from being left by my fiance nearly two years ago, I still can't bring myself to actually contact new people or go on dates because I have this belief that no one could love me if I can't love myself.  And right now, I can't stand who I am.

Anyways, these are the reasons why I'm writing suicide notes instead of sending out my resume.  I just don't see the path continuing much further.  Going to bed now.  If you have any idea what steps I should take over the next couple weeks to make myself care about my life, I'm open to hearing it.
