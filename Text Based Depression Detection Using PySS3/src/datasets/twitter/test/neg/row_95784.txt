Most of my life wasted. I genuinely don't think there is a way out of this hell.My parents homeschooled me growing up, I was severely socially isolated. Looking back now my childhood sucked, and now I am a clueless 19 year old adult.

I work a restaurant job and that's about it. I get bullied there everyday and that is making me more depressed as well. I want a new job but I have no fucking idea what to do. I have my job, I hate where I live (with my annoying parents), and I hate my life. I have severe social anxiety as well. It's tempting to end it idk. I just don't think I will ever be able to improve. Too scared to talk to a therapist.
