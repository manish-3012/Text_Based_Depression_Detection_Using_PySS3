What's the point?I have been working in audit at a big four in Germany for about a year now and my hours are ridiculous. I barely do anything other than work. I hate it too. In fact, I'm ashamed I work in audit. Some people at the firm are so proud of their job. At the introduction day they congratulated us and said we were so fortunate to be selected to work there but I wonder if they believe their own bullshit. We're fucking slaves, nothing more. Salary is ridiculously low. Audit is the most unchallenging, repetitive job ever. And what does it contribute to society ffs? It's just compliance basically. It barely adds any value.

I feel like I can't go anywhere too. I started working there because I have always dreamt of moving to the United States. I wanted to work in a multinational with a great reputation in the US and somehow get some kind of transfer. Actually, I've always wanted to work in consulting but my grades were not good enough. This will probably sound ungrateful or maybe even condescendant but I feel like I already settled for audit. I won't be able to get a better job. How on earth will I ever be successful enough to move to the US? I'm at a dead end. In life. In my career. In everything. I wonder why people work so much when most people hate their jobs.

I don't have a lot of friends either. Probably because I'm depressed and insecure af. So in conclusion; my life basically consists of working a job I hate. There's nothing in my life worth living for. I'm just waiting for the day I finally have the courage to end it all.
