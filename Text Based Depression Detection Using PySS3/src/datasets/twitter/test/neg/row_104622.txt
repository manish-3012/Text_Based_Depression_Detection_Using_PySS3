Getting off Twitter, unfollowing all subs except r/aww makes a big differenceThere's so many problems and the goal of the media is to make them all our personal problems (quote from a woke podcast)

Stay safe take care y'all we got this I promise, I feel a lot better from a few days ago. Baby steps
