I'm easily replaceableBoth of my parents are dead, my friends/family in different citys/states and aside of a few plants (yes, leafy, inanimate household plants) in my apartment, I don't have anyone I'm constantly in contact with or anyone that I need to care for. I have such bad anxiety to point I can never articulate what I feel and constantly fear that anyone I get close to will grow to resent me or will die just like my parents. I have the skin disorder ezcema, which causes intense discoloration and irritation of my skin, and often draws the gaze of strangers. I try to convince myself that it doesn't bother me, but when I'm losing sleep after my skin flaking or being questioned about being unhygeinic or sick, it cuts too close to home. Both of these I've dealt with for years, and even during times of financial surplus where I've been able to afford treatment/therapy, I inevitably relapse. The trauma, the inability to have a platonic or romatic relationship with another person,the abnormality of my body and mind and the fact I haven't been felt any real lasting pleasure in over a year is too much. I'm about to hit peak season at my job doing logistics, and after doing some overtime this winter, I'm gonna pay off any debts I have, maybe get a will sorted out and then make my final exit. And considering that both my birthday and the end of my lease are in January, it seems like a fitting end.
