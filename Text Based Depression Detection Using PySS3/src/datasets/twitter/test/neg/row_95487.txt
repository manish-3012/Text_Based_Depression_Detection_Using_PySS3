I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me. I am not depressed yet I think about suicide.The title explains it all.  There is nothing wrong with my life to make me feel like this.  I feel horrible for thinking about suicide because there is other people out there who are in a worse situation than me.  This is a problem I dealt with majority of my life,  Iâ€™ve always felt alone (doesnâ€™t matter if I am with family or friends) and always been emotionally distant.  I donâ€™t see the purpose of my existence anyway.  I tried once sometime in November 2018 but it stressed my parents out and havenâ€™t attempted again since m.  Iâ€™ve thought of ways to kill myself in the future.  Iâ€™m basically waiting for the right time.  

I donâ€™t know why I wrote this.  I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m suicidal but I am not depressed.
