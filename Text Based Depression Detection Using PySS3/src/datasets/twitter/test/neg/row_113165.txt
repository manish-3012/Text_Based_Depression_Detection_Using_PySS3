I feel really hopelessI bought 2 bottles of pills today, and I was planning on taking them about 20 minutes ago... now i'm not sure i can.
  
I can't stand myself, and every day feels like it drags on forever. I've got depression and anxiety issues, and I've been wanting to kill myself every day for the past few months. But I'm terrified at the prospect of dying, I almost don't think I can do it now that I'm  this close to it. I feel hopeless because it feels like my only choice right now... I've kind of shirked all my responsibilities, I didn't think I'd have to deal with them. I'm failing several classes, and all of my personal relationships have kind of suffered. I can't find motivation to do anything at all, and nothing really interests me anymore. The people I really care about don't seem to pay much mind to me... I know if I decide not to take these pills tonight, it'll just be more of the same shit. I feel really worn out. I'm not sure what to do.  
  
Sorry for the incoherent rambling. I really don't know why I posted this here, but I'm all out of sorts right now
