I know I want to kill myself because no one will help me but... no one will help meI can't handle life anymore. I can't concentrate on work and I have an existential problem. My boyfriend threatened to commit suicide so seriously right in front of me a couple days ago that I had to call the police on him.

I feel all alone with no family behind me, no friends, even my boyfriend wants to leave me due to his own problems mostly probably unrelated to me although he's scared of losing me.

I have a lot in the metrics people seem to care about but it seems I truly have nothing. I'm just sad. Rich and sad.
