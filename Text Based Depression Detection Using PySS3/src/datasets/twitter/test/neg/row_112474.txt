Ive messaged every one of my contactsExcluding family because none of them know about my thoughts of suicide. It's been over an hour without a single response. People say they care yet I have no one caring. I know what to expect from writing this, "Oh I do care because blah blah blah". Anyone reading this probably doesn't know the first thing about me. I've posted here numerous amounts of times looking for help and advice but all I end up with is an empty inbox after a few days go by. Every time only makes me want to die a little more. I've recently started to cut myself and it helps transform my pain into a more physical pain which helps I guess. All I have is one question, If there are friends who actually care about me, where are they? Do they all happen to be busy at the same time? or in reality no one wants to put up with me. I'm pretty sure I dont belong in this world but feel free to convince me otherwise.
