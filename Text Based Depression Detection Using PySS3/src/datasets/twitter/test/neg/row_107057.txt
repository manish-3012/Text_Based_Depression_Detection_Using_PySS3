Ugly suicidalI want to die bc im ugly.
Ugly women have no place in society, as womanâ€™s value is tied only to her looks. And i tried so hard to make up for it. I worked so hard to improve myself. To look better to have better personality, to be more interesting. All that and i still was ignored and invisible. I never had a boyfriend i never will have one. Im 26 and every year i look worse and feel worse. I just wanna off myself in next months. I dont care anymore. And i know what people say â€žattractive people have problems tooâ€ No shit. I know its part of human experience, to face hardships. Id much rather be attractive person dealing with these problems. Being ugly person on top of that is like a nail to the coffin. I faced bullying, abuse, toxic friendships, loneliness. When i was younger at least i had dreams and ambitions. Now im just empty shell. This world has destroyed my soul. I hate myself. Theres nothing left for me
