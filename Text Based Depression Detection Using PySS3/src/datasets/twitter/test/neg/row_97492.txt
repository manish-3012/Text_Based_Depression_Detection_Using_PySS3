No one will help meI'm in an extremely horrible place, mentally, physically and emotionally. I live in an abusive environment and it's either this or living on the street right now. I am someone who rarely asks for help, but I've become so severely depressed that I've started letting people around me know. I thought people would want to help once they knew how rough of a time I am having, but the responses I've gotten are either to ignore me or be mean to me about it. An example of this is I told my parents I was having suicidal thoughts and they told me to "go cry to a therapist about it" and that "people have it worse."

I'm not really sure why I'm posting here but I guess I just need hope from others since I've lost all of mine. I know deep down I am a smart and kind person. I graduated college in under 4 years, used to have lots of friends and a steady 9-5 job. However, I became disabled last year and since then I spend most days wondering why I am still alive. Death sounds like the best course of action for me. No one is willing to help me now so I know that they wouldn't miss me if I were gone. I'm not sure why I'm still here.
