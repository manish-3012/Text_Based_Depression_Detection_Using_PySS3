I had a dog     I had just got this dog three days ago my mother rescued her, and as soon as she had left the car she wouldn't leave my side. This dog was sweet, and my mom said she would check it for a chip (only check it for a chip) She ended up giving her away and i didn't say goodbye, this dog was making me want to get up out of my bed, this dog was making me happy. Now that she's gone i don't care about anything, I'm considering shotgunning my head my life is trash and i'm useless, if I don't respond this was my goodbye.
