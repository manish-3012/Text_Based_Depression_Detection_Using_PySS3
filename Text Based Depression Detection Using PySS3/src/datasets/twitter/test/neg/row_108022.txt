The Hospitals send me home when I go there for helpI feel completely alone.

Fucking Reddit just calls me a troll. Nobody listens to me here. 

My ex-bestfriend is getting rich off the company that I started. I hate my body. I hate the police. 

I had a surgery in September, and right afterwards I went to the hospital for suicide watch. Well, they fucking kicked me out when I tried to hang myself. They said "you're one of those people who will always feel suicidal and being in the hospital won't help you AND you'll never actually kill yourself."

I've gone back to the hospital since then, but they just sent me away without even admitting me.

On Sunday, my fucking supposed teacher/father-figure-ish guy from church put his hands down my fucking pants and touched my private parts.

Well fuck that. I'm going to kill myself, death by cop. And I'm going to take out so fucking many of them, as many as I can.

Or I don't know. I probably won't. I've never been successful at it before. And I'm terrified of pain.

I don't know. Can't someone just fucking take me seriously, please?

**edit: thank u pkboo + koozer. thank u for taking me seriously and listening to me. i wont do anything stupid now. im going to talk to the mental health team in this town and maybe visit the hospital in the next town. im going to follow up on some opportunities and do some chores.**
