No one will want to read the note, so I'm leaving it hereHi redditors! Long time lurker here. It's time to make my first and last post.

I feel like I should leave some words of significance, but they will just disappear into a vacuum anyway.

I have probably lived decades longer than most of the people who kill themselves after posting here. It's unfortunate that you could not have lived as long as I have (42 years). The majority of those years were quite happy, to be honest, but circumstances have proven that my best years are behind me.

Rather than live with the miserable knowledge that life will all be downhill from here, I have decided to make one last short uphill. It will be brief but sweet.

I don't have much money saved up since someone stole my life's savings, but what I have is enough to go to S. America, spend the rest of my cash on hookers and blow, and then do myself in. Exact method has yet to be determined. Any suggestions are welcome. Painless and quick would be better, but I probably will not be able to get a firearm unless I steal one, which I suppose I may as well try.

Good luck and maximum happiness to everyone here! And coming from someone older and supposedly wiser: if you're young you still have time. I bet you can unfuck your life still!
