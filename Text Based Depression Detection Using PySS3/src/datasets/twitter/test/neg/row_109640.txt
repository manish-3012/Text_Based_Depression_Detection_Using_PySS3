iâ€™m just looking for a reason to stayAround a couple months ago, I decided I would live until 20 years old. This is because I have a â€œfriendâ€ (idk anymore) in a country where the drinking age is 20, and I told her Iâ€™d take her out to drinks one day. Besides, itâ€™s about 5 years from now â€” if life really couldnâ€™t get any better in 5 years, I might as well be dead.

Tonight Iâ€™ve realized I kinda fucked up my life worse somehow. Itâ€™s true, everyday I spent time in my bed, living in a fantasy world, crying and wishing things were different. It felt like I couldnâ€™t do anything.

My mom came into my room a couple minutes ago, and she laid down the cold hard truth: none of my friends are texting me because they no longer care about me; that theyâ€™re moving forward and I should suck it up and move forward too. Iâ€™ve always tried to explain to her that I really just canâ€™t suck it up â€” I tried to ignore my feelings at one point and it made things worse.

This is my fault and I know it. I want to say â€œI want to see a therapistâ€, but I donâ€™t know if that therapist would call be a BS liar faking depression and tell me to suck it up, too. I want to tell my parents my honest feelings, â€œI canâ€™t work hard because I really donâ€™t see a future beyond doing one thingâ€, but itâ€™s just painful and I hold it back.

There are some sleeping pills next to my bedside, and maybe Iâ€™m just looking for reasons not to take them. Iâ€™ve messed up my life so badly and I donâ€™t want to face tomorrow. I have no one else to talk to, so Iâ€™m sending it here.
