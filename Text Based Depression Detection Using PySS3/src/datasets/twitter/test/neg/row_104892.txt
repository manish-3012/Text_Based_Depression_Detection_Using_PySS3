the people i know don't want to hang out with me, i push away the greatest thing that ever happened to me. The only thing i have to turn to is heroin again. but im tired of that.Everytime someone gets close to me i push them away. i look for what the fuck is wrong with them to be with me instead of accept that they want to be with me. It's happened before and this last time (7 months ago) she was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. She's already happy in another relationship. i haven't spoken to her. the only thing that i've done since her is get a job. i got the job so i could take care of her. Now i have this money saved and no one to spend it with. I don't realize what i do and wonder why they want nothing to do with me, i wonder why they start lying to me....its because im not giving them what they want im afraid they'll hurt me.....i end up making them hurt me..


the people i know have either moved or are basically married or have kids and careers and the ones that don't don't seem to want to let me know when something is going on or when there is they don't want to see if i want to roll with or i can't come because someone they know doesn't like me(don't know why). They all seem to care but never want to hang out, i don't want to bring them down with this because im not that close to them. to anyone.

when i see people i have the mask on. but as soon as i turn around it's thoughts of ending it. i don't care about my family and can't even talk to them. the only thing that's made me okay was my addiction to heroin. i was content with the lonliness. it was more a happy nothingness. i actually had something to do, people to be with when i was using.

i don't know whats holding me back, maybe i just don't want to do that to my parents but i know its because i'm just a coward but i need to do this. i need to do it for myself. it won't get better and if it does i will fuck it up. really..what else is there?
