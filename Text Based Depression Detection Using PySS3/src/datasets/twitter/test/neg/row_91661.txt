Parking Garage Gate Closed 1st TimeThereâ€™s a 10 story parking garage over by my apartment, usually go there when I need some sunlight or to look at the drop. 

Was going to do it today, had my notes and whatnot in my car already, only for me to pull in and see that the gates were all closed.

Theyâ€™re never closed, not in the past 2 weeks Iâ€™ve been going. Maybe itâ€™s a sign to not CTB, just maybe.
