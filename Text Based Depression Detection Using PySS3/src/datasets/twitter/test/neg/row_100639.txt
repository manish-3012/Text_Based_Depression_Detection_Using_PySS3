I'm scared of myself please help meI'm scared of myself, I'm scared that someday I will be so sad that I won't recognize these episodes and losing will to live as a depression talking... I'm mad at myself for years of keeping things to myself, always smiling and acting like I'm a strong persona... Now I have no one to talk to about this, I've tried but everyone gets mad when I tell them my dark thoughts, or they think of me as rock that can handle everything but I can't... I need help, I want to help myself, I want to love myself, I want to live finally and I can't :(  
I'm sorry for the post and bad english, I just feel so scared and alone...
