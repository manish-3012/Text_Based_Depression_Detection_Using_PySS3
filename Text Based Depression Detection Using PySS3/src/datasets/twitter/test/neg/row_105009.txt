Considering it again.The truth is I usually come here and read other people's posts about there lives and how my problems are not as severe. But in fact they are. I just don't feel happy with my life, my ex girlfriend who I am very much in love with won't try and work things out with me. It's like torture for me because I still love her and I love her more than I do myself. I got kicked out of my mums house in may 2 weeks before my A level exams. Which had a knock on effect to them. I hate it, I feel so unloved and that nobody cares I wish I could just disappear, rather than having to actually die. My mother has picked her boyfriend over me and I can't move back into my home because if I do so he will move out. I don't want to upset my mother but its upsetting me that she would choose him over her only son. At this point I just feel unwanted by my family.

I feel like nobody cares anymore and it's so difficult to try and stay happy I don't think about suicide often but I often think that I won't have more than I year left on this planet. I can't tell my friends because they would think I'm weak or something. I wish I had enough money to just get up and leave and never come back. But I dont have a job so I have no funds to do so I don't feel like I've acomplished anything in my life, I often feel lonley because my friends rarely ask me to go out or do anything and when I ask them it's always the same answers. I think to my self that someone has to be lonley so why not me? Atleast that way someone else isn't and they are happy? Maybe that's a bit strange but it's the way I think of things.
