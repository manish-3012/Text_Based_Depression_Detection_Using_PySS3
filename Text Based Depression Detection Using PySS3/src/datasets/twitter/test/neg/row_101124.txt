Run Away or die?I've seen others post similar thoughts but, lately I dont know if I want to just die or if I want to just dissapear for a few months with this friend of mine.  Hes in a worse mental state than I am and I'm constantly in worry that one morning he wont text me back.   I've talked with him about going away for a few days or weeks but I dont know.  We both have responsibilities.  We talked about moving to Florida together soon and I really wonder if it will help us get in a better mindset or not.  I just really want to see him happy and recovered, and I'd like to feel better.   But I'm way more concerned for his life than mine
