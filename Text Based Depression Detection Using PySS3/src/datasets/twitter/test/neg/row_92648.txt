I want to die but dont want to hurt those that love meI am struggling really hard. I am over 3 years clean off a drug addiction and am starting to wonder why I even got clean. I am lonely and scared and think about killing myself regularly. I haven't yet cause I don't want to hurt the people I love but at this point Im beginning to wonder if I hurt them more by being alive. I have a bottle of pills that I think I should take. Of course I am scared.
