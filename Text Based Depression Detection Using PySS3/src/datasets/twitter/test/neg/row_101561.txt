It'd be so quick and easyI have access to the roof of a 9 story building, I go there almost every day, just looking down, wondering if I should do it. Sometimes I think about whether it'd be fun for my last few seconds or not. Maybe i'll enjoy it, maybe my last feeling alive will be a thrill. I'd be sad that they'd have to clean up after my body, because i know that a couple other people have jumped from that spot in the past and the area they landed in was closed off for several days and it inconvenienced a lot of people. But if I'm dead, I won't have to worry about that, or anything else, I can just spend my last few seconds enjoying the rush.
