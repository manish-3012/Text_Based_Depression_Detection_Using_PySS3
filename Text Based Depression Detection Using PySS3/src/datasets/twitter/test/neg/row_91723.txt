What is reality, life, and consciousness?I used to think life was just something that happened out of pure luck and for no reason. I used to think God created us all out of boredom. Then when I stopped believing in God I started believing life started out of pure dumb luck, that energy created matter in the endless nothingness that existed before the big bang.   


How can nothingness exist in nothing and then create energy that creates matter???  
Is life even real? If your senses, taste, touch, sight, and sound can be manipulated with your brain how do you know anything is real? Can reality be consciousness? Is everyone and everything just a product of consciousness?  


Am I God?  
Did I create this life for myself out of boredom? If you were just a ball of consciousness floating around in an endless space of nothingness would you create the sort of life you were living now? Like if you could dream any dream you wanted every night and say inject 70 years of life into that dream would you dream you were rich, happy, and had everything you've ever wanted? Money, cars clothes, relationships, sexual partners, family. You could do it every night until you got bored... Bored of dreaming a life where you knew you created everything you've ever wanted. So then you might think "What if I put a spin on this life? or an element of fear and unknown" So you dream a dream where you are living with all sorts of monsters and unknown things. Eventually, you will get bored of that one too. So then you've created a dream on both side of the spectrum, one where you have everything and one where you have nothing. So now the next dream you think of is one where you have to work for your goals and one where you take away the previous knowledge that you are just dreaming. You think of a dream that sort of looks like the life you are living right now.

What if killing myself will take me out of this dream? I want to go back to where ever I came from because this dream I thought of out of boredom, its too hard. Living a life to be a slave for money just to be successful so I can die knowing I was successful is not a life worth living. I have a job I hate, no one likes me, I don't have a girl friend, or any friends for that matter and I'm just tired. I'm tired of "Living this life" and I want to see whats next. Killing myself seems like such a peaceful idea, what if killing myself will put me on the next level. Like the only way to get out of this level is to die.  


I'm just tired of fighting to make a living just to pay bills so I can come home to an empty apartment and brows reddit.
