It doesn't get any better.19 year-old male going into sophomore year of college. Overweight, slightly less cringey than an Otaku, but with typical gamer interests.


Every time school comes around, I spiral into a terrible pit of misery, until the semester is over and done with. I don't care for it, I don't care for the bullshit roadblocks, and I don't care for the extraordinarily ridiculous prices required to even enter. 


All I want is something to be good at that I can do for an at least livable wage. I already spent way too much money on games and a gaming rig; I don't need to spend any more on those luxuries. 


But the way the country is going, I won't be able to get a job at anything anywhere,  let alone earn a livable wage from it in the first place. I'm not dealing with that. I'm not living at home for another 4 years being the fat loser slob.


If I drop out, I have no future and am thousands in the hole. If I stay,  I'm miserable and may kill myself, and I'll STILL be thousands in the hole with no future ahead of me.


Honestly I'm done. Done with this shit. I know I'm a snotty entitled brat, but I can't deal with it anymore. I'm not going back to those classrooms, and playing "get to know you" games any fucking longer. I'm gonna blow my own, or somebody else's head off if I have to walk into that again. It's a nightmare.
