Weâ€™re all gonna die, why should I waste my time?Hello 1/8,000,000,000 humans, congrats for living so long or short depending on who you are. In my opinion suicidal people are selfish... Iâ€™m selfish...

I only want to have chats and get more friends, I have friends but does it really matter in the end game? The human population is gonna spread to 1 trillion or quintillion then weâ€™re all dead. Humanity is doomed, if we spread more seeds, weâ€™ll continue our downfall into more violence and killing more animals.

I wanna die. Death makes people cry but they will die as well and never remember when they cried! I leave no memories! I am not depressed, if I am, my doctor hasnâ€™t said shit about it! She probably doesnâ€™t care! Nobody cares! I am talking to fucking strangers on the internet! Youâ€™re not gonna win! Humanity is gonna die, you know the Columbine Shootings right? Well, those will happen everywhere! More people means more stupid and mentally ill people! More mentally ill and stupid people means more deaths!

I might kill myself because if I spread my seed, my son or daughter might be crazy and I will be disappointed! Elliot Rodger may have been mentally ill but youâ€™re damn sure that what he said is right! Sex drives the fucking world, weâ€™re being controlled! Less power! Do you want people to die? We will all die from a meteor or asteroid! The fucking sun will kill us! I am just wasting my time on this earth!

Humanity wonâ€™t recover!

EDIT: My mind is already shattered, you canâ€™t save me.
