The human mind is a weird thingShould I feel bad that during this whole Covid-19 pandemic, I have been wishing that I would get it (and I am in a slightly higher risk category, because of high blood pressure)?

Should I feel bad whenever I see a bad car accident, that I wish that I was in the middle of it?

Should I feel bad, that when my father in law passed away last year from an aggressive cancer (from diagnosis to death was only 5 months), that I wish it had been me, not him?

Should I feel bad, that when I used to regularly self harm at an old job, I was too much of a chicken shit to go any further?

Should I feel bad, that when I just read another reddit post about an OD in a hotel, that I wish I actually did drugs?

Should I feel bad, that I have never been able to starve myself for more than 40 hours (used to do the 40 hour famine when I was a kid)?

Should I feel bad, that all I want to do, is just disappear off the face of this planet...what difference would it make anyway?
