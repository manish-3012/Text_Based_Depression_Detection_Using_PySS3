There is really no other option for me.No other interesting option, I mean. I don't like anything the world has to offer and I don't like myself. I turn down help because I don't want to be helped because that would stop me. Therapy wouldn't work because I hate having to talk to people. But the thing is, you can't live without being forced to interact with others to find a job or even finish your studies. I just don't give a shit anymore. Unless there's some crucial point I'm missing I'll just get my things in order and kill myself. I've seen enough to decide I don't like living.
