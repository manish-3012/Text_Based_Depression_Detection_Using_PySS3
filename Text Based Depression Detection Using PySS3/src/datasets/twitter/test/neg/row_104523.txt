I don't feel pleasure anymoreThis is going to sound angsty and very adolescent, but I felt the need to get some sort of help.

I feel very isolated and alone. I moved several states over in a completely unfamiliar area. I also just turned 20 and found that I don't even have old high school friends that cared enough to talk to me about it, spare one. 

I also recently ended a long-term relationship with a high school sweetheart. I should add that this was not only the longest relationship I've been in, but it is also the closest I've been to another person before. She knew me completely and I did her. I trusted her and I thought she trusted me. She broke up with me over Facebook Messenger while interning in another state. But it's not all her fault. And I agreed with breaking up, we both felt like the love we felt in the relationship had long been dead. I still feel bad about it, to say the least. We tried really hard to get back together after our first break up in high school, and when we got back together in college it was exciting and passionate, all the good qualities you'd find in a cheesy romcom or something. Not anymore.

I've struggled with MDD and GAD since I attempted suicide in high school. I'm not going into detail about that.

I recently fastened a belt around my neck and closed part of it in a door, just high up above me so that it would choke me if I sat down. I decided not to go through with it when I felt what strangulation feels like. It's scary.

I got a job as a cashier in the new town I live in. I am alone and I do not fit in. Not only that, but I can't bring myself to talk to others outside of generic, lame-as-hell small talk. I can't communicate with people. I think I have been isolated from people for so long that it has severely impacted my skills to connect with other people in a friendly sort of way. I don't try to get past the small talk anymore.

I feel like I want to kill myself, but all the usual contradictions come up and I'm left just feeling sorry for myself. I continue nevertheless. But what I've realized over the years of depression is that I don't experience pleasure the way I did when I was in middle school and before. Things were very simple back then. I was still socially alienated, but I got enjoyment from movies and games, talking to people, etc. When I try that sort of thing now, I feel nothing. I don't know how to explain it, but it's either a perfectly neutral or completely negative feeling. Nothing really interests me anymore. I tried to play videogames the other day, because that was something I was big into when I was a little kid, but I didn't enjoy it the way I hoped I would. It only annoyed me.

I don't know how to get that "good" feeling back. I have tried numerous antidepressants. Nothing seems to work. I feel sterile at best, and vile at worst. I'm trying to eat better, which is good, but I really only feel that "good" feeling when I'm eating something. I'm very rarely hungry as it is, and I try to fast frequently. That being said, I'm 5'11" and about 180, so I'm roughly 15 pounds overweight. I hate looking at myself, even though I'm probably a 7 or 8 and I've had a lot of short relationships. But they don't ever feel mutually beneficial. If anything, I feel like a parasite, always bringing my SO/whoever down. I also don't really feel strongly about the people I date, but I do it anyway. I don't know why that is, and I know it's weird. I guess I just want to try and connect with someone on a deeper level. 

I'm going on ephedrine to try and cut back more. I tried some the other day and it made me feel better than usual, but I still didn't feel that good feeling. Just something posing as it. I don't know how to explain it. It wasn't real.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I feel like a stranger to myself sometimes. I feel like my life has stagnated. 

Sorry for the poor writing, I realize I opened each sentence with "I..." and it reads horribly. That's just how the thoughts came out.
