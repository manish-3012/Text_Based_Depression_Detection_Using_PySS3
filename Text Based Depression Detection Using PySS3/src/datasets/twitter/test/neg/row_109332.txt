i am so losti donâ€™t know who I am anymore. iâ€™ve dropped out of all activities i once did due to anxiety. i donâ€™t talk to anyone or go anywhere. i donâ€™t even know why i own a phone anymore. gaming doesnâ€™t help anymore, i just end up getting pissed off and quitting. i only like myself when iâ€™m drunk or high, and if i could i wouldnâ€™t leave my room and would smoke all day. i donâ€™t want to die, but some part of me wishes to not be here anymore. i know that me dying would seriously screw up my parents and siblings lives, but i still think about it. whenever iâ€™m in the car or going to bed, i think about crashing and instantly dying or dying in my sleep somehow. i usually snap out of it later and realize how selfish i was being, but i donâ€™t know how to stop. can anyone help me please i donâ€™t want to be this way anymore
