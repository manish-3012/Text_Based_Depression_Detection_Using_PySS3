I have xanax in my hand and ready to end my shitty lifeI never thought life was that way, we live for no reason, we suffer for no reason, all that numb feelings will end soon, I just dont know how to feel I self harm myself just to cry I'm slowly going crazy this is too much for me there's no reason to keep going

Edit: I'm sorry for that, I've decided to not OD on xanax I'll try to find a help from my close friends or my parents, thank you guys I really love what you guys do for us &lt;3
