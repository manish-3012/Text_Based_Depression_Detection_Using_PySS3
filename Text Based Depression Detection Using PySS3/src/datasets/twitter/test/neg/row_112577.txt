I failed high school. Tried to do a university preparation course, passed first semester but failed second semester twice. I feel like my life is going to go nowhere. Please give me motivation not to end life right now.I come from a wealthy home and a big fear of mine is not being able to recreate that, but I was raised in a home with emotionally manipulative parents with everything handed to me so I grew up depressed.

I genuinely can't tell if I'm depressed, lazy or stupid which caused me to fail.
