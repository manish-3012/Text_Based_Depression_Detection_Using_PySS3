Can't Live This LifeHello Reddit Community,

I am a 19 year old, female college student and I have decided that suicide will ultimately be my best option. I have thought about suicide since primary school age and now I've finally gotten serious enough to go through with it. I plan to carry everything out in about a month where I plan to overdose next to the ocean (mine as well die somewhere I love, right?)

I guess if you're reading this, you're probably wanting to know the recent events that lead to my decision. I lost my best friend, my 10 year old dog, about two months ago and her death hit me extremely hard. It was incredibly unexpected as I just saw her that morning and she acted completely normal. About 3 weeks ago, I found out I had HSV-1 (herpes). Assumably, it's the oral variety (cold sores), but there is a chance that I could have it genitally, and without proper symptoms, there is no way to tell where it is in my body. This diagnosis destroyed all my confidence and I feel like I will never be able to date with the "herpes talk" and as soon as people hear that, they'll run. I've always dreamed about traveling the world with a significant other and I feel like it will never happen for me now.

At the beginning of my second semester at college, I fell off the deep end for a bit. I acted like a complete whore to feel some validation and I never thought twice about it. A few days ago, I received a message from a person who I sent sexually explicit pictures to online. I never met this person, don't know their name, and I haven't talked to them in a long while. We exclusively talked over kik and although I had a picture on there, I never thought they could track me down. I was very wrong. This person reverse image searched my picture and found me on Facebook despite my strict privacy settings. They told me if I didn't send more pictures, they would forward everything to my friends and family. I felt trapped. There is almost no way to track this person down and they have explicit topless photos showing my face and chest. This event was the last straw. I cannot live this life anymore.

Besides these terrible events, my already existing depression has driven away every friend I've ever had. I have absolutely no one in my life and I constantly feel extremely lonely. As a college student, I expected this to be one of the best times in my life, but it isn't. People don't want to hang around someone who is miserable all the time and I understand that. I'm ready to take the plunge into forever and simply give up all of these mistakes.

All I've ever done is make mistakes and this last one with the explicit photos is irreversible. I have my note written and I'm working on getting my affairs in order. I'm writing this because I feel the need to let someone know what's happening and ask for some advice. Are there any ways to make this transition easier for my family? I don't want to hurt them, but I'm tired of using up their money with college when I don't plan on living much longer. And, would it be better to leave a handwritten note or a video? I want them to know exactly why I chose this and that I don't blame anyone. I'm not angry or upset. This is simply my only option left while I still have some dignity. Any comments are much appreciated.
