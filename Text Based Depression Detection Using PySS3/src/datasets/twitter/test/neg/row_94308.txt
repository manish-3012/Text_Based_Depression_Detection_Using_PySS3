I want to do it so badly, but I'm afraid of survivingI really want to kill myself. The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm afraid of not messing up and actually surviving and having to live with that. The methods I have access to aren't guaranteed lethal, but if I had access to a gun (which I don't) I wouldn't hesitate for a second. I keep wanting to feel like I can know what it's like just a little bit so I've been trying to cut myself lately. I say trying because I've hidden most of my sharp knives from myself so all I have easily accessible is a really dull serrated knife which can barely break the skin. I just want to be dead. I've given up and just want it all to stop.
