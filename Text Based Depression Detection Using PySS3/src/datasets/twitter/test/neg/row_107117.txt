21, fulfilled this life but now I want out.Hi all, I just wanted to come on here to just share my slice of this wonderful hellscape we call â€œlifeâ€. Iâ€™m on this subreddit because Iâ€™ve fantasised and pondered about killing myself multiple times throughout my life. The last few days were probably the most intense yet, as I tried to kill myself 3 times. My issues are pretty complex, I guess Iâ€™m really good at cloaking my mental health but the only word I can use to describe exactly how Iâ€™m feeling about life is â€œexhaustedâ€. Iâ€™m a recent graduate with a degree in Music Production (so useful), and I have struggled a lot with my mental health because of university. While I was at uni, I developed epilepsy which is brought on by anxiety and sleep deprivation. That diagnosis fucked me, I then began to live my life completely the opposite of what the doctors were telling me. I was so wreckless with drugs and alcohol and other dangerous situations, but it was all because I wanted to be closer and closer to death, it was sort of like a game for me. 

After spending lockdown on my own, spending thousands of pounds (not even my money) on drugs to just give me that escape from my depression and anxiety, I am now even worse because I live at home with my dad, which makes my suicidal thoughts increase tenfold. 

I just feel absolutely worthless, like an old paper Â£5 note, had a bit of worth a couple years ago but now itâ€™s useless. 

Currently I do still want to die, I have set various dates and ways to go about it but Iâ€™ll never know until iâ€™m in that moment. This gives me a chance to step back and think a lil bit. 


Thanks for reading if you got this far
