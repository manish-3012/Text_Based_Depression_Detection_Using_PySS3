Me and my 7 month old daughter just got kicked outIâ€™m debating if my life is worth living, I have nothing left anymore besides my babygirl. But what kind of life would she want to live if I can give her anything I want to give her.. I think Iâ€™m going to drop her off at my boyfriends/ her fathers house and go hang myself in the woods close to where I used to live... i have a job and everything but being a cosmetologist isnâ€™t going to provide well enough for my sweet baby.. she would be better off without me... everyone would. I just donâ€™t know when exactly to do it but Iâ€™m set on doing it because Iâ€™ve been depressed allot recently and my antidepressants arenâ€™t doing anything...
