What to say to someone suicidalHi, i hope i'm in the right place to get advice on this difficult situation.

My long time online friend has been struggling with a lot of problems such as depression. They recently texted me a long message to tell me how much i mean to them but some things they said in it are very alarming to me.

They said they don't know how much longer they can live on and they probably only have a few months left. They're lost in life; no passions and no motivation to live anymore. They really seem to be considering committing suicide in the next few months. I'm very concerned.

I don't know what to say. I want to help and support them as much as i can, but there's not much i can do since we're living far apart. I fear listening to them might not be enough this time. However i don't know what kind of advice i can give them, i don't want to sound like i'm trying to save them or to "fix" them because i know i can't. And I'm not sure saying "it'll get better", "life is worth living" etc, is helpful at all. I don't know what to do. 

We're both underage and i think they mentioned once their parents don't take their depression seriously so i don't know if they can even get access to therapy. I don't have any contact his their family and i don't know their address. I'm beginning to be pessimistic as well but i refuse to give up on them...
