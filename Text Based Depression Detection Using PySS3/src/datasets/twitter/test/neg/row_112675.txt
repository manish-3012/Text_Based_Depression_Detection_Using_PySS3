Lost and confusedI will start this off, I'm an engineer at a rather well known company.

I've been pretty unhappy for a long time with my work, and my job searches have been yielding nothing.

Lost a few family members recently.  Tomorrow is my best friend's two year anniversary of his suicide.

My girlfriend and I have been together awhile but I just don't have the heart to propose because my shit isn't together.  I've been wanting to leave town but she said she'd follow me anywhere despite the fact she's made some great friends and pretty much has a dream job here.

I think the only thing left for me is to just end it.  I've only got one request if I do end it all. 

I'm an organ donor but I'd prefer to do it in a way that leaves me as a viable donor after the fact.  I know it's morbid but if you have suggestions so that I may be a use to other people after my time is gone I'd appreciate it.  I just don't want to drain the world of anymore resources as people are dying in hospitals right now that want to live and I'm uncontrollably sobbing thinking about how I am choosing to end it while they struggle to live.
