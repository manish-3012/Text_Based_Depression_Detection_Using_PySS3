Kinda over lifeI am just sick of stuff. Anyone else? Does it ever feel like it's selfish of others to tell me I need to live when I don't like living?

I have no reason to complain. My life is good. But the pit in my stomach, the inability to eat or sleep or sit or do anything besides feel this horrific anxiety makes life suck. At what point can a person just give up?

I exercise 6 days/week. I eat healthy-ish. No drugs or drinking. I have meds. I go to therapy. If all this isn't helping, will anything?
