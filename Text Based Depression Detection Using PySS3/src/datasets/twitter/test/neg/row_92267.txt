What's the fastest least painful way to die?I've fucking had it. I'm sick of disappointing myself over and over again. In high school I told myself to hang on until college and now I'm in college and it's just worse. I'm so tired of being lonely, ugly, untalented, full of bitterness and hate towards everyone. It's so stupid because no one has a second thought for me. I told myself that loneliness can't be helped right now, I can improve myself slowly, work out, diet, practice drawing, maybe get plastic surgery when I'm older so that by the time I'm 25 I'll be a decent artist and much better looking and then maybe people will give a damn about me and I'll have a little more self confidence. But I can't work on any of that in any appreciable amount because I'm stuck at school where I'm learning useless shit that I could learn by myself. I so desperately want out of here but that's not an option because my parents insist I graduate and besides the idea of staying at home with them and dealing with my mom's temper every day is just too much. I don't want to go back home and I don't want to be at school. I don't want to live anymore in general.
