Power cable in closetI wrapped a tshirt around a long computer power cable and looped the cable around the closet hanger bars. I sat down against it and I could feel it supporting my weight, all the pressure behind my jaw.  My vision started to blur and I sat up afraid, my wife is gone for the day. I could actually be dead before anyone even notices. 

I don't know why 

I'm unemployed and we dont have rent money, we both got laid off and are bad with money anyways. I'm interviewing at a fucking car wash tomorrow. What the fuck is the point of any of this. My wife and family will miss me but I've been worn down, lower and lower year after year. 

I don't really need to talk to anyone I guess,  I'm just tired of telling my wife/friends/family about how I feel. Instead of fighting or ignoring my mind any longer I just want to sleep. 

If sleep requires a few minutes of pain then so be it.  I think the only thing that stopped me was an animal instinct to breathe.
