I'm ready to go.I'm very depressed and I'm sick of people invalidating my feelings. Yes I have a degree and a "good job", yes people "love me". But that's what makes it worse. I am sick of being a burden to everyone with my feelings. My mum tells me I have nothing to be depressed for I "don't know what it's like to be depressed", I'm depressed because I feel like a failure and I'm worthless. I have tried talking to a doctor. I've been given drugs.. AGAIN. And told to get a hobby. I just don't see the point. Maybe, that's why I'm posting on here for some one just to understand how I'm feeling before it's too late. I don't want to die but I see it as the only way out. I am ready to go. And if I do it and fail again, am I attention seeker? It would just be another failure to my list.
