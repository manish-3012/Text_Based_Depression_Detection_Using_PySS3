Therapy helpIâ€™ve been getting mentally very poor again and my environment has been changing rapidly. I am usually good about being honest with my therapist, but I am actually quite hesitant. Iâ€™m scared that itâ€™ll result in inpatient care again which will make the people around me quite disappointed. Any advice? No private messages, just comments please.
