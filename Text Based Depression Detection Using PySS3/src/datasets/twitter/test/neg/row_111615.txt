Suicidal Ideations of After I'm ~40Let me start by saying I've been depressed for years, currently on Zoloft and some other junk. I've been doing better, and don't really want to die yet. However, I can't help but think I'll kill myself decades down the line. I'm a freshman, 18,  and I'm planning for my dream job, life, and none of it is too fancy. However I feel like once I've achieved those things and experienced happiness for a time I'll kill myself knowing I pushed past high school and all of life's bullshit for a worthy reward, then game over. 

It kind of scares me to think that way, but I don't know how to stop it. It's a future problem I guess, but I just don't know. It's all so overwhelming. Even when I'm doing better I can only see one way out, the same way in my darkest moments.
