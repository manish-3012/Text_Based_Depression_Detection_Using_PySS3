Not sure what to say here, not looking to be talked down but I just need to talk it out.So, I'm sure people would envy my life, I'm still kinda young (mid 30s), wife and a daughter, full time job, a home, and I'm loved by my family. I'm respected professionally too.

But I just sent my wife running out of the house crying because I had a knife to my throat. The only reason I didn't cut is because of what is would do to my family. But I've wanted to end it for a few years now.

My wife keeps telling me about how bad it'll be for them if I end it. But I'm sure it'll be worse if I stay. Here's my story. 

Since Afghanistan just keeping two thoughts together has been a challenge. I came home after 7 months in combat unscathed. But once home, I couldn't relax. I drank and was drunk for over a year. Doctors at the base threatened to put me in an institution if I couldn't sober up. So I lied and said I was sobering up. I didn't. I drank quietly for a few more months, until I met the girl who would become my wife. 

Then for a few years I felt good, calm, I sobered up for real. We got married and had a kid. But before the wedding, I started getting angry, angry at the stupidest shit, but always getting angry and angrier. Now it's become all I am. The simplest thing will set me off. I can't see straight, I can't think even when I'm not angry, I distract myself with reddit, xbox, or movies, but it doesn't always work. Especially when the tablet or game crashes, that really sets me off. I've been in counselling since I got back, but it's a fools quest. Every doctor either is just a stereotypical joke, pushes pills or doesn't get the military (so I end up explaining what things are more than I talk).

Now, I'm at my wits end. I can't think clearly or see clearly except when I'm thinking of ending it. The only thing keeping me here is what it would do to my family. But I'm afraid that isn't working anymore, I'm positive that if I stayed I'd damage my wife (not physically but emotionally) and my daughter would end up like me, angry, distraught, distant. 

Like I said, I'm not here to be talked down, I just wanted somewhere I could talk it out. I'm not going to do it today, I'll need to find a place and method that won't make it worse for anyone, walking into traffic would fuck up whoever hit me, jumping off a building would fuck up anyone who saw, eating a bullet would create a mess I don't want my family to see nor do I want the gun community to have another statistic, hanging myself would leave someone to have to find me. If I could get a boat I'd step off the side tied to a bag of rocks, but I kind of want my family to have a body to bury (is that crazy?). 

Writing this has actually helped me calm down, for now. But next time I think I may just walk out never to return. 

Thanks for reading.
