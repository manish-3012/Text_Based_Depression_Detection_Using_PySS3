I'm done.I screamed "I don't care." When my spouse was suggesting that I am going to put myself in an early grave if I don't get some exercise and I realize it's true.

I'm too lazy to actively attempt something, and I wouldn't leave that mess on my kids, but if something happens I don't care. My give a damn left and I don't know how to get it back.
