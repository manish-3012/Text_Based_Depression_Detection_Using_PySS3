One day at a timeI can't even compose the words to describe my situation without getting into specifics but I really fucked up my life, with a single small mistake that had devastating consequences on my current employment (now fired), my career and future finances, and the plans I had with my wife, daughter and son.

All my plans were laid out and in an instant they have vanished before me. I should have dealt with the grief of my father's early death a year back sooner instead of ignoring it and letting it bottle up at work. I was way in over my head with the responsibility required of me but I needed the money to support my mom, sister, wife and 2 kids after my dad's death. 

The past week I have been lurking here every day because it sometimes helps to read other people on the brink to know that we are not alone. As much as I entertain the idea of just letting everything go, it would completely destroy everything around me. My wife, my two children would be fatherless, my sister is already suicidal and it may trigger her to jump ship too and my mom is still a mess after my father's death.

It's so alluring to just let it all go. It may just be my severe anxiety that is pushing my fight or flight response to run from my situation but I'm honestly paralyzed daily by the potential repercussions of my actions. 

I've tried to talk to my mom and wife about how guilty and sorry I am for what I did, but I don't think they know the extent of my despair. There's little they can do regarding how this will play out, they can only try and remain strong for me and assure me it's not as bad as I am making it out to be.

One day at a time. But anytime I sleep or find some calm, it just takes waking up or re-remembering what I did to drop me back into complete paralysis. 

It feels impossible to get through this.
