Iâ€™m so ready to go..Iâ€™m so ready to be done with this. Iâ€™m so depressed that I canâ€™t eat. Canâ€™t drink. Canâ€™t do my work or school. Canâ€™t take care of my dog. Canâ€™t do anything. I just want to sit in bed. The sad part is I have to face these responsibilities eventually. Thatâ€™s why I think itâ€™s best to just go because I canâ€™t bear the thought of having to do anything. Life isnâ€™t worth it. Nothing good every happens to me. I struggle with awful anxiety and depression, my boyfriend just cheated on me, I have no friends, itâ€™s all meaningless. I feel bad for my family and my dog though, but Iâ€™m sure they can handle pain better than I can. Also, is it rude to not leave notes when you do it? I just donâ€™t have any energy to write the notes..anyways wish me luck. Iâ€™m going down a benzo and alcohol journey that should end with what we all long for; death. Thanks everyone in this sub for being cool, I hope you all live great lives.
