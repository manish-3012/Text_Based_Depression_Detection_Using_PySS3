Long time lurker, first time posterIt always comes out no where. The thoughts go away, things are great.. and then, Bang. 

Here we are. Reaching out to strangers because we feel alone and don't trust our decision making processes.

Whomever may see this.. dont give up. You are winning your fight. I know it doesnt seem that way now, but you are. Please dont give up.
