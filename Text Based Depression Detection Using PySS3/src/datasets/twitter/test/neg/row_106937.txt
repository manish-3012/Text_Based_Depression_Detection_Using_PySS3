I'm not sure if I'm in the proper placeBut I never really thought I'd end up at this point. I was never the type to self-harm or even think about offing myself. It was just a small sadness in my chest that would press too hard against my heart sometimes. Everyone gets sad sometimes. But there was always that hope there, too. That tomorrow couldn't be as bad as today. But the worst thing kept trying to beat its own high score. Each day felt like someone was shoveling dirt over me. It was easier then, to brush it off. But then it started piling it on, faster and faster until I couldn't keep up. And now I feel immobilized, in the dirt, in dark. And I feel like can't breathe anymore and that stupid hope that woke me every morning is just gone. I don't know what I'm waiting for, but I don't think it will ever come.
