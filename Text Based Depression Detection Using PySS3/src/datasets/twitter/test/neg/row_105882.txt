I wish I was dead.Real account as I have nothing to lose. I'm home with a screaming, crying toddler all day every day.  I can't do anything or he screams and cries at my feet.  I can't prepare food.  Go to the bathroom.  Make a phone call.  I can't not be holding him or he has a complete meltdown.  This never changes.

I fear I am nearing the end of my rope.  Sometimes I think being dead is the only way out.  I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.
