Someone cares.I have seen, Many times on this subreddit, the words "Nobody cares about me".  Let me just tell, everyone who has said that, that someone will always care.  There will be many people mourning if you were to hurt yourself, including me.  I've also seen "I have no friends".  I will be your friend.  Im serious!  I would love to play xbox with you sometime, or just talk!  And I understand what depressions like.  I remember one week I was so depressed I could barely get out of bed every morning.  And if you wanna no how it gets better, PLEASE pm me.  Because it sure as hell does :)
