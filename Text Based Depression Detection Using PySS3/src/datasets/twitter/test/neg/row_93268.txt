I canâ€™tIâ€™m beyond done. I donâ€™t think I can go on. I feel beyond awful. My relationship just failed so badly and itâ€™s my fault. I donâ€™t see a point in continuing. I wonâ€™t ever forgive myself or move past this. I needed a push to make me follow through, just like I did last time, and I feel like this could be it. Not for a few days but, I canâ€™t forgive myself. The world doesnâ€™t need me. I feel empty.
