I believe we're bad people.I'm sorry if I offend anyone by saying this but I honestly think were a burden to people. Everyone else has normal lives and are able to handle every thing on there own, but people like us constantly make mistakes. Even if we do know how to solve a problem we are for some reason unable to do it. I've started planning out how to kill myself by ordering pills online, but I don't have the money on me right now and I don't know what pills I should order. My second plan is to some how drown my self in a bath tub. I know it will hurt like hell, but I am not afraid of that.
