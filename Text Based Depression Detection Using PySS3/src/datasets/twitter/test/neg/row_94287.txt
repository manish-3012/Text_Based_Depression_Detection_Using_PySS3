It's time.  I can't do this anymore.I am not sure where to begin.  This will be a mess, I am sorry.

 I am a mid twenties female...I just got accepted into nursing school for the Fall.  I feel like I should be immensely happy over that, but I am not.

I cry often, every day, multiple times a day.  The final straw was last night.  I was finally getting some peaceful rest when I suddenly snapped wide awake with the thought "if you killed yourself, it would always be this peaceful".  I am just so sick and tired of thinking about killing myself.  I want out.

My life is a waste.  I was addicted to meth and heroin for a long time (13 - 23 years old).  I still live with my mom because of this. My dad died when I was 16, I was a total bitch before he died and said some cruel things.  He fell into a coma soon after died before I could make amends, I live with that guilt every single day.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I feel like this is my last ditch effort.  I just think this is it.  Thanks for listening to my pity party, I'm sorry.
