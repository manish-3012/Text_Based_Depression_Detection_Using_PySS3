I want to suffer while I go.Maybe this is the last legs of caring but I know there is no going back. My brain is on fire and nothing can calm it down and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I want to die, I am so tired of this fucking little voice in my head.  But for whatever reason there is still guilt. Because even if I can believe for a moment that anyone truly cares for me in any way past a tolerance I still feel guilty. So I donâ€™t feel I have the right to go peacefully, I feel like I have to suffer. Is there any 100% guaranteed way to kill myself, regardless of what the pain leading up to death may be.
