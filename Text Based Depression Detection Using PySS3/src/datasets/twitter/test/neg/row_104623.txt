Mothers Day and my birthdayYesterday I told my parents how much I want to kill my self. Their lack of empathy and understanding is making it worse. Today is Mother's Day... I don't know what to say to them or how to make them understand. It's also my birthday... but that always seems to come second to my mother. While she does the bare minimum in this household, she is celebrated. I am ignored and "ungrateful" for what I have. I just want today to end.
