I think its finally game over..I've always loved playing games, either on my pc, playstation, old Terminator console when I was a kid. Then became a jock in school and playing games with girls, oh how immature I was... I became serious and started working, made a good living, but still couldn't stop playing games, so there comes gambling.. Lost all I had made, then I bounced right back up. Few years after it all came back, got in huge debt, legal problems that are still ongoing now, then try suicide ( failed miserably to be honest ). Tried starting off fresh, new place, new life. Found a nice girl that I promised the world to, of course I couldn't keep my promise, so I tried making more money, spend on giving her what she never had, and also continue paying my debts. It was never enough, so guess what, I started playing games again. All of a sudden I'm back where I was before, broke, alone and I can honestly say I'm done "playing games", I think its game over ..
