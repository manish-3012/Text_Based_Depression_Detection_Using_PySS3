Tonight is the nightTonight is the night. 

I've had enough of this life. 

No one cares of my plight. 

All alone with my strife. 

Something about ending it feels so right.
 
My true feelings, I stifle. 

So with my knife cut the left and the right.

There's no healing. Without me is life full. 

Tonight is the night. It feels so right.
