Think I might try and off myself tonightI'm sure there are plenty of reasons i could find to not do this but i dont care about anything anymore, I'm an awful awful person for what I'm about to put my family and friends through, but at least this will be a much cleaner seperation than them spending the next year or more pretending to really care about me doing therapy or trying to get better for their sake when they dont care about me that much at all anyway.


Damn thats a negative wall of text. But true imo. Ive got a bunch of asprin and a big ol bottle of whiskey, plus my trusty old razor so I'm thinking i might get as drunk as possible, cut myself up a bit and then eat as many asprins as i can. Hopefully one of those will work. 


Sorry to be so depressing n graphic. And bless all you folk who pretend to give a damn about strangers on the internet, y'all are precious &lt;3
