It's time for me to go.I've been trying to talk myself into suicide for years now, but for whatever reason I've been hanging around, maybr holding out hope that things will get better, maybe out of fear of dying, maybe all these and more. Idk anymore, and I don't even want to know anymore, I just want tk be fucking dead and it's time I just man up and do it.
