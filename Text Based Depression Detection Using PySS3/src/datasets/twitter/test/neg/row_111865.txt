Am I really like this bc of a fleeting love?Iâ€™m generally I very optimistic guy even in the worst of situations. Recently I feel like Iâ€™m losing my support system and lover. Iâ€™ve made this throwaway bc In some weird way Iâ€™m afraid to admit that Iâ€™m turning to this. 

Iâ€™ll first start out with admitting that yes this is bc of a girl. I canâ€™t keep wrapping my head around this because Iâ€™ve had plenty of partners that have come and gone. But this one, sheâ€™s been the little hope that I cling onto. 
She has now given an ultimatum to come stay in her country for x amount of weeks or weâ€™re through. Given the recent situation and the fact that I am a uni student funded by my parents it really isnâ€™t my choice to make. Iâ€™ve offered to come for a few days but it wasnâ€™t enough. 
I donâ€™t want to admit it but I refuse to continue with out her. She helps me when Iâ€™m at my lowest and everything just seems right when sheâ€™s around. 
Iâ€™d keep on going but I feel like Iâ€™ve turned to rambling and I canâ€™t really bring myself to write more 

I guess Iâ€™d just like to really talk to someone since I canâ€™t talk to her. Or get this off my chest but I really donâ€™t want to continue without her.
