I've reached the point where I'm ready this time...no overthinkingTwo suicide attempts, both some time ago. I've been in therapy for almost two years now, and both suicide attempts predated that. I've had chronic suicidal ideation the entire time I've been in therapy, but haven't attempted again, but I've come close.

But this...feels different. Like I've truly reached the end. That I'm just done and ready to give up. And I'm not sure what more I can do...besides revise the suicide note I wrote two months ago, write the other one I need to write, and go.

Maybe some of us just have no chance.
