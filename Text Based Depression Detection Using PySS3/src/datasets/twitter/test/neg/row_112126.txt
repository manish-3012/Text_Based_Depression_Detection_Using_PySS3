Time and time again I catch myself asking why it's even worth it anymoreMy future is in the shitter.  I'm actively fucking up my grades, watching myself fall deeper and deeper into this massive fucking hole I've dug.  I don't mean to have bad grades; but for some reason, I just sit there and don't do any of it.  It's as if some other force is controlling me, *making* me do these things.  But at the same time, I know deep in my heart that I'm perfectly capable and in control.

***Life is hell***
