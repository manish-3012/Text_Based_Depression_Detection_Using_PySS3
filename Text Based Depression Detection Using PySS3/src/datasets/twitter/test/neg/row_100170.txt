No one caresNot one single person cares about me. Its frustrating as fuck to think that we live in a world with 7 billion people and I'm all alone. probably forever. its such bullshit. but why would anyone care about me? what is there to like? nothing. I'm just another insignificant speck of dust in the wind who will grow old wither away and die with no one there with me. No one to mourn my passing, to celebrate my successes, to show me love and compassion. 

I don't want to bother living if thats the life I can expect. Just day in and day out devoid of any companionship, love, or affection.
