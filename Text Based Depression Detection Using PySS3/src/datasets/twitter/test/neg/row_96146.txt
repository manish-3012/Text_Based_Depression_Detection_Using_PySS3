Help me?This time of year has always been rough for me but this year is... different. its worse. i feel like i cant pull myself out of this hole i have dug for myself... let me give you some background on me... i dont remember much of my childhood and i dont know why... my counselor told me it was because of the psychological torment i went through at the hands of my parents but i dont believe it... no one remembers childhood right? when i was in 8th grade my mother (i use that term loosely) and my little sister moved to texas. now before they moved I raised my little sister. fed her daipered her cuddled with her. the works. when she wasnt with me she was in my moms room... we lived with my grandparents. my little sister got into her coke once (yes, the drug) and i went ballistic... before i knew it she was moving away. so far away i couldnt save my sister from what came next... she was driving (both drunk and high) and failed to negotiate a curve... my 3 year old sister wasnt in a carseat or seatbelt... she was killed on impact... all i could think was "i could have stopped it. i could have said or done something more" her birthday would be in 32 days... and i cant bear to see that day again... i have no one where i live. when i feel like this they tell me to "snap out of it" or "i dont want to talk about this" so i came here... help me survive please
