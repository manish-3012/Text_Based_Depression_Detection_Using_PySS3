Why is there no respite or relief? Is this a sign?My mind just wonâ€™t stop. Iâ€™ve been in severe amounts of emotional pain since I woke up this morning. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. I usually am able to regulate and distract for a bit but it isnâ€™t working. 


So I want to be dead. I canâ€™t be conscious. Make it stop. Please
