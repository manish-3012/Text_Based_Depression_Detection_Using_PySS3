Need some advice on crisis services and help in Canada. Have severe distrust Hello all,

Thank you first and foremost for reading my post. I find myself in a position right now where I fear I might be spiralling. The suicidal thoughts have not completely taken over, however I'm afraid they will. I'm all alone at the moment, in between places, in between everything. As such, please I cannot ask anyone for help I am so very alone on this.

My concern/questions is regarding crisis services in Canada. I am very afraid to call the crisis line and text them in fear they get my number and track me.

This starts from an event that happened almost a year ago. Last year, in Montreal at Montreal general hospital, I faced a situation in which I cannot so far, recover from. One night I had been drinking, feeling like shit, I probably provoked this situation but a person I truly love called the authorities on me for suicide.

They barrelled into where I was staying, I was just at that point trying to eat, get w sense of normalcy. They cuffed me despite me pleading with them not to. There was no sign of a suicide attempt, no weapons, no anything. They berated me, told me it's the law and they will forcefully take me against my will. They searched through my things without my permission, they took IDs that they needed, they forced me in the cuffs. I told them I had nobody to vouch for me, I was alone. They were so incredibly rude, they treated me like I was insane and forced me to the hospital.

Montreal General is seriously spread thin. They do not have any resources whatsoever to cover whatever emergencies they get through, let alone a forced admission. They were unhappy to see me take a bed as they had to immediately check me in. I begged them to go home, I tried to call anyone, my whole family is overseas and they did not want me there. They forced me in a bed in a crowded hallway where I slowly started to unravel. I begged to see anyone, a doctor to let me leave. They told me tough luck you wait for tomorrow morning when the doctor has time. They called me selfish constantly despite me not wanting to be there and for asking to see a doctor so I can leave. After about 3 hours of this berating I made a bad judgement and insisted to leave.

They strapped me, forced my clothes off and put me in a robe. They told me I lost my privilege in keeping my regular clothes on. They proceeded to inject me with 4 different rounds of Ativan, none of them did anything. Ativan is supposed to relax people but since they did not bother to ask, they were unaware that I am severely resistant to Ativan and it tends to raise my blood pressure. I became more anxious, more alert on it. Their response was to keep injecting me. One of the nurses, not a doctor, when I told her shes wasting her time giving me Ativan decided to give me her two cents. She said she thinks I'm ? Tbh I don't even remember anymore bipolar? Disaccosiative? All these are not conditions I have. I have seasonal depression and chronic anxiety, I've seen several professionals for this.

I told her that she's not allowed to back seat diagnose me and that I can complain. She became hyper aggressive and told me that no one will listen to me as I am basically not worth the time.

The next morning, the specialized doctor shows up, I tell him I don't need his help, he discharges me. After all that happened I was not interested in their treatment. He made no effort whatsoever to try to treat me either. A GP shows up, checks my vitals and notes that I am having an abnormal reaction to the drugs in my system. I insist on a discharge anyway despite their concern.

I went home, it was a blur but I went home. Since that day, I have absolutely refused to speak about a single issue in my life. My significant other left me as well and I have nothing tethering me to life. I am using an alt, I refuse to see anyone. Everytime I remembered, for a while, what I went through I truly and honestly consider ending it because if that's the "solution" then clearly it's not worth pursuing.

Now, maybe I am ready to talk about this. I know for a fact that many of the things that transpired were wrong. However I am afraid, if I contact any form of crisis hotline, just to talk when my feelings overwhelm me that they will trap me in that situation again. Again, I truly would rather die. How does crisis services work? Will they contact the authorities if I reach out to them just to talk?

I am putting a moratorium on this thread. 24 hours and I delete. I cannot without feeling anxious leave a trace of who I am in fear of being forced again. I'd love to talk to the hotline and start to find a path forward but I am afraid.

I truly wish I was embellishing this story but I do have one person who will vouch for it.
