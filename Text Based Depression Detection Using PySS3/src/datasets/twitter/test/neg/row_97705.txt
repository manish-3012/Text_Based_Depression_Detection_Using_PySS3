first post on reddit hehe and maybe lastI'm 17, and have been struggling with pretty severe depression for the past 6 years of my life. I realized today that I might just be made to be alone. It's not something I like to think about a lot, but it has crossed my mind before. I've never actually made a long lasting connection with another human being. I've never had a best friend or a partner that has lasted longer than a year or two. But that all changed last year when I met him. He wasn't perfect, but no one is. We met over the summer and spent a lot of time looking at the stars, smoking cigarettes, and just talking. He got me on a level that no person ever has before and vice versa. And then within a few months, he fell in love with and moved away with one of my "good friends".  So that's another 2 relationships ruined. And it was my fault 100%. My only current friends think I'm stupid and constantly make fun of me in a way that they think I don't understand or berate me for little things, whilst always reminding me that I'm inferior and not good at what I do. There's not a single person who would choose me first. Not a single one. Everyone has someone else at the top of their list. Which is okay, I can't make anyone love me more. But it just hurts, ya know? Everything just hurts so bad that I wanna end it all. I can't seem to take the final step because I don't want my parents to be sad. But I'm so afraid to keep living. I know that if I make it to 30 I'll just be some druggie washup with nothing going for myself and no hope of recovering. The only thing that makes me feel even remotely better is abusing alcohol and hard drugs and chainsmoking Newports. There are times when I'm driving home at night, high off my ass, going 80+ down a country road and I just want to jerk the wheel and crash into a telephone pole and finally fucking die. But what if I survive? What if I'm severely disfigured or crippled and have to live out the rest of my life like that? What if I just turn into a vegetable and my family refuses to pull the plug? Those thoughts scare me more than anything. It just seems like there's no good option here.
