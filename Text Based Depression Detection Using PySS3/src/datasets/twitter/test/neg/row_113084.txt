It hurts, my soul hurts. nothing i do is good enough for anyone. not even myself. I am simply tired. My mother yells at me for being depressed and not being some overly happy person "i wanna rip your fucking head off, you have no respect for me....Im gonna kill myself you drive me so crazy".... I try so hard to fake a smile, I really do....And i am tired. sleep does not help, eating like a normal person does not help, therapy, antidepreesents...I wake up wishing iI didnt, I go to bed preying for it to end....I dont wanna hurt anyone but I want to stop hurting....I keep thinking there is no place for me in this world...that i have no place where I will ever belong....I get yelled at all the time....I just dont wanna hurt anymore
