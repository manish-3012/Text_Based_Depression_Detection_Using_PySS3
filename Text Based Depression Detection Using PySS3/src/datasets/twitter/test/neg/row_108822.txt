I need helpI have reached a point where I know I need professional help. I am so scared right now and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I am meeting with a new therapist on Friday. I feel like he is going to suggest or require inpatient care. Has anyone been placed in somewhere voluntarily or involuntarily? What was it like? Did it help?
