Just had my first legitimate thoughts on committing suicide and it's my own faultSuicide was something I had thought of from time to time whenever something bad happened, but never did I really see myself doing it. Yesterday, I just didn't want to live anymore and it was because of me. Not anything to due with an argument or abuse or any of that. I have an extremely privileged life, I don't have to go to school, I get all the junk food I want, my family is extremely caring, etc. The only slightest complaint that I have about my lfie that is out of my control is my ulcerative colitis, but even then, I got the medicine and proper treatment I need for it. The reason I thought of killing myself was because I'm a piece of shit. I'm just a leech who lives off of my parents' kindness, and thus, I do little to nothing for myself. I don't clean up after myself, I don't bathe myself, I just either sit on my ass, typing away on this computer, or lay in my room, playing video games and sleeping.

I was asked to do one thing yesterday, and it was to help clean up the soda cans in my room, as my dad was going to do the recycling that day. I hardly got three cans done until I broke down and my dad had to do the rest for me. I laid down for the rest of the day, just hoping to go to sleep and never waking up. And even as I was crying and being self depricating, I still felt no obligation or need to clean up after myself at all. My bed is a mess of plates and bags and I stared at them, feeling no need to clean it up at all, even with me feeling like shit for not cleaning up.

I don't think I have depression or anything, since that was my only episode of those emotions in my entire life, but it was still concerning to me. So uh, advice?
