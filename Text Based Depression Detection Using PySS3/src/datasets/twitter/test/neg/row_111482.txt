i know things will get better but maybe noti'm being treated for depression and ptsd and a lot of other things and i know things will probably eventually have to get better but right now i'm just so... sad doesn't even cover it. like deep pit of my being.

taking my medication seems like a waste and i keep thinking about the fact that people are literally better off without me and they wouldn't miss me, or they shouldn't. like if i somehow got brave enough to do anything they'd be sad but they'd realize that i was kind of shit anyways.

my friend told me to take my medication last night, and like just... the way she looked at me? the way she talked to me, and said please and how worried she sounded about me? i want to cry so much. no one should care that much about me, i'm not worth it.

literally all of my thoughts are just about how worthless i am and how i don't deserve any of the good things that have fallen into my lap and i know it's just depression i know it's just thoughts but 

i'm so tired i'm so sad i'm so upset why can't i just do it why can't i just kill myself why are there so many people who love me or think they love me when i'm not! worth! it!!
