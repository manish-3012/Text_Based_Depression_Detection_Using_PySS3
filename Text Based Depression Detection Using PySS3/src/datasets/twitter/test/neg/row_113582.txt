Should i go to the hospital?I am very very suicidal right now and ive been like this since 3 days. Ive been suicidal since childhood but today is very INTENSE because my chest hurts because i broke up with my gf. Should i go to hospital? I am worrying because they might call me attention whore or something . I cant tell them about my break up because i will be with my parents. What to do? My mind isnt listening to me. I am 20 and i dont want to kill myself because my mom will be very sad.
