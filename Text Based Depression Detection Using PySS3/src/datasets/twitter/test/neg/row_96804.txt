Thinking about it...I don't really see a point to my life anymore, it just seems as if I don't really have a future in this world. It just seems so empty and nonsensical, pretty mich leading to nowhere. No real interests, trying to learn new skills by myself seems too difficult, I just can't hold myself from giving up. I seem to be doing well at school, most people think I am going to have a bright future, but I am simply sure that I am going to hit a wall very soon. I pretty much don't have any true friends to help me out. My parents are trying to be supportive, but they seem not to truly understand my situation and sometimes they don't take it too seriously.

I am sorry if I sound like another dumb teen edgelord looking for attention (which I probably am anyway), but I just wanted to express my thoughts somewhere.

I think I should do it...
