I failed at life at the age of 20I don't even know why I'm making this post here, maybe I think that if I vent here it'll help me at least a small bit, I have come to a point where ending my life would mean the end of all of my problems. I am a technical school dropout that can't even get up and get my shit together. My family expects me to go to work and/or school but I don't even know If I can do it. 

I have been bullied in my early years of school, had no friends since junior high school. I was terrible in school. Then after some time for some reason most of my "friends" in that school turned their backs on me for no particular reason. I was the quiet kid, that rushed to my home as soon as it was possible. Non of the teachers liked me, and I always felt like a burden for everyone around me. I have a victim syndrome, so most things that people told me I believed without a second thought.

I even almost had a girlfriend at junior high school, but I didn't understand feelings, so I never engaged into actually knowing her a lot better. She was kind of obsessed with me, but all I ever did was talk to her at a school trip. After we came back, she would always sit beside me at breaks, asked how I was feeling etc.. But because I was really bad at understanding emotions, I never really did anything about it.

I wear a "mask" everytme I talk to anybody, I'm very good at hiding my true feelings to everybody, because I don't want them to worry about me. Friends around me also sometimes have depressive thoughts and states of mind but everytime I see that something is wrong I try to help them to the best of my ability. I always tell them that I'm here if they want to talk. 

Throughout the years I tried to busy myself with different things, such as: playing piano, making music, making art, making games, editing videos and making videos, doing photographs etc. but every time I touch a topic I just straight up suck at it. The only thing I'm kinda good at is probably playing games, I do like very difficult games such as Dark Souls, but that's beside the point. And the only thing I learned from it, was that if you want to be good at a certain thing you need to do that one thing alone and polish it first for a long time. But I also see so many successful people that do several of these things at once, so I guess I'm just not enough to do this. 

After a few months I learned that I guess I was born as a lone person, people turn their backs on me, and stab me in the back when it hurts the most. So I guess I'm just better of alone.

After I dropped out of my school, I realised that there's no future for me, I'm too stupid and lazy to even go to a job interview, I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. My family won't understand that something's wrong with me and keeps on thinking I'm "normal." 

My life was so boring, and uninteresting I remember only a small number of situations where I was really happy.

It's very hard to get out of bed, when my dad or my mom want me to go do something outside my home. 

I really dislike people. I just don't trust any people, and I can't bring myself to trust anyone. The second I trust somebody, I get stabbed in the back. 

I suck at socializing, I'm a weirdo, I'm a fuckup and I just want all of this pain to end.

The world today is way too fucked up, and just thinking about all of the things that are going around the world makes me sick. It's all going to end sooner or later anyway.

I want to disappear and go into and endless sleep where I don't have to feel anything and where I never existed.

My only safe space is my computer. Without it I'd probably kill myself even sooner.

I've reached the point in my life where everytime I hear or read about death it makes me want to commit to it even more.

I'm sorry, that this is all so frantically written and may make no sense, but there's just so many thoughts going through my head it's actually making my heart and head hurt. I'm sorry for my bad English, it's not my native language, Polish is.

I give myself about a month to two months, if nothing changes after that I will most likely end my life.

Am I scared about it? A little bit. Will I regret it? Maybe. But I want to feel okay, it's better to feel nothing. 

I know that my death will most likely make my family and friends sad, but I feel like it's the only thing that would make me feel at peace. And I know suicide is a very selfish move, but after all these years of actually caring about other people and putting myself at the last place for people I deserve this last choice of my life to be selfish.

I really don't know why I wrote all of this, I just want to be happy.
