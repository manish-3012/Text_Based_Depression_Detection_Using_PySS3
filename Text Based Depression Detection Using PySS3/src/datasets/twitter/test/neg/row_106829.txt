Iâ€™m planning my last trip - what excuse can I make for being gone?I only have one thing on my bucket list and I decided I might as well do it before I end my life. To make my trip worthwhile Iâ€™ll have to be gone about a week. Iâ€™m unsure what to tell my husband and employer so itâ€™s not suspicious though as Iâ€™m not the spontaneous type to take trips out of the blue. Iâ€™ll use most of the money I have in my savings to go. I wanted to leave it to my husband but he can sell my vehicle which is paid off so heâ€™ll still get a bit of money. 

Typing this out it seems selfish and too complicated to go. Maybe I wonâ€™t.
