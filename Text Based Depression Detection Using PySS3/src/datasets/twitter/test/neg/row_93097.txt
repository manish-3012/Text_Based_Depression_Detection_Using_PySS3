Let me go, I'm pleadingPut a gun to my head

A failure, by general consensus

Place a bomb by my feet

Let me go Iâ€™m begging

Let me go Iâ€™m pleading

`

Place the pills in my drink

Put the noose around my neck

It hurts to breathe

It hurts to think

`

Somethingâ€™s twisting up my mind

Somethingâ€™s in there breathing

I hear a voice crying out

But thereâ€™s no one here but me

`

Put a gun to my head

Let me feel that cool slick steel

Let me tremor with that bullet in hand

That power to end all ability to feel

`

Everything has an end 

A shame this story ends early

The last few pages leave unwritten

The final scroll unfurling

`

The voices in my head tell me to run

But to where, thereâ€™s no place to go

Trapped in the same never ending circle

can't rise too high and can't fall too low

`

Iâ€™m walking on a deserted road

That to no distant land lies

Iâ€™m walking alone on this empty path

Too numb to breathe it hurts to try

`

Oh please Iâ€™m beggin the heavens

Just place that gun by my soul

Let that gunshot silence and ring out

safer to end it than to not go

`

Iâ€™m walking under that moonless sky

In pitch black clouds of fog

Canâ€™t see but two inches before me

After all only the failures walk in their thoughts

`

and Iâ€™m curious to see where itâ€™ll take me

Iâ€™m curious to see where the darkness will stroll

Do you think that itâ€™ll be pretty?

the place that darkness calls home?

`

Someone place that gun by my hand

Someone place my finger on the trigger

Someone let me step into that next cab

Someone let my skin be just a bit thinner

`

The better to pierce the blade with

The better to carve like butter

The better to steal the courage of others

The better to walk in the heavens and not alone

`

God give me courage and give me that gun

Donâ€™t let me just walk please let me run

I have no need to change my mind

when I turn back thereâ€™s nothing left to find

`

thereâ€™s a faint burning in the back of the throat

but thereâ€™s no flame left in this life oâ€™ mine

the lungs have been crushed beneath the weight of a thousand lost dreams

no I donâ€™t cry, no my eyes refuse to ever weep

`

Put a gun to my head

A failure, by general consensus

Place a bomb by my feet

Let me go Iâ€™m begging

Let me go Iâ€™m pleading
