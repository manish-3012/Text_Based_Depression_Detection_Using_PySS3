ExpectationsI'm really just so so tired. I've been various degrees of suicidal since my mid-teens and it's almost always over people's expectations of me. There has never ever been any allowance or understanding of my mental state. If I'm not doing perfectly in life then I'm to be guilted, insulted, made to feel like dirt. 

I've been at breaking point for years but my performance hasn't been allowed to slip. I kept writing essays and putting together presentations even when I hadn't seen other humans or the outside world for weeks and once three straight months, when I couldn't sleep over debt, when I was awake 5 times every night convinced someone was breaking in, when I was distracted trying to catch ghosts on my camera, when I was sane but breaking down from stress every night.

Now in my last year of university I have given up. I couldn't work 30 hours a week and study 50 hours a week and somehow it led to uni being the one that I dropped. When she finds out I don't know what my future will hold but it won't be good.
