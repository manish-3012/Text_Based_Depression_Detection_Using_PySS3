I'm doneI'm going to end my life once the lock down is over.

Why live? I've never experienced something positive. My parents hate me and every day I wake up to them making my life a hell.

No one cares. Abusive relationships, bad friends, I have ADHD and autism spectrum disorder.

I tried to follow religion to get some relief but I can't see any. I tried taking up hobbies, I can't see any. I don't get free access to dorms in my uni so my parents will have to rent a place for me until I find a job and they'll be dictating me and making my life hell.

I'm a walking punching bag, nothing else
