I am am suddenly deeply depressed and I donâ€™t know why.I am a teacher. I have been crying in class, faculty meetings, in the middle of the night, all for no reason. I work at a very stressful inner city school, but that has always been the case.  I am making plans to stop myself from hurting myself should that be something I think about doing but I have deep dread about the future and I have severe urges to hurt myself. Please help me someone.
