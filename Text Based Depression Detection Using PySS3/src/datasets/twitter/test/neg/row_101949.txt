My head is full with suicidal thoughts...Iâ€™ve been thinking how happy people would be if I die? I mean, my parents would be the happiest but hahahah idk about others.. maybe same..? It hurts in my head and my heart... like you feel suffocating and tired. My parents said im a burden.. they said im ugly and useless.. theyâ€™re right tho I accept that. So maybe with killing myself will make them happy, why not right?
