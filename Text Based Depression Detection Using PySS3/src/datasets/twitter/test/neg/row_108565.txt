Why am I keeping myself alive again?For the past while I've been asking myself why I'm keeping myself alive. I'm not depressed, don't really have anything too wrong with me, but I just don't see the point of living. One reason I don't do anything is because it'll be a messed up thing for my family to have to go through, but really I think they can get over it. Besides that, I don't see the point. I'm a skeptic so please don't respond with any spiritual motivation because obviously that won't convince me. I've been deported from Canada and the USA and now live in Brazil, where I was born. I have a good head on my shoulders and a financially promising future. But I don't really know why I should bother graduating from university and get an amazing job and all that because I really don't have anything to live for.
