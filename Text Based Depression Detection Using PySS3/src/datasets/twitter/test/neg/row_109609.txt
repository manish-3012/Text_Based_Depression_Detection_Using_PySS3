Every spring it comes back.I left my baby in 2016. My first, last and only love. I broke our hearts and there is no coming back. Every fucking spring (especially around my birthday in march 20) im going suicidal. 2020 was 4th time i've planned everything to end up with myself, but guess what. It's another summer, i've survived every spring and im robot for the next 3 quadrums until the spring of 2021. 

On the side note (basically the main point of this post) this year i've become boomer af, finally found interest in politics, found my place in the world. Idk if i finally recovered my broken heart or what but i think that i've found reason to live which is pure hate to people. It drives me crazy and makes me go hard everyday. Im glad that 2020 is so fucked up, people are rioting, media are as fake as never, nationalism is rising up again. I have one message for my fellow sadboys: Find your enemy and beat the shit out of him.
