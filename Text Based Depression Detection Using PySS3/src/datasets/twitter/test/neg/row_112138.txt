Does anyone here get sudden urges to kill yourself despite being otherwise (somewhat) happy?I've been in a better mood for the past few months (in general). But sometimes, especially at night when I'm alone, I just start to...idk how to describe it, break down? I start involuntarily breathing heavily and freaking out, then I start to disassociate. This is usually accompanied by strong suicidal thoughts and urges. I don't self harm all that bad. I have a rusty box cutter in my room that I lost. I dont ever make myself bleed, just usually scratch my stomach and left arm. It doesnt really leave any permanent marks, maybe it looks a little red for the next few days. Kinda like if a dog scratched me. I havent been doing that here lately, I lost that box knife and am too much of a pussy to use scissors.

I fantasize about suicide often. About if people would care, what I would put in my note, etc etc. My earliest suicidal thought was in 3rd grade. I don't know WHY. I had no idea what depression was, much less suicide. I just spent that whole day wishing I was dead and wanting to hurt myself. I just finished 9th grade, and it still happens now. 

My dad confronted me in 6th grade by accusing me of being "goth to be cool," despite me never even being goth or emo or whatever, other than my music taste at the time (Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco, you get the idea. Bands with a large emo/goth fanbase). I told my mom in 7th grade (2017-18) after I had come close to actually killing myself quite a few times. It took her until February this year to reluctantly promise me a therapy session. I had another one of my breakdowns the night after my birthday celebration, which was actually an awesome day. It took until March for her to book it, it was rescheduled for June due to coronavirus. I'm not angry with my mom for this, I love her to death. I understand why she was reluctant but we're pass that. 

Anyways, even when I don't have one of my breakdowns, I still get the urge to kill myself often. Like I'll be driving to the store with my mom, while I'm in the passenger seat fantasizing about my death. At the same time, the thought of my mortality is fucking scary. I panic about that sometimes, too. I don't want to be DEAD, exactly, I just wish I was...gone. Or didn't exist. 

Along with all of this, I hate my body. No offense to any women here but I hate the fact that I was born as a woman. I hate my boobs and I hate my vagina, I hate my high pitched voice, and I hate the shape of my face. I hate the fact that my face is too fat so I have to keep my hair shoulder length. Think like, idk, about as long as Eddie Vedder from the 90s or Kurt Cobain. I don't understand why, but I do. I hate talking about this because I'm afraid I come off as sexist. I have no intentions of this and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.

I feel so guilty all of the time. I apologize to my mom all the time even if I didn't do anything. I'll ask if I did something wrong if she's doing something out of the ordinary. I bet she probably gets annoyed. If any of my friends are even slightly upset about something, I'm always worried I did something to hurt them. 

I'm sorry if this post went on too long, I didnt intend for it to be. I just wanted to tell someone about this and didn't feel like annoying any of my friends. There's a lot I didn't talk about here but this is all I can handle right now.
