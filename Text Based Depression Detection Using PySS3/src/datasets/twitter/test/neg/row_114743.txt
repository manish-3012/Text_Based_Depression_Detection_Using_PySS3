Iâ€™m dead inside and going to finish the jobI havenâ€™t been suicidal since a while because Iâ€™ve been stoned the entire time (2 years).  Iâ€™m out of weed now and the depression has been unmasked.  Almost 16 years old and no matter how much weight I lose and how much I workout Iâ€™m never as good as the other kids.  Iâ€™m not even fat but 5 extra pounds in the wrong places kill any self worth I have and make me look worse than every other kid with a 6 pack who eats Cheetos all day.  All I see are kids hooking up and just living life and the only girl Iâ€™ve kissed is - wait thatâ€™s right nobody because I truly am a loser.  Iâ€™m not trying to throw a pity party but Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing and donâ€™t have any friends, loneliness just makes me more and more hopeless.  All my life whenever something goes well or I think it did, it turns out just being the exact opposite.  It feels like no matter how hard I work for anything it will be outside my reach.  Iâ€™m going to fill up my bath tub get inside then drop a hair dryer in.
