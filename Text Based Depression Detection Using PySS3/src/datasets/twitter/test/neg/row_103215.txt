I'm so so tiredI hate everything about myself and my situation..Nobody has ever loved me, my parents are abusive and I've never had any close friends , I've never had any kind of relationship. I'm the shit at the bottom of the barrel nobody wants. Not a single man wants me either. I just want someone to love me. What's wrong with me that everyone hates me like this. Is it too much to ask for someone to care about me , to think I'm pretty and interesting and actually value and respect me , to think I add something to their life and that they'd miss me if I was gone. I'm done with this shit. I can't even go to a therapist and I have a year left to deal with this shit before I can possibly start to reach out for help only to be on a long ass waiting list and probably not even get fixed. I can't do it anymore , I've lived in an abusive household all my life and for 3 years have been dealing with the worst depression. Worst of all it's affecting my future , I have no clue if I will ever get into a decent uni or get a job because I'm starting to slip up in my standards because I'm too tired to put work in anymore. I struggle to fall asleep yet I can't get enough of it. I'm so tired every day. Nothing helps anymore. I just want it to end. Maybe I should just fucking kill myself. It's not like anyone would miss me. I literally have absolutely 0 people who care , it's the shittest thing ever , maybe that's a good thing though. I'll die and be forgotten and have no consequences. It's not like I was worthy of anything good anyway. I'm ugly and disgusting, my parents never loved me so clearly I did something wrong to deserve it , nobody else gives 2 shits about me so clearly there isn't anything right about me. Clearly I'm worth nothing..what's the point of carrying on anymore
