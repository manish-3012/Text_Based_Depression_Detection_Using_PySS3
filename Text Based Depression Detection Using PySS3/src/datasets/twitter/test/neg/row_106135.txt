Going to make it as easy as possible for my familyI'm 34 and I honestly didn't think I would be still here. I day dream about a natural disaster, a military attack or an incurable disease taking me out. It would be so much easier, but since that isn't going to happen I'll just have to start planning my exit. One of my concerns was leaving an even more stressful situation behind for my family, so I am going to continue downsizing all of my belongings, pay down car debt, clean my vehicle with a detailed instructions on how much to sell it for to pay for my cremation and then I would like to write a few final letters. I think it's important to help with closure to at least write to the important people in your life or just a few words explaining why it had to end. 

I was born in negativity, raised by a chronically depressed Mom, felt unwanted by my Dad, always attracted to horrible women that bleed me emotionally dry and I'm done trying to find a decent woman to share my life with. A woman isn't going to make me happy, it's always fleeting and the love is one sided. I'm tired of working my ass off just to make pennies and barely afford to survive. 

My goal in life was to buy some land, build a home, grow my own food, get married, have kids, but I don't think I am meant to have that kind of emotional security or support. I do enjoy traveling, so I might plan a trip and just lay down on the ground, look up at the night sky and do the sleeping pill route. Nature can just reclaim my body.
