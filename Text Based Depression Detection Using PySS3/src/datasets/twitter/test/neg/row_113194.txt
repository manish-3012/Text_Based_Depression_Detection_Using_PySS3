tired and stressedi feel like a waste of space because im not doing anything with my life, whether thats sports, going out with friends, or just being a useful person overall. school has been nothing but problems and more stress on my mind, every time i try to talk to people at lunch they just walk away, and some of these people used to be close with me. it confuses me, but also upsets me a lot, because i really want to just have people in my life to occupy myself with man...
