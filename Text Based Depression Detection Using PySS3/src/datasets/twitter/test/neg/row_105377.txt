I can't do this...I am so lonely. I have "friends" but no one to really talk to, as fast as I try to talk they stop listening or start to talk about something after they've said a little "awww"

I don't feel like I'm worth something. No one really cares. I've really had enough of this life. Not for even one second I've felt happy over the fact that I've failed my suicide attempts. Plural. Not even able to do that right lol. It's really not worth it.

Fuck.
