Failed attempt #3I'm going through major problems that I simply do not feel equipped to deal with at 29. Everything came really easy to me: smart, good looks, humor, great family, great boyfriend, etc.  Well, last night, I drank a lot of beer and took 50 Benadryl tables (not great at math but I think it was 3750 mg). I was fucked up, but I am still here. I woke up. How is that possible? Last weekened, I downed 60 mg of klonopin, maybe 12 Benadryl, and various cocktails. I still woke up. Didn't Heath Ledger die from less? Two years ago, I was admitted to the psychiatric hospital for doing basically the same things I did in the past week.  The difference between the hospital and the 2 attempts this week is that I reached out the first time but not the second and third times.  I don't understand why I won't die. I'm just want it to be over. Everytime I call the hotline, I feel worse. I am uncomfortable voicing my feelings. I know those volunteers mean well, but I want out, not to get better. I have no energy. I am on the border of losing my job. I have had enough of life and do not understand why these so-called dangerous substances aren't working the way they're supposed to work.

I realize that there wasn't a question there. I just needed to vent through Internet anonymity.
