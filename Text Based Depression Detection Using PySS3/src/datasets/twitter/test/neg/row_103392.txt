How does one learn how to live when they are suicidal?We donâ€™t really know what this world is. Why we are here. It can be so beautiful and fun yet we worry about how other people think of us, the things we â€œcanâ€™tâ€ do and we give up. 
Iâ€™ve allowed myself to crawl back into a whole I spent an entire year getting out of. 
Every night I think about giving up, just so I can stop feeling. But I question why I care? If Iâ€™m just going to give up on life why donâ€™t I just try not caring about the things getting me down first. 
I could travel. I could move. I could change my number and cut the toxic people out of my life. Change jobs. Change schools. Work out. Find a better life / work balance. 
These things can be done. Yet I keep telling myself they canâ€™t. I have to remember itâ€™s never a no, itâ€™s how is it a yes...and figure it out. Cause I can only feel how I feel..:I can only live my life. I only have control over my emotions and my feelings. Iâ€™m the only one who can change my life.
Iâ€™m always suicidal. But I donâ€™t want to die. I need to figure out how to ignore my stupid emotional brain and figure out how to live.
