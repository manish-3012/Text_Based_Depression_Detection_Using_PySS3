i'm scared of everythingi've always been mature for my age. when i was eight, i already had a solid political ideology, when i was nine, i made internet friends that were much older than me, and now, i'm ten, and i've attempted suicide four times. 
one of my earlier memories was of me being molested by my female neighbor, who was in high school at the time. lucky me got molested by her multiple times, and when i got older, again by a girl i considered to be my friend. my brain keeps on telling me it was my fault, which seems pretty typical. i constantly think of the physical pain it made me feel. i'm so scared that it'll happen again.  a byproduct of my molestation was a refusal to eat. now i'm about forty pounds underweight. i've lost the ability to think clearly or focus, clearly due to malnutrition. i'm always cold, and i'm constantly shaking/shivering. i hate my body so much, i feel like no matter what, i'll never be happy with it. everybody tells me i look fine, but my brain won't let me believe it, i don't know why. i know it's likely i'll end up in a mental hospital again, but i still refuse to eat. one of my friends (that unfortunately lives all the way across the world) is literally the only reason i keep going. i'd do anything to cuddle him, but with my extremely dysfunctional family, i doubt it'll ever happen. on top of everything, i've found i'm bisexual. i know my super GOP family would disown me if i came out, so very few irl people know. i'm so fucking scared that somebody will tell my parents out of hate. my entire school knows,  and most of my school hates me to death (likely because i'm far from the current social norm). it's so hard to find friends, and when i do they are on internet, way older than me, and only see me as some sort of "woke ten year old" because i like politics and 4chan. i am so fucking sick of living. all i do is cry and complain. i know i'm selfish, and i hate myself for it. i just want somebody to hold me and tell me that everything will be okay, but apparently that's way too much to ask. i'm so scared that everything i do is just a colossal waste of time. i'm sick of saying i'm okay. i'm sick of taking antidepressants that do nothing to help at all, and that make me puke if i don't eat, which is most days. i want to help somebody, or be of worth to people, but it isn't happening. i've come to despise humanity, specifically the current generation. i'm sorry.
