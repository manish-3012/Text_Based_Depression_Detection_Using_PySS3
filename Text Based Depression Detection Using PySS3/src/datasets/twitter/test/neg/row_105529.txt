It's my birthday &amp; yet I still feel so young.It's past midnight where I live. It's officially my 16th birthday. I'm almost an adult now. I don't want to get older, I'm scared of being alone. Getting older might mean I'm closer to moving away from my father but part of me wants to stay. I feel helpless because I feel alone. I feel like a child. I feel like I need somebody to take care of me, which I know is stupid but I don't know what to do about it. I still feel like I'm a little kid hiding behind a chair. A little kid being forced to sit in a mans lap. A little kid who had to call an ambulance for my own mother. A little kid who just wants a fucking hug. Why can't I just be strong?
