Sorta cringe but a vide no doubt I was just thinking about life again tonight and I felt empty and I was thinking of the things that make me happy and what I really want isnâ€™t sex or going out on crazy parties with some friends like people do in movies, I really just want to be able to be laying down with that special someone staring up at the stars talking about life and gazing at the infinite cosmos on a blanket in a field. I know this is sort of unorthodox from the usual posts here but I just kind of wanted to express my feelings and see if other people feel the same way so if this gets downvoted a lot I will understand. But thanks for reading my thoughts.
