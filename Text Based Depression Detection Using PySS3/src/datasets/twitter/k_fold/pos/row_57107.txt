Is my relationship weird? Is my relationship weird?

A little context before you answer, sheâ€™s 13, Iâ€™m 15. When we started dating we were 12 and 14, and weâ€™re almost on 11 months. Weâ€™re really happy together but Iâ€™m afraid people will frown upon me when I tell them about my relationship, so far Iâ€™ve only told people I trust. Both sets of parents know, my mom is all about it, hers is not so happy with it and wonâ€™t let me explain myself. I honestly feel like I could go long term with her. As the title asks, is my relationship weird? I might have to delete this soon because my friends know about my account and I didnâ€™t have enough karma on my throwaway.
