School is coming back so as my anxiety I changed for a new school this year and all of my friends went to a different school and lately I've had a lot of anxiety because I am not good at making friends because I am very shy and introvert. I'm afraid I get bullied. In my last school the only friends I had were from my class. Any advices (to get less anxious or to make friends easier) please?
