Im in the friendzone deep enough that i might be into the step bro zone now Ik this girl thats a year younger than me , we\`ve known eachother for around 10 years which makes us pretty much best friends by standard recently we\`ve started getting closer and closer to the point i dont care what she does around me nor does she we\`re pretty much like step-bro and step-sis in the PH sense but not that deep in yet its weird i guess y\`d call it friends with benefits or something but idk if she wants a relationship or no , i dont want one personaly but idk bout her
