A family friend just died in a tragic accident It was unexpected. He was just taking his dog on a walk on their street and suddenly, he was hit by a car. Apparently, the driver was still learning how to drive and he stepped on the accelerator instead of the breaks. I canâ€™t imagine the pain his family is going through. Iâ€™m not really close to them but just hearing the news that he died just made my heart sink.

Imagine that, you went outside early in the morning, just taking your dog on a walk not knowing that it would be your last day on earth. Itâ€™s scary.

So please, spend as much time with your family, tell the people you love that you love them, and â€œcontinue to fill your hearts with the things that matter. Donâ€™t let your heart fill up with the capacity with things that donâ€™t.â€-Andrew De Pano
