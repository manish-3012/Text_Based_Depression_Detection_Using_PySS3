do any of you guys feel like you're nobody's best friend? I have "friends" and would probably consider them "best friends" because they're the closest friends I have. but I think each of them have other closer friends' than to me. there's not a mutual "best friend-ness" between myself and my friends. every close friend I have, are friends to other people that they're willing to call their "best friend". I don't like to think I'm super lonely, but I don't feel like I'm part of a group since the supposed group I'm part of have sub groups that I'm not part of, and those sub groups seem more closer together. I don't know how to explain this, but does anyone else feel like you would know people that would consider YOU their "best friend"? is this all in my mind? do I have real friends??
