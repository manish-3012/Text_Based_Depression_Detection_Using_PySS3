why am i so fucking stupid why did i ever think im worthy of happiness? im a miserable, stupid, annoying, piece of shit. i donâ€™t have any real friends and i never will because im not worth it. i should just fucking run away so i can rot in a gutter long ago like i planned. nobody would fucking miss me and no one would care. id get all the suffering i deserve and people would finally be rid of me. theyâ€™d finally get that one annoying kid to stop bothering them so they can stop pretending to be nice to everyone. i donâ€™t know why i ever thought people would want to be my friend. im a loser. im a nerd, im a complete dumbass, and overall a fucking pathetic excuse for a â€œfunctioning humanâ€. im supposed to be in the social high of my life, but i havenâ€™t talked to any of my â€œcloseâ€ friends in a month. every time i do they just pretend to be excited to see me. they say â€œhey whatâ€™s up?â€ and the casual talk people expect. every time i ask if they wanna hang out, the question gets pushed aside with â€œoh no Iâ€™m busy, sorryâ€ but theyâ€™ll happily post about how much of a great time theyâ€™re having with friends the same week. i just wish i could fucking off myself already, i already know no one would care if i never spoke again. all thatâ€™s holding me back is the fear of failure and becoming more of a burden than i already am. itâ€™s disgusting I live like this and i trudge ever onward in false hopes of happiness one day.
