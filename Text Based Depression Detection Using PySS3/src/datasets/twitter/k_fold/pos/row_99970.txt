Teenagers of Reddit, how is life for you currently? (Mods please mercifully banish me if this goes against a rule)

Potentially mandatory: I am not a teenager. I (25M) have been curious for a while what it must be like to be a teenager in the world as it is right now, as already I believe my experience, as short a while ago as it was, was vastly different. 

The main reason for this is a want to always keep up with change, which is a mistake many of my generationâ€™s parents made when they assumed too much about us based on their lives in the 60s and 70s etc. With the way society is advancing, there are things that exist where even Iâ€™m saying â€˜when I was your age...â€™ to someone 7 years younger than me, and itâ€™s crazy to me to be at this stage.

Are you happy? What pressures do you have? What worries you?
