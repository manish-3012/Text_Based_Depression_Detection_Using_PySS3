If someone smoked weed in the past can they get in legal trouble? Iâ€™m asking this question because I have a friend 15(f) and her old friends were just constantly messaging her about why she is still alive, and how they arenâ€™t surprised she isnâ€™t dead yet(from suicide). And as an argument they had was to bring up how she smoked weed about a month ago. Iâ€™m trying to convince her itâ€™s fine to take this to the school/police. But sheâ€™s afraid of getting in trouble.
