Ok here it goes. This is what I've been thinking since sometime. So I said good night to this girl but I want to talk to her :( so much and I know she won't text me now but I'll wait for her text in the morning. I hope she texts me later at night. Seeing her msg in the morning first thing is honestly a very good feeling. Even if it is just "are you asleep?" Gives me a sense of feeling that she was thinking about me :(
