Yeah uh, holy fucking shit the anime RE:ZERO is a horrifying rollecoaster. I can't say about all of both seasons, since i only as of now finished watching the 15th episode of the first season, but let me tell you, from the very first eposide to at least up to the 15th one, the deeper you get into the lore, the more emotional, chaotic, and at points outrageously dystopia-like. So if you haven't watched that anime yet and are planning to, please be prepared for a shitstorm if you're a really emotional person.

First it wasn't as bad, but then later i felt like i couldn't await for nothing good to come, then it became better, and then at last death and destruction came. I don't know how this all will continue, but this is, to put it simply, the stages of how i felt troughout the time up to this point.

Seriously, after watching the 15th episode, the main characters trauma even spread to me a little bit trough the screen. I'd say im emotionally stable to not go to a terrible state cuz of an anime, but holy fuck i feel like im on an edge. Now that i think about it, that anime has to be for ages 18 and above. And im only becoming 16 in February.

Legit after the 15th episode when i stood up to go to the bathroom, i felt like i was experiencing psychosis. Luckily a deep breath and a quick prayer fixed that, but even in the bathroom i felt like i was turning into a psychopath.

I love that anime, but i seriously gotta watch out if i feel like i can't handle no more. Maybe ill just try to get used to the madness haha.
