If you want a better America than you would get by electing trump again hereâ€™s how you would do it: First: make sure everyone above 12 has it drilled into their head that unproven conspiracy theories are to be ignored or fought against.

Second: lower the minimum age to vote down to 12.

Third: Make all future presidents 14 and 15 year olds that give easily into peer pressure.

Fourth: Watch as America has a slower destruction than before.
