Why are there people that are fetishizing being different because theyâ€™re desperate for attention? Bruh I swear so many people do it for attention. People say â€œoOoH iM sO iNtRoVeRtEdâ€ yet in order to feel comfortable they are constantly around a group of people.

Lots of them self diagnose and shit. Mental illness isnâ€™t quirky. Thereâ€™s this trend going on on instagram too where people are showing their eyebags and people are drawing on eyebags, and some are saying â€œOOOh I wish I had eyebags theyâ€™re so quirkyâ€
Like stfÃº insomnia isnâ€™t quirky.

Iâ€™m going to go off on some guys here. Stop calling youself a fucking skater boy with your thrasher shirt and carhartt beanie when you only take out your skateboard for instagram posts.

Fucking attention whores dude. Also, this is gonna get kind of morbid so 

#trigger warning past this point

One of my close friends killed themselves, and this one girl that obsessed over him, yet manipulated him and who he hated, posted her crying multiple times acting like they were in a relationship. It made me sick tbh.
