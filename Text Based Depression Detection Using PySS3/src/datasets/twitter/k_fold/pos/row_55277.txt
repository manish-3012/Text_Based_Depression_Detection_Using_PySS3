Why schools, why. Why arnt there security cameras in my classrooms, it fucking stupid why there arnt. It would stop so many cases of bullying and other stuff such as, teachers abusing students sexually, and also fails accusations about teachers being abusive. It's a win win to having them in class. *So why arnt there*
