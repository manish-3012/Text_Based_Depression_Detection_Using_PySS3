I think my teacher is a little slow So civics class starts at 9:30, he starts class at 9:25 and gets mad that we werenâ€™t there at 9:20, so hes mad because we werent there when he started class before we were supposed to be there, he does this every day, OH AND he assigned 4 projects last tuesday that were due last friday, still, nobody has finished even the first one
