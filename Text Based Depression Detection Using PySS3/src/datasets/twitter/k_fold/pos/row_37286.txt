Help one of friends tried to kill themselves I'm trying to keep this simple but they just opened up to me about happened a couple days ago and it was nothing crazy but they cut themselves said "I knew it was going to hurt but that's why I wanted to" they also claimed to have this massive flood of emotions. They say everything is under control but so worried about them this has never been something I've had to deal with so I need some help
