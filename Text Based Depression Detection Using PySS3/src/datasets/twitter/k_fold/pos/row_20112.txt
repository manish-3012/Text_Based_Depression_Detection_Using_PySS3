I seriously think I might have dyslexia Like whenever I type something I would leave out words unknowingly and make typos even though I know how the word is written. Its also affecting my reading which makes me misinterpret large bodies of texts and forces me to read the thing over and over to truly understand it. I really wanna get it diagnosed but I don't know where.
