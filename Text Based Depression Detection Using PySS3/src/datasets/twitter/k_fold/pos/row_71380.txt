What just happened to my friend seems like a comedy skit So we're both freshman boys in high school and don't know many people and so the first day of school ny friend is in Bio and this girl walks up to him and actively starts having a conversation. So the two of them are friends now and me and the rest of our friends like to joke of "when's the wedding?" Sp today he told us he was finally going to ask her her number, and he got it, but he also learned: she's trans. So he just tells me "not exactlt my league" and so any romantic possibility there is now gone. But hey they're still good friends and Im happy he found a friend already that he gets along really well witg.
