What the heck star wars? It just came to my mind that PadmÃ© was 14 in the first episode.
They had a 14 year old queen. She could have started a giant war just because she felt bad or something.

This is nothing against 14 year old girls or any 14 year olds for that matter but they shouldn't have that kind of responsibility and power.

Also she probably didn't have a good childhood because she was flying around all the time.


Sorry for the rant but I'm bored.
