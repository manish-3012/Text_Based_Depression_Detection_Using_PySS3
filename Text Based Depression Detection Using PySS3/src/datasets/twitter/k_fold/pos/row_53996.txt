Anyone else get annoyed by the "girl snap code" ? I've seen this go around on snapchat a ton lately. A post saying "if it's just an eye she feels ugly, compliment her." Or "black screen she feels bad, cheer her up." When I speak my opinions about these, I get talked down to and get called negative a lot. 

The main thing is trying to cheer them up. The thing is, most of the time that's all I do. Trying to make people feel good just feels right to me. But it really bothers me when if you're a guy and feeling down, they don't give you the same treatment and just say "that sucks" or "cheer up" without giving any other positive reinforcement (at least in my experience).

But the thing that really grinds my gears is the " if she leaves you on read double snap so she knows you care".  Why should I go out of my way to talk to you if you're not gonna put the same effort in to keeping the conversation alive and then complain that no one talks to you. It's because of expecting them to talk all they can to make sure you respond but you won't do the same for them.

Sorry if this is confusing. Im extremely sleep deprived so im doing my best at explaining.
