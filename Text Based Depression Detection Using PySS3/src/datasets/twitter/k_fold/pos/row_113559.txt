Do you listen to music a lot ? I donâ€™t know if iâ€™m normal or whatâ€™s happening to me. I feel like I canâ€™t cary on the day without jamming to some music or something like every hour everyday. I donâ€™t know maybe itâ€™s because dopamine is released into your brain when you listened a song you like? Like no matter what situation, happy, sad, overwhelming, overthinking, I just put music on and I feel better than before
