Why does everything go wrong Everyday i try to help my parents in house work and chores and stuff cuz they think im lazy. I try to do everything properly but something always ends up going wrong. They are Pakistani so that automatically means that they will yell at the litllest things.
I dont know what i should do i just wanna give up but that will only make it worse as they already think i dont do shit.
