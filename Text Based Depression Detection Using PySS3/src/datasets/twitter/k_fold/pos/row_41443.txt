I get 7s, 8s and 9s (A &amp; A*) and my mum doesn't care. I don't submit some homework for ONE subject and get yelled at, told that all I do is play on the computer and that I'm stupid This is the same person that wants me to get into Oxford / Cambridge and is trying to make me publish this 'book' (20 pages long, decent but not writer's quality).

I'm 13 mum, not a mastermind.
