Can anyone explain wtf is happening to me? Iâ€™m super nervous for absolutely no reason, Iâ€™m trembling, having trouble breathing a bit, my heart is beating so fast that it sounds like itâ€™s gonna explode, Iâ€™m nauseous, I donâ€™t wanna eat, and i just sorta think Iâ€™m losing my mind. This happens quite often soooo... can anyone explain pls?
