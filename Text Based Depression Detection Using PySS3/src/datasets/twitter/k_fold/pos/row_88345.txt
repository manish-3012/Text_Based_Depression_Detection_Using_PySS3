I would like to have my organs donated I should make a paper that states that all of my organs can be donated after I die. 

My brother got cancer a few years ago. It was extremely bad. Eventually it got to the point where he needed a new heart. His condition was so terrible that he was put at the end of the organ transplant line. 

Apparently some young girl had died at a hospital in our country. My brother got her heart. I don't know how it was arranged. He was at the end of the transplant line. But somehow he still got it. 

My brother is fine now. He's able to live a pretty normal life. He did lose his shoulder to the cancer but that is still far far better than what could've happened. 

Sometimes I think about the people in front of my brother on the line. I hope they were able to get a heart. But they probably didn't. Some of them might still be waiting. Others might be dead.

So I would like to have my organs donated. I could swap places with someone who deserves to live more than I do.

It makes me happy that someone's daughter or son will be able to walk out of hospital after I die. It means that my meaningless life will finally have some meaning. That even if I've failed, I'm able to give someone else a chance to succeed.
