I am a tough situation. So i think my life is fuckin' shit
My parents divorced couple years ago i live with my mom and my grandmother but we are having financial difficulties and my grandmother is not even barely supportive and is mentally torching my mom, so recently my mom's friend found a job some where far from our current location and i am in 11th grade right now and i might have to shift with her and lose all my friends keep in mind i am an extremely introverted dude and not ready to adapt to change that quick. I dont know what do i do i am really scared and nervous.
