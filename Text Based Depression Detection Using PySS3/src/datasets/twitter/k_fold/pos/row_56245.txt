Tips anyone? I got my first ever job interview tomorrow and I'm nervous as fuck. It's a first first job so I'll be pushing carts and taking out the trash but still it's my first and I'm about to shit myself. I know to some it may not seem like much but I'm finally able to work and contribute to society, that's how I feel about this. 


My parents have been giving me advice on how to act or what to say but I feel like i need more. So for any of you got any tips or small things that would be most appreciated. Please anything
