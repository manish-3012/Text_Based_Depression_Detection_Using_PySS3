School mental health study So my school announced that mine (15-16 years old) and the class two grades lower is going to be part of a mental health program which is held nationwide by the closest University near the school, they told us that at first we will have a few weekly/reocurring meetings in class with the people who do the program to talk about different things, the main point of it is Stress and Anxiety for Students and how to deal which both of those problems, thus we will be talking about our lifestyle, eating habits, self harm and many other things.

In between/at the start (I really don't remember), we will get asked Questions (anonymously and online) which we can answer if we want to, one year later they will visit again for us to do a very close to even identical survey, so they know what changed in that time, we don't have to take part.

I for my part will tho, because I think it's a important topic and really helpful that it's getting the attention it needs, because mental health problems as well as self harm and to much stress can be unhealthy and even dangerous.
And if I can be a help for the study by just answering a few Questions, I'm in.
Also all data is secure and not used anywhere else, and the test is completely voluntary, as well as time sufficient as it takes place while we have school, so there's no point against taking place to me. 

So now it's your turn, what do you think about it? Would you take part? I'd just like to know about your Opinions on the program, but also feel free to ask me some Questions or share your view on the topic.
