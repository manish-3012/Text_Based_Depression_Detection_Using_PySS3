Just felt two contradiction emotions at the same time (I think that's how you take a screenshot) So I was just hangin out, playing some smash on my switch in bed, and then my dickhead of a brother comes in and starts yeeting random objects at me and then laughing when I react annoyed. So after a few minutes I finally get him to leave.

So I turn back to my switch. I was playing online, so i couldn't pause the game which resulted with me losing two lives. So I was like "eh, might as well give it a try egen though I'm down 3-1", but then this absolute chad that was my opponent jumps off the stage twice so it's still a fair fight. If I had been voice chatting with them, I think i would've told them that I love them.
