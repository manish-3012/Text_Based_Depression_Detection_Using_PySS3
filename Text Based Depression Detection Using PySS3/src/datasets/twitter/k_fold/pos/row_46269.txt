In the span of three weeks... I went from the new kid at my school that nobody knew super well who just kind of chilled to that one cancer kid that EVERYONE knows. Itâ€™s so annoying. Most everyone is super nice about it but I donâ€™t get why people who I legitimately have never talked to in my life are suddenly messaging me with their thoughts and prayers and all that. And like nothing bad to them, I get that theyâ€™re trying their best and I donâ€™t wanna hate on that but I really really really wanted to feel normal for the rest of the school year but apparently nope, everyone has to know now.
