A quick summary of my life on the internet. -I should meet some new, interesting people.

*goes to random sites, meets quite a few people*

-It's fun, I got people to talk to.

*Every single one of them makes the conversations dry as hell*

*I ghost them*

-Yeah, not doing that shit again. Solo gaming irl is fun as well.

^There ^is ^nothing ^social ^social ^flair.
