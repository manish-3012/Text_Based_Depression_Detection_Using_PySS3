Friend has been mostly ignoring me for about a week, idk what to say or do 
I [17m] have been close friends with her [17f] for years and we have texted pretty much every day, not as much during the school year usually but a lot since covid started since we are both stuck at home. But over the past week she has taken anywhere from 4 hours to just ignoring texts for a whole day and barely saying anything to me. We had some long and normal text conversations earlier this week and some short conversations through Snapchat and she seems fine, like thereâ€™s no significant difference in her snaps or even the very little that we text. But she is having some serious mental health struggles and idk if this is related or not so Iâ€™m just generally confused. Itâ€™s honestly just super weird and such a sudden change from almost a year of texting 500 times a day every day.Basically my question is should I text her asking why sheâ€™s been taking literal days to respond and if sheâ€™s okay? 

tl;dr: friend basically ignoring me after many months of talking tons every day, confused on what to say
