Guys help, I'm genuinely terrified Ok, so the story goes like this.

At the start of the year I changed house, I changed phones and my email/gmail address. And since then, everything 
was fine. 

But today, it happened. When it happened I thought to myself: "that's not possible. How did it found me?"

What happened was: I was playing a random game on my phone, and I clicked on an ad to get some reward. This is normal, but now it gets dark. The ad that appeared scared me. It was Duolingo. 

"He found me", I said. Even after changing house, phone and email, it found me.

What do I do?
