Guys I finally got a girlfriend! And I dumped her because it was a toxic relationship and had a negative effect on my wellbeing. I got help with writing the text and my dad said he was proud of how I dealt with it. I could barely see her and she wasn't nice to me anyway. 

There's loads of posts of people getting into good relationships but remember that getting out of a bad one is just as impressive.
