Growing up, I had irrational fears To start off, my mom has told me that I used to be terrified of a deflated blowup snowman (I believe she said it was across the street from where we lived at the time). I apparently screamed bloody murder at the sight of it (I don't quite remember because I was really little when it happened).

Next, I was supposedly scared of drama faces. Mom says that the funniest part was there were drama faces in the neighbourhood. Yet I apparently wasn't scared of getting hit by a vehicle.

According to my sister, I used to get a lot of nightmares. She's said that there used to be weird monsters in my dreams. She's said that she used to tell me that she'll go beat them up. I apparently used to laugh and end up falling asleep again. She thinks that picturing tiny her beating up monsters is probably what made me laugh (she has dwarfism).

When I got older, I remember becoming more and more scared of falling. I used to be able to use escalators just fine but when I was 8 or 9, I suddenly became scared to use them out of nowhere. I can use elevators just fine, though. On certain kinds of stairs, I'm noticeably cautious when walking on them. I remember being on a teeter totter with someone when I was 5 or 6 and being fine but when I got older, I felt nervous/scared when I was higher in the air.

That's not quite all but yeah, I developed strange fears growing up.
