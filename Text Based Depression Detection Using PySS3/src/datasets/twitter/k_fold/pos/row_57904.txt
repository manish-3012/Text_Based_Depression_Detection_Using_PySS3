A song I wrote Yeah

Why donâ€™t music gotta be so good

How about I show you what we could

If we bring back the music that wasnâ€™t a dud

Just really gotta go digging in the mud

Because We wanna see a thud

I donâ€™t wanna be listening to a spud

And I guess Iâ€™ll show you what we should

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

So I am sailing down a river

As I try hard not to quiver

I guess now Iâ€™m eating dinner

Really hope this isnâ€™t thinner

But I guess I stole your liver

As Iâ€™m showing you a skinner

Whilst Iâ€™m feeling kinda chiller

And now itâ€™s time you see your killer

Because weâ€™re ending it with a thriller

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Anybody wanna show me up (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take my cup (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take me down (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take me 6 feet underground

Anybody wanna show me up (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take my cup (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take me down (yeah yeah)

Anybody wanna take me 6 feet underground

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Yeah

Why donâ€™t music gotta be so good

How about I show you what we could

If we bring back the music that wasnâ€™t a dud

Just really gotta go digging in the mud

Because We wanna see a thud

I donâ€™t wanna be listening to a spud

And I guess Iâ€™ll show you what we should

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Guess Now I gotta demonstrate how many syllables I can say. So here we go.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Anybody Wanna take me Steven

Down But I am like a demon

I am like Jack the Ripper

Whilst your staring at the big dipper

This verse is gonna get quicker

Anybody gonna try it slicker

Anybody wanna fuck with me

Iâ€™m gonna take you out by the knees

Iâ€™m running out of time

Gotta speed it up or pay a dime

Not even eminem can see this pace

But Iâ€™m gonna put you rappers in your place

cuh

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Yeah

Why donâ€™t music gotta be so good

How about I show you what we could

If we bring back the music that wasnâ€™t a dud

Just really gotta go digging in the mud

Because We wanna see a thud

I donâ€™t wanna be listening to a spud

And I guess Iâ€™ll show you what we should

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Now Iâ€™m making rhymes in the booth

You are really looking aloof

Guess Iâ€™ll be gone in a poof

But now this is my skill here is the proof

Dr Doof

I got a pain in my tooth

Guess you looking like a goof

And Iâ€™m doing this shit in my youth
