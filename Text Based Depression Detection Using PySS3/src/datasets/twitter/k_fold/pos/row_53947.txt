Can someone explain how sleeping on a FaceTime is cute? You can probably find so many people saying "omg my crush fell asleep on ft" like almost everywhere. It could literally mean anything, it's not just that "they're comfortable enough around you to sleep in front of you". But if they do, what are you gonna do? Just stare at their face? End the call? Kinda rude innit. It could also be that they're just tired of you and want to end the call but can't do they have to come up with an excuse, not everything is 100% accurate. Or could also mean that they're tired as hell cuz **FUCKING SCHOOL**
