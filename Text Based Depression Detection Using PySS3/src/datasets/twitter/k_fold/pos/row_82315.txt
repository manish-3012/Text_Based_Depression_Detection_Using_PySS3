forwarding my comment here the number one leading cause of death for non-hispanic blacks are by homicide. from 1-19 years old itâ€™s 35.2% of all black deaths and from 20-44 years itâ€™s 28.9% of all black deaths

my source is [here](https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/lcod/men/2016/nonhispanic-black/index.htm#anchor_1571149579) and itâ€™s a demographic from cdc.gov

yeah suicide and violence would still happen but far less. in 2017, 39,773 people died from handguns in the united states. in that same year, only around 60 people were killed by handguns in the uk (for context, this paragraph is explaining why i think that the removal of guns from everyone in the us would sharply lower suicide rates and gang violence)
