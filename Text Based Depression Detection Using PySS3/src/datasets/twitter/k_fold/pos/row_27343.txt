No one is necessarily a bad person. You shouldn't want to m0rder someone for being "bad". Read more. Everyone is shaped by their environment. Entirely shaped. All the way. Their education from their environment and their brain/body structure determines who they are. They dont choose what that is. They arent at fault for what they get. For what they turn out to be. Now, this isnt an excuse for people not working on bettering themselves. You can do that. You should do that. Just that the want or even ability to better yourself comes from your environment. If you never got the right pillars of circumstance, you would never want to do that. You would never want to become better. You would never be better. If you did, you would. No doubt about it. We are entirely controlled by things outside of our control. So you shouldnt hate someone for how they are. You can dislike them. But hate? M0rder? That isnt justified. Maybe its justified why you would do it. Your own ignorance. But the act isnt moral. It isnt justified itself. 

Hating a racist isnt right. It shows your ignorance. 
People are racist for one reason. Ignorance. Mis education is taught to them. People arent born racist. It's just their environment. They had no control over that. If they legitimately knew that racism was wrong and incorrect, they wouldn't be racist. But they don't, so they are. If you were in their shoes, you would be racist as well. 100%. Your hate isnt justified. Your actions against them aren't justified. The best thing you can do is try to eduacte them. If you want to. It's the only thing that will fix the problem. And it's the only moral thing you can do.

We don't choose our circumstance. Dont hate someone for something outside of their control. 

Society needs to learn this.
