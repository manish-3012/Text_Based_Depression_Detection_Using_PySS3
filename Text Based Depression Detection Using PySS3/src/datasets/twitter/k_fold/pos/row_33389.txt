I've been called cute today Well I was playing some games with my friend.

We were playing League of legends and I messed up 3 games.

So after the matches we were both pissed and went of.

After that I've apologiesed for ruining the games by voicemail

She called me cute multiple times.

I'm not really into her but still that made my ruined day to one of my best days in life.
