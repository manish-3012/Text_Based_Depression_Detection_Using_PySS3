How can I get over the girl I've had a crush on for 2 years? So I have a crush on this girl for almost 2 years, and recently we've talked for about 5-6 months (and dated for a few weeks) and we were almost ready do be in a relationship (the sad part is that we were arguing about stuff pretty often, but only through text, and f2f we were vibing so hard and everything was going well), but as soon as that was about to happen she said that, she wants a break and "sees me as a friend". And after all the things she said and did, I still can't get over her. I feel like I've been used. [because now she is talking to another guy (she was talking w him even when we were dating) that was in a relationship and just broke up w the girl he was with,( I guess she waited for him to break up and then go for him, also I think she just tried to make him jealous somehow). 

I apologize for my English.
