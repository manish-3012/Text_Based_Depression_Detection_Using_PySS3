I need help basically talking to a girl So, i do archery, and every tournament i go to theres a girl that looks really pretty and shes really nice, but she lives in a different city so i just wanna like idk ask her to play videogames together or something. The problem is, tournaments are kinda crowded, and my mom is always watching me so it will be really akward, also i play videogames all day and have no social skills, so help?

Also this is probably like the 5th time im posting this cause reddit is glitching.
