i LITTERALLY HAVE AN F IN EVERYCLASS
I have had straight zeros in band for 3 (three) quarters. my bd said "hi,____ hope u r doing ok. it would be nice to see u in class." this betch sent that in december on my birthday. he didnt say "happy birthday___ come to school on monday so i can congratulate you" like i would have hoped. ðŸ™„ dont even get me started on my assistant principal he litterally accussed me of skipping a subject wich i did not skip. i couldnt attend because i didnt have the code. like HELLO??? and they contacted my dad and he yelled at me so i sat outside for 5 hours and now i have to go to the eye doctor on Thursday. how stoopid is that? so tomororw i have to spend all day doing work so i dont fail 7th grade not like i wanted to pass anyways because everyone in my class is stoopid and is wierd.  and so r the teachers i got graded 2.4285699999999997/5. i can send pics for proof. but ya so now i have to do prealgebra and stoopid stuff tomorow all freaking day. rant over might add l8r lmao rawrz
