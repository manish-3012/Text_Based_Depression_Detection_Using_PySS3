LPT: donâ€™t start developing feelings for someone that isnâ€™t over the last person they liked It hurts! Ngl! My chest feels heavy

Especially when they tell you about it and ask you for advice about it :))))

*this year is so rough please can I have some good things happening to me or am I gonna have to grasp onto things that give me a temporary feeling of happiness*

Iâ€™ll be fine but for the time being? *ouch*
