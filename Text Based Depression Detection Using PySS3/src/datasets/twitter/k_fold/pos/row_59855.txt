My mom is f-ing stupid My government just announced that we have to wear masks in class and in the halls of school from 7 grade up. Since I go to high school I have to apply to that rule, but my mom think I shouldn't wear my mask in class and she thinks that the government is trying to scare us with the virus. She also thinks that my opinion isnt valid. Should I ignore what shes says or what?
