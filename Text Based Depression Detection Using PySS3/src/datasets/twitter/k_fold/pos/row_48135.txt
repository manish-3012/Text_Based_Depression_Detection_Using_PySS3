I think that trans girls make the best partners for heterosexual relationships if sex isnt a priority Ok so let me explain. We hace to live like men for at least 16 years (in the US, dont know about other countries), possibly even more. We know better than cis girls the pros and cons of being an amab (assigned male at birth) thus making it easier for us to relate to you. Plus, at least in my case, since i was raised as a boy i like more boyish things; like cars and videogames. Am not the best at expressing my thoughts plus English isnt my 1st language so idk if yall would understand but i need someone elses thoughts on this.
