I just had a dream I woke up, and a hot girl that I used to know greeted me with some... fun times let's say. Then I wake up, and realise it was a dream that I woke up into. Dissapointed, I get up and go talk to the cast of Madagascar about saving an african tribe of mice from Winnie the Pooh and the gang.

Now I woke up again, and idk what's real anymore
