What tf is up with the fetish-ization of japan I watched a YouTube video today and there were some people on the comment section supporting Japan during WW2 ~ and blaming it on the Chinese and Koreans

Hell tf no, they're probably Westerners who don't know or care about Asia. It makes me really angry when they support rhetoric like this. Who are they really? They're probably just people who got to watch hentai and will 100% support Japan at all costs.

Don't get me wrong, Japan is a vibrant country with a lovely culture and I'd love to visit Japan sometime ~ but it's a bit too much if they attempt to deny the atrocities they did.
