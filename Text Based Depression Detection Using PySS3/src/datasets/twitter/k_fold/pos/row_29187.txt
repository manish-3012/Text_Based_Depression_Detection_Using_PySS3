Hey Alex, the dude I met on Omegle, I'm searching for you   I was on Omegle and I met this guy named Alex. He was so much fun to talk to, and I accidentally left the conversation. I was on a call with my friends, and they started talking to me so I forgot to talk to Alex. Bro, if you're reading this, it's Liam, please hit me up. Idk if he has a reddit, but it's worth a shot. If you know an Alex who's 16 from Wisconson please lmk, I feel so bad for ghosting him in the middle of our conversation
