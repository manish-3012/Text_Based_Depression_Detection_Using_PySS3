It would be better for people to make slightly offensive memes that to complain about them 10x more  So many people are complaining about edgy memes it's unreal. And the "this subreddit has become" posts are just made for karma farming imo. I think if we stop making posts about people complaining about memes it would be better as the sheer quantity of these posts is making good quality posts hard to find. I don't know if this is considered complaining and ironic, but still this issue needs to be addressed better and most people will just thing im complaining too but I'm not good with words and will probably come off in every wrong way.
