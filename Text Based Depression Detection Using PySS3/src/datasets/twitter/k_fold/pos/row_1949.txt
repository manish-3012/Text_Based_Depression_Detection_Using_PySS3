OMFG IT WORKS so yesterday i saw this post that said something like "i told the universe i was ready to be in a relationship and then a cute guy held my hand" so i (14m) was like, might as well give it a shot, cant get any more lonely, then I GOT THIS NOTE TODAY. it happened right after lunch, i walked into class and a not sat on my desk, it said "date me?" with a heart and a smiley face, the problem is i dont know who put it there so i cant respond, but i plan to find out on monday, and im hoping its this one girl that sits in front of me because she's super cute.
