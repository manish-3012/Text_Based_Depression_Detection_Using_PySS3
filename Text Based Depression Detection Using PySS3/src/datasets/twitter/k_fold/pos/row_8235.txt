Alright Reddit. This is a long shot but I need help finding my old middle school history teacher. So my dadâ€™s job requires us to move a decent bit and I had this one teacher back in middle school who had such a positive influence on my life. Seeing as itâ€™s my senior year, thereâ€™s a few teachers that I want to reach out to and thank for the help they gave me. His name is William Gerichten II and I had his class at New Bridge Middle School in Jacksonville N.C. Normally I wouldnâ€™t do a post like this, but after being unsuccessful trying to find him, I thought the internet might be able to help.
