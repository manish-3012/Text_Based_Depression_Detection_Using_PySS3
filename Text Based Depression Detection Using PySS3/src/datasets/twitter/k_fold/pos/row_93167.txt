I am really tired I am going through a difficult time as my dog is being put down, My friends today have made fun of me from school grades, to me "gay" even though I am not, then they tell me I am homophobic. They wonder why I dont talk to them that much, I am already stressed enough trying to pull up my grades and I am just done, right now I am having suicidal thoughts.
