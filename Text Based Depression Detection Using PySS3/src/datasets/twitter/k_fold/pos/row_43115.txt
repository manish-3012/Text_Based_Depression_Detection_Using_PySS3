If your friend ever asks you to let her/him stay at your house for a few days bcs they're running away from home,would you help them? Just wondering.

I dont remember quite clearly bcs this memory is blurry in my head but I think my older brother's female friend did this once,she came to our house late at night bcs she was running away from home,I dont remember what happened next but I think at the end she didnt stay at our house after all,I dont remember why but it's either she went back to her house or went somewhere else.I dont remember much since it's like years ago.

But anyways would you?
