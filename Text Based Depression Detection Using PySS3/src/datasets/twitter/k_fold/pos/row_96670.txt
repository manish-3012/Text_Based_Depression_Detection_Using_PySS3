I'm a guy who goes to an only boys school in UK. What's it like having girls in your school? I always read about "omg my crush said yes omg omg omg" is it really like that? And also would you want to go to an only boys school in the UK or just stay where you are? Is it really worth having a gf or bf? As you can tell I'm very regarded as I haven't talked to a girl in almost 2 years :/
