How to block out sound in your bedroom I'm currently in bed in my room and can hear my sister and her boyfriend moaning even though she's in the loft and I had a YouTube video on. It's currently extremely hot so I cant put a pillow over my head without suffocating myself and overheating.

How do I block this out
