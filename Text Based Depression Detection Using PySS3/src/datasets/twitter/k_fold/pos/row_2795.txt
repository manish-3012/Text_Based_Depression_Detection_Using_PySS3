I need to get this off of my chest... Ice doesn't belong in drinks. I SAID IT. Before you jump to conclusions, I have prepared a list of what I like about ice, and what I dislike about ice.

What I like:  
\- haha drink is cold

What I dislike:  
\- I find that when drinking, ice enters my throat. If the ice is too big, I choke for a little bit, and it is unpleasant. If the ice is too small, It just slips down my throat. This is also unpleasant.  
\- Ice puts a time limit on your drink. Oops, you didn't drink your coke for two minutes? well now all the ice has melted and it's diluted and tastes like pee. I will admit that this doesn't affect water.  
\- You get Less drink. Have you ever ordered a drink from a fast food place? Yea, half of the drink is ice.   


In conclusion, ice sucks and its overrated. Change my mind
