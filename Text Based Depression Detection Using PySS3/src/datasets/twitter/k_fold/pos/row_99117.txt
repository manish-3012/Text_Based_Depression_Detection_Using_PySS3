Censorship in my country. Situation that really angered me Okay, it's a very local problem but I just wanted to share it with other people cause it really angered and shocked me. 

So I'm living in Ukraine. Democratic country with the freedom of speech, you know. 

We have a YouTube channel called "Geekjournal" which reviews films, series and Ukrainian television. And a couple of days ago this channel a video about one of our TV channels (called 1+1 if you're interested but I'm quite sure noone read till this moment). So this 1+1 chanell threw 4 strikes on this video (I'm not sure is this correct in English) even though Geekjournal didn't violate copyright law.

The problem is not even in the fact that this channel is going to be blocked. The problem is that this situation violates the freedom of speech.This is harsh unreasonable censorship, something on the scale of what was in the USSR.

The optistic thing is that many Ukrainian YouTubers defend Geekjournal. Many people in social media cover this topic and support this channel. There are tons of negative comments on the official account of 1+1 in Instagram. The hashtag #savegeekjournal became number one in Ukrainian Twitter. I hope the situation will be resolved fairly.  Otherwise I'm afraid to imagine what will happen in the future
