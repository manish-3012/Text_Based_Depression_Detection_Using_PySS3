This is a certified bruh moment That moment when you stay up all night knowing full well you have online school to do the next day, and then it's suddenly 7:45 and you want to go to bed but you know you can't because you need to do online school and if you go to sleep you know no alarms will wake you up and that you will sleep all day and not get any work done. Very relatable I know.
