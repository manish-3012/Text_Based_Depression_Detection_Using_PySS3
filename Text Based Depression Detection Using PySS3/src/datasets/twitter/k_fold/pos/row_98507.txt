Help Im so lovesick so i had my first love at school we have been together for a time


We used to talk every night and now she is gone I am so sick. I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach and I cannot distract myself with anything. My chest feels tighten and i feel empty inside like a uncompleted half, like something important other than myself is missing. Damn I just miss her so much


Im scared


Im scared I am so dedicated to loving this person and I fear one day I will lose her, the person I have invested so much of my self into. Im so afraid I will lose her


Who will I become then, will I ever love again? Will I break? If missing her for just one day effects me this much what if she was gone forever, and our paths never intersect again. I know there is no happy ending for this relationship even though everything is going smoothly.


sorry for long rant It feels suffocating without her which is why i need to write this
