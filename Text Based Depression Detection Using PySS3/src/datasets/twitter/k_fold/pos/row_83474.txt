Science experiment about gayness Warning Iâ€™m basing this off of stereotypes, this doesnâ€™t apply to everyone. 

But yâ€™all ever noticed how itâ€™s common for girls to prefer a guy whoâ€™s more feminine whilst guys prefer a girl whoâ€™s â€œjust like the boysâ€. 

Am I just living in a bubble or has anyone else noticed this?
