I had the wildest dream two days ago... It started out with me and my girlfriend, just sitting and chilling out, like we normally would. Then all of a sudden, from nowhere, she says, â€œI think Iâ€™m ready.â€

I know this is a dream by this point because her family is extremely catholic and they donâ€™t approve to sex before marriage.

By this point, we were making out and taking off our clothes. And then it happened. I penetrated her and it felt warm.

Iâ€™m about to climax when I woke up. 

Itâ€™s, uh, an embarrassing experience cos Iâ€™ve never dreamt of something like that before. 

Have a good rest of your day/night.
