Is it just me or is among us the new undertale. When undertale came out there were many animations and songs and i can totally see among us going in that diraction. New games always bring memes, but among us hit the 2 month threshold and shows no signs of stopping or dying. I don't think it's bad as it's just how the internet is handling memes to create new content. Just some braincandy.
