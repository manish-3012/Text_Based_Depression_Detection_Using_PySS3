I feel really guilty about going out with my friends ex because I feel I aided in their breakup Iâ€™m friends with both the guy and the girl in the story. I still am, but it still hurts to think about.

My friend was dating this girl, who was also my friend so I spoke with her about what he says and one day I found out that maybe he had romantic feelings for another girl. So, I told his girlfriend and.. she was angry but I told her to be reasonable, you know? Donâ€™t Overreact, thereâ€™s no evidence, and she listened.

A few days go by and.. they broke up.
I, just.. I feel like I played a hand in that. 

She was upset after the breakup but I wasnâ€™t sure I liked her at that point, I still had feelings for another girl.. the girl my friend supposedly had a crush on. Fast forward a bit, sheâ€™s got a boyfriend, interest is lost with her and we just become good friends instead. 

During that time I was speaking with the first girl in the story, the one going through a breakup, and started to feel things for her.. eventually we started dating and I feel guilty about it ever since, I potentially played a key role in their breakup and now Iâ€™m dating this girl..

I donâ€™t want to bring it up with either of them, I donâ€™t want to bring any more hurt into the story than there already was.. 

The worst bit?
I was wrong. He never did love that other girl.
