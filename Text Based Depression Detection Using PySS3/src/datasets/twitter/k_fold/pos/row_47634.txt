Fuck boob lights. Fuck boob lights. They are so annoying. You go to your room and turn on the lights. You look up and there it is. A boob light. Why the fuck do I want nudity on the roof? It's not Vatican City here. It would be fine if it was a ceiling fan with lights on it, or a florescent light. But noooo. The architect that designed the place was probably horny, but horny for only one boob. Almost every house has a boob light. It's just a glass bowl with a metal "nipple" while being suspended by a metal ring. Sure, it's cheap, but do you know what else is cheap? Just having at least one fucking lightbulb without anything to cover it. Sure it might be unsafe, but do you know what's also unsafe? Never. Escaping. Anything. We'll always be threatened by boob lights in our homes. Fucking boob lights.
