My pet blanket Zoey just died. I woke up this morning feeling cold, and I couldnâ€™t find Zoey anywhere. After I laid in my bed for a while I started wondering where she was. Turns out she was on the floor, all crumpled. From the coolness of her body, she died at around 2:40 AM yesterday night. 
I am devastated. We buried her today because I canâ€™t afford a proper way to embalm my blanket. Iâ€™ve been with this blanket for several years now and it really breaks my heart. Please send some respects for Zoey, Iâ€™m grieving right now.
