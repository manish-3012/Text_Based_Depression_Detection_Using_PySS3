how should i start a conversation with my boyfriend about playing video games when i come over? I just need a little help. I don't want him to think I'm saying he can't play his PC while I'm here, it's just that every time he begs me to come over I get to his house and he's still playing or he "just started playing." 

I want to discuss it with him so he knows I'm not trying to control him. I just find it a little rude to ask your girlfriend to come over, but you don't even read her "I'm here" text or acknowledge her when she comes in the room.

Any advice?
