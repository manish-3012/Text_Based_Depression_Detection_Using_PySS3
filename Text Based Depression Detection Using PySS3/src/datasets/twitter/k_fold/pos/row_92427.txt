Should I tell my parents that I (16) am talking to/would date a 19 year old guy? I'm young for my grade (11) and hes a freshman in college. I have 3 friends that are turning 18 a month or two after I turn 17 and he turns 20 like 5 months after I turn 17. Ugh i dont know. I hate having to sneak around to hang out with him but at the same time my parents would be like wtf he's 19, no. What would your parents say?
