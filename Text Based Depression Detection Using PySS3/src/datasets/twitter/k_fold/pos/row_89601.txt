Man I'm actually excited for the rest of the year... Yesterday there was a PS5 showcase, it gave the price and release date ($500 for the disk edition, $400 for the digital only version, and Nov. 12th for both, at least in the U.S where I am) but what got me more hyped was the fucking games.

So for launch titles we got Spiderman Miles Morales and Demon's Souls. Coming I assume not too long after is Horizon Forbidden West, I think it'll be early next year because it's also releasing on PS4 which the only other exclusive that is. Then NEXT YEAR is God of War Ragnarok (well GoW 5 but Imma call it Ragnarok) so yeah I'm actually really hyped. 

Also coming later is two shows I'm really into: Supernatural on Oct. 8th and RWBY V8 on Nov. 7th. Oh plus starting in October I'll be able to see some of my friends again after not seeing them since like March.
