Can the IT apartment see my docs? Can the IT apartment of my school see my deleted documents? I wrote sumn bad on my school account on accident and if the IT dude sees it iâ€™m screwed. 
I deleted it but can he see it anyway. Thereâ€™s like 700 students so why would he look through MY deleted documents, that would be weird RIGHT?
