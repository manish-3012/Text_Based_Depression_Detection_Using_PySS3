r/teenagers podcast? As a teenager I know how stressful and mentally damaging life is, so my idea is to start a podcast where me and a couple of you guys maybe, will host people(teens) to talk and help about life problems, assets in life, etc. I donâ€™t know how good the idea is but Iâ€™m open to feedback in the comments
