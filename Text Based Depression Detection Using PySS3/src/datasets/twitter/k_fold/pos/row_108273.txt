I cooked some pasta (for the second time) Review:
Tasted better than last time, managed to cook the pasta for the recommended duration so it didn't come out hard like last time
Prawns and scallops tasted pretty standard, not much change from last time, nothing too mind blowing but it is good enough for me
I think I may have put too much salt into my pasta, it shows through way too obviously at some parts
Overall, a much better attempt than last time, hopefully I get to cook it again
Also if any of yall have any tips feel free to tell me
