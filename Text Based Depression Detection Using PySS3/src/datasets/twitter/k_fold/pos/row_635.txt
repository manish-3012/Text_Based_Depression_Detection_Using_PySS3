Why cant he be normal? So I (16f) had a crush on this guy (18m). We would flirt and play and shit. Then I gave him head. Then he started not quite ignoring me (we work together) but like not aknowledging me or acting like I'm there. No more jokes or whatnot. Absolutely nothing. And I get it. He was only after one thing. And he got it. But like come on. I get it that you never had feelings. I dont either. But why just completely avoid me? Just fucking be normal for christs sake. Anyone have any clue as to why he's like this? Bc I'm stumped.
