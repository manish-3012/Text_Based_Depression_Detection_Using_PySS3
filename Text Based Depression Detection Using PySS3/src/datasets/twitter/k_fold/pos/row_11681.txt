This has happened 2-3 times and I'm starting to get afraid of it Imagine yourself sleeping peacefully at the middle of the night, then suddenly, out of nowhere, you hear the fire alarm go off, you wake up, panicked, thinking it's real fire, you go and check what made the fire alarm go off, and right there, when you go around the corner to your right, someone is just making coffee for themselves in the middle of the night!  Why? Because everyone else is just sleeping and you want your coffee so bad that you make it yourself and set the fire alarm off! Like seriously, you have drank coffee every day and it has been made for you when everyone is awake and when you make it yourself you almost the house on fire? Oh please! Just go to sleep already and don't make it yourself and almost the house on fire! Wait till someone wakes up and make coffee for you!

Tldr: someone sets the fire alarm by making coffee for themselves in the middle of the night

Note: I'm not going to name the person who did it and it's not me, it's just annoying to see this happening to you
