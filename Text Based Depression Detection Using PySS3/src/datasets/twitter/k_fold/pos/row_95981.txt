Posting some lyrics because why not [Father Time by iamjakehill](https://youtu.be/qubHGr6Snx0)

I take a trip by myself here

Write my name in the sky

Hang from the stars, I dance on clouds

And watch the world pass me by

It's my escape from the dread

That we all face every day

We call it life but in the end

We're all just dust in the grave

It's soundin' bleak, yeah

Guess that's just the way it is

I can't fall asleep so I lay here

And I'll face it now

I'm comin' undone

Fallin' endlessly in space again

Maybe I can find the will to

Finally find some faith again (faith again)

Dug three feet but I backed out 'cause I cashed out

But it doesn't really make me proud

I been feelin' way too alone, no

But I don't know how I can really make it show

Tick-tick-tick-tick, Father Time is right on my heels

I'm probably way too far gone

I don't think that I can be healed (I can be healed)

Trapped in my skin

But I pretend everything's great (everything's great)

The rain pours, I feel the pain more, used to wash it all away

But it sticks around my vision now

Goes dark, I can't feel (I can't feel)

Anything but misery, my soul, I can't heal
