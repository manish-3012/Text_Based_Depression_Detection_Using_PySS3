Is it weird for a guy to pluck his unibrow? Ok like I donâ€™t see the problem here but still curious. Iâ€™ve got a unibrow naturally, and honestly I think look way better without it. So I pluck/trim it, is that weird? Like it seems like most people who do that shit at this age are girls, but I rlly hate my unibrow sooo
