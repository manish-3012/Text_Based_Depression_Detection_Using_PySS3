I've hit Boomer-dom at almost 17. Nothing is fun anymore, am always criticising everyone. It's very frustrating. I try to be open to new trends, but I ends up getting triggered/ criticizing almost everything to the point where I can't enjoy social media anymore. Not even youtube. I end up distancing from most and try to create my own kinda space simulating stuff to my liking.
