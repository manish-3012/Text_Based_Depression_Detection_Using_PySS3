Someone yell at me or something Ok so my friend is a little stupid (not because of this just in general) and she thinks that China released a strain of covid to affect kids during elections to prevent people from voting. Kids canâ€™t vote. The virus mutated. Iâ€™ve said the same thing over and over again and I know I should just stop arguing because itâ€™s not worth my time but I canâ€™t someone just yell at me please
