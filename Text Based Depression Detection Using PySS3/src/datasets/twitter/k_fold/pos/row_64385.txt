I'm not sure if this was a good idea but desperate times call for desperate measures Im not a popular kid (probably because of the way my face looks but I digress) but if there are any popular kids on this subreddit I need tips on what a guy should wear and if I should get a perm because as a fellow kid I'm trying to get a big tiddy goth gf and idk if the way I look rn will have anyone attracted to me (I'm like a 6.5 out of 10.)

To long didn't read: I'm not popular and I need tips to be popular and be a good looking guy that might need fashion advice.
