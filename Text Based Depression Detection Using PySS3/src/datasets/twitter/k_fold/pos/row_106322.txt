I cried during my zoom class Ever since I started my fall semester, I keep getting bad luck on having to answer questions I dont know in one of my classes, despite actually doing pretty well on my assignments and quizzes. I believe I know the subject pretty well, but sometimes my professor's questions can get really specific and confusing on what exactly he's asking for. 

But today, it was a relatively simply question. I answered it especially knowing that it was right and he said it was wrong. I was really confuse and started panicking because I was so sure that I got it right. He tells me to try again, and so I started spouting the other answer options and after each one he said it was wrong. He asks another student to help me out and she said exactly what I said for the first answer. Now I'm even more confused. Im guessing he just didnt hear me correctly nothing big really, but at that moment I was embarrassed. For the remainder of 20 minutes we had left in class, I started crying but luckily because of my bright window behind me, I appeared darker on screen and so my face wasnt shown that well hopefully....

I know it's stupid to cry over something like this, but I guess the bad luck just caught up to me.
