Just found out I could need physical therapy for my mouth for the rest if my life For the past few months I've been having this issue with my mouth where I can only open it like half way but if I do a sort of dislocation I can open it all the way. Yesterday I finally went to the doctor and he said I'll need to go see a specialist but he thinks that the is something wrong with my tendon that connects my jaw to my skull and that I'll probably need to wear a mouth brace and do physical therapy for a long time maybe mybwhole life. Big sad :(
