Guys, is the word "daddy" and "mommy" has to mean sexual all the time or nah? Because i enjoy being called mommy. Like, if someone calls me mommy in not a sexual way i'd be happy. But, its seems like the word "mommy" or "daddy" has to mean something sexual. So, is calling someone "mommy" or "daddy" has to mean sexual all the time regardless of the context? (except with parents)  


Im putting NSFW just incase.
