I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™d deserve this I feel betrayed

I helped this girl though out all of 2019, and 2020. Stool up for her and I was by her side through out it all she has literally cried on my shoulder, you know what happened she blocked me on all stoical media and called me a racist R-word, and after all of that I told her I felt betrayed and unappreciated and then she went on to say how I was making her feel bad and not good for saying that and then said I was guilt shaming her. 
All of this because I had a different opinion on the Kyle riddle house shooting and I still thought he should be put in jail.


There was this other girl we really clicked I liked her and she liked me. One day we were talking and she said she wasnâ€™t looking for a relationship and I was ok with that and I told her I still wanted to be friends with her, I still went to her consorts and hung out with her got food with her and then one day she blocked me on all social media and didnâ€™t talk to me for 5 months and the last time she talked to me she wanted the answers to one of her online tests.


Iâ€™m not saying that they owe me a relationship or anything. But to be blocked, ghosted, get called a racist R-word by the people I actually put trust in just hurts, I just donâ€™t get it I really just donâ€™t get it...
