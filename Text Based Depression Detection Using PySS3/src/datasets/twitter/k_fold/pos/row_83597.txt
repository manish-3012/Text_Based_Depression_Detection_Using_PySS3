My rant about women in general And by women, I mean raisins

And by general, I mean in cookies 

Why the hell do raisin cookies exist? Most the time you think theyâ€™re a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and then BAM. Itâ€™s a nasty ass raisin that tastes awful. 

The only person I could think that would eat a raisin cookie is a homeless person whoâ€™s starving for food. Raisins do NOT belong in cookies. And the cookies themselves usually taste awful when it has raisins in them, like the dough is hard or too chewy.

This has been my rant about raisins in cookies, this has nothing to do with women I just wanted to clickbait you.
