Topic: H1Z1: King of the Kill( game )

Z1 Battle Royale (formerly H1Z1 and King of the Kill) is a free-to-play battle royale game developed and published by Daybreak Game Company. The game's development began after the original H1Z1 was spun off into two separate projects in early 2016: H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. The games were further split as separate projects in October 2017, with Just Survive dropping the H1Z1 name, and King of the Kill becoming simply H1Z1.

After itâ€™s release on 2015/01/15 Z1 was early access game for 3 years and became free on 2018/02/28 later released for the PlayStation 4 on 2018/08/07 which made the game quite popular. There were few attempts to make the game mobile.

In the match there maximum of 100 players fight against each other. Before becoming free Z1 had only few weapons such as AR, shotgun, crossbow, bow, pistol, and sniper rifle. After it has smg, revolver, AK, and hunting rifle was added. There are also grenades, flashback, Molotov, toxic gas and smoke which is useful during fights. Equipments are helmet, body armor ( tactical or self made), boots, pants, shirts, glasses and masks.

One of the uniqueness in this game is you can craft things if you have materials. Craftable things are body armor, crossbow arrow with grenade or Molotov, also you can craft bandages from you clothes. Also one of the uniqueness is you will bleed if you get shot.
