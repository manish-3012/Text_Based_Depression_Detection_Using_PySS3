3/11/21 (edit) I have a tough time adapting to change

My emotions spill, embarrassing rage

My head feels heavy as the world keeps turning

My eyes wont shut and my heart keeps burning

I dont understand why I give so easy

My heart feels weak and my stomach feels queasy

I throw up my thoughts onto the page

Herbal sedation of hibiscus and sage

And no one will hear my silent cries

My painful protests against the growing lies

Its all so loud

I do not dare

The watching eyes

That always stare

Im just a kid

I swear im learning

Please just stop

My world is turning

White flashes

Deepened gashes

Stop the flow

But still nobody knows..

...

Black..

..silence..

My fist is bleeding

I get up off the floor and notice

The silver vase on the vanity

Has finally shattered into insanity
