Iâ€™m probably going to be downvote bombed for this but r/teenagers isnâ€™t really about the current teenage generation anymore. Itâ€™s anything but that r/teenagers is supposed to be about us, teenagers. Iâ€™m tired of seeing a bunch of karmawhores and meme reposts from other songs only the r/teenagers front page.
