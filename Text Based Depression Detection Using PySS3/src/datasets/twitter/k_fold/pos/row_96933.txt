Someone tried breaking into our house A bit of backstory, I live in Southern Africa and as you can imagine crime is pretty common. I've heard of break-in's from people I know but holy shit this is terrifying. Recently I've been working my ass off for money to buy a pc and all of it could've been for nothing. Luckily they didn't get in our house but they broke one of our windows trying. The police have been contacted and they're looking into it. This is a new experience for me and I don't think I'll be getting any sleep tonight
