How do so many people have sleep paralysis? I had literally never heard of it till like a few months ago and it seems like such a common thing from how often I see it talked about. It seems scary as shit tho Iâ€™m so glad I donâ€™t have it. Whatâ€™s it like like your awake and canâ€™t move and see like a demon moving around?
