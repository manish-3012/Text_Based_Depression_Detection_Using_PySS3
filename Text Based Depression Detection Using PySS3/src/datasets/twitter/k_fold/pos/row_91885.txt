Random History fact because Iâ€™m bored #3 During the German Invasion of Poland, Wizna was defended by ~800 Polish soldiers. It took the German force if ~46,000 three days to defeat Polish forces. Even though they were heavily outnumbered, the Polish troops managed to hold off three days against a massive Wehrmacht Group, while outnumbered 40:1.
