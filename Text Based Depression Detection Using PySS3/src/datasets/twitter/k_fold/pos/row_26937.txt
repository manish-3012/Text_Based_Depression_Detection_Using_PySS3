My mom just broke her ankle and I donâ€™t know how to feel about it About 20 minutes ago, my mom steeped on a stair on our deck in the backyard, and it completely gave way and she fell. She was put on a wheelchair and taken to the ER by my dad about 10 minutes later. Itâ€™s pretty much confirmed she broke her ankle, because only her left ankle is in immense pain and she canâ€™t walk on it. 

The thing is, Idk how to feel about it. Should I be worried? Scared? Upset? Because I honestly had nearly no reaction. Iâ€™m really confused and donâ€™t no what to do or feel.
