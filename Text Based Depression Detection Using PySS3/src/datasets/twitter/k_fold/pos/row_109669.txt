The state of this sub. When I discovered this subreddit I thought it was going to good teenager related posts but boy was I wrong. Recently I have noticed SO many posts like 'I asked out my best friend' or 'I told my crush I like her'. Yeah most of them might be true but surely not all are and it's tiring seeing the same thing over and over again. Yeah just wanted to share this.
