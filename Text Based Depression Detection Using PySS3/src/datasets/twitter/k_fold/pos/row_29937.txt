Been having the worst week so far. So online school started so that's kind of annoying, but the worst thing is how I have suddenly lost the ability to shit. So earlier this week everything was normal, when suddenly I went to the bathroom and nothing happened. I didn't think about it at the time, but it has been 4 days now and I still haven't been able to shit. I took laxatives and stuff, but right now its 4 am i have school tomorrow at 8 am and I cant sleep because my stomach is a active volcano.
