I have access to a ton of people's email logins but there's never shit. You can't do anything with it like you can't login to their bank or whatever if it's linked to that email because it will ask for a phone text code. It's worthless so I don't even use them. filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
