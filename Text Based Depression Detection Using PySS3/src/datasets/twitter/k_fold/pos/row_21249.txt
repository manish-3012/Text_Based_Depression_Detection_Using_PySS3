Here's a philosophical question for you all. The universe is huge. So massive that the human brain can't comprehend it. A galaxy is minuscule in comparison to the universe. A planet is minuscule in comparison to a galaxy. A city is minuscule in comparison to a planet. A human is minuscule in comparison to a city.

When you really think about how small and insignificant us humans really are, does anything we do really matter? I wanna hear y'all's thoughts on this.
