Guys I did it. I told my crush how I feel. Granted it was over text. But as of 11pm on November 6 I finaly had the  courage to tell her how I feel. I've know this girl for right around 7 years and we daited for like 2 months a year ago. At the time I say it as an excuse to see her more not necessarily romantically. But she got a boyfriend a few months after I broke it off. They broke up like a week or 2 ago and in the time they were daiting I was jealous, i think. I hate to day this but I was actually happy when she told me they broke up. I put on a face and comforted her the best I could. 
Today we were texting and somehow I ended up sending a text that said she was my favorite person and she said the same in her own words. I eventually said I throught I liked her romantically but I'm a bit unsure if she understood what I was trying to say. I hope she did.
