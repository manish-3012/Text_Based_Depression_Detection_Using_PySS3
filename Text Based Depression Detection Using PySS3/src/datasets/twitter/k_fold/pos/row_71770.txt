My mom is crazy. Basically I used to be in care and in April last year I was returned home. At the beginning my mom acted like she did before I was taken away (which is generally really happy and kind.) But the longer I lived here the more I saw of how much being in care effected her. She comes up with ridiculous ideas that obviously wouldn't work, she gets angry at the smallest thing, she gets scared easily and the list goes on.

Tomorrow my social worker is coming over (the first time I'm meeting them because my old social worker left) and my mom is getting angry at the rest of my family because of it. She keeps repeating the same points and is saying we aren't on her side etc. I just kinda want it to stop so do you guys have any suggestions because this type of thing WILL happen again and I need a way to calm her down or something.

Any ideas will be a great help.

Thanks.
