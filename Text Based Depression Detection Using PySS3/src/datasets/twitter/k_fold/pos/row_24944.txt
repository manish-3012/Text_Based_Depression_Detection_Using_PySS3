It kind of confuses me when girls say â€œI canâ€™t sit on you iâ€™d break you/suffocate youâ€ Like first of all weâ€™re not braindead. We can tell you if weâ€™re going to suffocate plus even if you weigh around 300lbs, no youâ€™re not going to crush someone. Plus if we did end up dying from it how in the fuck would we be upset by that lmao.
