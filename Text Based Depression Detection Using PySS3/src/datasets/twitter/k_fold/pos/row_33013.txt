i see people talking about how satisfying it is to close all of your tabs after a long assignment.. but now that iâ€™m nearing the end of my semester in school, iâ€™ve gotten to close one of my four class tabs i keep open for accessing assignments. so now iâ€™m 25% closer to closing my entire school window. for until next week...
