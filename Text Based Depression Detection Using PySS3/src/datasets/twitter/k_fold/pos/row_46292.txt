Is it normal that I haven't done much of the normal teenager stuff I haven't had a crush 

I haven't liked anyone 

I never wanted to have sex 

I haven't done interesting shit 

I haven't dated 

I haven't cuddled

Haven't kissed 

Like most teenagers are supposed to do I guess?

And I haven't done many more things I don't know what to include
