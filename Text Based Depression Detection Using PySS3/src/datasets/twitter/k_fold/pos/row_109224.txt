Guys I need some encouragement for my concert today Ok so A bit of backstory, I have a recorded concert that I need to go to soon, and Iâ€™m kinda freaking out.... only one of my friends will be there (normally there was like 6 of my friends so that doesnâ€™t help much) and Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m gonna mess up... I kinda know what Iâ€™m singing, but I feel like I always mess up when other people sing over me... also teachers instructions were cryptic as hell, not sure what to do... please give me some encouragement, and I will post updates later 

Cya
