Any other teenagers kind of lonely because of this? For practically all 3 years of my teenage life (starting at age 12) I've been very involved and invested in philosophy. I read books packed with deep ideas because its very intellectually stimulating. Sometimes I am so invested in my thoughts that I feel as though I am asleep.

now, I dont like saying stuff like this because I feel like its me trying to impose arrogance or narcisissm, but I feel that I am much more mature than most people my age. I dont believe that makes me better than anyone, its just something I observe as a result of the knowledge I have gained about maturity and meaning.

All of this has caused me to be incredibly lonely. When I was in my freshmen year, I would try to stab deep concepts into conversations just so I could vent everything I was learning. I wanted so badly to talk to somebody about that stuff. But all I ever got was "wow thats big brain", and then we move on from it.  

I cant relate to anyone because of this. All of my friends want to talk about the same supericial things everyday and it drives me insane. Give me an idea, tell me what you think of the universe, tell me about your universe, give me morally challenging scenarios, is death beautiful? what is beauty to you? is the world built on objectives or subjectives? On that logic, can it exist without consciousness? Why do we react to hatred with hatred when we are angry that there is hatred in the first place? What do you think of social media imposing a hive mind intentionally or unintentionally? Why do many reject emotions when emotions set us free from the binds of an indefinite objectiveness?

Of course I dont only want to talk about deeper concepts. I dont like small talk, but I like to joke around with people and I think its important to have fun ("think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world"). You just get tired of it eventually. There are no strong connections that have been made and I feel like I'm just wasting my time.

I dont know. This is all kind of thrown together because its late at night and I'm tired. I just feel like most people dont take the time to really think about what matters and this isolates me. Maybe this changes as we grow older?
