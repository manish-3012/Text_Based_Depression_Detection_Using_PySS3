A girl texted me help. She texted me like: Heyy, an i said hi, she didn't respond so i asked what is going on and she said: nothing. I asked: then why did u text me? me she said: because i can (so no reason). I think its bc of a status in insta or something like: 'new chalange, text a random boy and say "heyy" to see how they respond' but im not sure. 

H  E   L   P    anny girls that know whats going on
