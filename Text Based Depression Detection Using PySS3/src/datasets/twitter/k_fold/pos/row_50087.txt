Hey Any 19 year Olds looking to make friends? For gaming or just fun chatting through the day! PS Eppstein didn't kill himself. Hey, I'm 19. I live in Oman it's a country in the middle east. I currently work for a charity but and going to Germany to learn engineering soon. I like shoes such as snowpiercer, Bridgerton, modern family, how I met your mother, Brooklyn 99 and more. I'm a fun guy and I want someone to talk to while I go through my day. I went go Karting yesterday and got T boned hard lol. As for physical appearance I'm tan, 5'9 and pretty muscular as I train boxing a lot. We can talk about anything or just send goofy pics to eachother. Pm me for my snap and insta.
