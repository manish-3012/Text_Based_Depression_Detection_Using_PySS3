My teacher just rickrolled the class. So today my English teacher posted an assignment in Google Classroom that was a film analysis. All we had to do was open the Doc watch the YouTube link &amp; answer the questions such as â€œWhoâ€™s the main characterâ€, â€œHow do you relate to themâ€ â€œWhatâ€™s the tone of the filmâ€. I clicked on the link thinking it was a short film we had to analyze, but I got rickrolled instead. In the spot where the 4th question would be he said, â€œIf you answered all these questions you trippin. Please go back to the assignment and work on your playsâ€.

TL;DR: English teacher rickrolled the class with a joke assignment.
