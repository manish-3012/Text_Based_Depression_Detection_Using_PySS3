Thereâ€™s this boy.. .. and I REALLY like him. Nobody knows, not even my friends. Today we had an orientation day (a tour of highschool), and heâ€™s going to my highschool too. My friend whoâ€™s annoying lol, keeps on pulling me away when I talk to him. We are both 13, should I wait until next year when we get in highschool to tell him?? Idk if I trust telling him now then him telling his friends. Thx guys ðŸ¤—
