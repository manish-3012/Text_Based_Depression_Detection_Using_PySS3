Has anyone else been skipping their online classes? I'll be honest. My online class sessions are completely useless and they don't really benefit me in any way at all. When I'm not feeling it, I'll send my teacher an email with a BS excuse about why I can't be in class today, then I'll go off and do my own thing. Works perfectly every time, and I have straight As.
