Advice on personality Hello! I would like to ask the kind denizens of r/teenagers some questions regarding personality. I've had a rough time these past few years struggling with emotional numbness, and I'm anxious that it's had a negative effect on my personality. Things I believe it has affected are my motivation (which has made me a lazy prick who takes the path of least resistance almost all of the time), charisma (which has made me a very dull person to talk to as I cannot really relate to others problems or acheivements in a meaningfull way) and has dampened my will to help in a selfless way (I don't get any emotional reward from doing a good deed anymore, so it is harder to help others.) I feel jaded by it all, and can't for the life of me truly care for anything. I'm aware that some of these things are typically associated with autism, or other ailments on the autism spectrum like Asperger's, and I have formal letters from my therapist attesting to me being autistic. However, these traits never have been as strong as they are now. Is this normal? What advice would you give to someone in my position?
