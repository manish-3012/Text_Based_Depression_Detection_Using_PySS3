Help I don't know what the fuck just happened I randomly got a tunnel vision kind of thing. Like I could only see a tiny amount and the rest of my peripheral version was just dark red. My heart also started beating extremely fast and I could barely breath. Anyone know what this is? Or am I just dying right now?
