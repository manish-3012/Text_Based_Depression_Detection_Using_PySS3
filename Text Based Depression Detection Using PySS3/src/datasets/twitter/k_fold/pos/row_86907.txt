I would really love to have a job, but not for the obvious reasons. I wanna have that kind of weird but amazing friendship with someone three times me age and be like "hey where's Hans, haven't seen that elephanthugger all day" and then someone is like "oh he broke his hip this morning from falling of the stairs in his four-story-villa" and then I rush to the hospital and I find him lying in bed, eating pudding and absolutely vibing to the regional news on the hospital television and then I'll be like "Hans!" and he'll be like "Steve!" and we hug it out because we're both happy he's okay but I kinda forgot he broke his hip so I lean on it a bit and kinda hurt him but we just laugh it off because we're such great friends and he knows how clumsy I sometimes can be.

Men can have simpel dreams, am I right?
