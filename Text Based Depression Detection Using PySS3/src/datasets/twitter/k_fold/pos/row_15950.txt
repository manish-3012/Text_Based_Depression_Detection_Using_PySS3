I'm never going on this sub again Btw I'm fully aware nobody cares but I joined looking for friends and people like me however instead I found a bunch of sexist or wannabe edgy idiots. It makes me feel even more depressed seeing how everybody's either cringey levels of edgy or sexist or desperate for reddit awards and tries to play it off as a shitty meme something and because I'm a loser I feel put down just because every post I see is about perfect relationships and since my last was 2 years ago and I got cheated on at 12 it makes me feel depressed anyway rant over... have a great day
