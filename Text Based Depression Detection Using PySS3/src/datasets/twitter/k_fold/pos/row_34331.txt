Just saw two friends vape, Do I snitch? So I live in HK where underage vaping is illegal, and while waiting to be picked up after rugby training, the two dudes Iâ€™m with walk off behind a building where we are waiting, I follow them l thinking they found somewhere to sit since there are no benches here, I see one (him doing this kind of thing doesnâ€™t surprise me) hand a pen-like object to the other, which I think was vape. (There have been cases here where teens have been hospitalized due to smoking and vaping and the parents donâ€™t know so they donâ€™t get the right treatment) Do I snitch?
