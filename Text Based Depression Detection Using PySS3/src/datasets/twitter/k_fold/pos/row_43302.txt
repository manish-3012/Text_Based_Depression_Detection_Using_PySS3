Having existential crisis and thoughts about death... how to come in terms with them? Since the start of qurantine i've been very depressed, tought about my life, my death, existing, complex stuff that we dont know. Honestly I am very scared, i am an atheist so i know/believe if i die i will be gone for good, so before that how can i calm myself downand accept it?  I used to cry every night(i am terrified of it), i've calmed down a bit more but i feel like it's getting bad again.
