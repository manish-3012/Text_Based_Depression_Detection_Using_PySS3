My dad is really something... So earlier today, I was about to take out my dog and I asked my dad if I could get the new Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity game.
He then responded with â€œBut ya see, that messes with my Christmas present I was gonna get you.â€

I never thought that my dad really listened about what I tell him the small trivial things I know about Nintendo (Like how Wario was supposed to be German and he says â€œAh crap!â€ in German in the English version of Mario party 1 but it sounds like â€œSo I missed!â€).

I love my dad.
