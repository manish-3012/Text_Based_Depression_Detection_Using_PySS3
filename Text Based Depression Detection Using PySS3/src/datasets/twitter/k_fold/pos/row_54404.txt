home doesn't feel like home anymore (just me complaing about life) short version/main problem since this entire post is a mess: my parents finally crossed the line by turning my room upside down. They lost every bit of trust I had do I'm considering buying a hidden cam even tho I'm too poor for that



two week ago my friend invited me to go to the netherlands with him. Since I was bored I obviously came along. Apperantly my family saw the oppurtunity to snoop around, making changes to my lifestyle and whatnot. They were like that before, looking at my chathistory, eavesdropping my calls and judging my friends. Because of that I was already insecure and made some hidden mechanics and places in my room where they would either never find it or it gets immediatly destroyed. This time I found out that they turned my entire room upside down, replacing some furniture and sorting all my clothes. I was broke my entire life and valued eveything I owned so buying something like a hidden cam is obviously outside my budget range but now it really feels nessassary since I lost all trust in my family. I live in a 6mÂ² room so I have no privacy (ignoring the fact that I can't lock my room since they "lost" the key). Luckly I'll just need one of those cams as a result 

other things they did

- called me 37 times after being 30min late

- complains that I'm lazy and never leave home (eveb tho I go to the gym every second day)

- (dad) insulted me with my relatives in front of me (indirect like the pussys they are)

- explained to me how my cousins are better than me because they were snobby and more successfull

- after questioning why they were not successfull they pushed the fault on the family (mainly me because i asked) because we spend to much

- since 7th grade I completly snapped, casted away most of my personality and became stone faced and monotone. I did everything like they told me to, declined everything they offered as "unnessesary" and started working so they can't tell me shit. I won't give them the pleasure of seeing a happy normal kid growing up and since they told me to do everything by myself they can't expect me to help.

-  Because of that my life hit rock bottom and some people cut off every ties with me telling me I was cold and s complete psycho.

- after figuring out ms salary my dad was fully prepared to ask me for money (he owes my sister 5kâ‚¬ and is 70kâ‚¬ in debt)

- while I was completly down my aunt gifted me money an awesome laptop. My mom transfered it to my sister so we can think about it and buy it together (she was studying in italy and I was visiting). After returning home I consulted my dad and we bought it together. When my dad said that was his money I asked him where the money from my aunt went. Nobody knew and so someone just took 4,2k â‚¬ from me. At least I got a laptop that immediatly broke down. thx msi for breaking it completly after the 4th repair

yes I portrayed them as assholes but they still care for me, asked me how my day was, what i ate etc. (tho sometimes annoying). My dad didn't interacts with me much so he alwsys asks the same questions but compared to 3 years he really tried hard to become better (stopped smoking, being less agressive and only nags all day) He even signed up to gym with me to spend more time with me. My mom starts the fights now but since he created that bad impression my sister always backs up my mom. It really ticks me of but like I said: that's not my problem.

Am I just overreacting now because of my teenage hormones ? Really feels like a standard emo wanna be story after reading through it. Sorry for that just blowing off some steam, have a nice day/night
