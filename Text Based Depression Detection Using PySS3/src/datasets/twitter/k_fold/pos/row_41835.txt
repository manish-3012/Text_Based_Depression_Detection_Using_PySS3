This is part 2 of the story im writing. It will focus on Newtons backstory. If your new and want to read the story, you can click on my profile and read part 1. Enjoy! My mind flooded with questions. A man named Newton has just admitted being partially responsible for the end of the world, and the loss of my family. I wanted to beat him up right then and there. Who the hell just ends the world and tries to play hero afterwards? I wanted answers.Â 


"Hear me out" he says. "You might be a bit pissed at me-" "Understatement of the century" I cut him off. "-But I can explain". A few years ago, I was visited by a few scientists" he says. "They said they knew that I was one of the smartest people on earth. Rivaling with Sir Issac Newton himself. They explained that they were going to create monsters that would wipe out all the evil in this world. Little did I know that they wanted to actually end the world. They promised me my family and me would be safe from these monsters. They were going to do it with or without me, but with my help, it would greatly increase production speed". "Wheres your family now"? I ask. An awkward silence falls between us. That was enough for me to figure out what happened. "Im so sorry". I say. "But why me"? I ask. "You could literally choose anyone else, so why me"? "Because at this point, Im pretty sure your the only other survivor, besides the guys working for the mad scientists, who will surely do everything to stop us".


"The only other survivor". That thought filled me with dread. There had to be other people out there willing to help us. But during the explosion that blew my house to pieces, it also blew my phone, so I had no way of checking. I just had to pray that my friends were safe. But somehow I knew they were long gone.


Its been 5 years since all of that happened, we have had five years to plan our attack, and now, those bastards are gonna have hell to pay for killing my family, and ending the world.Â 


So tomorrow, we strike.
