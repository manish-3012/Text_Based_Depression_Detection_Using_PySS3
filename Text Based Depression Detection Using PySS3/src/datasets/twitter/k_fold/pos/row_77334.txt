okie, which one of you caring motherfuckers told redditcareresources about me fr tho, thanks for reaching out. I'm not doing too well but I've been managing to cope, and I'm trying to make the most out of every day. I hopefully will not have to resort to a prevention hotline ever again.

thank you to whoever did this, for caring for me :D
