Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 97 Three Days Remain.  


Wow, THREE DAYS! That's insane! As always, if you have any questions or topics for me, let me know in the comments. I'll see you tomorrow!  


Fact: Let's talk a little bit about Saturn's lesser-known moons. As cool as they are, Titan, Enceladus, and Iapetus can't get all the attention! There are 4 of them I want to give some info on, so I'm not going to waste your time here. Let's dive right in!

&amp;#x200B;

Dione: The first moon here is Dione, which - like most moons - is tidally locked to its parent planet. However, there's something odd about the way Dione is tidally locked. The side of Dione that faces Saturn has fewer craters than the side that doesn't face Saturn. This is the exact opposite of what many scientists were expecting, and it could indicate that - at some point in the past - a massive impact may have caused Dione's orientation to completely reverse!

&amp;#x200B;

Mimas: This is my third favorite Saturnian moon, and it's all because of one feature named Herschel Crater. To put it simply, it's a massive crater likely made by an impact that nearly obliterated Mimas. It's so big that it makes Mimas look like the Death Star from *Star Wars!*

&amp;#x200B;

Rhea: Back in 2008, NASA announced that observations from the *Cassini* probe suggested that Rhea could have a very small ring system! This would have marked the first time that any moon was known to have rings, but further *Cassini* observations unfortunately revealed no evidence of ring material.

&amp;#x200B;

Tethys: Our final moon here is Tethys, which is 97% as dense as liquid water. This suggests that the moon may be almost entirely made of water ice!  


The Saturnian moons are super interesting, and I loved doing this fact about them because they all have their own little quirks!
