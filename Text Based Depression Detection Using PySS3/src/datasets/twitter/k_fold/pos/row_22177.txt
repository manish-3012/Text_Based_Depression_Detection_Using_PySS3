Help me decide what to do with my room Moving in a house we are building in a while and I have the layout of furniture decided but I donâ€™t know what sort of pictures or whatever I should do; I have off white furniture, want to display my instruments also (guitar, electric guitar, ukulele), also I take and want to take more Instax pictures and maybe will do a thing with that, and I have a bench I might put in there thatâ€™s just white and dark wood color, should I put any pictures up or like what should I do
