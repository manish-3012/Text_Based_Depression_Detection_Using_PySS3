I'm about to go mad... So in 2 days ago our school and most schools here all canceled the exams due to corona and just now and I was excited as I knew nothing, but now just this morning they emailed us and said the exams will be started on 3 November as told before. They must be joking, I literally know shit, and I wasted 2 days thinking it was gonna be delayed for 1 month. I don't know what to do tbh.
