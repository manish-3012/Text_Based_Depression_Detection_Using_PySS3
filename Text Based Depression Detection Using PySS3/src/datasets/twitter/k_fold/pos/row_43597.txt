a boy from my school said that everyone who isnâ€™t on his private snap story is a pussy He said â€œdonâ€™t waste my time tryna act all nice when yâ€™all donâ€™t have good intentions. Donâ€™t hmu bc Iâ€™m keeping my circle exclusive.â€ He actually said not to make him look like an asshole when he starts acting like one bc he thinks weâ€™re all fake pussies. This kid said on our schools Instagram tea page that he loves going to school so he can â€œcrack kids in the face.â€ The reason he posted this is because he thinks most people on his public snap story are pussies.
