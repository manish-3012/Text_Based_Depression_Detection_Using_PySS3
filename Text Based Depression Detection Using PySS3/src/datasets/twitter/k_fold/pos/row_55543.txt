I just accidentally opened my porn folder in class Sorry in advance for formatting, I'm on mobile

So I was sitting in Latin class and we had just finished translating some poem with the whole class, and since i didn't have a notebook on me, i used my laptop. i didnt want to do it again (obviously), so i saved it. but the thing is, im switching laptops today, so i needed to mail it to myself (like everything else i did yesterday). I opened mail, and I remember thinking "wait, I sent my porn folder to myself yesterday, I should use my alternate email adress."
because I was sitting at the front of the class.
So I opened my alternate email adress, clicked 'new mail' and then clicked 'add file'. The thing popped up so I could choose what file to send myself, and my heart skipped a beat, because it had opened the porn  folder, as it was the last folder i had sent something from with email. then things got even worse: i froze.
I snapped out of it after about half a second, but it felt like an hour. i sent my latin text to myself and looked over my shoulder.
even though i was sitting at the front of the class, the fact that a bunch of people were sick plus the fact that the people who do greek left the class when we started translating the poem, coupled with my position near the outlets meant i only had 3 people directly behind me.
the closest one seemed to be busy, and the two other ones were focussed on the teacher, so i think i made it out without any damage.
