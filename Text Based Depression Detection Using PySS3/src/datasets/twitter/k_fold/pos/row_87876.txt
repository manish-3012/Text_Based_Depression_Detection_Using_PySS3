One positive in 2020 for me As we all know, 2020 has been a clusterfuck. I havenâ€™t been to in person school since March 
13th (coincidentally, my birthday).I finished my junior year strong but the first semester of my senior year was bad. But since Iâ€™ve been cooped up in my house, Iâ€™ve developed a hobby, poetry.
Iâ€™d never thought Iâ€™d be into reading or writing poetry. My interest was sparked when I had an English assignment where we had to create a poem and I really enjoyed it, so I kept going. As a guy, Iâ€™m pretty much expected to bottle up my feelings and Iâ€™ve been doing that ever since I can remember. Poetry gives me an opportunity to unload my feelings. I love pouring my fears, sadness, hopes and dreams onto a page, creating a mesmerizing array of words. Itâ€™s been a tough year but also one that gave me something thatâ€™s precious.
