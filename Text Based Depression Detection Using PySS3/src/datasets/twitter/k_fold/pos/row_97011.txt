is this ok in a relationship? :/ my boyfriend is a PC gamer and plays games every day. iâ€™m seeing him on Monday, and he said that he wants to play a few of his new games while iâ€™m over. i asked him â€œwhy canâ€™t you play them on sunday or Monday before i come over?â€ but apparently they take 4 hours to download and 

â€œwe donâ€™t do anything anyway, so you either put up with it or iâ€™ll get mum to drop you off earlyâ€ 

am i a bitch for wanting his attention the whole time? guys and girls pls help me out. have any of you been in this situation? whatâ€™s something i could say to him?
