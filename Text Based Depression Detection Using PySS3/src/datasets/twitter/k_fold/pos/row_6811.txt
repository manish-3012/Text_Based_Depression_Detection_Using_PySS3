I GOT A BOYFRIEND During this pandemic my depression has been crazy, a few weeks ago I got much closer to suicide than I ever hope too again.

Today I figured "why not, I got nothing to lose" so I texted my crush, told him how I felt, he felt the same, and here we are! So.. I GOT A BOYFRIEND!!!

I am aware dating with depression is difficult, he is aware of my condition and he knows some days will be good and some will be bad. I'm really grateful to have him.

Please post nothing sexual in the comments... were both 13 and I don't want to be thinking about that. 

So, yea, I GOT A BOYFRIEND!!!
