Guys i need quick advice.. So long story short this girl on my sc posted on her story asking someone to face time her. I didnt expect her to want to face time me since she didnt know me or anything so i slid up and was like â€œwanna text?â€ And she was like â€œno face time meâ€ so i gave her my number and she called me like 5 minutes later and that was surprising cuz she is FINE AS FUCK for one, and i dont mean to sound negative but im not the sexiest looking guy lol. 

We got on the phone and I immediately started teasing/playing with her talking about how theres a â€œspider on her wallâ€. She found it funny and seemed to be genuinely laughing about it. She was even like â€œboy you so irratatinggâ€. We talked about some other random shit or whatever for a good maybe 20 minutes? Then her friend called her to tell her about some shit that happened at a party or whatever.

I doubt she will call back cuz its late asf rn but im confused on what i should do next. She seems cool asf yk? And i want to start talking to her more. But im scared that this might have just been a one time thing and that shes not actually interested idk. I mean i do know shes single thats for certain.

Should i text her tomorrow if she doesnt text me first? Ill be honest shes kinda dry on texts but expressive asf on the phone. So should i text her to try and call her again tomorrow night? I feel like i could text her and be like â€œheyy spider girlâ€. Idk what yall think? I know im overreacting this but shes so cute bro and I actually wanna try and see if i can get her.
