These are what I believe to be the hottest things on a girl. No makeup, all natural. I mean, I understand having makeup and stuff when you're going out and trying to present yourself in that kind of way. I'm talking about, not wearing makeup everyday, because honestly, I find no makeup cuter than makeup.


Braless. This might be a bit graphic, but I especially like it when your nipples are hard and making an indent within the shirt. But I especially like it when a girl feels comfortable.


Glasses can be really fucking adorable, but it usually depends on the person. More often then not though, it's cute af.


Baggy shirts/hoodies. That's just really adorable to me for some reason. Idk why, but I just wanna cuddle someone when they wear that xD.


But yeah, I just needed that off my chest. Anyway, goodnight.
