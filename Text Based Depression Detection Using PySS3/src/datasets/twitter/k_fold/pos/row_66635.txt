I fucked up. Big time :( So it all started when I finished school and was in the phase of getting into college and joining coaching classes (everyone does in our country, learning something twice so you're more perfect)
Also the college I took admission into was one of those for who didn't score well in school (not me). So basically I was kindof doing them a favor because I had scored good and which meant I would be scoring good further which is good for the clg's reputation. In return, I get to skip basically I give them assurance I will study well on my own. This all just sounds stupid in retrospect but trust me I'm better of not going to the college where they was time teaching literature and EVS and shit which is literally useless.

At the time I was at my aunt's wedding (our families were very close and all) and I was at my native place (basically not where I was supposed to be). Fast-forward, I'm late. When I joined everyone was ahead of me and I was supposed to do some of the beginning chapters on my own. 
Oh and btw I later turned out to have adhd and depression!! 

So because of those reasons I wasn't doing very well on my own. Fast forward to today, I've wasted 1.5 years of time with all of the syllabus due! 
Yea I survived clg without but that doesn't mean I know anything. 
I wasted 10 months doing nothing in covid. 

I'm going to have to drop a year now where I'm going to be alone without any friends and it's going to shitty!  I hate myself and can't get over this!.

Tldr;I have 1.5 years of syllabus due. I have ADHD and depresshoun! And my adhd meds don't start another month. I've got exams in Jan, Feb, April. Very important ones and I know jack shit!
