How tf do I tell my parents Iâ€™m dating an older guy by 6 years my parents had a hard time accepting me dating someone older by a couple months
They only know Iâ€™m dating someone cause my mother went on my pc and read my damn discord messages
Theyâ€™re asking questions about him like his race,age,height,what does he do, and etc
I really donâ€™t know how to tell them his age cause weâ€™re not even in the same gen
