Awkward moments of my life. So when I was around 4-6, canâ€™t exactly recall, I kissed a girl (same age range as me). We both agreed without thinking and we did it on the closet, to this day I cringe and laugh about it.

She still remembers it, but she does not want to talk about it to this day. Did we got caught? Yes. Did our parents got mad? Yes. She was my friend.

In the fifth grade, a girl, she was shy, asked me out. I rejected the date, beautiful and smart one, but I never saw what we do together. Moving forward in mid-2019, never seen her after M.S.

Another awkward moment was when my friend took me outside for a walk and discuss life, she then wanted to proceed a question, but her brother came out and she blushed pretty hard. Week later, they moved out, I forgot to ask her Kik/FB (back when it was a common thing).

Moving along on the 7th grade, some girl just randomly kissed my cheek. Me being confused, I just ignore it. She kept getting all over me, but I never felt the tension, she asked me out and I just politely rejected a no. Yes, sheâ€™s cute, but we never had a similar connection.

TL:DR. I always have an awkward moment when Iâ€™m interacting with people. (These were my 4 most awkward moments).
