Should I risk it... My best friend liked me for 2/3 years now. I came to the conclusion that she 
could be more than an amazing best friend. 

I gotta mention that sheâ€™s in my same classroom so if stuff goes wrong, weâ€™ll have to see each other everyday... This is my biggest fear, togheter with what will my other classmates say and think. I hope and iâ€™m almost sure this wouldnâ€™t happen because in all those 3 years she didnâ€™t like any other guy but me so I know she will sincerely love me... Even after ignoring her at the beginning she still went for it until we got close and became best friends. I also know I like her because if I didnâ€™t I wouldnâ€™t even doubt this move and I feel that special spark you donâ€™t always feel.

What do you think? Should I ask her to be more than just best friends?... 

Itâ€™s risky because our amazing bf relationship might either become something better or get destroyed...

Thank you for the advice! (this is a more detailed version of a deleted post Iâ€™ve made)
