HOLY S**T FINNALY ITS BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS AND AFTER ALL THIS TIME OF NIT HAVING ANY CONTACT BETWEEN ME AND ANY OF MY FRIENDS. JUST NOW MY BEST FRIEND TEXTED ME. I HAVE NO CLUE HOW HE EVEN GOT MY NUMBER UNLESS HE DUG IT UP FROM ONE OF HIS OLDER PHONES. IMMEDIATELY I HAVE GONE FROM BEING BORED AND SLIGHTLY DEPRESSED, TO FEELING LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO FINISH MY SCHOOL WORK.
