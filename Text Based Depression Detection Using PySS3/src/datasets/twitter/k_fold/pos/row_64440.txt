How do I even move on... (she - (F)). After a 4 month long and secretive relationship, I had to move out to another city, than we started talking on Instagram and nobody knew until yesterday. Her sister replied to me and I said I just wanted to ask her a question (i lied) and said "Nevermind I'll ask you instead cause It's a question you can answer too". So I made up a question and she answered and said good night. Today I texted her again and this time (F) answered and she said "We should stop talking because it gets me in trouble.", from that I knew that her sister told her mom that I texted her and she got angry at (F). And I don't want to get her in trouble. I get her point, the only way she won't get in trouble because of me is if we stop talking. On the other hand, I don't think a relationship can keep going without even talking. So I asked her "Do you think we can still be together without even talking?" She answered "I don't know" and than I said " I don't think we can be together like this, It's over.". And than I asked her "You get my point right? You understand right?" She said "Yes, I understand". And than we both said that we love eachother and goodbye... I'm f***ing broken Inside.
