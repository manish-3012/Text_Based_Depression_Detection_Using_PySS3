The 2 biggest problems with Dating as a teen and young adult (GUYS N GIRLS) The big problem is most of you guys dont know what you want. MEN AND WOMEN. you have to sit down and actually think about what u like. "do i want her to be short or tall, would u substitue some looks for a better personality?" "how tall ur man is, how much money he has to make" Sit down and figure out what u want youre partner to be so u can go find them, cuz its hard to go hunt for something that you dont know 

The second biggest problem is dating without reason. There should always  be a real reason u go into a relationship. if not, keep it friends with benefits. But too many guys n girls just date for no reason. Alotta guys think TO have sex they needa cuff a girl, nah bro that just leads to u breaking her heart. Alotta girls cuff a guy because all her friends think hes cute, so she'll date him for coll points in her friend group. you needa be dating each other for each other.
