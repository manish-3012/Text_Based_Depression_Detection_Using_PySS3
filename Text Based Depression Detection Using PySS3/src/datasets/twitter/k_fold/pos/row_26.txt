Not having a crush during quarantine. So Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend. Last year was the first year I actually tried to make an attempt to date but all of those fucked up and Iâ€™m in quarantine now. And right now Iâ€™m feeling like shit because I donâ€™t have a crush. That may sound pathetic but even though it was quarantine and itâ€™s not a good idea to start a relationship during quarantine and probably wouldnâ€™t but it was still nice to have someone to think about. A lot of nights I just feel hollow. Its not necessarily a feeling. Itâ€™s the absence of one. I donâ€™t know I might sounds stupid right now just need to get some stuff out.
