Just a rant about s o c i e t y What is the point in trying at school to get grades to go to another school to get grades to go to a uni to get more grades and a shit load of debt to get a job where you have no time for anything and when you do have time you are to tied to do anything.
I'm currently looking at university to do a degree my parents think I should do, then when I say my hearts not in it they ask what other option I want and I can't find anything that I actually want to do.
