Please respect pronouns Yes, I may have been AFAB, but that doesnâ€™t mean I always us she/her as my pronouns. 

If youâ€™re going to say something about how Iâ€™m a female and canâ€™t use other pronouns, you can go. Just leave and ignore this. 

I am gender fluid, which means â€œpeople whose gender changes over time. A gender-fluid person might identify as a woman one day and a man the next. They might also identify as agender, bigender, or another nonbinary identity.â€
