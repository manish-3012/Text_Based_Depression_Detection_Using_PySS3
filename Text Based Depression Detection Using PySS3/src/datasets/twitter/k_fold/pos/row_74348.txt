this is kind of irrelevant but, i didn't know where else to post it and i didn't have anyone to tell. im so fuckinv grateful to be here. not here, in this subreddit; but on this planet. i never thought id live past 14 and its my 16th birthday in ONE WEEK. if it weren't for my literal best friend, i wouldn't be here and im so thankful for her. if anyone decides to read this and is going through a tough time, it gets better. it might not feel like it but i promise u; it does.
