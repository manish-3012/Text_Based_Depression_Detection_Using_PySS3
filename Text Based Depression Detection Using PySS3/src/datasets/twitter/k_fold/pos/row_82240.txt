If I ever get a gf I want to dress her up in cute clothes Iâ€™ve been thinking so much over the past three years about what Iâ€™ll do once I finally get another gf. One of the things iâ€™m looking forward to the most is dressing her up. Hereâ€™s some of the outfits Iâ€™ll want her to wear:

â€¢ japanese schoolgirl uniform

â€¢ black leather jacket and jeans

â€¢ nurse scrubs

â€¢ male blue collar work clothes

â€¢ this one Superman shirt that my ex used to wear + a beanie, which she also used to wear

â€¢ a onesie

â€¢ full adidas tracksuit, with no underwear

â€¢ a turtleneck and skirt

â€¢ a grey baggy hoodie and sweatpants, with her hair down and out of it

â€¢ hello kitty pajamas (I own two dolls even though iâ€™m a grown man)

â€¢ a marching band uniform 

â€¢ her old prom dress, with her hair tied up in a ponytail but with one strand of hair hanging down in front of her face

â€¢ no clothes except wearing My underwear and a pair of white shoes

â€¢ no clothes 

Oh yeah bby
