I think someone just saved my life I was down today and didn't plan to make it until tomorrow.

This person I don't really talk to checked up on me because I wasn't in school for a while.

"Hey I know we don't talk much but I just wanted to check up on you, I didn't see you lately so I wanted to ask if you're doing okay"

I don't think I would have changed my mind if they didn't send that message :)
