I just experienced a once in a lifetime event My YT channel FernOfBlades just hit 69 subscribers!!  


Jokes aside, even though my numbers are small. I appreciate every single person who has watched any of my videos. Every comment is just so supportive of me and my passion, more than I have ever experienced from my irl friends and family.  


Everytime I see a notification pop out on my YT feed and its a comment I just smile because its like, wow I just made a complete stranger care enough about what I do for them to take the time to type out a comment. And ik it may make it seem worthless but I heart every comment and I mean it truly.

It really helps me feel a lot more confident in my art and storytelling capabilities. After years of being put down by ppl ik irl, especially my family. They are really traditional asians and being an artist just never goes well with them. It also doesn't help that they're always talking trash abt my art.

Anyways Im getting super emotional, all of this support just came out of nowhere. Especially since I was at my lowest earlier this year, when my parents forced me into a college course that I just didnt want to be in. And a big influencer decided to message me on Discord to tell me that my stuf sucks compared to him and that a lot of his fans thinks so too.  


For the first time in a long time,  I actually feel kind of proud of myself for once. Fingers crossed I get to entertain more people with my stories soon! I'm going to make a video just saying thank you next.  


TLDR: Got tons of support and Im now emotional
