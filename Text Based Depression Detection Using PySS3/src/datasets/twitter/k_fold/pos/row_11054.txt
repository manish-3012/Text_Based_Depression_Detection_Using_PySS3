Advice on helping a friend Um Hi, so i need some advice, i would be grateful if i were to recieve any ( we are high-schoolers)
So my friend has been in a relationship with someone for abt a month or 2 now, though it only has been a month or 2, they are having some problems, his girlfriend is a bit on the "cold" side and sometimes treats him a bit harsh and blames himself for being too  needy, when in reality he hardly ever is, and now his mental health is worsening, he consulted me abt his problems and we talked for awhile and i suggested breaking up if he couldnt deal with it anymore (i desperetly regret suggesting that). I dont know what i can do to help him, he just wants to be alone rn, but i worry abt him cause he's my close friend. What can i do other than give him space...can someone give me any advice other than telling him to break up...thank u for helping....
