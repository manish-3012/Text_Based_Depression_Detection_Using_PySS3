Another monologue A person asked me a really good question that I would like to respond to:

What would you do if you were given the role of being the king of all of humanity?

My response is do many reforms, such as equality for all and industrializing places with lesser infrastructure. I would also create a small earth defense unit to protect the earth from foreign intelligent races. Though I do not wish to fight them and would rather guve them the rights all humans have, one can never be too safe. I would then reform the education system and add cultural enrichment classes along with classes that teach the language of either English or mandarin. So we can all communicate with each other and have a one language society, but of course, we shall not forget these languages for the purpose of preserving history. I would also set up a democratic system like the United States except on a larger scale. Then I would step down as king and let democracy thrive in the human race
