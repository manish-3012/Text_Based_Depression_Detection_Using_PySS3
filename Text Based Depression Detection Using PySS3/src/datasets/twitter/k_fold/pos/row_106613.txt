I'm feeling kind of sad. And it's because my friend's mom is threatening to permanently take his phone away, and because he lives in another city that means I'd hardly get to talk to him. And I know his address so I will be able to write letters, but it's just not the same, you know?

I'm thinking of writing his mom a letter and asking her to let him come over to my house for a day.

I just know I'm gonna miss talking to him all the time.
