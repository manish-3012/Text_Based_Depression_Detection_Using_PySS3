Question- what does being harm free mean? Liek, I've seen people posting about it, and on face value it looks pretty easy, like...just don't harm yourself lol.


Also, are people harming themselve on daily basis? Why?

Coz they are suicidal? I thought suicidal people just ... Commit suicide.

Is harming yourself like a lite version of comminiting suicide or what?
