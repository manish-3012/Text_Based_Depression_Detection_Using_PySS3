Iâ€™m terrified of getting taller, is there anyway I canâ€™t stop my growth or even force myself to shrink? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask something like this, I donâ€™t really know where to put this and I can delete this post if need be. 

Anyways so Iâ€™m 5â€™7â€ and I have extreme height dysphoria. I hate the fact that I feel tall so much and I would do anything to be shorter, My Dream height is to be 4â€™10â€ Or at most 5â€™3â€. I canâ€™t find anything on the internet that talks about decreasing your height and Iâ€™m starting to get stressed out! Anytime I find someone who also asked a question like this every Answer is â€œDonâ€™tâ€. Listen I donâ€™t care about the dangers or what could happen to me please please tell me if or if not itâ€™s possible and if it is how to do it! Thank you in advance
