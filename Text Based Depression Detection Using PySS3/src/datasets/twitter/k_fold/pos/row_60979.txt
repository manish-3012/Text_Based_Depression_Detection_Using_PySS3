Not that important, im just salty. So I wanted to get minecraft java for a long time since bedrock, really isn't that good. So I told my cousin from the UK to buy it from me(I live in iran and our credit cards are different so I can't buy it on my own)

After he bought me an account apparently minecraft is banned in iran(java) so I turned on a vpn and downloaded it (yea you probably see where this is going)

My cousin told me as soon as it downloaded I should call him on discord.
After it downloaded however, I didn't call him...
I went on hypixel with my vpn on (I had no idea you could get banned for that) and I instantly got perma banned.

My cousin went on the appeal and thankfully they changed my ban to 30 day ban.

So yea not important just thought I'd let out my anger somewhere.

28 days to go.
