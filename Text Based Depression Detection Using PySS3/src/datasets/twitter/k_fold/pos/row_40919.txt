How can I improve my score for the SAT? Sophomore in high school, I want to prepare for the SAT

I didnâ€™t get a good score on my PSAT 8/9 I took in Fall of my freshman year, 990 was my score (i actually dont know what the average good score is for the PSAT 8/9), and am aiming to take the SAT for the first time in Fall 2021 junior year and the College I want to go to has an average of 1300 on the SAT. So I just want to know how can I improve?
