My mom dad and sister get me in trouble for no reason and constantly gang up on me So I had an IQ test a long while back, mine came back 145 and theirs around 105. You might think this is besides the point but itâ€™s not. For some reason they expect me to swing the pitch of my voice up and down constantly while I talk, like how you would talk to a baby. They for some reason think that if Iâ€™m not talking like a baby to them (they talk like babyâ€™s to everyone and everyone to them, AKA vice versa) I prefer to talk normally and smoothly, unless itâ€™s an emergency or something that requires a different pitch. They for some reason think that Iâ€™m being mean to them, by saying â€œgoodâ€ in response to how are you doing in a smooth normal voice. And ground me for no reason, theyâ€™ve even gone as far as swearing at me, and threatening to kick me out of the house. (Iâ€™m 14) even the questions they ask are ape like. For example, I might be watching tv and they will ask me what Iâ€™m watching. While itâ€™s playing on the tv, and Iâ€™ll prefer not to answer because theyâ€™re staring at the tv with me. They then proceed to gang up on my and ground me because I didnâ€™t reply even after I explained why I didnâ€™t. 

What the fuck is wrong with people.
