Is a stem degree really a great idea? I came across this video where he discusses the issues with stem education.

One issue with graduating in stem is that you do not really learn anything you cannot learn on your own for free via internet.

One general issue with university education is that it is typically specialized to one field but you do not really know what working in this field is like assuming you can get a job in the first place.
