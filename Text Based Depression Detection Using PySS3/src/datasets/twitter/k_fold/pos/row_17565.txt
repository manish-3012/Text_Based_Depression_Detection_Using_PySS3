Does anyone else find it funny that the people that want to go back to the 50s and 60s are the same people that hate Jewish people the most? This is always so strange to me, that people who jerk off over the US after and/or during ww2 are the same people that would likely be killed during ww2. Do people not realize that they would have been hated for their anti-semetic beliefs during that time period? Along with that, how is it that people like Ben Shapiro can stand to be a part of the Authoritarian Right, which is quite frankly extremely anti-semetic. Its all very strange to me.
