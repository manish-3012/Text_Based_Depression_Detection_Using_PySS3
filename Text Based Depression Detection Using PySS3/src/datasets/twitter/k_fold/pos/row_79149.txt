Scared the shit out of my stepdad today... whoops My stepdad (Papa) is part of my schools administration, meaning he works at the school. My boyfriend had football practice (weâ€™re doing a spring season) anyway I didnâ€™t want to wait two hours to go home (cuz my boyfriend drove me to school) so I went and sat in my papa car knowing he was leaving to get my little sister soon enough. (Moms a nurse and I wasnâ€™t told to get her so it had to be him.) 

Anyway Iâ€™m just sitting there on my phone and he opens the backseat door to throw his bag in the back and comes to the front and the drivers door and slips in finally looking up to see me (he had headphones in and hadnâ€™t heard me talk to him apparently). He jumped ripping the headphones out and giving me a look. Whoops. 

â€œYou scared the shit out of me.â€ 

â€œThought you  heard me, sorry papa.â€
