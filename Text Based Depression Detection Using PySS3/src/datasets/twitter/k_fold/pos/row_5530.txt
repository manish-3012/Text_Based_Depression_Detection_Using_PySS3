Is it just me who thinks it's a bit odd that the story of the 13 year old in England who got stabbed to death hasn't really been big news outside of the UK? Not to compare it to school shootings, but like you'd hear about that in England within a day but it seems like this story has been exclusive to the UK. For those that don't know, a 13 year old boy was set up by his girlfriend who paid another 13 year old to stab him as a way of "teaching a lesson" because he got angry that she sent nudes to another guy
