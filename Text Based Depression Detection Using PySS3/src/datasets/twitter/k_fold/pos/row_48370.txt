Did I mess up? 

I started to talk to some girl on Instagram and I like her and I think she likes me too, I have a friend that knows this girl and she said that the girl that I met on Instagram thinks that I'm cute.
Yesterday we started to talk about movies and she said to me that it's best to watch a horror movie with someone and not alone so I said: â€œ so when are we going to see a movieðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚?â€
She answered: â€œlet's wait till the Theaters open upâ€.
