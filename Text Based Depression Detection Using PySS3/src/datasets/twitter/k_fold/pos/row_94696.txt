THE GREATEST THING JUST HAPPENED My mom was on the phone with Home Depot trying to talk to a specific employee and the directory asked for an extension and I said 420 as a joke (the phone didnâ€™t pick it up) 

So then my mom gets to customer service and the employeeâ€™s extension was 499

MY GUESS OF 420 WAS 69 AWAY FROM THE EXTENSION LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
