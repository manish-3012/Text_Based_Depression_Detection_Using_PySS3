I tried kill myself a month ago and have been in in patient therapy for 2 weeks and i don't feel any better. Of course my family have hidden all the knives so I can't self harm. My urges to self harm got so bad that I used blunt kid scissors to cut myself. I also haven't told my friends what happened. I'm also worried that if I'm honest at therapy I'll have to be in in patient for longer. I dont know why I'm posting this but yeah.
