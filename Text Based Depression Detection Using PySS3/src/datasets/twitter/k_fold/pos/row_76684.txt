My 6 year old sister "pranked" me before I say this i'd like to tell you about my sister, she might be crazy, I don't know how but she is different then others I guess, my mom Also let's her watch youtube kids. Any way here we go. I left my house to go to the store so I could get some chips, I ended up talking to some friends for about 30minutes. when I came back my TV was on the floor there was soda dumped all over my floor and bed, my controller which I still don't know if it's broke had some on it. She appearently was watching prank Channels. Sorry for the long post I just needed some outlet to say something.
