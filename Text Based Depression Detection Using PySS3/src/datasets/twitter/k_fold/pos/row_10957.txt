I can withstand bigotry but I draw the line at stupid bigotry. Like seriously the amount of transphobes that are just flat out ignorant is amazing. Like will you at least take the time to learn that trans isnâ€™t a third gender and that trans and gay arenâ€™t the same thing before you start calling people slurs? And on the fact, before you say â€œbasic biologyâ€ again, could you please take the time to read literally fucking anything about biology that isnâ€™t made for 4th graders? Maybe even like learn the difference between gender and sex? God I hate these people. If the only way you can be transphobic is to be extremely ignorant of reality maybe then you shouldnâ€™t be transphobic.
