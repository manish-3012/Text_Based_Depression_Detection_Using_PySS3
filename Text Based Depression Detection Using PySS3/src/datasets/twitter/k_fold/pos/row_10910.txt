He got in the way TL;DR at end 
So this morning my oldest cat woke me up at 4:20 by eating plastic and then jumping on my bed and putting his paw on my stomach. Awesome. I watched YouTube until 5:45 and took a shower. I got ready for school. I got out the door at 7:12 the bus arrived at 7:15. My sister wasnâ€™t outside. I called my dad to try and tell him to send her out. He didnâ€™t pick up. The bus driver waited which was nice. I ran up the driveway to tell my sister to get outside. As I was about to open the door, my sister stepped out. She told me that our slightly autistic (Iâ€™m serious, he actually has very minor autism) stepbrother was cooking his breakfast and being a little shit by hugging and dancing around with his mom WHO HAD JUST WOKEN UP AND HADNT HAD COFFEE YET. My sister also didnâ€™t have a mask and couldnâ€™t get it due to little shit. Weâ€™re in the bus and the shit is like this every day. Heâ€™s clingy, annoying, loud, and doesnâ€™t give me respect. If I tell him not to do something like letting the pets outside, he turns to my dad for verification. I just am super tired and pissed rn. Iâ€™m vibing on the bus rn which is helping
TL;DR my stepbrother got in the way of my sister and the bus was waiting. Stepbrother is also annoying and autistic
