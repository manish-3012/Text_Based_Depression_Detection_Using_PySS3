My school ruined my poem So last year I submitted a love poem (disguised as a friendship poem) for the annual school magazine. Wrote the poem for the girl I like who happens to be my bestie too. 

The digital copy of the magazine was released a few weeks ago, so I went back to read my poem and I kid you not, TWO LINES GOT MERGED. YEAH.

What was once "Passing year after year without seeing your face" + (another line I can't recall) is now "Passing year after year, again a distress"

I can't express how pissed I am
