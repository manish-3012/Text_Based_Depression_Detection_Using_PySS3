I basically ruined a wall of electricity in our house In our kitchen the microwave and keurig (coffee machine) are plugged into same wall. I was trying to make a burrito while my mom made coffee and it just went out. Also turned off a couple other outlets. I feel like crap, how's everyone else's day.
