I feel like my parents are noticing my stupidity Growing up my sisters were always popular, prettier, and hung out with friends. One was cheer captain and the other homecoming queen and my little sister is so well know(Varsity for track and field). Meanwhile Iâ€™m neither of those things. I donâ€™t have friends. Iâ€™m not as pretty. Iâ€™m kinda like the runt. All people know me as is â€œsmartâ€. Well my sophomore year I decided â€œfuck itâ€ and got caught with a boy (cuddling). They found out I wasnâ€™t a virgin. My parents called me a whore and said I wasnâ€™t their daughter. Safe to say I never want to have sex again. Literally Iâ€™m genuinely turned off by the idea. Anyways my gpa went down. To a 3.29. My social skills shriveled up and died. I became severely sad. It was depression but I just couldnâ€™t stop crying. Anyways the other day all I had to do was answer what plus 1900 equals 2000. I immediately said 1000 and well thatâ€™s obviously wrong. My sister was like â€œI thought you were the smart one.â€ And then my dad asked how many people did his work (percentage) and I said 34% even though it was 65%. I feel like my family has just given up on me and I donâ€™t blame them. Iâ€™m stupid.
