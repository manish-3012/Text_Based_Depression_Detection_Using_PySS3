Hey losers I just wrote some song lyrics Mama sold your hand in marriage, _x000D_
And daddy didn't care, _x000D_
Little brother didn't know what to do, _x000D_
So he just sat there, _x000D_
While your life, _x000D_
While your future was being put in ruins_x000D_
_x000D_
I say:_x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
But some say that's wrong, _x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
Who we trusted all along_x000D_
_x000D_
Daddy says I must love a man, _x000D_
He must give me gifts, _x000D_
But I'm not allowed to love a woman, _x000D_
'Cause the whole world knows, _x000D_
That a person, _x000D_
Should never love in a homosexual way_x000D_
_x000D_
Who can it be harming, _x000D_
If I'm happy with my soulmate, _x000D_
Even if it's not the norm, _x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
For that's what love means, _x000D_
Because it's all, _x000D_
Just what the world has always told us, _x000D_
We just follow along with the beliefs of the past, _x000D_
But we shouldn't_x000D_
_x000D_
Hey!_x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
But some say that's wrong, _x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
Who we trusted all along, _x000D_
_x000D_
'Cause it's a commitment. _x000D_
Why should it be decided for us_x000D_
_x000D_
We should love who we love, _x000D_
We should love who we love

^these are the words. I wanna know what y'all think about them
