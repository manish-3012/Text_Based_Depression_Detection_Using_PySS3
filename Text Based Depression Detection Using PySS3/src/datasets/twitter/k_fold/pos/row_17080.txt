Me: â€œI donâ€™t really care about other peoples opinions of me.â€ Also me every single time I make a joke: *Oh god, was that funny enough? Was it funny at all? Are they gonna laugh? Oh god, oh fuck, theyâ€™re gonna hate me, everyone hates me, I have to leave, Iâ€™m moving to Tibet and becoming a monk, this single joke is going to ruin my entire social standing and by extent my entire life*
