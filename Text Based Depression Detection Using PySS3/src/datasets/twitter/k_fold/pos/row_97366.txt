I donâ€™t expect many people to see this but iâ€™ve just given my first award to someone and I couldnâ€™t feel better I recently logged onto a really old, neglected reddit account and I noticed I could give away a free award (the coins tab had a massive [FREE!] on it and I had 24 hours to give away the hug award). Me and my sister arenâ€™t on the best terms but we mutually share our interest for reddit. I gave her the award on reddit (her first!) and I kid you not her reaction was so wholesome. She texted me with a screenshot and that has probably made my night. Glad iâ€™m able to make her day, too, without her knowing it was me. This (fouryears-) is also an alternative account and she doesnâ€™t go through r/teenagers but on the off chance that she sees this, thanks for always sticking by my side even if i can be a bit lame :))
