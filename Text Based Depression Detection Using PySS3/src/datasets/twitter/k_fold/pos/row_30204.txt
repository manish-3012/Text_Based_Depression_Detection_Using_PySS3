My mother has me in her grip, help! Basicly I used to help my mother with everything I could, mainly home tasks. There wasn't anyone at home that could help her so I always agreed to make something instead of her.

The problem begins about two years ago. I started going to new school and I started growing up. I started focusing on the things that are important to me (friendships, passions, better grades), but my mother doesn't understand that I can't help her as usually i used to.

I want to mention that I have two older brothers where one of them absolutely helps with NOTHING and the second one never agreed to help so my mother don't even ask him.

The whole situation is way more complex but I don't really want to share so basily it all looks like:

My mother ask me to do something --&gt; I have to refuse because I already have a lot of my own tasks --&gt; she punishes me.

My mother never asks my brothers to help --&gt; they don't have to refuse --&gt; they don't get punished.

That's the grip I'm talking about. I'm sick of her constant bans and punishments that don't allow me to develop in what I love to do. What should I do to stop being used. Please help I'm looking for advices!
