Got called racist today because I said the word monkey near a black person Honestly this world is stupid. I canâ€™t even say monkey without being harassed by a group of white girls.
(For context, I was saying monkey because Iâ€™m bad at funny jokes so I just say the word monkey and hope my friend laughs)
