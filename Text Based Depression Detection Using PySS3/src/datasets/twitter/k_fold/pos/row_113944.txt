Holy shit I'm a horrible person My friend is super sensitive, she's had a bad childhood and so she's super afraid of ppl being angry at her/of disappointing ppl. Basically a r/raisedbynarcissists situation


Yet for some horrible sadistic reason I have an urge to press her buttons and to treat her in same shitty way her mother did oh my fucking god

I haven't yet but something makes me *really* want to but I think I'd fucking kill myself if I did
