Shower thoughts about a guy .

So there was this boy I used to be friends with. Around freshman year and middle school, he was always nice to me. We were actually friends. But, as we got older, he turned out more and more thuggish. 

Last year (junior year) and sophomore year heâ€™d always use me for homework. Heâ€™d take advantage of me because I am a nice and smart girl. He pressured me into sending him homework answers. We actually cheated in some classes on zoom together. He added me to snap group chats for cheating and we all sent each other answers. At that time we were friendly. 

One day during a biology lab session, since we were friendly at the time, I pretended to squirt him with an empty squirt needle thing. Then he said, â€œIâ€™m not afraid to put my hands on a womanâ€ to me. It made me so uncomfortable. 

However, he got even worse this year. On his Snapchat story, he posted that if he catches someone talking behind his back, heâ€™d â€œknock the shitâ€ out of them. Heâ€™d always write that caption with tik toks of people explaining the signs of fake friends. Heâ€™d even say heâ€™d unadd people who ask him why heâ€™d post this stuff. On our schools Instagram tea page, he said his favorite thing about school was being able to crack fake kids in the face. 

I just saw him walk down the street and thinking about him hurt me.
