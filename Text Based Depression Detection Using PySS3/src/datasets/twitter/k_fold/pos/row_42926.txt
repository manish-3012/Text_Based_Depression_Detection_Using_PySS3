I think there is something wrong with me. So today is my friends birthday and celebrated it this afternoon. Like 2pm because none of us have time to celebrate later. So we were about to take the picture. That's when we all removed our masks just to take the photo. Then my friend told me to smile for the picture. I swear to god I'm not joking, for that whole 5 minutes my brain and body forgot how to process and make a smile. I dont think this is normal, forgetting how to smile is not normal
