Today i lost my best friend. Yes i indeed lost my best friend. or like most people would call it 'a dog'.

i had to put him to sleep because he got paralyzed (which i dont wish anyone to see) from a hernia.

after some time i just photoshoped  him into heaven to know he would make it. take care my friend.

if someone is curious and please dont judge my bad photoshopping, i am not here for judgment. [https://imgur.com/a/za2fDG9](https://imgur.com/a/za2fDG9)
