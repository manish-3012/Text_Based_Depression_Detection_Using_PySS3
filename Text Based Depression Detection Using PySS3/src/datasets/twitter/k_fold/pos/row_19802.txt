I give up, this girl is too much for me Now she's not only glamorizing depression but also pretending like panik attacks are cute and quirky and not only in a private setting, no, in front of everyone she knows. I'm just gonna talk to her less until we're not friends anymore. I can't take her bullshit anymore. Everytime she says something like that I almost cry so I give up
