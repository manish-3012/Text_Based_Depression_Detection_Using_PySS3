I'm convinced I had the coronavirus But my test came back as negative. I don't think I did it right though. I had a really bad cough to the point where it was getting difficult to breathe and whenever I get a cough it's gone the next day but this lasted about 8 or 9 days. I was also really hot and had no conversation whatsoever. My smell was a little bit different I think but my taste was fine. Does anyone know how reliable the test is? They said 70% but they also said I'd get my results the next day when in reality it took 5.
