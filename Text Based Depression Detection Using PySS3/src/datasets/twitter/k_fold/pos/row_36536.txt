I've been feeling really demotivated lately. Soooo long story short, I saw a classmate of mine win a basketball tournament. He was sending snaps on snapchat of them screaming and celebrating and jumping around. And then - I got really sad.

I think its because I don't know if I'm ever gonna achieve something like that in my life (like we're both 16, but still, winning a baksetball tournament at 16 is kind of a big deal) Like because I don't play any type of sport  and I'm literally sitting in my house playing video games and wasting my summer and my life.

 And I got really sad when I saw their whole team just celebrating and jumping around, because their probably the best of friends while I'm here alone just doing nothing. Like I don't even wanna get up out of bed in the mornings. I feel sooo demotivated. I don't wanna do anything.

Can anyone help?

Has anyone felt the same and how did you get rid of this feeling?
