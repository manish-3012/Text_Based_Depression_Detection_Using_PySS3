What's gonna happen now? I feel too stressed out by school, and that's causing some of my grades to go down a lot. I got caught cheating (somehow) by using Photomath on a quiz. I just didn't wanna fail it because my grades can't afford it (even though I got a 0 for cheating lol). Anyways, now I have a referral and need to go to detention for about 2 hours. Never happened to me before today. To what extent will this affect my college applications and such?
