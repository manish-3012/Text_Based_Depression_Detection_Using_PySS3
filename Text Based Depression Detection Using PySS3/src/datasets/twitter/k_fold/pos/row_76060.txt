Lately I've become so disgusted with how fat I am I don't wanna eat anymore ðŸ˜“ I ate some sliced peaches today but I legit don't want anything else. I probably have like some sort of binge eating disorder cause that's usually what I feel like and when I eat food I just want to eat more. I'm so sick of it though I want to be skinny so bad.
