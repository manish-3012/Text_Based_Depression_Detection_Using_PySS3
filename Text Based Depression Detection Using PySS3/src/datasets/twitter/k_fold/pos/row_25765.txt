Final stances on NNN: Here, I have my final stance on NNN.

Participation: Not required, it's okay.

If you fail, do you have an addiction: It really depends on whether you already were doing it multiple times a day every day, or did it in moderation, and how far you made it into NNN if you tried it. There are too many factors, don't think failing can say anything for certain.

But I don't like NNN and others should know it: Ok, please take a break from Reddit, this stuff isn't gonna stop. I could swear I saw more posts about disliking NNN and disliking posts about failing than other posts about NNN.

Are you higher than others because you completed: Being deal here, good display of self control and stuff, you don't get to look down on others, though.

Is this about participating in DDD: No. It's not about going one month not horny to go one extremely horny.

Should you participate: Depends. It's a personal choice. All comes to what you think you should do.

Is NNN good or bad: No. It's whatever you make out of it. Some is good, some is bad. Just like social media. Just like the world.
