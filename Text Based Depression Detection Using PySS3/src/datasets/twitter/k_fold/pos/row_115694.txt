I self cured my (almost) porn addiction When I discovered porn a few years ago, I didnâ€™t watch it all too often. But in these past few months, Iâ€™ve really been struggling to stop watching it. It got to the point where I was taking riskier and riskier moves to watch it and jerk off. I was watching porn twice a day at the height, which was a few weeks ago, and I realized that this couldnâ€™t get out of hand.

My Grandma has a small gambling addiction (my grandpa keeps it under control tho) and I wondered if I could be more susceptible to it. I knew that this had to stop when I realized that masturbating didnâ€™t feel like anything to me anymore. It just felt empty, and I needed porn to masturbate every.

There were two things that helped me get through this. I was too scared to go to anyone, but I slowly stopped using porn as a means to masturbate, and slowly started taking breaks from masturbating as well. The other thing is the fact that my parents almost caught me a few times, and honestly the fact that they were definitely going to catch me if I kept going at the rate I did scared me.

Iâ€™m doing great now! I still watch porn, though infrequently, and jerk off, but I feel better whenever I do it now. I hope to anyone else thatâ€™s going through what I did can realize that this is a really unhealthy behavior, and quit it.
