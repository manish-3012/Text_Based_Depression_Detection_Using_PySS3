I'm either all in or all out and that's a terrible way to be. I've noticed a trend with myself. Either I care for someone with everything I have, or I don't give a damn what happens to them at all. I want to find that middle ground though, I want to be able to care for people but not be overbearing about it. I've only ever managed this with two girls, my two best friends.  It only works with them though because they're chill as fuck and extremely kind. Most people can't match their level of awesomeness in my experience with others.

I'll give an example, almost everything I send to anyone through text is at least a paragraph long, usually longer. When it's not, I don't care or want to be talking to that person. I want to be able to just send, idk maybe one sentence long texts but still care about the person.
