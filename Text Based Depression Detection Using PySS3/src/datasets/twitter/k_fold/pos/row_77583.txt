I keep having nightmares about gunshots I live in South Africa, (13, M) wich is a dangerous and voilent place. I am blessed to have everything that I have. So anyway. At night I keep hearing gunshots in the streets. It keeps me awake and gives me nightmares about losing my family. Sorry if this is not something you can give advice about...
