Doors are bad So I'm going to the Cleveland Clinic. I have an appointment about the disgusting amount of acne on my face. I go to this door and there is a horizontal handle. If there was a handle, your first instinct would be to pull, yes? But nooooo, this is actually a push door.

Not a big deal but doors are still fucking stupid.
