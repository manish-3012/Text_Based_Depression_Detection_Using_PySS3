In the midst of all the chaos of 2020, I just got hired! I've been searching for an apprenticeship for the last year and a half and today I finally received the best news I've heard all year. I'm going to be a Trainee Accountant and I start next week! To all the people out there still searching, good luck and don't give up! I did well over 100 applications over the past 18 months but remember, only one person needs to say yes. You've got this!
