I own tickets to a concert that never happened. In 2017, me, my dad, and my uncle, where going to the linkin park one more light consert. But we never got the chance because the lead singer, Chester benigton was found dead in his home. We got refunded for the tickets and to this day I still own them. The thing is I don't know how much they are worth.
