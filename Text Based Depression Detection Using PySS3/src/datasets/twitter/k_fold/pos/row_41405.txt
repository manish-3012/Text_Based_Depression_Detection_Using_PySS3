Are you for an academic freeze? And why? This was a debate question at my school and since this kinda affects us the most, Im putting the question and some points out there to see how everybody disagrees/agrees about this. Idk im genuinely curious.

If we do this, the govt will not have a sense of urgency to develop the vaccines cus class could always be extended plus teachers will lose their jobs and students will be discouraged to go to school anymore. But also this gives lower income families a chance to save up for school materials and gadgets for online learning the next schoolyear.

On the other hand if we dont do the freeze, then lots would suffer because some schools arent prepared to hand out modules and be able to sanitize them properly. As well as students will have a hard time getting connection or the stuff that they need because there was no leeway given to them. But some working students would be able to graduate early and get a job as soon as possible in order to provide for their parents who couldnt otherwise.

Thanks for reading and sharing!
