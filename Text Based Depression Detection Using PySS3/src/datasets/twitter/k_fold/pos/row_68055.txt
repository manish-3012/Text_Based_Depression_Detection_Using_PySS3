Going through with my new years resolution At the end of 2019, thinking about my new year resolution I said to myself "I dont want to be an introverted anymore, no shyness, I want to be more open, direct and extroverted".   
At the beginning of the year I changed to a vocational school with a focus on IT, where I knew nothing and no one and this was my chance, to become who I wanted to become now.

To help myself with that I always kept one thing in my head, if I was insecure about something or thought about something a bit too long just fucking do it.  
Having this phrase in mind helped me a lot at starting out to talk to others or start up a conversation, going on I always kept this sentence in my head about, just fucking do it and over the time I just let myself loose, when I had something in my head where I wasn't sure if I should say it I thought to myself just fuck it and got it out of my head, this got me a very big mouth which I love, I like to just get my words out there without many backthoughts and putting out one joke after the other out loudly.

Just letting myself loose, not thinking about things like, should I really do this? would people think of me different if I did this? really makes me feel a lot more comfortable around people and becoming so open and more extroverted now, makes me feel a lot more comfortable in myself
