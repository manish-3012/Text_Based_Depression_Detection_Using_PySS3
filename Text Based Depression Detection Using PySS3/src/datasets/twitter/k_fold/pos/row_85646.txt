I messed up Awhile back before covid-19, I had a girl in my theatre class . Turns out she was from Ukraine and had to go back after the year ended, man did I mess up. 

Let me give a little bit of backstory. So I'm in this theatre class for freshman year, just so I can get the credit and get it over with. I actually enjoyed the class and I want to be more involved with it possibly in the future, but who knows. in my class were a bunch nice people. sociable and not so sociable. I sat at a table in the front and that I dont what came over me. 

I seen this extremely beautiful girl walk into my class and I instantly thought my self. "wow.". later on in the year after getting to know everyone in the class this said person decided to join our table with  the other 2 guys, along with me. She was really funny  and nice to be around and overall my type of person. one day we had an assignment to go see a play for around 300 points. and we ended up sitting next to each other. she and I were making fun of the play the entire time and I again thought to myself "man you do something this is it dood."

here is my predicament. I didn't do anything and a few weeks later my grandfather passed so I missed class for a few days and she was gone. sent back to Ukraine. I wish I could've done and or said more. but now i'm stuck regretting my actions. 

we do talk from time to time and I eventually told her how I felt and she replied with "aww I wish I was still there." so I suppose that gave me a little hope. but who really knows. Now that I look back did I really mess up. I dunno why I'm even typing this I just wanted to get stuff off my head I suppose. if your reading this, thanks for reading I guess.
