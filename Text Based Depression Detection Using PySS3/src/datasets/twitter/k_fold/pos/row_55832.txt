Girls are unrealistic and don't care about men. Before you say "well that's not true!" let me explain.

Because of stigma (and in my opinion, movies), a lot of stuff is expected from men, while virtually nothing is expected from women. 

You see in most romance movies, men are expected to do everything to get and maintain a relationship with the woman.

Because most romance films are made by or for women, the man is basically every woman's fantasy (Muscular, unemotional, willing to give the girl everything and expect nothing in return, etc).

This creates an unrealistic expectation of men for women. And because a lot of women believe these expectations, they start applying them to the real world.

Because men like beautiful women and want a relationship, they don't care.

And now, instead of an unrealistic expectation, it's a reality.

Also, most girls don't want "a good man". They want someone to provide them with an easy lifestyle and resources. It's not that looking for a better life is a bad thing, but only being with a man because of his money and giving him your ASSets in return is a shitty thing to do.

And then when they leave him when he is at an all-time low, they don't give a fuck about him. But the second they see the man successful they get jealous and angry that they didn't stay with him. Fuck off.
