Finally understanding the feeling of "she deserves so much better" So there is this girl in my freshman class, and we have advisory together(just a half hour where we don't rlly do anything but talk) she's super cute and fun to talk to, and while writing this I'm getting texts from her, but there are some things holding me back. 1. She does have a current bf, which I don't wanna ruin that. I'd at least she break up with him before I rlly start trying to go for a relationship. 2. She's rlly cool, (I wouldn't say trendy but maybe a little) and my parents are hard-core fucking Christians, so if they saw her insta, or what she wears on occasion they might flip and I rlly don't want to drag her through either baratement from my parents or wearing something she doesn't want to. Her parents are also divorced which they rlly would think is wack. 3. I'm a complete asshole who plays videogames. She doesn't rlly play any, which is fine that doesn't bother me, but I just know that she deserves so much better than what I have to offer. I'm not rlly the nicest person to be around(partly due to my self hatred and suicidal thoughts, which again I don't want to drag her through) and I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to being a good bf. With my last gf, it ended after a month bc we had gotten into an argument because she thought I was shunning her at school. I wasn't, I just didn't know how to act when I saw her in the halls. It made me feel like shut, and made me realize I don't know what tf I'm actually doing. This girl though, is so amazing in every way, but just deserves so much better than me. 


It's kinda funny, I've seen posts like this a few months before I started being all dark and shit, but never rlly understood them and thought it sounded like someone just wanting a pitty party. Now I kinda understand what they were going through. Damn it sucks
