I think I might do it I think I might cut my wrist
Iâ€™ve done it before and will do it again
Iâ€™ve written way over a page of notes for anyone to read
Iâ€™m listening to my favourite songs I love
With nobody to talk to because nobody I know cares about me 
Lifeâ€™s cycle is horrible
Work from birth until your too old and sore and you can only stop if your lucky and have enough money
Wonâ€™t be me because I am not lucky enough
Been bullied all my life
Canâ€™t handle fucking milla rn
Stop harassing me babe
And my friends all donâ€™t like me anymore
