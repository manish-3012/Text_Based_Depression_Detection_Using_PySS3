I donâ€™t understand. Ok so this morning I walk into school and Iâ€™m just casually standing there, listening to my music. At one point I looked around and I could see my crush and his friends (who Iâ€™ve never spoken to before) look at me (my crush actually got on his tipi toes to look at me) talks, then one looked back.

Like what the f is going on? Why are they looking at me? What have I done? Was it because of the yolo story (which Iâ€™m never using that stupid app again) and someone said that â€˜I know U like girlsâ€™ and I replied back saying that no and that Iâ€™m straight? I only follow one person who was standing there on snap which is my crush.

Were they talking about the story or something? Because if it was it wouldâ€™ve been brought up my crush, and why would he talk about it? 

Maybe they werenâ€™t looking at me and were looking at someone else. But I did make eye contact with one of them.

Iâ€™m sorry I know this is stupid but Iâ€™m an over thinker and I really need to stop it.
