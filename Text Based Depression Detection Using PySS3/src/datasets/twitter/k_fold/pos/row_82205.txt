Got a decent project I need done, what should I do? This project was due this Tuesday and now it's late, what should I do? I need to be awake by 9 tommorow and it is 1:15 rn.

Option A-Stay up to finish the project, this may take up to an hour and a half. 

Option B-Wake up a 6am to get done and sneak the project in before he checks. 

Or suggest another idea below
