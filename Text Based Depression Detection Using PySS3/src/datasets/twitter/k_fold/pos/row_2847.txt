Would having a selfie of me as my discord pfp be too narcissistic? i got a hair cut a few days ago. it's been a really long time since i've felt comfortable looking at myself, so i decided to finally take a picture. now i'm planning on putting the pic as my pfp, but i don't know if my friends will think i'm narcissistic or something..
