My friends have a bet on me about getting a boyfriend Three years ago we were walking to school, and that day we were talking about relationships and stuff. I don't know how we ended this way, but the two friends that were with me decided to bet on me.

If I get a boyfriend before I turn 22 years old, friend A has to buy a pizza to friend B, the rest of our friend's group, me and the bf.

If I don't get a boyfriend before I turn 22, friend B owes friend A 40â‚¬ (which is around 40 dollars).

I never thought this bet would last, but I'm now 15 and friend A lives in another country and they are still keeping it. 

So, for my friend, my lonely heart and that pizza I will get a boyfriend before I turn 22, wish me luck.
