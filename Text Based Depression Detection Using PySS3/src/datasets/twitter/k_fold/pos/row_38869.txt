I'm on my screen too much, I need to change this. I currently have a problem that I'm on my screen for basically the entire day. My school is currently online so I'm on a computer for 6 hours, I watch youtube and scroll through social media for entertainment, my hobbies are coding and playing video games. I feel like everything I'm doing is on a screen but I have nothing else to do. I take walks but I can't walk an entire day. Any advice is appreciated. 

If this is the wrong place to post can someone redirect me to a different sub? I can't find a good place to ask advice for this.
