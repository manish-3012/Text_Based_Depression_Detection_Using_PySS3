Ok so hear me out You know how hair is supposed to protect your head from the cold or something? And pubes were supposed to protect your private parts from the cold probably? 

So what if we could get pube cuts? Theyâ€™re like haircuts but for pubes. Imagine going up to someone and being like â€œI just got the the newest style of pube cut, itâ€™s now dinosaur shapedâ€
