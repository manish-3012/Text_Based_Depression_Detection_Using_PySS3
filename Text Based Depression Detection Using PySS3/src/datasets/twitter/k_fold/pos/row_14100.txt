My school anti-abortion club still hasnâ€™t been shut down even when someone made fun of a girl who got raped in front of the principal. So pretty much my high school has this anti-abortion club that is just so fucking stupid. They preach about how ever life is a life no matter what. This group of students showed up to protest this club (the club has their meetings after school) because theyâ€™ve said horrid things.

People in this club unironically said â€œif a girl gets raped she should have the baby no matter what because itâ€™s predetermined and the father should have a sayâ€. These students got extremely mad when that was said. This one girl got very emotional and talked about her experience being raped and how itâ€™s disgusting to say that, and some guy said â€œcrying about it wonâ€™t unrape youâ€. The principal was in front of him. The principal fucking chuckled and cracked a smile. WHAT. THE. FUCK.
