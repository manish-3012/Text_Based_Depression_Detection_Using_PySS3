Alright I think itâ€™s story time. When I was 12 I was invited to a birthday party of a friend. A lot of people who I knew went there. It was in a climb park ( you had a safety vest on and you climbed on different stuff there was also a parcour in the air). We did the parcour first it was a very long parcour about 2 hours long. In those 2 hours there was absolutely no way to get down to the ground. Suddenly an half hour in I had to shit really badly. I tried to hold it in, I runned for my life, nothing worked. On that fateful day I shit my pants. I still had to continue the parcour for an half hour with shit in my pants. Still the worst day of my life.
