Inexpensive gift ideas? Since thereâ€™s talk of yet another lockdown Iâ€™d like to get my niece (13/8th grade) and nephew (16/sophomore) something small to make them smile. I feel so sad for all of you trying to get by with virtual and hybrid school, it has to be really difficult. Anyway, I was thinking about giving them each a little gift box just because, with $20 and some small items like maybe a king sized candy or Rice Krispie treat, and then something for their mental health?? Any suggestions on things you actually use, want, or enjoy during this hard time? Nothing mentioned is set in stone so feel free to mention whatever comes to mind... thank you

PS. I know it might seem lame and it isnâ€™t much, but itâ€™s all I can give.
