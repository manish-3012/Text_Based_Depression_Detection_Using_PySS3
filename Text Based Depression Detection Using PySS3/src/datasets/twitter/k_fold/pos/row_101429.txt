I get this seems like the wrong sub but does anyone know what's wrong with my headphones? My headphones (Taotronics 85) right ear just died and it seems like it's not " broken " just not working and the only reason I'm posting here is because my parents would be pretty pissed if I asked them to take to some place and fix it. Again I know I'm talking to teenagers but please if you know what going on pls tell me
