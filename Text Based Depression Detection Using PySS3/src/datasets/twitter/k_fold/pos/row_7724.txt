My crush on my best friend has sent me into a depressed frenzy and i want to die over it I don't even know where to begin. My life up to this point has been worse and worse, I've had a crush on my best friend for ages and i know she doesn't like me back. it seems like she downright hates me. but i have to keep trying because "it'll happen someday" 

The way this has effected me is beyond words. I've had constant suicidal thoughts, I've started self harming over it, i feel like there's no hope for anything. I've been open to her about how i feel and all its doing is making her feel like I'm controlling her emotions. I've told her constantly that those aren't my intentions, yet it still feels I'm doing that exact same thing. Then again she's started talking to this other guy and they're doing well, I've talked to him and he seems like a really nice and genuine guy, I think she deserves him, but i also feel like i should be with her. 

We're all in an Instagram group chat and the more the guy flirted with her the more i felt jealous and angry over him. i know that she's worth nothing in the end, but i feel like she's the only person who can help me through everything. 

i decided I'd come to this sub hoping at least one person could help me here. you all are around the same age as me so i thought you wouldn't write me off as being some attention seeking brat like my parents do. i don't want to get into my parents but I'll just say that they're very overprotective and they try to associate themselves with everything i do. also they don't care about me at all and just worry about saving money and their jobs.
