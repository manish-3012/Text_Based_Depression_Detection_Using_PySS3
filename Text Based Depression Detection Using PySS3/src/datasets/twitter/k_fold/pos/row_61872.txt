I need advice about a possible girlfriend (i am also a girl) So I recently entered a boarding art high school and very quickly became good friends with this girl. It started with me asking for her pronouns because she was listening to queer music, and she later told me she was bi (I'm a lesbian). We go to school only once a week for pandemic reasons, and we hang out together when we do. We also go to an art lesson once a week together.

After our last lesson, we went into a shop, bought spray paint, and painted biblically accurate angels in an abandoned hospital while we are ice cream.

And 2 weeks before that, we ditched class and went to the construction site next to our school. It's a gigantic building that seems to be mostly done, half the lights turn on and it has ever long and dark corridors, I think is going to be an elderly house. We hanged around in there, talking about how creepy it was.

And I am crushing hard on someone, for the first time. I keep telling her "I really like to hang out with you" and she says the same, and I feel like I'm getting the Teenage Experienceâ„¢ when I'm with her.

She is my only friend in HS so if I fuck this up I will be alone for the next 3 years.

What do I do?
