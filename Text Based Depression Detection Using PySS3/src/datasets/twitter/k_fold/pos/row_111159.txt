Idk why but there's always that one guy who over analyses everything about a post. He carefully looks at the wording and looks at when things are mentioned, he always over analyses every single sentence, he always tries to comment on why your wrong on a specific thing and sometimes will make you look bad more often than not, always make you feel dumb and they usually get top comment and anything to redeem yourself gets downvoted to oblivion.

So it just makes me spend more time on a post to make sure it's as inoffensive as possible when I just want to post it.

Also worst part is when they don't reply to your comment and you just feel worse.
