The day my friend brought a GUN to school So, this happened when I was 17, the guy(18M) I'm talking about was not my friend at the time....actually he had no friends, my other classmates used to make fun of him, because he had a slightly below average IQ,he was a simpleton....or so everyone thought.....he used to sit behind me so,I used to have a few conversations with him in a day . One day I noticed that he was looking weird, like he was watching his classmates weirdly as if he was thinking of doing something also,he kept checking his bag from time to time. That day, he had been teased by a few guys,so I thought it might be about that. I asked him if there was a problem,he took me to a secluded corner of the classroom and told me in fearful tones" I have a gun in my bag"....I was shocked to say the least, my first thought was that he was lying,but I had noticed him being weirdand checking his bag, I told him to prove it and in lunch break he took me outside and lo,behold....there was a gun in his hand....now I asked him calmly(even tho I was panicking inside) what was he trying to do with a gun.he just said nothing.....i told him to keep his gun hidden, I could have gone to the teachers but he reminded me of my brother who also was simple-minded. I knew if he had wanted to,he could have shot us,so I kept quiet about this for the whole day . Next day, he came to me and thanked me for not telling the teachers, in return I introduced him to some of my friends and told him to not do anything as foolish from today onwards...I know I did the right thing because he was just a simple fool who didn't know the consequences of his actions and if I had complained ,it would have ruined his life
