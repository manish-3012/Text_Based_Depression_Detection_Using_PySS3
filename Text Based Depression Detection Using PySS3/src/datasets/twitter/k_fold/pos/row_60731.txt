I think I have a problem. I got an anger management issue and that makes me a generally unlikable person to be around and thatâ€™s fine and all but the rest of family has no anger at all and it makes me look like a crazy person even when I make a reasonable point and I hate everything. I canâ€™t do nothin right and itâ€™s ruining my life. 

Sorry for talking about my problems Iâ€™m gonna go to bed now and be back here tomorrow.
