How do you motivate yourself to get back up after some type of disappointment I (18), had this test at school and I had spent days studying for it. And I was really hoping to do well in it. Well, it turns out that everything that went wrong, went wrong. I made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test, I feel like such a complete dumbass. I feel like I have been kicked in the balls and it really hurts.

It really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. I this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when I know I am not. I work hard, I am committed and I invest a lot of my time and energy into my academics. It just really sucks that this type of thing can happen from time to time. And when it does, I begin to feel like I am less than or something. I have been told in the past by my sister that I should just calm down and stop overreacting. But setbacks like this sometimes leave so dejected that I just don't see the Pont of putting in the grind anymore. I have goals and I know I can achieve them. But I just sucks when you look so dumb sometimes.

I was just wondering if anyone has had this feeling or is it just me needing attention.
