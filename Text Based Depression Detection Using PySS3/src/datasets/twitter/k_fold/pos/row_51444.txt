Just realized that the email I sent to my teacher seemed kinda rude So basically, I forgot about a big-ish assignment thatâ€™s due Friday night. I thought that on Thursday night I could complete it in time.

#i could not , and now Iâ€™m very tired

With some stuff happening after school on Friday, I would have little free time and little energy to finish the assignment. It was kinda possible, but not very feasible (probably not the best use of those words but Iâ€™m TIRED ok) 

So I email my teacher if I can submit it on Saturday (or Sunday, if itâ€™s gonna be super high-quality or something) but only now have I realized I was just complaining about how it would affect my sleep a little. I didnâ€™t add a little â€˜thanks for consideringâ€™ at the end. I DIDNT EVEN SAY PLEASE. All it ended with was basically: â€œI want you to let me submit on Saturday or Sunday because it would be the most convenient for meâ€. 

#guess I know what Iâ€™ll be doing Friday night...
