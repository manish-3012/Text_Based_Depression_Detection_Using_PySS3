Learning to say 'No' will be one of the most important life skills you will ever learn I'm not sure if I have to be a teen to post on this sub.I'm not, but I just wanted to let you all know that one of the things I wish I had learnt early on was that I should say no more often. Learn to accept no from otherS but also learn to say no. Don't be afraid of rejection because it's bound to happen; Don't be afraid to say no because so many people are unkind to your kindness, which is why people will take your kindness for weakness.
