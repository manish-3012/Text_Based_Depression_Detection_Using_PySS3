Ok some imma rant on dumbasses defacing confederate statues, hear me out don't just start raging and calling me a racist Ok so you want to hear me out, i think its stupid for people to be destroying statues of Confederate soldiers and that's because we should embrace our history. Have them as a landmark to show that fuckers like this wont ever reign again and we will never become what we used to be! In every country some bad shit has happened and we shouldn't just cover it up, it should be brought to light and show that we are now reasonable good people who don't want to let this shit stand! People who find the statues offensive should indeed look upon them in disgust and hope and strive to be better. They shouldn't look at the statues as something that should be destroyed because it promotes some slaver, it should be looked at with the ability to say i will not be like him, i believe that these men are horrible and should rot in hell but we can not be rid of their memory!
