I was bitten ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± by a radioactiveâ˜¢ spiderðŸ•· and for ten years Iâ€™ve been ðŸ‘€the one and only Spider-ManðŸ•¸ðŸ‘¨. Iâ€™m pretty sure you knowðŸ¥´ the rest.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜

I saved ðŸ¥µa bunch of peopleðŸ‘­ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘¬, fell in loveðŸ’â¤ï¸, saved the cityðŸ˜œ, and then I saved the cityðŸ¥ðŸ¬ again and againðŸ™„ and againðŸ™„. And uh... I did this...ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•ºwe donâ€™t really talk about this.ðŸ‘ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘

Look, Iâ€™m a comic bookðŸ“˜ðŸ“™, Iâ€™m a cerealðŸ¥£, did a Christmas albumðŸŽ„ðŸŽ¤. I have an excellent theme songðŸŽ·ðŸŽºðŸŽ¹.And a so-so popsicleðŸ¡. I mean, Iâ€™ve looked worseðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®. But after everything, I still love being Spider-ManðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”. I mean, who wouldnâ€™t?ðŸ¤¨ So no matter how many hitsðŸ¤•ðŸ¤• I take, I always find ðŸ˜¼a way to come backðŸ’ªðŸ˜¤. Because the only thing standingðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© between this cityðŸ™ðŸŒ and oblivionðŸ•³ðŸŒŒ is me.ðŸ™ƒ Thereâ€™s only oneðŸ‘† Spider-Man.ðŸ•¸ðŸ‘¨
