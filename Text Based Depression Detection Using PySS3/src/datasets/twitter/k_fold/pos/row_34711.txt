Well hey there Reddit Well a couple months ago I got my first girlfriend. The past months have been amazing and Iâ€™ve never been happier. But yesterday was, not to fun. She told me to join discord which I got really happy about since we played Minecraft together a lot. But thatâ€™s when she said those horrible words, â€œIâ€™m going to give it to you straight, Iâ€™m a lesbianâ€. Now, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING LGBTQ+. Itâ€™s just that this kind of stings. This was my first girlfriend and I thought things were going really well but I guess not. I asked her how she realized and the explanation is as follows. 

â€œi mean it was a slow process but basically in November i had basically privately decided that i wasnt really interested in dating men and then you came along and I was like â€œok nvm thenâ€ but like after a while i just started feeling like something was off, like I had every reason to be happy in our relationship and something was just missing, and then I was talking to one of my other friends, who is a lesbian, and we started talking about how they ended up realizing and suddenly it just clicked, I found what was missingâ€ 

I really just need advice on how to deal since this really fucking sucks ngl.
