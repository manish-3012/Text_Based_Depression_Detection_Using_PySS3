i fucked up so, a few days ago my really good friend, weâ€™ll call her jessica, told me that she had a crush on her, and asked me to be her gf. i said yes, i had that feeling that i liked her, and said yes. tomorrow comes, and we go to the park together. itâ€™s pretty awkward, and i realize that i donâ€™t reciprocate the feeling. at all. i hide it, we hang out, and i go home. i canâ€™t ask my parents because theyâ€™re homophobes, and i donâ€™t want to upset her but i think our friendship is going to fall apart if this keeps going on. i know that iâ€™m kinda being a dick here, but i donâ€™t know what to do here
