I hate being me so badly I'm so alone and people always say I'll find someone in the future but I have these problems now and everyday seems to take to long, I wanna be happy now and I just can't do it. "The future" Isn't a place in time, I wanna know how long I have to bare this shit before I don't have to anymore.
