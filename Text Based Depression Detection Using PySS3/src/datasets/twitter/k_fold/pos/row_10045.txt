Someone told me I shouldnâ€™t have kids I donâ€™t know how to post this without sounding weird but I told someone a biological statistic about myself and they said it wasnâ€™t anatomically possible and that they study anatomy. And after I convinced them the truth they said I was a phenomenon and that I shouldnâ€™t reproduce. This made me cry a little. I do not know what to add but I feel hurt, I was blessed with a good trait and Iâ€™m being called out! An no, itâ€™s not that I â€œhave a big dickâ€ because I donâ€™t think I do at all. Itâ€™s something else.
