the end of adolescence? ok so basically in my country the majority is 18 years old and i will have them in october and i really felt like i had no teenage no party no first love no friends i was rocked by the teeb movies and I had an idea that adolescence was the best time of life and I feel like I have passed by.

am I the only one in this case ?
