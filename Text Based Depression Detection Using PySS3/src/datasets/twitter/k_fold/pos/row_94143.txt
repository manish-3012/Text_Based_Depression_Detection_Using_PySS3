You try being nice to someone and they just throw it back at you! [Iâ€™m talking about this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ityw4j/i_used_to_be_a_bully_but_i_wanna_make_reparations/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) so I tried opening up to this kid, turns out heâ€™s a fucking asshole, he thinks screaming is funny and putting up the middle finger is cool. The mother fucker superglued a kids pen to a block of wood, mind you that this was his only pen and he cannot borrow anyone elseâ€™s (he got his ass kicked by that persons mates after). During maths today, I was having a laugh with a few people, nothing to do with him, he decided to mimic what I was saying after I showed him some empathy, I told him to stop because I can get I bit violent when insulted luckily it only took a bit of yelling to get him to stop. The way he talks as well, so God damn lifeless, like bro, do you even give a shit about the conversation weâ€™re having? Maybe there is a reason why heâ€™s bullied.
