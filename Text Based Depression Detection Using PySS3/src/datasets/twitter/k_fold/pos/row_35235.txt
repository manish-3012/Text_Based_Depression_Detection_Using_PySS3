My sister's sim just got told to die in a fire Ok so basically one of my sister's Sims was sending chain mails to a bunch of people. She got responses about being in big trouble, but one really stood out. A Sim by the name of Vincent Christianson said "Four word. Die. In. A. Fire"


I had no idea Sims could get in such heated conversations lmao
