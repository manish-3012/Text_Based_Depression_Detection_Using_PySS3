I am so proud of my boyfriend! We have been dating for 6 months now, and every day he never fails to make me smile. But honestly, Iâ€™m so proud of his hard work. Especially towards his band. You should hear how amazing he is on guitar! His bandâ€™s latest song has 1.7k views and it may not seem much to some but for a new band working their absolute hardest, I am honestly so proud and so lucky to be with him. Heâ€™s so handsome too, that punk motherfucker. Heâ€™s releasing a new song Sunday, I hope it gets so many views and likes, he deserves it! 
His band is called Rats On Acid, if you wanted to help support them!
