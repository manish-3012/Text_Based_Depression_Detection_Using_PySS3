It's only 12.47pm, I'm up early on a Sunday, what a perfect day to just read manga all day. Bummer I need to write an essay, do homework, study, finish a drawing and all that on a half dead brain because I didn't sleep at all last night.  


And of course I'm wasting time on reddit now making this post.
