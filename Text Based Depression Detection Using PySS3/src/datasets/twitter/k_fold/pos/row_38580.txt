So I'm proud by a ton right now So I play baseball, I play as a pitcher and I'm a skinny guy that doesn't seem like a sports guy at all. Everyone is always surprised to hear i do. I play my first game on my team. I was a substitute. The starting pitcher let 17 runs go by in 2 innings. I was frustrated. Then I was subbed in. I played a perfect inning. 3 strikeouts in a row. GOD I WAS ECSTATIC. Oh that felt good. I'm so proud of that. It just feels good to be like an underdog and just prove that I'm actually good.
