My quality of life had improved greatly In the past few months iâ€™ve improved my shitty life far more than i ever thought i would. Iâ€™ve obtained medication for the hallucinations iâ€™ve heard and seen for years. I started improving my body and working out. My grades are slowly increasing. I made new friends who support and understand me for who i am. And best of all, I met the love of my life.

I guess what iâ€™m trying to say is, donâ€™t give up hope. You can do the same, you can change for the better. You have a part, and if you see that, you can be whoever you want to be.
