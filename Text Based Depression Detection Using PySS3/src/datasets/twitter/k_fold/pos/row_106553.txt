How petscop made my mom give me an Ace of Bace CD (First of all, sorry for my horrible english, I'm from Mexico lol) 

Basically, Petscop is a fictional game made for the ps1, but if you want to know more about it, go to r/Petscop

Okay, now onto the main thing, on Petscop 21, people found out that it syncs perfectly to ''The sign'' By Ace of Base, and I listened to the song and I loved it (Typing this while listening to it lol) and my mom, somehow, saw me listening to it, and one day, while she was cleaning the attic, she found three  CD's, and one of them was from Ace of Bace (Happy Nation, to be specific) and she gave me the CD, and I was like okay?... (When she gave it to me I forgot who was Ace of Base lol) And then she says "Beacuse you like them, I heared you listening to them once" and then I saw on the tracklist "The sign" and then, realization came in, listened to it and totally loved the album, specially "Living in danger".

So anyways, thanks for reading my TED talk and sorry if I caused you a massive confusion with my english lol, peace out.
