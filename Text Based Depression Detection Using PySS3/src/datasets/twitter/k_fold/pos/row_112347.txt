Took a trip to Egypt last year with my grandpa It was really cool! I met a lot of friends along the way. There was a Japanese boy around the same age as me. While we were traveling we also invited a fortune teller and a cool French guy to join our group. I think the Frenchmanâ€™s name was Pole or something like that. Anyway, he taught us how to fight with swords at that was pretty cool. There was also this interesting mansion with fog coming out of it. All in all, I think the trip was great!
