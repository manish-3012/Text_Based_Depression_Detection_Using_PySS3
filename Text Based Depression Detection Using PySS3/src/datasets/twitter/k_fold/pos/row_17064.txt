I want to be more productive. College apps and shit have been taking a lot out of me. I haven't been talking to a lot of people. I find it hard to get homework done. I get it done, but I feel really scared because I am a big ass procrastinator and I am afraid that I won't be able to improve my art enough. I also smoke weed a lot, but I don't want that to be an issue. I want to enjoy it, but I feel like its been harder to be responsible with it; It's a crutch right now. Might switch to nicotine since my eighteenth birthday is tomorrow. Maybe I have been feeling like this because I was in a mind fuck of a relationship about a year ago that made me feel shitty about myself. I'm good, but I always feel like I could be doing more. Also, I get really mad at home sometimes. **burps**
