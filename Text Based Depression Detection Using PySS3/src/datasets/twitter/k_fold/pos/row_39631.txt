â€œWeâ€™re in this togetherâ€ they said  Hereâ€™s  double the work, half the time, and 6 hours of useless zoom lectures,  to waste even more of your day.  Seriously, idek why I even go to the  zoom meetings.  I would learn more jerking off and playing CSGO than I  do during a â€œlectureâ€.

Oh, and you  have hobbies you want to enjoy?  Too bad.  Socially distancing from  people IRL isnâ€™t enough, you should be socially distancing from discord  to study instead too.  Fuck that, work from 8am to midnight with breaks  only for porn, short walks, bathroom, and coffee.  Enjoy your McFuggin C-, because the material isnâ€™t there in your study guide.

Anyhow,  time for me to spend 3 days without grading assignments, while I sit on my fat ass posting updates on how â€œhard it is for all of usâ€.

I  canâ€™t stand those assholes, at every turn they fuck over everybody.   Every time I converse with any friend on discord, the words â€œI want to  fucking dieâ€ almost always get said.  Nobody gets enough sleep, exercise, or socializing.
