I knew I was onto something when I looked at my life So for a while, I've had a lot of symptoms of depression and I was feeling depressed a lot, to the point of me having suicidal thoughts and actions. Recently, me and my mom went to a doctor and got me a therapist. Well today we just got a letter in the mail with my diagnosis. I have severe depression apparently. Not sure what to do with this information but now I have to see a therapist every day, and I'm on suicide watch now. On the bright side I passed my english test on a book I didnt read.

Edit: I apparently posted this 3 times.... how the fuck I did it, I don't know
