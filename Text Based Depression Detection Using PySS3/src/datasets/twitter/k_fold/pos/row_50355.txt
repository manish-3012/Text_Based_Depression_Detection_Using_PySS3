Reasons why I haven't killed myself throughout the years: 1-6- didn't really think about it

7-10- mum would be sad (also apparently it was a sin and I didn't want to go to hell)

10-12- cats would be sad

12-14- had braces and didn't want an "ugly corpse"

15- If I died now my grave would have male pronouns and names on it
