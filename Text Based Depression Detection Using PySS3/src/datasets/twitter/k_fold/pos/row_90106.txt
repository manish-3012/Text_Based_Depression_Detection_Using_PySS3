When you talk with redditors about how to get mental help and talk with your mom about it the she immediately says your doing it for pity and blaming everyone else even though she seemed open to the idea. Then says if we see a therapist theyâ€™d think Iâ€™m crazy. Boy do I enjoy being told Iâ€™m crazy when I kinda hate myself rn. Fuck me.
