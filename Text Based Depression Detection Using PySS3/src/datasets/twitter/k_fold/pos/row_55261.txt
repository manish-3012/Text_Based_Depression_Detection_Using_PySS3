Wt I did tdy I'm jst sitting on the bare ground ,looking at the stars and skies. I wrote a poem , bad poem ,bt still poem. I sang , meaningless hums and songs, bt I sang. Bcs no one would judge me , not the stars not the skies. Me , who is scared of worms and snakes , me who doesn't go out without a shoe , sat on the bare ground with bare legs.

I think I'm happy 

I'll probly regret this. Bt I'm too drunk ( on happiness or wtvr this is ) to care.
