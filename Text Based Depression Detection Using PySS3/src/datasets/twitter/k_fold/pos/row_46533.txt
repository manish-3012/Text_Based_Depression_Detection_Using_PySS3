My dad and I had a talk about college So I've been excited about college since I was ten.

Ever since I can remember, I've worked and worked to get into college, whether thats doing scouting, getting good grades, or being part of as many clubs as I can, I've always worked for a well-rounded resume. Im a senior in high school now, and my dad says I'll be able to get into any college I want, which is reasonable, but as it gets closer, I'm terrified.

Im sure a lot of y'all can relate to this, but for the past year or two I've had a list of five-ish colleges that i've had my eyes on. This list doesnt seem to ever be enough, though. My dad is pressuring me on finding more colleges and is saying that where ever I go will probably be for the rest of my life. Its super intimidating and I'm just super stressed.

Ive also had denying thoughts on my major. I know a lot of people change their majors, but since I was little I've wanted to go into astronomy, but now I want to go into computer science, and now that college is getting closer, I dont even know if THATS what I want to do for the rest of my life.

Now im frantically searching for colleges to put on a list to make my dad feel better about me, wish me luck.

Anyone else going through this?
