These past few days have been sooo unlucky for me So many things went wrong that I am starting to wonder if a meteor will fall on my head next.
On 18th, a stray cat scratched me and we had to go to the hospital to get rabies shot
On 19th, I cut my arm on a rusty iron rope and thought I might get tetanus for a few days
On 25th, I noticed a little gland on my neck and it caused me some ache 
On 27th, I went to the hospital  to get that gland checked and a bug flew into my eye and bit inside of my eyelid
On 27th, evenning, I managed to make the whole house's power to go out while installing new led lights I had gotten on my birthday. 
I may not be THE unluckiest person on Earth but these last few days has made me feel as if someone cursed me with bad luck or something
