so I want to go out... but my parents won't let me....I've been inside my very small house since march.... I have strict parents so its very hard to convince them. another problem is that they have never let me out before. Like ever. I wouldn't mind having life 360 even. but honestly....

I want to go out to see my uhh "friend". I started talking to her around July ish and I really like her. and she really likes me.. we aren't dating. but we will the moment we see each other. she is my first and idk...I just really want to get out. any advice...
