i want to try twitch streaming iâ€™m planning on saving up for a pc once we move houses if we do. i really want to try streaming and maybe doing videos. i dunno. wanted to talk about it to someone other than my one friend lol. if i do it, iâ€™m doing it faceless because âœ¨anxietyâœ¨


(would yâ€™all watch some random nonbinary person play minecraft survival for the hell of it? bonus points because i donâ€™t actually know a ton of minecraft stuff despite playing it everyday? lol)
