I just want a nice room It sounds stupid but I canâ€™t stop thinking about how I want my room to look and Iâ€™ve been buying all this shit and it still feels so empty. I heard people go â€œa personâ€™s room can tell a lot about a personâ€ then I looked around at my room and it wasnâ€™t something that was me if you get what Iâ€™m saying. Anyways my biggest goal rn is to have a cozy room with plants and lights. I just want it to feel less empty and boring
