My s.o is going through some hard times rn and I don't know how to help them They're seriously depressed to the point that it's hard for them to feel emotion. I have tried to get them to ask their parents but they think that they're fine and they don't care what happens to them. I want to support them and make them happy but I don't know how. I'm really lost and I just want them to be happy again. If you have any more questions please ask. I just need help.
