Were me and my brothers right in this situation It all started with my brothers and I at a friendâ€™s house, everything was normal until we got later in the day.
This is where the problem star, our friendâ€™s cat got stuck in the tree. So we went to try to save it. We tried everything in this situation, shaking cat so it could come down, calling itâ€™s name a lot and all that. 
The cat didnâ€™t bother to come down, it was stuck. So after like 20 minutes later my mom came to pick my brothers and I  up to take us home. She also noticed the cat stuck but did nothing. 
On the car ride home our mom starts screaming at us because we were getting into problems that had to do nothing with us. She kept saying the cat wasnâ€™t ours so it doesnâ€™t matter. Of course we argued back.
This argument was going through the whole ride home. Mom kept screaming â€œitâ€™s not our cat it doesnâ€™t matter, itâ€™ll get down by itself, donâ€™t get into problems that doesnâ€™t include you in it.â€
We argued back that we wanted to be good people and help out and SHE WASNâ€™T HAVING IT. Once we got home everything just basically stopped, my brothers and I were pissed.
How could our mom not teach us to not help out in situations where people/things needed help? 
Were we right for helping out? Or we shouldâ€™ve let the our friendâ€™s cat in the tree?
