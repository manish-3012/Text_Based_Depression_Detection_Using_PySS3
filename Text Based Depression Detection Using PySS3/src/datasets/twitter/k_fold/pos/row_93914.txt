Just needed to get this off my chest to feel better So the last few months have been tough. Like Honestly Just really bad. I lost my father to suicide after christmas in 2019. Shit was rough for a while cant even begin to imagine how my mom feels. Ive been trying to just distract myself from the everything he left behind but its a process you know. Its been 6 months and I really miss you dad. He was the only father i ever knew and the only one i will ever love to be honest. I looked through old facebook messages and texts from a year ago and boy did it hurt to read but it kinda made me smile you know in that funny but kinda sad way. I think about him every day, and it never gets easier. He was a drug addict for a very very long time and i always hated him for that but i never stopped to think how he felt tbh. How  hard he fought addiction and how hard it must have been for him to let us down to never truly be able to win until the very end. I always miss his goofy grins and his terrible jokes and his little old knick knacks he used to collect he really liked old toys and books. I still have all the gifts he ever gave me no matter how dumb they were at the time. He was a great father and an even better man. He taught me alot about growing up always looked out and cared for us even when i didnt realize it. I was to absorbed into my own stuff to really spend time with him, and i regret every second of it. Moral of the story is please dont let time go by even if you are teen like me cherish every moment with your friends and family because you never truly realize what youve lost till its gone. I swear its all true and i mean every word. Believe it or dont just please cherish your time on earth with the people you care about. I can answer question or talk. I doubt any one will see this but it felt good to get it off my chest
