how's school going for everyone? i started school onsite like 2 months ago. i want to STRANGLE MYSELF this week bc i had a big final grade essay to write (finished it, thank god), an ap world test tomorrow, a science test on friday, an english test on friday, and an ag test today

i HAD all a's, but i forgot to turn something in for ag and now i have an 83 ;(. i couldn't even turn it in yesterday bc my teacher wasn't there

i havent had any time to actually study for my ap world test so pray for me tomorrow D;
