How to meet people over quarantine Ever since before quarantine Iâ€™ve been trying to meet people, and make new friends, and possibly find a relationship, and quarantine totally put that on hold for me, and many others Iâ€™m sure. But, it was already hard enough on my search for girls pre-quarantine, and now itâ€™s even slower. Iâ€™m not desperate for a girlfriend, as I made the mistake of moving too fast with my first gf, and I realize now I really donâ€™t agree with her as a person. But getting a gf is still something i really want to do, especially since my best friend has been spending time with his gf so I feel lonely for the first time since I met him. Doesnâ€™t help that some of my other friends are drifting away. Basically my point is that my inability to reach out and make friends is kinda the worst. Not to mention I donâ€™t even really know where to begin looking to make new friends and find new girls, and I was curious if anyone here had any positive experiences in certain places or suggestions on where to meet people online. Thanks in advance!

On another note, Iâ€™ve been lurking in this sub for quite a while, so I may be being a bit too stiff in my post, but I didnâ€™t know where else to go to ask because of my age, so its nice to say hi for once!
