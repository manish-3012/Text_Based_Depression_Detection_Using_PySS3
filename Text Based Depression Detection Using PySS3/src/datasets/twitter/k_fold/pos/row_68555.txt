Can I have some advice? There's a TD;LR at the end btw Heyyyy guys. What's up? I have a question that I need some advice on because I can't decide myself. Ok so should I tell my friend that my mom won't let me go to her house? Or should I just avoid her house in general. Like if she wants to hangout should I just be like, "Oh we should hangout at the park or at my house." But then I think she would get suspicious... Btw the reason I can't go is because of my mom. She doesn't want me going to a man's house. Because he hasn't been with a woman for months, and he might be a pervert. She also asked me if I was dating him!! Like bruh, no. He's gay and I rather date a girl. My age too!!! Like seriously. Is she dumb? But I can't tell her that he's gay because then she will be like, you can't hangout with her anymore. Now I know where you get these crazy ideas from. Because one time I talked about the difference between sexual and romantic attraction. But that was a bad idea. But you know what was even worse? I told her I wasn't religious and then I got grounded. Lolll. But that was a while ago. Anyways what do you think? Should I tell her? I don't want to offend her or her dad because they're both amazing people! Also if I tell her she might tell her dad or someone else. And then my mom would probably find out and then I would die. Lol. Sorry this is so long. 

TL;DR I can't hangout at my friend's house because my mom thinks her dad is a pervert.
