Honestly Fuck My life The build up for my first ever PC build was long as shit , nearly a entire year of planning, discussion, research and saving up went into this moment , I unbox all my parts getting more and more hyped , my friends are in a call with me , hyped that I'll be able to game on a better PC than my shitty old dell , 

What do I find when I open the case box?

A massive fist sized dent in the side of the case

Now the seller is going to take ages for an replacement unless I buy a new case

Kill me.
