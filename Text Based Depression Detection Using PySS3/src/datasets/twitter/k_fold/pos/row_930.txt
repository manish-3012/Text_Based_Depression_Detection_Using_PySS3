That's not what it means Ya'll don't know me personally but my non-existent friends can tell you that I have a strong opinion on equality, discrimination, etc. I respect feminism. Women do deserve the same rights. I see it right now:   ThEy Do YoU sExIsT pIg. FEMINISM IS WOMEN ASKING FOR RIGHTS NOT DEMOTING MEN AND PROMOTING MEN. 

thats my entire rant. idk if this has been said before.
