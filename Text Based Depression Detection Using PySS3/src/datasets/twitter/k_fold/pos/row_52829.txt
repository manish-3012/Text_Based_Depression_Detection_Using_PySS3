This year I'm not getting any presents. I guess I don't think it's fair. Is it petty? I just wanted something to open but I gotta watch my family open gifts but I don't get anything at all. My mum was gonna buy me an oculus quest 2 but we needed to refund it because they ran out of stock before it got delivered to us. The refund came and my mum lied to me. She had spent them online.

But oh well! I guess I should try to be happy? I don't know how to feel. I just feel a little betrayed that's all.
