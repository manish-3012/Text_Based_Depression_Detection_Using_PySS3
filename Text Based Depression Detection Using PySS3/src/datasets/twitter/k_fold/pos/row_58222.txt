Help Dutch teens, please Please sign this [petition](https://secure.avaaz.org/community_petitions/nl/minister_slob__eindexamens_verder_versoepelen/?cmytnrb&amp;utm_source=sharetools&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;utm_campaign=petition-1180236-eindexamens_verder_versoepelen&amp;utm_term=mytnrb%2Bnl). It is about the final exams in the Netherlands.

 
Some explanation:

'Dear Hugo and Arie (poliricians), honeybobos, it might be hard to understand but an extra fail â‰  missing a year and a half of school to a certain extent. when the exams were canceled last year, as a 5 vwo student, I was just shooting my pta tests in the same exam gym hall. 

as a 17 year old you are supposed to do illegal things, get drunk at parties, receive STDs from people you've met today. but we, me, take an exam without an exam trip. an exam without a prom. I miss a year of my youth life and I am not even allowed to take a walk in the evening if I would like to. 

how last year I could name 15 people as good friends with whom I have daily contact,
there would be no more than 5 now. the amount of therapy sessions that I wasted at school this year is not normal. so, Hugo, Arie, do better.

exam measures required. I did not work hard for 6 years to then screw up my final list with my meager exam grades. kisses.'
