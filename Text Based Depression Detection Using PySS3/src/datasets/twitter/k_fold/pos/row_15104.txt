I don't feel motivated To be honest I don't know why I'm making this post. I've never really felt this feeling of like, loneliness I guess? It's weird. School is overwhelming me (despite not being prestigious) and I just have a feeling of weirdness, like when you stare at a non-important object for a long time without thinking much. It must suck for people to feel like this all the time. I'll most likely delete this later, but for now I guess this is just a rant talk or something. Sleeping with no work done but hey live to see another day I supposeðŸ“ˆ. Good night everyone reading this.
