Weirdly attracted to a fictional character Tldr: I am attracted to a fictional character a bit too much, and get a weird feeling when I see said character, and get sorta sad when she isn't real

I've recently watched this show (it's an anime but I won't go into it) and I like one of the characters in it, I think it's what's called having a waifu or something, but I get butterflies in my stomach when she appears on the screen, a bit pathetic I know ðŸ˜… 

Summing it up, it's sorta like the feeling you get when you have a crush at school, except not real, also, it isn't like this character isn't on my mind, I don't tend to think about tv shows that much outside of watching them



Also, to finish up, it isn't like I'm lonely or wanting a relationship, because I don't want a relationship with anyone I know etc...
