What if humans are simulating themselves to understand their own origin? This means, there is no start or end to humanity( or the universe really ). If this were the case, we are then stuck in an infinitely large inescapable loop of nested simulations. sorry, r/Showerthoughts wouldn't let me post there because it is an "unoriginal" thought.
