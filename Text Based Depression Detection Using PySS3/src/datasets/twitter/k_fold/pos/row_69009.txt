Iâ€™ve fallen out of love and feel bad Iâ€™ve been dating this girl for 3 months. I was her first boyfriend, and Iâ€™ve met her parents. Weâ€™ve exchanged gifts and went on many dates, and I think she really likes me but I donâ€™t feel anything for her anymore. 

I spent the past couple nights thinking about *why* Iâ€™ve lost interest, and I still donâ€™t have a coherent answer.  

I think itâ€™s partially due to her wokeness in that whenever I try to talk about any modern issue she goes full woke mode, and it makes the conversation really boring. 

Itâ€™s also  probably due to the fact that sheâ€™s very rigid when it comes to affection. I thought this was just because this was her first relationship, but she really is quite unaffectionate. Iâ€™m not clingy, but I would just really appreciate if she leaned against me on a bench or put her head on my shoulder while watching a movie or something. Instead, my arm is just awkwardly floating on her back, and holding her hand is like holding a dead fish. 


If I told her about how I feel, it would probably be a massive shock, and it would destroy our friend group. So, how should I go about telling her?
