Things arent going the way they are suppose to My monitor broke, i feel that the girl i like is only using me, i can barely talk with my closest friends because they are all in diffrent schools and im stuck 9 hours a day with only 40 min of recess ( i have 1 of 20 min in the morning and 1of 20 in thr afternoon and i dont know any synonyms for recess I'm 15), my family is falling apart because my brother is a maniac and the only positive thing that happened to me since early November is that I'm free of covid. Yep that's all folks
