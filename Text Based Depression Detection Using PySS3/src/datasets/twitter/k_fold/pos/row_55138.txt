Teenage Girls If feel like everything a teenage girl does or is interested is going to be mocked or invalidated by society. 

Sports like cheer, dance, and gymnastics (things more commonly associated with women) are seen as not â€œrealâ€ sports, even if it requires a lot of physical and mental dedication. It requires the same amount of work that say baseball or football would, but itâ€™s still constantly dismissed or seen as easy to do(itâ€™s really not). 

Girls who are interested in makeup or clothing are seen as superficial. Or only doing it for the trend, even if they are interested in that style. An example of this is VSCO girls.

Also lingo used more by girls, like the word 
â€œlikeâ€, are made fun or mocked because they use those words. Iâ€™ve also noticed points, even if they are well made, dismissed in school because someone used the word like. Iâ€™ve been made fun of for constantly using that word by teachers, even itâ€™s something I canâ€™t really help.

Video games are ever usually a fun place for women, but when girls have an interest them they are accused as only doing it for male validation. Also Iâ€™ve seen games like animal crossing or the Sims be dismissed as â€œnot a realâ€ game because it has a large female fan base. 

Also things like politics, mental health, or sexuality are constantly dismissed or invalided because girls are only talking about for the â€œattentionâ€
