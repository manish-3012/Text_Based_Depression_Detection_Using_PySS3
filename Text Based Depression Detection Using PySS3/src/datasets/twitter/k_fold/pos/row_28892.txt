AITA for unintentionally ruining someoneâ€™s reputation and friendships? Copy pasted since AITA doesnâ€™t allow posts 

Iâ€™ll call her Mandy for privacy. Weâ€™re all between 17 and 18 for reference.

This was a few months ago. Me and Mandy used to be friends until she cheated on her boyfriend. I fucking DESPISE cheaters so I immediately dropped her which led to our whole friend group doing it. Then the whole school found out because I was open whenever someone asked why we werenâ€™t friends. She ended up with almost no friends and itâ€™s still like that now. 

She absolutely hates me and says Iâ€™m an asshole but I think what I actually did was justified and everything else was just a chain reaction that she deserves

Tl;dr: I accidentally ruined someoneâ€™s social life
