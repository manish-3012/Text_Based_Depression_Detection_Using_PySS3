Need Advice for College Admissions and Stuff Senior who might graduate in 2021, and made poor life choices. Missed my chance to take the SAT last year because I took an internship for a care center, and didn't call the school if the tests would be notified to me. So in November I'm taking it and I am nervous that I'd fail. 

What are the most important things to remember or do as I study for the SAT? What are things I can do to remember easily for the test itself? No cheats, just ways to make it easier to remember what I studied when I actually take the test.
