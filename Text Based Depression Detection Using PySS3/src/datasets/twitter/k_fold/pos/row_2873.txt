I canâ€™t anymore My twin brother of 14 years bullyâ€™s me constantly. He makes fun of me punches and kicks me. Iâ€™ve caught him making lies about me to his friends. He created a rumor that Iâ€™m gay and now I have to deal with it. I told our parents who gave the shitty excuse that I have to learn to deal with my own problems. I donâ€™t know what to do. No one wants to help me and whenever I try to tell him how I feel he says itâ€™s just a joke and Iâ€™m making everything about myself
I just donâ€™t know what to do
