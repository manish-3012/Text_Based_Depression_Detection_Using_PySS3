So I was solving a section of the ACT exam (the english part) and I got 60 questions out of 75 and this was my first time. But my dad got disappointed from me. And to be honest this is not the first time they undermine the effort I put into achieving only in the end to say that it is  it enough. And when I confront them about it they just tell me they encourage me but when I try and tell them that this doesn't help me they just tell me to shut up and not tell them how to do it. I am really frustrated beyond explanation and I think I need help. Is it ok for me to feel frustrated or is it just normal for parents to be like that. I don't know even know how feel in my own home.
