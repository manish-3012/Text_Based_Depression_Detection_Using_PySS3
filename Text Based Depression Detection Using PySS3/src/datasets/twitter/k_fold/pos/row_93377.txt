Fanboys ruin everything They are there most toxic people, they think that whatever they are fanboying over is the best, I saw this 15 year old at a car meet who is a Tesla fanboy, he kept insulting everyone else because they didnâ€™t drive Teslas and he was just being an asshole, sorry for this rant it probably doesnâ€™t make sense but that kid pissed me off
