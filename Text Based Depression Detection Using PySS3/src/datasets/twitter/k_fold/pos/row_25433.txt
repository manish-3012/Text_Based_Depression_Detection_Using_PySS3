As long as Iâ€™m thinking, I will be self conscious constantly. I donâ€™t even think half the people who say they donâ€™t give a fuck about what people think about them are telling the truth. Maybe they think we are but we all act differently towards different people. I wouldnâ€™t act the same way I do for a friend as I would to that friendâ€™s parents. Sure theyâ€™re both different parts of myself but I have to change myself for other people. Thatâ€™s just how it works and Iâ€™m tired of being told thatâ€™s wrong to do. Most of us do it. I cater towards people around me. I share my interests that I think the person Iâ€™m talking to would like, I wouldnâ€™t talk about stuff they donâ€™t care about... Around quiet people Iâ€™m naturally more outgoing and around outgoing people Iâ€™m naturally more quiet. I just feel responsible for talking if no one else is. 

To get back to what my title is talking about though. I am always thinking about how Iâ€™m perceived and Iâ€™m sure most people are. To say you donâ€™t care means you wouldnâ€™t do whatâ€™s socially acceptable because youâ€™d just be doing your own thing. If you arenâ€™t doing things that are socially acceptable then most people wonâ€™t like you and youâ€™ll end up all alone. I care what others think of me and Iâ€™m still alone so I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m making this post. Itâ€™s completely useless overthinking everything action I do in front of people but it just happens because I have the option to do it. People still donâ€™t like me even when I try to be a person theyâ€™d like. Iâ€™m so tired of never being enough for people even when I try my best to be the person theyâ€™d like.
