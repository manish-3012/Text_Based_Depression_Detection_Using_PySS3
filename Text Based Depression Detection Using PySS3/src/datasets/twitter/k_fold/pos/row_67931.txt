Dear popular kids, Why do you pick on me so much? Is it because because I am bisexual and like anime? Cant you see that l am a humans and all deserve to be treated that way? Sure I may not do any sports, but am I less of a human because of that. I always try to act kind to everyone why do you find reasons to pick one me? Why is it that you spreed rumors about me that bring me down? Would you like if this was done to you?You create welcome groups for the school but use them to pick on people. Why do you hate us so much? I am actuality crying writing this because of what you have done.

Signed,

A large amount of nerds in your school
