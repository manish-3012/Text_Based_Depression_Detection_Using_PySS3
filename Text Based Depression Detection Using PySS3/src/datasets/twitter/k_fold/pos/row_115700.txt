Should I ask my crush out? I've been thinking for a while about telling my crush how I feel but I'm just so scared he won't look at me the same way and that I'll ruin our friendship. And even though I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me back, I feel it'd be a wasted opportunity if I don't say anything. And who knows maybe we'll become better friends or he might even say yes.
Anyways thx for the 5 people who read this, and sorry this was so boring
