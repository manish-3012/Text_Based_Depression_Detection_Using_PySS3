does anyone is uncertain of their future to an extent that scares you? yes I already know the uncertainty is part of the human being, however sometimes I think if I am going to have a good life, a good job, a girlfriend or just a person who is not fixed in superficial  things like looks. Or simply I will end up in the genetic pool.

I may not be the best, the smartest, or the strongest but i only know that  this "thought" of "what the future depares me?" makes me feel conflicted about things that happend all around me.

then ad up the fact that most of the time i feel cold. Not in the way of it is 32Â°F more like i feel cold in the inside idk i any one of you have experiensed something like this.

well any way i hope maybe some of you can give me an advice or something like it
