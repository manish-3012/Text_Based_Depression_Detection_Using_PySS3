Is cyberpunk worth playing through on playstation 4? I got cyberpunk as an early christmas present and i made my character (eww boobies and peepee) and failed the mission to steal the car as street punk or whatever on normal difficulty. I'm not usually a huge fan of super long story driven games, so is it worth playing through all the way
