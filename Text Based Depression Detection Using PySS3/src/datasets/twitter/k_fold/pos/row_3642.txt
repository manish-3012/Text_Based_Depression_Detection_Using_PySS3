I hate family vacations Iâ€™m all for flying to Hawaii or somewhere cool or back home to see family for a week and a half, but family vacations usually arenâ€™t like that for my family, and the last one of those we went on was years ago. Our family vacations usually consist of driving somewhere close and staying there for a night or two, and I fucking hate them! Like no, I donâ€™t want to get in the car and drive 30 miles to some crappy beach and stay all six of us in one little room at a crappy hotel where I have to sleep on the filthy floor and get up early. Weâ€™re literally in the same area as where we live so itâ€™s not even really a vacation, except now I have to stay crammed together in a crummy hotel room with people I donâ€™t want to be crammed in a crummy hotel room with. Then we have to go do stuff, and nothing we do is cool, and my family is ridiculously embarrassing. I feel like we look like a damn circus troupe whenever we walk out somewhere. And these â€œvacationsâ€ are always during the weekend, so instead of getting to enjoy my weekend and relax and get ready for another week of doing shit I donâ€™t want to do, I have to go do something I hate.
