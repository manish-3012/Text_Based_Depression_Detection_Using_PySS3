Day seven of posting until a homophobe makes a well conceived argument free of falacies Psa: homophobia is a term used to describe a mindset in which one acts or reacts adversely to homosexuals or (in some cases) toward any member of the lgbtq+ community

I have recently seen several occasions where people misuse this term. Whether it is as joking as 'its just a home why would I be afraid of it' to undeniable homophobes saying and I quote (with censoring)  "why would I be afraid of f***" this is an issue not only because it makes it harder to debate, but more importantly it trivializes homophobia in all cases. 

In other news I have given up reading the Bible, because I have realized arguments based on religion are flawed for reasons I can understand without having read the entire religious works of said religions. For example, leviticus 20:13 (a very commonly used passage to justify homophobia) can easily be debated against if the person citing it doesn't believe cheating on a spouse should be punished by death. That is unless they can provide an inherent reason for which they believe the moral and not the punishment (feel free to take a swing at this). 

r/okbuddyhomo is an sub made for the purpose of spreading hate toward the lgbtq community, so maybe drop the mods a report or two if you want. That's all from me. Enjoy the rest of your evening
