Hey guys! Do you mind taking this survey for me? In our PLTW Engineering class, we have to research and find a solution to a problem regarding the conveniences of closing and opening curtains (yes I know, it may sound silly). As of now, we have around 90 responses and need to get to at least 200 in a bit.   


Anyways, here's the link to our group's survey! Thanks in advance for reading and filling it out!
