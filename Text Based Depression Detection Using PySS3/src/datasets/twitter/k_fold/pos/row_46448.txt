Anyone here involved with Teen PEP at their school? My school has a teen PEP (prevention education program) that accepts juniors and seniors, but it is fairly selective and requires an application and interview for acceptance into the program.

I really like everything about the program and feel itâ€™s a grear opportunity and for for me. So, I wondering if anyone here could give me some guidance on how the whole application/interview process goes, and just your overall thoughts and experience with the program?

Not sure how many people here have heard of it or will even see this, but any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!
