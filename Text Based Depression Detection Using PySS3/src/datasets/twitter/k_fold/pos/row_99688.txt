He was â€œtoo niceâ€? (Not sure if this should be flaired with rant or relationship. I apologise if I got it wrong)

Okay so my best guy friend dated this girl for a couple of months (they have been very careful when it comes to meeting in person since the cases in our country went up) and he really likes her. They were never official but they talked about becoming something serious soon. 

They seemed like they were doing fine. He felt safe and comfortable around her and I was happy that he had that in his life. I never met her but it seemed like she was into it as well. 

Now, please tell me why she ended it all because he is â€œtoo niceâ€ and she â€œdoes not want someone who is niceâ€? 

I do not understand. She literally said she does not want someone nice? Does she want someone who is mean to her? (*Disclaimer* my friend is not a simp okay he is just a nice guy)

This is also the day I learnt that this apparently happens a lot?? Apparently this is not uncommon for guys to experience? 

Guys, I promise you there are girls out there who wants a nice guy. This whole situation made me so confused.
