I think my grandmother purposely wants for me to be diagnosed with a mental disorder to stop me from entering the military  I am currently 17 years old and have always had aspirations to join the military and make a career out of it,  everyone in my family my mother, my father, aunt's, uncle's etc. are all on board with this, except my grandmother. For some context, I'm extremely close with my grandma, (more than my mother) and she's always been there for me and supported everything I've do except for this. I've had this dreams since I was at least 10 or 11 but back then I think she must have thought that this was just "oh! a little boy wants to be an army man" but I still want to join the military and I've even been talking with some recruiters, so I think this has her worried.

Now here's the part I can't wrap my head around, over the last two years she's been claiming that I have several undiagnosed mental disorders and disabilities to family,  friends and even my school counselor and Dean.

ADHD, Autism and even bipolar disorder are all things she claims that I have. Now none of these I even show symptoms of having and I know I don't but she is adamant that I am mentally unwell. She's made me take atleast a dozen online tests and forms to clinics and doctor's office around the country to try to get me diagnosed with something. Now this may be just me overthinking the situation but I do genuinely believe that she's doing this so that if I'm diagnosed with something, I will not be eligible to join the military. now this usually wouldn't bother me much if it weren't for the fact that I am extremely close to my grandma, and if she was doing this purposely, this would ruin our relationship instantly. 

For last few months this has been eating me up inside and I generally don't know what to think. Thoughts?
