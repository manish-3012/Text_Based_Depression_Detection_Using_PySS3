I feel like such a burden :( My friend invited me to go to her house with a bunch of friends for a Halloween party, I'm excited and stuff but anytime I'm invited to anything (which isn't very often) that I won't have any fun or will just get left in the dark. I just feel like no one cares if I'm there or not and that I won't make a difference if I go or not or if I do go it will be a bad difference...And then it'll be later at night when it's over most likely and I don't want anyone to have to go out of their way just because of me. Then it's like I wanna talk to someone about it but the only people I can think to talk to it about are my friends and then I feel like even more of a burden for laying all my feelings down and them feeling obligated to cheer me up. I feel like such a burden to my friends, and I don't even know if they actually like me...
