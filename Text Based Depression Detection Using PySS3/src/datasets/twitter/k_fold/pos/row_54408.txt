I don't understand girls This is a post made at midnight because I cant go to sleep because I can't stop thinking about this.

So me 16 y/o guy likes same age girl, and one day in      conversation over text she says "I like our relationship because you are the only guy friend i have that i don't have to worry about feelings and shit" and  I don't know what to say so i respond with "cool"

Now about a month later she sends me a pic of (I assume) her self looking like she just left the shower.
So I don't think she has a shirt on so I can see like the slimmest line of what might be a bra, but some text that says "my hair is so poofy lol".

So now after you read all that my question is: Am I like level 99 friendzoned or has she changed her mind or am I completely overreacting about some hair?


Sorry if spelling or grammar is wrong I'm on my phone kinda panicking
