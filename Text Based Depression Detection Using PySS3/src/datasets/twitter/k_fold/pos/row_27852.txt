It pisses me off when people complain about their parents Like I get it if youâ€™re being treated bad but they are asking you to do chores the do it, some people are really ungrateful, I seen my dad work hard, at one point he had to take pills to sleep, then least I can do is help with chores because he is not making me work and he isnâ€™t asking my to pay bills or rent, so donâ€™t be a dick you your parent unless they are treating you bad
