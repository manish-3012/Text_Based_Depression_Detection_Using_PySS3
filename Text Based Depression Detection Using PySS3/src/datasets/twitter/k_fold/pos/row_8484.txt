How short should I cut my hair? Hey guys, gals, and non-binary pals :)

So I've been meaning to cut my hair for months now lol and I'll most likely finally cut it this weekend. The thing is, idk how short I should cut it :/ My hair is currently like to my waist and is naturally straight.

I'm thinking about cutting it to about an inch or two below my shoulders, maybe a bit more. The shortest I've gone was to my chin and I didn't like it but granted, I was little and didn't know how to style it lol

idk what would look good on me and idek if this is the right sub to askðŸ¤£ if it's not, plz tell me what sub would work better lol. 

Anyways, how short should I cut my hair? there's a pic of myself on my profile for reference lol so you can get a better idea. I hear face shape matters when cutting hair lol. Also, side note: my hair is a bit wavy in the pic cuz it was in braids but the length wasn't that different from how it naturally is. 

gracias for your guys' help in advance :)

k that is all, byeee
