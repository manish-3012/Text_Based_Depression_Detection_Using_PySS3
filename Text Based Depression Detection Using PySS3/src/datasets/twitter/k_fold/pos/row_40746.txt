So, I just want to vent a little bit Okay, so, these last few days Iâ€™ve been wondering what makes me actually happy. Like, I want to find something I genuinely love to do, and that I come up with on my own. All my life Iâ€™ve just been following what my friends do, gaming. As much as I love gaming, I donâ€™t feel like playing it unless I can play with them. I just donâ€™t feel like I am using my time very well, and it bothers me a lot. I just want to find something that can make me genuinely happy whenever I do that peculiar thing. Any thoughts?
