I got into a political debate with my mom and she kept saying You cant trust the news

Trump isn't racist because he has a black person in his cabinet 

And shit like that

The Conversation was because I told her that trump is banning Tik Tok because they keep bullying them

Before anyone comments "Its because of Chinese spyware, Facebook sells more information"
