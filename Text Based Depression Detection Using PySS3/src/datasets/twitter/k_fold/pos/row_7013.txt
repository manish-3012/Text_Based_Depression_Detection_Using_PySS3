Me and any friends try our best to make our teacher happy. Me and my friends (two of them) always try to answer the questions of one of our teachers. Everyday about 5-6 students join this particular class including us, even though the strength is about 20 people. 

This is our favourite subject too, so we answer her questions as much as we can because the other students don't bother much. Whenever she asks them in particular they leave and just don't bother. 

I know teaching is a hard job because my dad used to teach a few kids. He told me that sometimes the teachers loses hope as well. So I don't want her to lose hope, because she tries her best to teach us and no teacher should lose the hope to teach. Maybe its because I like the subject and try to learn more, but at the same time it makes me sad that there is no response from the whole class. I appreciate my teacher very much and will always let her know. And I'm thankful for those two friends.
