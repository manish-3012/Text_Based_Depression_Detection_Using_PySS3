So i wrote this poem, do you guys like it? # Reality 

  
Always been selfish and scared,  
I feel like someone else.  
There is a void in my soul,  
or maybe I am in a hole.  


Wish reality could be more than this;  
More than just a room with a trapped soul.  
Escape was an option that I never believed,  
maybe trapped  is what I want to be.  


Bright lights blinding me,  
but i am unable to look away.  
I just want you to love me;  
How could you though, after all its me.  


Don't know what I want,  
not this for sure.  
Muffled sobbing and an aching heart;  
That night I lost the fight.
