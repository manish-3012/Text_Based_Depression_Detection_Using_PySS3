I have a podcast, need listeners so I thought Iâ€™d share here. Ok so my podcast is called The Random Podcast. You can find it in the links below. I cover a random thing each week on Wednesday and each episodes are 20-30 minutes long and I donâ€™t cover religion or politics.


So here is my Reddit account for the podcast u/TheRandom_podcast. And here is the links to the podcast. I hope to see you guys tomorrow with the Minecraft review and I suggest you listen to older episodes please.
