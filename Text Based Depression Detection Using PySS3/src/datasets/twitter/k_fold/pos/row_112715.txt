Were any of you talened when you were younger? When did you 'crash'? I was and still am a 'talented child'. I'm going to 9th grade now and I've never had a grade worse than a C (I get one once or twice a year). I study like.. 5 hours per school year and get many national awards and was determined to be one of the top 10% of children logic wise and 15 creative wise by a test issued by my school (I have no idea what it means and it isn't important)

I don't have a work ethic and I've heard so many stories about teens and kids just like me that reality just slapped in the face. I'm trying to study more but it isn't really working so I'm waiting tp get punched in the gut by life. Share your stories please!
