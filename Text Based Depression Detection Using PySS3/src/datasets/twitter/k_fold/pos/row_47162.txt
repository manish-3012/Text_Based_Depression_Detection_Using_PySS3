I accidentally made a really cool pickup line So what happened today was really interesting. Here's some context:
A friend (let's call him A), called out irrelevant character on a discord server for excessive spam, calling him, among many others, "a troglodyte". When someone asked how many sides a troglodyte had (I chuckled at the stupidity of this joke), I replied, 

"It depends on the troglodyte. If it's acute, it has a number of sides equal to it's phone number. If it's obtuse, it has a number of sides equal to the result of putting the social security number of the troglodyte and its credit card number side by side" 

At this point, the values I described like the phone number, social security number and credit card number were completely random, i.e. the first numbers I thought of. 

Then someone asked how many sides they have, and realizing what I had accidentally done, replied with this. 

"Well, you are a cute troglodyte, so the number of sides you have is your phone number." 

He rated it a 7/10 for set-up and execution. 

And then I quoted Pablo Neruda. 

"I want to do with you, what spring does with the cherry trees." 

I considered it a fitting end to our platonic exchange.
