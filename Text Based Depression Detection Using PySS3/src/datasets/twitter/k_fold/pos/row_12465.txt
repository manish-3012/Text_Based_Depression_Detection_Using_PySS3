Hahaha Teachers Are So Clueless So I'm in 8th grade and I was in a zoom class for signing up for my classes. And in the beginning portion of the presentation the teacher brought up a slide that said "tips for freshman success". And I'm not joking, she talked about about how important it is to do your homework and then started talking about how important sleep is. Like, do you not know that your the cause of lots of kids not getting enough sleep in highschool? These teachers are so clueless that they blame students schedule not being coordinated enough instead of taking the blame themselves. It's so annoying. Like how do they not know that giving kids 5 hours of homework is causing insomnia more then anything else. They think that they are entitled enough to give a shitton of homework and then tell you to "just get sleep lmao" like are u stupid. I haven't even started highscool and I already know that this system is broken. Like waking up a 6:45, going through the day doing hard ass work and then getting 5 hours of homework is not healthy. And the thing is, these teachers think it's normal. They just want us to do homework and then blame the students on not getting enough sleep when they are the cause. It's legit braindead.
