so why have i seen.. more guys make fun of girls weight, a girls looks, a girls personality (it happens ALL of the time), and just girls altogether (girl vs boys memes)... (not to mention how girls even attack girls for these things)

than girls making fun of a guy for a guys height? i get why a guy wouldnâ€™t be happy with this but... can yâ€™all be nice
