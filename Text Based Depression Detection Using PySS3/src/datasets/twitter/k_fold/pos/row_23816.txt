Probably just sold my soul 2 years ago I dropped my 3DS XL on the floor and broke it and now me and my dad are trying to get it fixed so Tuesday we're taking it to this place that can fix anything

Just now talked to him about it and he said the place said they can fix it for $175. I have $500-ish in cash so I made a deal with him that in return for the 3DS, I'll split the bill and give him $75 AND zero missing work in 1 class. He bumped it up to 4 classes and I agreed that I'll have it done in 3 weeks. I'm about to start my biology stuff. It's impossible for me to promise him an A in all four, but he just wants me to get the work done. 

If I don't get it done in 3 weeks, I'll have to look for a 3DS XL on Ebay and pay the full price for it.

Wish me luck bois
