How many 2nd graders you think you could beat up if they came at you in waves of 10 with a 5th grader boss coming every 5 waves? You get a gun after beating 10 waves, a flamethrower after 50 waves, and a cannon after 200 waves

The final boss is you, turning back and looking at all the bloodshed you caused, and have to defeat yourself

(On a side note, I should legit make a game out of this, would definitely sell!)
