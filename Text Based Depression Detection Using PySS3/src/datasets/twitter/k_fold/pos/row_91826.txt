â€œMan privilegeâ€ is not real I was reading a post a feminist made in another subreddit that she is afraid to walk about outside at night because men have tried to touch her or said weird crap to her, and then she was saying her husband makes fun of her because she is afraid outside and rants about his man privilege because he can walk outside without being afraid and that men need to recognize their privilege, then in the comments there are men who say that man privilege is not real because when they go outside at night people assume they are criminals because they are a male, and because they are black, Hispanic or simply not white, and itâ€™s so true, if a person sees a black man walking at night they assume the worst, the girl that made the post said that her husband is white, man privilege is not real but white male privilege is, a white man can walk outside at night and people wonâ€™t assume anything bad, people might say, oh he is just exercising or he is going to the store but if a black or Hispanic man are walking at night they might say he is going to steal someone or he is trying to touch girls, why canâ€™t we just treat each other equal, this problem is everyoneâ€™s fault itâ€™s girls fault for thinking so bad about guys, itâ€™s the guys problem because a lot of guys donâ€™t know how to respect woman, if both men and women work together we can stop this problem
