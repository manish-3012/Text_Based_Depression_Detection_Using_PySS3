My dad took advantage of my mental health and guilt-tripped me. A little backstory, my parents are divorced, I have a bitch for a stepmom,I have autism,anxiety and, am bi-polar. Ok now that thatâ€™s out of the way hereâ€™s the story: last night my dad texted me asking if I wanted to eat out with him on Friday( today) I said no I wanted to spend time with my mom and he said that he as going to pick me up anyways. I thought he was joking so I didnâ€™t reply. Today at 5 in the evening heâ€™s at the door waiting for me and said he was here to take me out to eat. I didnâ€™t know what to say so I just said I told him no last night. He told me he came all this way (30 minutes) to get me. I felt guilty so I said Iâ€™ll go and I went out to eat while my anxiety kicked in and I didnâ€™t know why so I took one of my pills to calm down and he asked what that pill was and I said it was my anxiety pill and he asked why I was anxious and I said because he came to take me to dinner when I said I didnâ€™t want to and he told me that I need to grow up. 10 minutes ago as of writing this, I found out my stepmom was behind the whole thing and am currently feeling sad. If you read this to the end, thank you.
