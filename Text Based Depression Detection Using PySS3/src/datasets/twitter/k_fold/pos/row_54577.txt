my parents wonder why I don't do classwork today my parents tried to talk to me about my grades and homework. they wonder why i instead slack off and not do it. here's a list of why:

1. if i didn't finish my lunch, my mom would overreact to this and start yelling at me and throwing my lunchbox at me

2. I try to take the problem off my mind by listening to music or youtube videos so I don't listen to anyone most of the time (except for you :)).

3. I get stressed out whenever I hear footsteps near my door or yelling because I think my mom got an email saying i did something wrong

if you guys have any advice to get myself back together (except where I have to talk to them) it's greatly appreciated :)
