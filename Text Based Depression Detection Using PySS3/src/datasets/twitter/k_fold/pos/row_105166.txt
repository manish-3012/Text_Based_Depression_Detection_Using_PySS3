My best friend My best friend self harms herself, i help her out with her problems. I talk to her whenever she needs anything and we speak together everyday. I sometimes smoke some hash, so knowing the effects of cannabis kn a person (studied effects) briefly mentioned if she wanted to smoke up one day she could join me. She went crazy and started worruing about me. Me iâ€™m fine healthy and all. But she threatened to harm herself. So i did not know whag to do except tel her that i will stop. But that is a bit of a lie to keep her safe. Did i do the right thing?
