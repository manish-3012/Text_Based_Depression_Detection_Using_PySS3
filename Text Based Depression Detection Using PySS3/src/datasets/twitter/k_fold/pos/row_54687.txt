i wish i could have told him how much his friendship meant he literally hates me now i think but he fr meant the world to me and got me thru tough ass times. he was funny as fuck and had a good sense of humor. iâ€™ll never be able to tell him how sorry i am because of the way i treated him bc i was insecure or how much i cared.
