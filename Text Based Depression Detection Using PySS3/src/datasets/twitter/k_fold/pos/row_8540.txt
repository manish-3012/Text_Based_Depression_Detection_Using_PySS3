I require help on this matter I think I (13 MtF) am crushing on my friend (13 NB)

For the past few days now, I've been dreaming about us two together in a relationship. These dreams range from just casual hand holding to kissing and walking together at pride parades with our respective pride flags.

We both share the same crackhead energy and constantly send eachother funny/stupid videos.

They and my other 2 friends are all more contact-y than my past friends. When we're all stood up, they like to bounce me around like a pinball. So, back to the topic person. Sometimes, they pat me on the head. Other times, they slap me on my head and it slowly turns into a head pat.

Please help me in my predicament. I think the head pats are getting to me.
