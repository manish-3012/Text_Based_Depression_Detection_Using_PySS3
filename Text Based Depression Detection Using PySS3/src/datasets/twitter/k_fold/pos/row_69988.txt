My mom thinks I've been shouting curse words Well of course, more boomer rants. Well here's mine. As some of you know, there is a Call Of Duty for your phone. Couple of problems, such as DeSync and Lag. My mom has been scolding me for saying these words, and in her exact words, "do you think these words are good", these words make me think if I really should be playing video games even anymore. If you're Asian, more specifically, Filipino, you know not to say anything when elders are scolding you.
