Temporally Non-Linear Dreams (A.k.a. Time Fuckery) I have dreams about things that happen in the future. Basically it goes:

I have a Dream ---&gt; I forget it ---&gt; The event I was shown in the dream eventually and inevitably happens ---&gt; I become anywhere from somewhat to confused to majorly disoriented due to a feeling far stronger and much different than Deja Vu ---&gt; The intensity of the disorientation contributes to how memorable the even was ---&gt; Repeat. I already did a bit of thinking on it and decided time travel is likely a possibility. My theories vary.

# Theory 1 +LI Explanation: The Chosen

I (and others with dreams like mine) either discovered or experienced time travel. As a direct and unavoidable consequence, traveling through time causes a "break" that results in what I call "Linear Inconsistency" or LI. LI (in my experience) only seems to affect dreams, but may be the reason why I feel pain for seemingly no reason. It either only affects dreams, or it can also affect my nerve endings.

# Theory 1a: Crude Travel

In the future, time travel is created and I (as well as others) travel through time. Same effects as theory 1, but instead of being "chosen", LI is a rare side-effect of Time Travel.

# Theory 2: Strings Attached

In another universe, I found a way to travel through time. Instead of sending "me" back through time in my own universe, it sent me here, which caused the me that originates here to have LI.

# Theory 3: God?

Should God exist, it is (for whatever reason) directly causing my LI. The only question is: Why?

# Theory 4: 2012/Mandella Effect

2012 is recognized by some people to be a point when our Universe collided with another (or something along those lines). This event is suspected to be the source of the Mandella effect. Perhaps this event also cause my LI.

# Theory 5: Condition Without Cause

LI is not influenced by anything, and is instead just one of the quirks of this universe. Linearity can simply have errors, and I have a likelihood of such errors occuring.

All these theories could technically explain it. Either way, it seems as the only real way to tell would be to continue living and pursue an understanding of Time (and perhaps time travel).
