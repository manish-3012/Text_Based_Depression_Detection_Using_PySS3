My sciences teacher's Instagram is weird... So my teach showed us a picture from his Instagram of his kid (it was the kids first day of kindergarten). So my friend looks him up and she is just finding the weirdest pictures nd sending them to me. Like he was already a little weird but now... idk   
Its not too creepy but at the same time giving off some weird vibes
