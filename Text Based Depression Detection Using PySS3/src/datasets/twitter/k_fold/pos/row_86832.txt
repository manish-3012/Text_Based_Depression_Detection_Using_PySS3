I try not to show emotion because I fear Iâ€™ll be exploited Currently in high school, and over the years Iâ€™ve just become a private and quiet person. I donâ€™t really tell anyone about myself, and most of it is because I fear that people will try and exploit me. I donâ€™t know if it makes sense, but I want to try and change, I want to talk to people more. But at the same time, I feel like talking about myself is not being humble, and I just donâ€™t know what to do
