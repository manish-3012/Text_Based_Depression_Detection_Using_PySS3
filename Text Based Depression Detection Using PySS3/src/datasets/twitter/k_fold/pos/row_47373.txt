Comrades and Comradettes you're my last hope. I think my father is cheating on my mom and I need advice. So a couple weeks ago I found some lingerie in the laundry that does not belong to me (not mine), my sister (she's too tiny), or my mother (she's too large).

I also noticed my father seemed to be acting suspicious a few days before this.

I confronted my mom about what I found and she wouldn't believe me.

What now?
