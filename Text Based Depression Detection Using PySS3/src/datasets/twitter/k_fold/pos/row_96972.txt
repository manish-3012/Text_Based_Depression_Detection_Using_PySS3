Well I won't be sleeping for the next few nights Just to fyi I don't like gym unless we are playing dodgeball or ultimate frisbee. I hate sports. On many occasions I have hurt one of my hands by trying to stop a basketball (or in yesterday's case, a soccer ball. I now have a big bruise on my middle finger).

Anywho we were playing volleyball in gym today (which I actually don't hate as much as most sports) and I had just scored a point or something. Now the gym is usually pretty cool so my hands were cold. I was also completely zoned out.

So at that moment this one girl, who was really nice actually; she had been encouraging the team and saying things like: "Good job!" And  "Nice try!", Came over to me to give me one of those high fives that are low and to the side.

And instead of being a normal human and giving her a high five, my zoned out ass shook her hand. It was like 1.5 seconds of this cold, clammy, and incredibly awkward hand shake. 

She said, "That was very uncomfortable." in like a joking, nice way but I could tell she was really confused and I tried to laugh it off but inside my soul shriveled up and died from the sheer awkwardness off that moment.

The worst part was I had to play for another 15 minutes and I couldn't look her (or anyone on my team for that matter) in the eye after that.

Later in the hallway one of my friends who I told who knew her asked her "Did you try to high five Kool_Stuph, and then he shook your hand?" And she said "Yeah. It was *incredibly* awkward." jokingly again but again I cringed.

I just wanted to share this with any other socially awkward people here.

TL;DR A really nice girl tried to high five me and I shook her hand instead.
