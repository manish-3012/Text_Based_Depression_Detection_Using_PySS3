how to tell my dad i broke a vase at a bookstore and i'll go pay it tomorrow ( with my money ) hi. so, a few months ago i broke a vase ( a cookie vase if this term exists ) and i have to pay it, i'm friends with the girl there and she told me to calm down and that it probably won't be that expensive, but since then i've been afraid.

i haven't told my dad, and tomorrow i'm getting 60 dollars ( more than enough for the vase i suppose ) and i don't know how to tell him without making him angry / dissapointing him
