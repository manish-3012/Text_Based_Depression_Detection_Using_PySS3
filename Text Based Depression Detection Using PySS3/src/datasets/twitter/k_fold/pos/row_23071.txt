Conversations starters for your crush? 
Iâ€™m looking for good ways to start a conversation with my crush, we talked for ages 2 days ago and it was really cool I got to know a lot more about her, I started the conversation by asking if she found me annoying and surprisingly she said no and then we started talking, she also says she takes long to reply because she barely goes on Snapchat which is true, she goes outside a lot but we donâ€™t live near each other.

So Iâ€™m looking for some other good ways to start a conversation with her does anyone have any advice.
