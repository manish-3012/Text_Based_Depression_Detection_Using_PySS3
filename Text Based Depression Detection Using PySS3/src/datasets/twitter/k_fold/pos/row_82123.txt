I got my dad to do crime with me Since the quarantine started my dad started gaming a lot more

He would play single player war based games but recently I started playing a lot of PAYDAY 2, he saw it, said it looked like fun, now we shoot civilians and steal gold together.

Long story short: My dad is fucking awesome
