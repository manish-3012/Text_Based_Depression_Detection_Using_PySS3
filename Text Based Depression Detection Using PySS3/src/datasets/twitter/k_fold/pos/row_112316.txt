Am I the only one dreading the releases of the PS5 and Xbox Series X? As somebody who, like everybody else, doesn't have an unlimited amount of money, highly doubt that I'll he getting a next gen console any time soon. I just got the Xbox One like a year ago. Before that it sucked seeing all the new games coming out that were only available on the PS4 and Xbox One not being able to get any of them. Now, I'll just have to experience that all over again.
