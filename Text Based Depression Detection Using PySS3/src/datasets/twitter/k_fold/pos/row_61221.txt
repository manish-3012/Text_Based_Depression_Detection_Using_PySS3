What are your opinions on a slavery forgiveness payment? I saw something recently about giving money back to all blacks. Personally, I think this is a fucking stupid idea. Not a single soul on the planet was alive back then. If we were to do this, it should've been don a long ass time ago. Not now. Not a single fucking human being that is living in America at this very moment experienced slavery, so why should they be paid back for it? What are your opinions on this?
