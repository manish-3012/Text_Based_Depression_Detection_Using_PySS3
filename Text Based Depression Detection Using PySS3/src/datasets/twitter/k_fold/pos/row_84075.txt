I am addicted to r/DeadorVegetable, fucking help me! So recently I went to that sub and that place is filled with videos of people dying by accident/suicide/murder. Man I am sure I am not a bad person and fucking dont want anyone to be in those places but I cant stop going to that sub. Its disgusting but a part of my brain likes it and I automatically go that sub. Why is this so? Help me!
