You ever get so lonely it physically hurts and you want to die? Me too man. I havenâ€™t talked to any friends in awhile and itâ€™s been a couple weeks since my girlfriend dumped me. My sleep schedule is messed up too so Iâ€™ve just been staying up all night long just depressed feeling so lonely just wanting to hold someone. It sucks so muchhhh
