Screw assigned breakout rooms I just had to sit through an hour of 3 girls talking about why they like Valentineâ€™s Day and what guys they think are cute. LIKE BITCH WE GOT  PAPERS AND SLIDES DUE TOMORROW. But then they snitched on me when I told them to be quiet and said I â€œverbally sexually harassedâ€ them. Point is, screw assigned breakout rooms.
