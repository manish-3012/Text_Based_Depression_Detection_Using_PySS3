To all those conspiracy ideologists out there who think that Covid is communism: My school proves it. They literally put us in relatively small rooms without proper distancing and masks. If someone has it, everybody gets it, simple communism. They expect us to socially distance outside the classrooms with masks, which is of course good. But they say that wearing a mask inside is optional. WE SIT LITERALLY HALF A METRE APART! DO YOU GUYS EVEN KNOW HOW THIS VIRUS SPREADS? There are literally increasing cases per day here. Is it a good idea to put thousands of children and adolescents into small badly ventilated rooms without distancing? We are in a pandemic and shouldn't just do business as usual. Sorry, mustn't do business as usual! People's lives are at stake here and you just sit there in your seats and be like "meh"! This is not responsible! Dou your fucking job and close the schools before we have a giant outbreak. If only ONE PERSON has it, all people in their courses get it.

Anyway, didn't expect this to become a rant, but here we are.

Greetings from Germany.
