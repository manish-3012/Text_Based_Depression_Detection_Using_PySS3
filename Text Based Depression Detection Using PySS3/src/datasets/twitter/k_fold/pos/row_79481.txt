Is anyone else not completely miserable but not happy either? I am not doing bad. I still have a roof over my head, I still have food on the table, my parents havenâ€™t divorced yet, my teachers are still taking my missing work. I am not doing bad, I am not sad, I am not miserable. But I am not happy either and havenâ€™t felt happy in a while. 

Does anyone else feel like this?
