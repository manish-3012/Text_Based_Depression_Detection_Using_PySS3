Disgusting and Suspicious Tea Today my dad had me and my little sisterâ€™s drink a disgusting and suspicious tea he made. The tea was horrible and my sisterâ€™s hated it my dad was delusional thinking it would help defend or fight against the virus but I think it was stupid. So I tried my best to chug the tea without spitting it out. My mouth tried to reject it but I forced it down my throat. I hope that my dad wonâ€™t make next time but I know that heâ€™ll make us drink it again and I donâ€™t want too.
