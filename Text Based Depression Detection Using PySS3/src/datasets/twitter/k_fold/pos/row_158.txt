Serious Answers Only Please, unless itâ€™s funny. I started talking to this girl recently, but now sheâ€™s all I can think of. I canâ€™t even play games or masturbate, I just sit and stare at space wondering if Iâ€™m approaching her right or if things will work out. Is this normal or am I just down bad?
