I am so sick of fucking quarantine. I literally freaking cried myself to sleep last night. I don't care if that makes me weak, or if I'm not strong for having admitted to it. But I needed to tell someone, I'm reaching my breaking point and I'm scared of what I might do if I do reach it. I'm not sure that I can deal with quarantine much longer. It's killing me to not be able to see people and to talk to them in person for months on end. I know I'm not the only one who's being affected by this, and I'm in a very privileged situation, but I'm sick of this. All of it. And I don't understand how we're just expected to go back to school like nothing's ever happened. I know that there's lots of services available to talk but I don't want to figure out a solution because I know that there isn't any, I just needed a place to rant. I'm so done with all of this, and am sick of people yelling at me that I'm not the only one going through this. I know I'm not, but would it kill you to support me even a little? Apparently the answer is yes, even from my parents who are supposed to support me. Apologies if I sound entitled but right now I'm just so over all this. That's it, rant over, Kayliaf out.
