Looking for Feedback (AP Bio) Hello, through my high school's business incubator program myself, and four others created a free website to help AP students find the best study resources. We recently added AP Biology, and we are looking for feedback on it. If anyone is willing to test out and look through our AP Bio resources and give us feedback, it will help us improve a lot. Our website is [GeniusHub.co](https://geniushub.co/). If you want to help us out but don't want to make an account, please pm me, and I'll set you up with a free beta tester profile. Any feedback is much appreciated. The link to the form is [here](https://forms.gle/fkYdMskLMFhvVoNe6).
