Whatâ€™s the best food youâ€™ve ate Like when was it just best? A food Thats usually good but better after something 

For me it was cold tea and a croissant my mom got me after I was crying looking for things to kill myself. I didnâ€™t realize how good it was till now and now I want another croissant
