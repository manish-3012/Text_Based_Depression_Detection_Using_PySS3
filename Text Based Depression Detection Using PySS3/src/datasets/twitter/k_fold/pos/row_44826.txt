So I'm a bad dude and I break 90% of rules given to me. So here's my stroke of good luck. I was kinda grounded until I did an overdue set of quizlets.  I was watching Isekai Quartet on Crunchyroll when I stopped and realized...  "I need a cover story". Out of nowhere I suddenly want to spin a coin.  So I do that.  Hearing the coins, my father comes downstairs.  He teaches me how to spin a coin.  He then leaves and I realized, "I guess I didn't need a cover story after all". I then did the Quizlets.
