Ok cancels culture is bad and all but.... At a certain point, you have to realize that some of the shit people call mistakes are choices. People protect Shane and Jeffery Star even tho theyâ€™re deplorable people because they â€œmade mistakesâ€. Shane wasnâ€™t making a â€œmistakeâ€ when he created constantly pedophilic and Racist content, he knew what he was doing and went through with it anyways. A mistake is a high school kid accidentally saying the n-word **once** and they are filmed. They shouldnâ€™t be canceled years later for that. But, if someone is consistently racist through highschool, then sure. Cancel them if thereâ€™s proof they havenâ€™t changed dramatically sense then. Does any of this make sense?
