Just found a fucking worm in my fruit. I made an epic looking fruit bowl with a banana, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, watermelon, and pineapple. I got one of each piece and found out that they're prize-winning fruit before I saw a little worm crawling around in there, I nearly cried as I dumped it into the trash. I Googled it and Google said it's fine and the fruit isn't contaminated with anything, so everything I didn't put in the bowl is ok, but that still sucks.
