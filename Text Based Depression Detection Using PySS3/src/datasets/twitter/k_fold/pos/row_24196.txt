Using your brain to bully teachers you hate. Yes, teachers have a life and a job and you should not disturb them. But... What about something that can both annoy them while simultaneously flex on them?

My humble suggestion is to simply submit twice of what the teacher expected. When the annoying teacher wants you to write a 6 page essay, fuck it, just write a 12 page one! You can both annoy the shit out of her and flex on your friends and her at the same time!

Plus maybe the teacher might actually treat you a lot nicer.
