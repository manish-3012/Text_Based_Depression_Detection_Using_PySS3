Thinking of Going Remote School, Posting Here for Teen Peer Perspective Iâ€™m weighing the pros and cons but idk what to do. I am currently in a hybrid situation.

I love my in-person classes for human interaction, and my classmates are awesome. But every evening before in-person days I spend like half an hour trying to pack my bag and get all ready, and it takes away from my sleep. I also have rlly dry hands cuz of winter, and using sanitizer at lunch sometimes hurts. I have braces with bands, which means I am risking my health when I have to put my hands in my mouth to replace the bands. I have bad acne and sensitive skin, so wearing masks suck.

When I work from home, I sleep in a bit longer, I am less stressed, and I have easy access to most supplies I need, but I get distracted and/or bored pretty easily. If I shifted to remote, though, I could clean up my desk and I could make it work.   


Iâ€™m trying to discern what is laziness and convience from what is good points, any help/advice?
