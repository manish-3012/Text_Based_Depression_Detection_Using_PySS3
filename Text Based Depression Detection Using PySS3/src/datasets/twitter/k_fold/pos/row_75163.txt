I'm prepared for the downvotes but hear me out I'm a misogynist. No not in the incel "I hate women way". I believe in today's society we've forgotten what equality was about and now it's all "Kill all men" or "Straight, white males cause all problems" no I'm not talking about all feminists only the bad ones who don't understand what equal rights mean. I think in today's world men's rights and mental health awareness for men should be normalised and we should not have to stick to stereotypes just like what women have been fighting for. 
 
Thanks for listening to my rant everyone, stay hydrated
