Finally talked to my crush! I finally got the kahunas to start a conversation with this girl I like. She actually seemed interested in talking to me and laughed at the end and said â€œtalk again sometime?â€ Before saying have a good day. I know itâ€™s baby steps but Iâ€™m proud. Hopefully I can talk more with her!
