Travis Scott Burger I got the Travis Scott burger and honestly it wasn't much of a hit. It very well could have been the people who made it, (It was literally a quarter pounder with lettuce and two one inch long pieces of bacon). It just wasn't worth the price. The workers, even if they were underpaid, charged for another burger, gave sickenly sweet instead of unsweetened tea, and made us wait as the cashier cleaned her nails. Not super exciting for 6 bucks.
