I need help to turn my room into a vibe room I got a pretty small room. I will post a link to a pic of my room in the comments. But I want some cheap affordable things that can turn my room into something cool. I already plan on getting a new desk once I save up enough for one. But if you guys (or girls) have anything that either you have or think I should get, link it down in the comments. Thanks.
