Just realized my parents were right After 4 years i finally realized that my parents were right about how much someone you hang around influences you. My friend that I've known since preschool is like a piece of shit now, like as in self centered narcissistic degrading piece of shit, and in many other ways. But when he started being like that we were still best friends yada yada but i was thinking and he made me the way i am today.. Like im not bad like him, but im pretty self centered and say fucked up shit that i don't mean and i could've and should've been a completely different person than I am today because of that piece of shit and I hate myself for not listening to my parents. I should've just stopped talking to him and I wouldn't be a piece of shit like I am today.
