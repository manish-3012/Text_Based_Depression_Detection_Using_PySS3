I really need some friends Hi there, fellow redditors! I'm a portuguese 15 y/o boy, so I'm sorry if my english is bad

I have depression for almost a year now, and one of the main reasons is my loneliness. I only have 4 friends, and I could REALLY use some more, so message me if you wanna talk or something. I'd be very very happy.

I didn't make this post for karma or anything, I just really need some friends, so pls message me, and thank you for your time
