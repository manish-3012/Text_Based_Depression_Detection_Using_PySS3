I'm 15, and have a weak chin! Bruh, this sucks, I know I'm only 15, but a weak chin? Man, it sucks. I'm sure it may grow out in the future, but I'm literally the only person that has in in my family, and if it doesn't grow out, then I'm fucked. 
      I've already had braces, and have straight teeth, I also have a permanent metal retainer wire on both the top and bottom front teeth. 
      The only real reason I'm posting this is in the hope someone will reassure me that I will have a chin. Please, be that person lol.
