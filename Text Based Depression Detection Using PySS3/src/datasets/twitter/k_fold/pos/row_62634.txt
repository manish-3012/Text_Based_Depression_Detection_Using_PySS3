Dating as an autistic teen. Hey there, Im 15, male, from Europe. About a month ago I got diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, which meant I was already on the spectrum. Haha guess what my psychologist said... I might have aspergers aswell. And shes pretty sure I have aspergers but the final diagnosis isnt there yet.

Htf am I supposed to date with aspergers? No, its not cute and its not cool. I hate how my parents talk to me soo â€œchildishlyâ€ now. Im still the same person I was before diagnosis but now they treat me like some sort of a child.

Im scared that girls dont like me at all now. And yes, due to aspergers it is hard for me to understand if girls dont like me or if they like me. Soo there was this situation about a year ago where i tried to get a date with this girl. I kept pushing it even tho she didnt want it. Due to aspergers i never realised it might seem that i am acting like a creep. I would have never thought its wrong. Thats what autism does to me and thats why i am scared of dating any further.

Any tips from fellow aspies or neurotypical teens who have had relationships with aspies?
