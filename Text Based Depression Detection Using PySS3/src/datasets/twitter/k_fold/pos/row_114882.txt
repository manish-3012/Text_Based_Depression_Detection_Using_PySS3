I have been working out for the past month or so! It's always been hard for me to be continuously exercise, but I'm doing it! I've kept it up for a month and I'm proud of myself! I think what kept me going this time was I finally got to a point where I was tired of staring at my stomach sticking out and constantly sticking it in. I'm not the largest person, only 5'5" ish and 150 pounds pre quarantine, but it was annoying.

Anyways, I started working out and even though my stomach is still basically the same size, only a little smaller, I'm more happy with it:) but I somehow gained 24 pounds from when I'm starting even though I've been dieting, eating less, and exercising so IDK WHATS HAPPENING!!

Thanks for listening, just wanted to share :)
