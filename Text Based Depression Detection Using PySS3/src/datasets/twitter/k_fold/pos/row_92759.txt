My school goes Hybrid starting tomorrow. So the deal was that we would have online for 1st quater and re-evalate the next quater for what we were going to do. Covid cases have actually increased and we are still going back... Either way there are several regulations to follow such as certain paths, no drinking fountains, masks, ect. so thats good... also now I gotta fix my broken sleep schedule.
