To the furries reading this, start saving the money you would spend on porn commissions This isn't some anti-furry or anti-porn post. You can yiff all you want. Infact, I'm here to improve that experience. If every furry stopped spending big bucks on furry porn commisions and started pooling that money, then they would be able to fund research into genetically engineering real life furries. Granted, some details would be up to debate, like how anatomically accurate should the cocks be, but overall it's a wise investment
