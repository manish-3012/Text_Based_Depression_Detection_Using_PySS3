My parents are trying to punish me for having a meltdown. So basically my parents (mainly mom) is trying to punish me because I had a meltdown at school (virtual) and left the zoom call. Yeah I know it sounds bratty but its because I am horrible with processing my emotions and all that and the meltdown was caused by me not understanding a question that was written because I just can understand a lot of questions of they are written or typed I need them verbally explained and I just had a meltdown and left and now my mom is trying to punish me.
