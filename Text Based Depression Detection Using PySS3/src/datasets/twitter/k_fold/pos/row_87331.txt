Hey! You! sorry for yelling at you I just want your attention (long post)

So my school is doing a project where we learn about the voting process and the election and my teacher is now hosting a ice cream election near the date the actual election is happening and my team is Vanilla ice cream and I wanted you guys to help us with our project #IceCreamElection2020 and i want you to go follow us on twitter and like all of our tweets and maybe shoutout the hashtag yourself I don't know you, I want you guys to help our school actually have fun with this project some of the tweets may be cringy but hey were just a bunch of kids. so please follow our team @E3Vanilla and if you want to help the other team its @E3Chocolate but if you do that you're a traitor, I am just saying this because I think my teacher would be pretty happy if this blew up.
