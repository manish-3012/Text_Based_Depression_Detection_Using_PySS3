I've decided that I'm gonna film my last/first day of senior year Given how things are going with the pandemic, the principal doesn't have a plan to get students back in the school. The only day he has for students to go back is the absolute last day of school. And after watching [this](https://youtu.be/yqI93R_e28A) video, I realized that I'm probably gonna never see most of those people ever again. So I want something to hold on to. also I've got a lot of things to say to a few people. Especially my crush. I still want an answer.
