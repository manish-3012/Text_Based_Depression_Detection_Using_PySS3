That Time I Went Overboard to Prank my Friend So I was playing with my friend one day and he asked if I got a Girl-Friend, I was going to say "no", but then I thought "Might as well prank him." So I said, "Yeah, her name is Katy" (Random name) and he was sorta shocked, b/c I don't have very good luck with girls, and he didn't really believe me.

So to convince him I created a Roblox Account (B/c it's free and we play Roblox a lot) and spent ~4$ on it, to make it look used, and not just a new account (Buying clothes, acceries etc). So when I was playing (on my computer) with him, I logged in using the fake GF account (on my tablet) and used both at once to make it look like it was real.

Things were going pretty well untill I called "her" Kathrine, then my friend was started getting more and more suspicous. Eventually he saw some texts between me and another friend. It pretty much revealed everything, and I was pretty much screwed. But I wanted to see how long I could keep it going. So I told him that the prank was another prank we were going to pull on him. I even edited the photos using Inspect Element to make it look legit. But he was still not conviced

So I had to do something drastic. I asked one of my friends (who's a girl) to pretend to be Katie (Me and my friend go to different schools, so he doesn't know anyone from my school) And it finally conviced him. This happened a few days ago, and thought I share it with you guys.
