Does anyone else feel the same abt the pandemic Okay so this post is about some hatred I have towards certain people in the pandemic but before i get into the bad I have a good thing I love about this shitty time period. Since some people are wearing masks I smell cigarette smoke ALOT less and I love it like thank you masks. Now for the hatred. Is it wrong that I  D E S P I S E people who don't take the pandemic seriously. Like I hate people who go places and don't wear masks or make an effort to social distance. I went to a restaurant and half the people weren't wearing masks or social distancing in line like UGH. How could some people be so dumb and inconsiderate
