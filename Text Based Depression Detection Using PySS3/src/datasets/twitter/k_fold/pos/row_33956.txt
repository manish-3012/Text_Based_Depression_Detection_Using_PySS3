Why do parents feel the need to invade my personal space 
Why do my parents feel the need to go in my room and open the curtains. I have them closed because I enjoy sitting in the fucking dark. I leave my room for 2 hours to go for a run I get back and my curtains and window are open and it actually annoys me because I hate when people touch my stuff. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d appreciate it if I went in their room and opened their windows. They then use the excuse I am too pale and not getting enough sunlight but Iâ€™m not gonna get anymore sunlight if you open the curtains because Iâ€™m just gonna close them again and get in bed. Then they have a go at me because I spend too much time locked in my room and itâ€™s unhealthy and a load of that crap. I understand they may think itâ€™s their job but I tell them so many times not to do it because it makes me anxious leaving my room unattended.
