Just wanted to share this dumb story about my finals lol Parents have super high expectations for my grades, completely unrealistic

I'm naturally terrified for my finals

Astronomy class and photography class don't have finals, thank god

Morality final is a total breeze

Get an email that the Math, Chem, and U.S. History finals are cancelled due to e-learning

Just my AP Language final left, its scheduled for the next day

My mom tells me how disappointed she'll be if I get anything less than an A

Stay up all night stressed

Wake up, get ready for final

I have the Zoom we're supposed to open to take the final in opened but it keeps telling me I can't get in

Email my teacher, email my classmates asking what's going on

Realize not only am I going to fail but I also won't be able to get a bunch of these scholarships that the class was going to get me

Legitimately consider running away from home

Sit locked in my room in utter despair, thinking about how I'm going to literally be disowned

Having a full major mental breakdown

About 3-4 hours into the mental breakdown I get an email

"Sorry for the delay, your AP final was cancelled."
