I'm overthinking this too much A friend of mine told me a friend of hers thought I was cute. She then sent me her insta and I started following her, she's pretty cute too. That was around 2-3 days ago. Yesterday we videocalled with a group and she was also there, she didnt say much since it was her first time in the group.

I just opened insta and went to messages. I'm now just building up the courage to dm her. I got my heart broken very recently so it's pretty hard rn I don't want that to happen again so now I'm just scared that if I get a connection with this girl it'll happen again
