I have asked my parents so many times my dad decided to order it finally But i had to wait all day for it to come and didn't come,checked the messages(since he messaged with my phone) to see what is happening , i didn't find any messages


And realized it was a DREAM A FUCKING DREAM,I fucking hate my life , why won't my brain let me be happy for once and not hype me for things that will never happen,everything in my life is going wrong and i can't distract my self in any way :(
