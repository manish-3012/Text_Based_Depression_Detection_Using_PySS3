What do you guys think of scheduling kisses? Like, 
â€œoh, letâ€™s kiss tomorrow in the end of the class...â€
I personally hate this things! I think kisses should be instantaneous, and thatâ€™s why they are so romantic! Today basically all the teenagers schedule kisses and I think thatâ€™s disgusting. What you guys think?
