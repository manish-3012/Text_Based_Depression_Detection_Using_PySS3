Are you ambidextrous? "About 90 percent of people are right-handed, says Corballis. The remaining 10 percent are either left-handed or some degree of ambidextrous, though people with "true" ambidexterityâ€”i.e., no dominant hand at allâ€”only make up aboutÂ 1 percentÂ of the population."

I wonder how it feels to be ambidextrous lol
