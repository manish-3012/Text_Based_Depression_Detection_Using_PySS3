Weird philosophical thoughts With the rise of the internet, would it be possible to create a desired manifestation of yourself online? And if so, would it even matter what you look like as a person? Iâ€™ve noticed that the only people who get weird/creepy advances and messages are those who post their actual self online, but if you disconnect your physical body from your stated body online, you donâ€™t get weird messages, and you lose any form of dysphoria or dysmorphia that you may have had irl. Seems like a win-win to me
