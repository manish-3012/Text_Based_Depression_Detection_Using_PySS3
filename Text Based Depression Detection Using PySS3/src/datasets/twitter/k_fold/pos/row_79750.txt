I constantly see people being like â€œWhY dOeSnT pUbErTy GiVe Me FaCiAl HaIrâ€ trust me you donâ€™t want it Itâ€™s so annoying because it grows back so quick and you have to shave it and sometimes you make cuts and people make fun and you also get red marks which looks like acne. Also everyone makes annoying  comments on it such as family members and stuff and itâ€™s super frustrating. Sure hair near your poop hole is gross I understand but thatâ€™s better than facial hair because it can be hidden. So for me personally itâ€™s awful especially since I donâ€™t like the idea of beards, so I donâ€™t wanna hear any more complaining
