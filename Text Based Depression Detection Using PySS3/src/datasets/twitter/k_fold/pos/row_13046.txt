My 'Ben Shapiro destroys feminist' phase just ended. Months ago I found out about ben and I was f-ing obsessed to the point that I would watch his videos in between of my online classes. Well ...now I'm not obsessed with him and sucking him off on Twitter, and I can understand certain situations where he is just total shit. I still support the right but not to point where I am just sucking them off. I have changed my stands on certain topics and now I'm not pissed off when someone challenges my opinions. I feel more open minded and happier than ever.
