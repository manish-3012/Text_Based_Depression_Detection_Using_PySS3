Using this sub as a diary day 6 So. Today was really normal just could keep my mind on letting all of this behind, I'll start school tomorrow and I'm not stressed or angry about that that's is strange but sure welcome...tomorrow I'll search for a way to hide my money and keep it up

Rating my day 6/10 no mayor sad or happy event to resaltate but let's see tomorrow
