DON'T FORGET TO WEAR A HELMET IF YOU'RE RIDING A BIKE, SCOOTER, SKATEBOARD, ETC. I see way too many people without helmets on. It only takes one mistake and you've got brain damage which is something you don't wanna deal with, so don't ride anything without wearing one. You've only got one life and you don't want to throw it all away just because you didn't put a helmet on. Be smart and stay safe out there. That's it
