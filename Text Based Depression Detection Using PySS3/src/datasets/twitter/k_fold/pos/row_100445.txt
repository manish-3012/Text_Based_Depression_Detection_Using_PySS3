I know I'm being childish but don't know what else to do So I've had this small issue with my boyfriend for a couple weeks/months that I have to initiate every conversation, call, date, etc. I've talked to him, he's acknowledged it, fixed it for a couple hours then gone back to normal. So now, immaturely I've started "giving him a taste of his own medicine" by not starting conversations either.

(Edit: for the record I'm extremely introverted and shy so starting these sorts of things is difficult for me, and it just feels like he doesn't care enough about me or enjoy talking with me, even though that's probably not true)

So basically we don't talk other than in the morning, and he seems concerned about me- but obviously it's not "omg this is what I've been doing to you I'm so sorry" but rather "life must be really stressful for you lately, we should meet up since that usually helps."

I know I should directly tell him what my issue is but I HAVE and he just forgets about it the next day. I've tried wording it every way I can think of, he fully understands what the issue is but just can't bring himself to fix it. 

Even then it's not a "he's too busy" issue, since he plays games and talks on the phone with his friends (multiple calls, multiple friend groups) daily. 

I just don't know what to do. Am very emotional right now and obviously not being rational so if anyone has any (rational) advice it'd be greatly appreciated.
