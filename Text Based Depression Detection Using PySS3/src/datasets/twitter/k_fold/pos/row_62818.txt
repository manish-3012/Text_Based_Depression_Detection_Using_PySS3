so I posted this somewhere but got no replies I need advice lol okay so Iâ€™m gonna preface this with the fact that Iâ€™m talking about my ex girlfriend but I absolutely do not want a relationship. We started sixth form together and I was struggling to feel like I fit in and became over dependent on her, and her anxieties became a lot as well. It was toxic towards the end, she called it off, absolutely fair enough, Iâ€™ve learned from it and am definitely better off for it and Iâ€™m sure she is too. No bad blood we met up a few times after and talked things over and we remained friends for months after. Was flirty for a period in February and then it was more friendly until lockdown. But then we just drifted, no argument or nothing. A conversation or two but it wasnâ€™t the same as just weeks before.

Now schools started again and Iâ€™m in the same classes a lot of the time and itâ€™s just so awkward, cold even. We canâ€™t look each other in the eye. Thereâ€™s been times where Iâ€™ve been quite close to her and thought about trying to talk but just got tongue tied or hesitant. Every logical part of my brain is telling me to just respect the distance weâ€™re keeping from each other for now. Ultimately I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s anything I can or even should do but it feels good to articulate my thoughts on it. Thanks reddit.
