I cant believe it... So for a short time now I liked a girl pretty much. We chatted quite much and I wasn't sure what she might think. 
I let her know that there was one thing I wouldnt tell her that time. 
She could find it out by guessing. I gave her a few tips and after a time she found out. 
She found out that I liked her. I was very scared and didnt know what she might think but lucky for me she feels the same. I'm so happy right now.

Btw my English is bad, cant express exactly what I feel etc.
