Why don't people like online learning? As the title says, why don't people like online learning? Everytime someone brings that up everyone is like "yes, let's hope them schools get opened asap" and also I've heard about protests recently in Italy I believe. As a student in STEM, I can honestly say it's been a lot easier, I can rest properly, I get better grades (with no cheating, at least at the classes I care about), I go out more,and I honestly think I improved as a student. And also, WHY THE FUCK risk lives just because? I mean, back in April and May most parents didn't want their children to go to school, and they started protesting (at least where I live), and now all parents want their children to go to school. I mean, do they really hate theirs kids so much that they got sick of them, or what? And all my classmates agree, online school is better.
