Some venting about life I can't handle life anymore. I've been alot happier, but my parents have made my life hell. Every other day I am yelled at or cussed out by my dad for a unparalleled amount of reasons. He'll call me a "Fucking idiot" or other things similar to it alot. It hurts me but I force myself to keep a straight face in fear yelled at more. Admittedly, I get alot, and I probably don't do enough chores as I should, but I just can't see it being justified? Maybe I am in the wrong here. It makes me relapse with suicidal thoughts and makes me lose all motivation to do anything, including playing online or talking to friends. I hate life sometimes because of them. I don't have motivation to work because I am screamed at for not having all my work caught up. I am debating telling my mom everything here. Me and her both know that me and my younger brother are the only thing holding my parents marriage together. She even said that if she got the chance she'd leave him behind and buy a home on the beach. My mom is alright, she does yell at me or call me things sometimes, but she is definitely the most understanding of the two. It's either that or sit here feeling like nothing until I get old enough to leave home. Add onto everything, my dad has said if I ever get him jailed or he ever caught me trying to commit suicide, he'd kill me.
