I just closed Reddit to open it again. I was just scrolling, and I decided Iâ€™m done with Reddit for now. So, I closed it. Not only did I do that, but I double clicked my home button and completely removed the app from multitasking. Then, about half a second later, I just tap the app again. 

Bruh.
