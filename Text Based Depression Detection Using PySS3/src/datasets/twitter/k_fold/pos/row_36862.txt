Instagramâ€™s algorithm changed and Iâ€™m really fuckin mad Now my explore page just shows similar things to what I post, which is photography. But what I actually want is tumblr &amp; Reddit reposts &amp; stuff like that. I archived all my posts &amp; my explore page is STILL shit, and for some reason Iâ€™ve got â€œtik tok starsâ€ on there??? I donâ€™t even like tik tok. Who tf is Chase Hudson??? Fuck Instagram.
