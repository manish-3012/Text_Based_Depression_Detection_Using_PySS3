Day 16 of watching scary movies in celebration of Spooktober Today i'm watching Babysitter. It may sound like a boring girls' movie (no offence to girls seeing this), but it's really cool. I have seen it and it's sequel before. It's about a nerdy boy who stays past his bedtime and finds out that his Babysitter and her friends are part of a cult. I recommend it.
