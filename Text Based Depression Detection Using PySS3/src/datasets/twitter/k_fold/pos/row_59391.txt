I am always starting the conversation with my crush and I am not sure she is into me I am gonna try to keep this short and simple, but I feel like my crush just isn't into me, its always me that tries to start up a conversation, and we talk for about 15 or 20 minutes and then nothing. It just makes me feel bad that she probably doesn't feel the same way. If anyone has any advice on what I should do, or if I should do anything, please let me know.
