My minecraft dolphin died Now, look. I could be cliche and make a post about "boo hoo my minecraft dog died", but no. My goddamn dolphin was killed. His name was Fluvannia, and I had a pool just for him with a bunch of other cool tropical fish in it...Long story short, I killed my friend's foxes (he said he was keeping them as slaves of a certain nature so I was doing them a favor) and I got imprisoned. And then he went to my base and fucking killed Fluvannia dolphin. Now I have a memorial for fluvannia dolphin, but, like, I can't just replace Fluvannia godammit. Like, what did Fluvannia do to deserve death? Why did he have to kill Fluvannia? And he also killed my fucking fish.

Now, I get people who love their minecraft dogs and other stuff, but Fluvannia dolphin was everything to me...And he's now gone.
