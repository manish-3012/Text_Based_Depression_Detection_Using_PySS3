Why are people so godamn possessive over things they don't own So I have one friend who's getting on my nerves if he tells me about a song and catches me listening to it, he literally asked me "why the fuck are you listening to that I'm the one who told you about it" or the most recent one he found a small streamer he brought me in to the stream to make fun of other people and have fun anyway he's a mod and now I f I try to watch this man's stream or give him bits to support a smaller streamer he just bans me without reason and once again word for word said "go find another streamer watch ninja or something"
