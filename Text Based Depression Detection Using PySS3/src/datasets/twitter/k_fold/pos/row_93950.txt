Masturbation is okay! I wanted to come here and say this because women are shamed for masturbating and i want to tell you that its okay to do so. I thought it was disgusting for so long, but it isnt. Its normal and so many girls do it, they just dont talk about it because it is considered taboo. I have never told anyone i masturbated because its considered disgusting. I still dont tell people but i know its okay to do that.
