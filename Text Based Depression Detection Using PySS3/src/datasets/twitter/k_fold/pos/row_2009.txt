I'm turning 18 tomorrow and I don't know how I feel about it. It's my 18th tomorrow (Happy Birthday to whoever was born on the 9th aswell!) and I don't know if I'm ready to be 18. I'll be able to get my driving licence but I can't believe that I'll be trusted on the roads. It feels like I'll have so much pressure I'm not ready for. Anyways, this is my last post as a 17 year old, Goodnight!
