How do you move on from someone So every time Iâ€™m rejected/something else I instantly move on to like another person, but this time I want to move on and focus on myself. I donâ€™t know if I want a relationship, and I want to focus on school and sports.

I donâ€™t ***want to*** like anyone right now, and I think itâ€™s always like this:

Like someone - be awkward around her - think that I might have a chance - ask out - rejected. And I just want to take a break from pursuing people at the moment.

I donâ€™t think the post was too long but in summary
TLDR: I want to focus on myself HOW?
