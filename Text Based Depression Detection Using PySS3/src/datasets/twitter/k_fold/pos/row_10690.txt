Am I the only one that can't study like, LITERALLY can't force myself to study. I've been pretty consistent tbh up until last year in six months or so I'm going to start my senior year in high school and as much as I'm afraid I literally can't study I have exams this month I'm studying with absolutely no soul in me any advice for this odd situation?
