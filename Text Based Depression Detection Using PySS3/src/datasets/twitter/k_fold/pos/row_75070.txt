anyone else want to be a pipeline/oilsands worker in the future? almost all the men in my family have worked in the oil sands, my grandpa, my dad, my uncle, and more, and it's crazy good money, I think my grandpa made about $300k a year for only going over there to work a few months of the year, he was a boss im pretty sure tho so thats why his pay was so high, I plan on going out and getting a job as a welders helper and you can start off making $70k-$100k a year, it'll depend, but after a few years working there you'll almost always be pulling home at least a hundred racks a year, right now im working full time doing labour work and making pretty good money at it and then in a few months I gotta go back to school for half a year, so by the time I graduate I'll have more than enough experience to easily land a job out there, im pretty fucking excited, here I come supercrew f350 dually with an 8ft box and leather interior
