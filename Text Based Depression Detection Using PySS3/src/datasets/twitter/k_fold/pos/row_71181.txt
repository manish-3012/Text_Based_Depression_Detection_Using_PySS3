I just got an idea I'll come out to my friends with a joke:

Me: "You know why I don't know how to do maths?"

Frens: "Why don't you know how to do maths?"

Me: "I'm nonbinary"

It's gonna be really funny and they'll laugh and I can be like "No really I'm nonbinary" and they're like "oh that's cool also you're really funny do you wanna go on a date" and I'm gonna be like "hell yeah, also I'm bi" and they're gonna be like "that's cool too, I'm straight but if it makes you better at dating then we can go on a practice date" and I can help them come out as bi too and we can get married and have pies cuz it's pi day and we have too much sugar and we play Smash Bros together and we make the pun like "haha smashing the homies" and I was like "lol what if" and then we actually smash and it's wonderful and we laugh and look at a rainbow and the credits roll as we sip coffee together
