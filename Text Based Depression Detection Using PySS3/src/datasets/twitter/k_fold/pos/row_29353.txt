A realisation So I just watched my dad get in a long screaming argument with  mymom and a rather sad realisation came to me.

No matter what I will never see this man show a shred of humility and admit fault for anything. 

My dad is a rhetorical genius. 
He could argue for anything and come up on top .
But he  uses his talent to dominate any conversation that's even slightly emotional to the point where its point less to talk to him about it. 

He is also incredibly emotional. If he feels that he's been wronged in anyway.he will  retaliate with a "how dare you say that to me" and then shame the person for daring to be mad at him the first place.


I've completely given up on reasoning with him that is point.

After 19 years I've come to the conclusion that he will probably never change. 

Family huh
