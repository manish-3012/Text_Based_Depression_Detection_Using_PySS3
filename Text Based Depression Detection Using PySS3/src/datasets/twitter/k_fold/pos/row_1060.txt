So guys I screwed up last night and the consequences happened today So this happened last night, I was is the mood to pleasure myself, but I didn't have any lotion near me, so I ran to the bathroom to see if there was any, and yes there was. So I pumped a little bit onto my hand, and went back to my bedroom. I finished up, watched some YouTube and went to bed.

Now I wake up this morning, with my penis on fire, it hurt so bad. So I went to the bathroom to take a shower, it helped a little bit, but not enough to stop the hellfire that was going on. 

I checked the lotion I had used, it's face wash lotion for your skin it has hyaluronic, which is meant to dry out the skin. Of course the moron I am used it to to jerk off, and now I'm paying for my consequences. 

I now have it on ice which is helping enough to where I can type this without issue.

TL;DR: I used face wash lotion to jerk off, now my penis is on fire.
