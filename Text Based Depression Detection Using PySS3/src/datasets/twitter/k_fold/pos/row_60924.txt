Idk i just need help I used to identify as lesbian but now I identify as more of a bisexual? The thing is I would never have s!x with a guy butt Iâ€™d date him, Iâ€™d kiss him but the thought of doing ðš’ðš with a guy makes me wanna puke, my entire life Iâ€™ve only ever seen myself marrying a women and thatâ€™s how I want it I WANT to marry a women and do stuff with a women but idk, half my school knows me as a lesbian and idk how to go back from that ðŸ•¶ðŸ•¶ðŸ¤
