guys, we are immortal. the soul is energy. energy cant be created or destroyed, it is just transferred. so when we die, we are transferred to another organism. we dont have any memory of our past life because memories are stored in the brain. our soul is our personality, which explains why there are always bad people in this world. we are all immortal, our bodies are not, but we, WE, our souls, our character, US, are.
