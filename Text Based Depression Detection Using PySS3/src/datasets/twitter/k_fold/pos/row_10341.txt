Why can i never just actually *look* like i have musles I would consider myself in shape - the rest of my body looks pretty strong visually but for some reason my arms, the part that people judge you the most for, donâ€™t. Itâ€™s annoying asf and my arms arenâ€™t even weak, they just look like it for some reason.
