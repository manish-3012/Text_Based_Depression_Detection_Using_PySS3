So I've had 5 boyfriends... So imma just explain them all so you can see how bad it was.  

1. Genuinely nice and cute and the best one I had 
2. Horny as shit
3. Ghost
4. He was 15
5. He's on this sub and he's weird

Well, it wasn't really bad. The horny dude was the worst. It was horrifying. 

*Please help me all my sanity is gone*
