Need some advice on family stuff For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve never been the favorite child. Iâ€™m 13, my brother is 16. I know this sounds dumb to complain about, but honestly everyday for 13 years gets to you.

Iâ€™m still treated well, (mainly from my mom :/) but my dad absolutely is nicer to my brother.  My supposed bed time is 10:30, which doesnâ€™t make any sense because I get up at 9 for school so apparently I need 11 hours of sleep. 

Anyway, here are the list of â€œoffensesâ€

From when I was really little, I can remember waiting to play on the Xbox with my dad, but he was busy playing with my brother. I would ask when we could play and heâ€™d say â€œsoonâ€. Heâ€™d make me wait for hours until it was time to go to bed, and me being an innocent little kid asked at bedtime â€œwhen are we going to playâ€. I donâ€™t remember what he answered, but obviously nothing noteworthy.

Heâ€™s always had a history of getting really mad at me, and while I am more vocal than my brother it still doesnâ€™t line up. For example, if I would speak to loud while heâ€™s watching a movie (yes) heâ€™d probably get mad at me and say some dumb shit like â€œIâ€™m trying to watch a movie!!â€. 

More recently, when â€œbed timesâ€ come into the mix, heâ€™s a giant douchebag. My bed time is 10:30, my brothers is 11:30. I stay up to 11:30, Iâ€™m a war criminal. He gets mad at me and says whatâ€™s your excuse this timeâ€ (I was up late yesterday because I was waiting for the hot water so I could take a shower). Yet not even a week ago, my brother was up until 1 am and my dad never said a thing. When my dad caught my brother doing homework at 1 am, he just said â€œkeep up the good workâ€. If I did homework that late, heâ€™d say â€œdo it before playing gamesâ€. (my brother played games before his homework)

Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m explaining my situation in the most clear way, but itâ€™s so annoying. Iâ€™ve even tried telling him that I think heâ€™s being unfair, and he says the typical â€œI love you both the sameâ€ bullshit. My dad grew up without a dad, but honestly Iâ€™m starting to think heâ€™s the lucky one here.

Any advice on what to do? Itâ€™s going to be a long 5 years...
