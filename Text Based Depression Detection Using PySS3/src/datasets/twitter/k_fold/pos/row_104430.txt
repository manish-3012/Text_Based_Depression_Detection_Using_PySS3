I Found The World's Most Endangered Animal And I Need Your Help Saving Them Hi! I'm Ben for a school project we had to make a film about the ocean. I was shocked to learn that nobody else in my class had heard of a Vaquita before so thats what I decided to do mine on. The video is about how even though there are only 10 left, there is still a way we can save them. I was hoping you guys could check out the video and see if you think my idea is good or not. If you like my idea, please share the video to spread awareness for the vaquitas? Also I want to turn my Youtube Channel into a full on big ocean animal themed channel so I would love it if you guys would subscribe so you could see my next videos too!

Thank You!
