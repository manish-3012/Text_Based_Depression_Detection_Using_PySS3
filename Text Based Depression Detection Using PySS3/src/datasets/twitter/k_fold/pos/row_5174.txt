Today the dumbest thing happened to me and I did practically nothing. On Wednesday, I took a Spanish exam on Schoology and I had two minutes remaining with one question left. No problem right? Well I wrote my answers down on a sheet of paper (because I need to write shit down to retain it) and as I was about punch in my answers on Schoology, my browser closes and shows me that there was an unexpected error and I that I needed to restore my tabs which I did as quickly as possible. But by the time I got back into Schoology, my teacher had already closed the test. 

I immediately emailed her multiple times asking what should I do and that if she could reopen the test, I could put my answers in and call it a day. She failed to respond to me until ONE WHOLE ASS DAY later. Then she told me that since it had been one day she cannot trust that my answers are authentic and now I am being forced to retake the entire exam again on Monday. I am a junior and I had three tests this week alone and god knows how next week is gonna go. I really just don't know what do. The first quarter had me completely burnt and I am so close to giving up. Anyway I thought I should let y'all know and see what you think. 

I'll be taking a nap  so yea.
