If you pretend you have technical difficulties in online classes because you haven't studied, fuck you Whenever I am in class almost every time someone has technical difficulties its when the teacher asks them a question or we had an exam. Of course in the begging the teachers tolerated it, but now after so many people get so many issues every day they can't  differentiate between people faking their issues and actual ones so if you have an actual problem with your machine that day then too bad! You are getting an absence and possibly even a low grade if you had an exam that day and there is nothing you can do about it.


I personally have a pretty shitty laptop with bad connection so sometimes the teacher can't understand what I am saying, and two times now has it just refused to work properly during an exam and due to it I can't finish and then I get a low grade because teachers assume I am faling it so I can get out of doing it for the day.


So if you fake technical issues just to get out of trouble, fuck you, don't make people who actually have problems suffer because of your mistakes and incompetence, just fucking own up to it when you get asked a question you can't answer instead of pretending your microphone doesn't work.
