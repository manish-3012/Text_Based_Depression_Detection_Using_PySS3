so I fucked up didn't realise they blocked me for an *entire* month aight so basically there's this person I knew from primary school and after noticing them on Instagram I finally decided to say hi  after *2 years*. I say something vaguely funny and she replies "lol" . now any normal human being would think that I should say something positive in response. 

but nope

I need to be quirky and unique so I , in a waaaaay harsher tone than I meant, make the *super original* point that lol is a mild inconvenience to reply to.

she stops talking. my stupid ass thinks nothing has happened and only a month later I realise I sounded like a MASSIVE jerk with a short temper who can't go 30 seconds without getting mad about some minute detail. 

god I hate myself.

just to clarify no I do not and have never had a crush on her, but she was a good friend and it rly sucks that my stupidity ended it with a single text
