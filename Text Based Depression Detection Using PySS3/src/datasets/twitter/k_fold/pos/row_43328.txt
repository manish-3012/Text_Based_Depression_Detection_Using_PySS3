Don't cheat please If you're gonna cheat just break up. Idc if you're 2 weeks in, 2 months, 2 years, hell idc if its your bachelor/bachelorette party, don't ever cheat on someone.. they'll get over the pain of the breakup but the pain of being cheated on creates permanent scars..don't ever do that to somebody.. The short amount of pleasure you'll get from cheating is not worth all the pain and hurt it brings..please listen to this and never, ever hurt someone like that
