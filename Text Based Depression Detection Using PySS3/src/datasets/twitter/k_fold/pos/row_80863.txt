I've gotten depressed again So I already made a few posts about the matter, and so as a quick recap: I got depressed because my life was going shit, and ended up with me trying to commit suicide, I did, but I got saved by my parents last minute. Well, every time I got depressed in the past I had suicidal thoughts, but I never did anything, apart from what I did a few weeks ago. Now I've gotten depressed again, and I'm scared that I'll try to do the same thing once again. So I'm just asking for some advice or some nice comment that could make me smile, and make my day a bit better. Thank you :)
