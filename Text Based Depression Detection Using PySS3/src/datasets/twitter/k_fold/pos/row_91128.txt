What do I do here So me and this girl have been talking for about  month and have hung out a few times and weâ€™ve also each said we liked each other. But about 3 days ago on her snap story she posted a vid that goes like this-

Girl 1: â€œHe seems really different..Like he actually likes meâ€

Girl 2:â€We never learn..Weâ€™ve been here beforeâ€

My question is do I bring this up because it definitely seems like itâ€™s about me or do I just not talk about it.

Sorry in advance for grammar.
