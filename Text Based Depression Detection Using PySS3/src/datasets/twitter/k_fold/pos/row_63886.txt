You know the song â€œMy Favorite Thingsâ€ from the Sound of Music? The lyrics say, â€œWhen the dog bites, when the bees sting, when Iâ€™m feeling sad, I simply remember my favorite things and then I donâ€™t feel so bad.â€

But what exactly do you do when your favorite things remind you of a former partner because you shared every part of those things with them for so long? Or when your favorite â€œthingâ€ (person) was your partner?

I recently parted with someone (around 2 months ago) who meant the world to me. I shared every inch of my current life with this person for over 2 years. Even though I know the break up was for the best because it became emotionally abusive and some of my friends begged me to leave because of how it was affecting me, it still affected me to the point where Iâ€™ve been really depressed and unable to sleep.

With the pandemic and my illness trapping me away, I canâ€™t really move on to better things... Everything I do has my partner carved in the memories. They even taught me my current favorite hobby.

I canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t stop crying randomly throughout the day, and I canâ€™t focus on other things because other things remind me of them. Iâ€™m constantly reminded of the good, the bad, and the worst of the relationship.

On top of that, I feel guilty for missing them and wanting them back when it was an emotionally abusive relationship. I shouldnâ€™t want them back, but I do... I donâ€™t know why my mind and heart are still holding onto them.

My depression over this has gotten worse during the holidays.

I feel like Iâ€™m stuck in a really dark place and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do if I stay here... I just want out.
