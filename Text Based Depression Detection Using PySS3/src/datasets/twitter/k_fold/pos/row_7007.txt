Important thing :) If youâ€™re a man Iâ€™m gonna need you to never approach a woman whoâ€™s alone at night time. Donâ€™t care what your intention is - unless itâ€™s an emergency, donâ€™t. You probably have no idea what the jolt of cold terror and/or the gnawing dread feels like in these situations. Thanks.
