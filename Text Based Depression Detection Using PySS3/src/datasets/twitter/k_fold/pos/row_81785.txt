There are roaches at this Hilton Hotel! The title says it all, this is a fucking Hilton hotel Iâ€™m staying at and there are fucking roaches!

My fatherâ€™s trying to get a refund and if he doesnâ€™t then heâ€™s telling the press, he spent good money and there are ducking roaches.

Edit: got a refund, thank god!
