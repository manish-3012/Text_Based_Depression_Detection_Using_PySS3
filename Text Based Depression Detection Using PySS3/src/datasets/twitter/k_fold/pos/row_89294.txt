Just wanted to ask am I the only person that feels sadness inside while reading a book? I just feel like there are hidden dreams that a human can't achieve and it makes me sad. Please don't comment something like "yeah man I'm depressed too" because this is already annoying. I'm not depressed okay? I just feel like my dreams are beyond my reach.
Am I the only one? 

And if not, what do you guys do to feel better?
