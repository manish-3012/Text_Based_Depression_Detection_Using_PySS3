Something I started to look into &amp;#x200B;

So I recently started my senior year of highschool and let me just say, its extremely exciting and scary at the same time. I'm extremely proud of myself and feel great about it. My life is pretty damn good to say the least, I have a loving family and great friends things, are just fairly good in general. But here's where I fall short.

It's extremely common, and probably has been posted many times again and again. I've been single my entire life, and quite frankly, it's slowly starting to get to me. I've been fine with it for the most part, it isn't the worst thing in the world, but as soon as school started something clicked. I see everyone happy in their relationships and keep seeing posts on other social media showing couples, and they make me feel jealous to say at the very least. Jealousy doesn't scratch the surface of how it makes me feel.

Now I will admit, it's extremely lonesome and I even get really sad about it (I don't get sad easily). I have no problem talking to girls by any means, and I'd say I'm pretty attractive, so neither of those things are the problem here. I currently don't necessarily have a crush on anyone and if I did I wouldn't have a problem. My problem is finding people (specifically girls) and ESPECIALLY in these times. There are so many people at my school, a lot of girls that seem amazing and look amazing. They're all there right in front of me, yet somehow, I'm so far from them. It's hard to explain but I'm so close yet so far. I can't find a situation to meet any, and I don't want it to feel forced, like "HI YOU ARE CUTE LETS DATE" no, I want to build a solid friendship that way we can easily transition into dating and it won't be awkward.

Basically, I'm kinda sick of not having someone, yet it seems like I can't find anyone, and I kinda like the thrill of having a crush and talking to your friends about them. Any pointers or tips on how to FIND people to talk to would be great!
