Oh god being a kid is kind of messed up So uh family kinda going bonkers rn 

Yelling, cryin the usual ya know

So im downstairs and I hear my mom have a full on breakdown upstairs kinda telling a 12 year old to grow up cause she so incredibly tired and my brother trying to talk the sense into her. 

All i can think in that moment is "Does everyone in this household have a victim complex" What the fuck is wrong with me???????? Like did I just stop feeling empathy at some point?? Thats not a nice thought. I FEEL LIKE A NARRATOR. thats the best description i can give fr

Like im just takin in whats happening and just like "has it calmed down enough for me to go upstairs? I need to do homework" what the actual fuck though. I mean grades are due today so i can see why its such a big issue for me but oh my god I feel kinda fucked up. LITERALLY LIKE A NARRATOR WITH NO EMPATHY

so uh end of rant ig? dunno what else to say lol just ranting because reddit is reddit.
