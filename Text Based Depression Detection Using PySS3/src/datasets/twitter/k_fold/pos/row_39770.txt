As a 17 year old feminist Redditor, I see a lot of males and females trashing on each other. Online, we constantly shit on each other and feed into each otherâ€™s hatred as a joke. Until itâ€™s not. I donâ€™t stand for calling each other shit. Some radical feminists claim that calling men trash is right, but being a true feminist means standing for equality. Calling each other these names that put each other down ruins both sides of the argument. These radicals who say all men are evil and disgusting, I believe do not strive for true feminism. If you really want to win the argument, you shouldnâ€™t use these words against them. You should respond with silence. If no one cares about if â€œmen or women are trashâ€ then we can really be happy with each other. 

I would like to see the day where we can have civil discussions with each other without a male or female saying the opposite sex is â€œgarbageâ€, as they are not. We all are beautiful. 

What do you think of this?
