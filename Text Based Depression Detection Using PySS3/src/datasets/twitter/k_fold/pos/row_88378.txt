I really miss my friends... I really miss my friends, I miss seeing everyone's faces, their smiles. I miss being able to hang out with friends and have a good laugh while fucking around in the hallways of school or on our way home walking or on the bus,  I really just wish for one day things would go back to normal the next day, K just want to be able to meet my teachers and for a friendship with teachers and staff, make new friends and resolve problems that I had with people, make things right and make peace with everyone, looking back at time before the pandemic I just realized I was a big asshole and I wish coule apologize to everyone that I've either insulted or offended by accident, I wish we could go back in time to when everything was normal, we can only move forward in time, not backwards

Just thought I would get this off my chest
