HELP ME (going out with a guy) Hey everyone! I'm 17 and this is my first time going out with a guy since 4 years. Let me start off with some background information first. I met this guy about 4/5 year ago and we were friends for a while, then we started dating for about 8 months. I fell in love with him instantly but I was a kid so I just broke up with him because I want to "spice up" my life. We then didn't talk for about a year but reconnected during the summer of 2019 on Instagram. Since then, we've basically talked almost everyday. Keep in mind that I never sent him any of pics so he doesn't even know what I look like today because I've been super insecure about myself. The insecurity started a while after we broke up although he liked me even when I was ugly. He asked me out (idk if as a date or just friends) for next week. Im totally shitting my pants because what if he thinks im ugly? What if I don't know what to say or talk about? What if he realizes that he wasted his time with an insecure b\*tch like me all this time?

Idk why I keep overthinking things especially since he used to be practically in love with me when I was going through my awkward phase. But now that a lot of things changed about me physically (they became better), I just don't know what to expect his reaction to be.

Please give me advice on what to do on that date or if I should even go and also please throw at me any tips on how to be less insecure because I hate it about myself.
