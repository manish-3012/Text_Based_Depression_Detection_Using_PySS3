I have a crush on my best friends kinda girlfriend So I have this friend letâ€™s call him, Joseph (fake name Obvs), and he has an on and off again relationship with this girl, Cathy. Me and Cathy were good friends before the got together and we text everyday. I knew he liked her and she liked him and they helped them get together. Sheâ€™s one of my best friends and the only person who Iâ€™m bi, so Iâ€™m rly close with her. Today when I saw them together I felt like I had been stabbed and I realized that I had ended up liking her. It rly hurts cause sheâ€™s with joe and thereâ€™s nothing I can do without endangering both relationships so Iâ€™m rly sad.
