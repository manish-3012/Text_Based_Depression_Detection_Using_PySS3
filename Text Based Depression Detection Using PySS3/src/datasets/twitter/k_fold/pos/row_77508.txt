What do I do with my life? I havent done good in school since elementary, so when I turn 16 im going to apply for the GED thing and take it.

I just dont know what to do with my life and where to go. I would like to live in a van and take pictures for a living, but im afraid that might never happen... What would be a job or career i could pursue? I do have the ability to grow and sell weed for a living, but Im not sure how I would like that. r/vandwellers is basically how id love to turn out.
