I just realized that Iâ€™ve never had a crush in like forever Like even in middle school I never was crushing on any girls. I see girls and I think theyâ€™re cute or nice but Iâ€™m never focused on one specific girl. Itâ€™s just a weird thought, I wonder why I never developed those specific kinds of feelings for someone.
