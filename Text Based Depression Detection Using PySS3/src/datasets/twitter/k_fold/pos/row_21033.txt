Feeling hella nervous I just submitted my first college application/audition (I am applying to music school), and Iâ€™m really scared. Iâ€™ve been having this super anxious feeling that I straight up wonâ€™t get in anywhere and all my applications will be rejected. Is anyone else going through this right now?
