The guy I like might be gay I'm having a lil bit of a struggle moment because as the title says I really like this guy and he's really nice to me but I don't know if he's been trying to hint that he's gay and I'm just an idiot or if im reading way too far into things. Id want to be his friend anyway if he were gay because he's a great guy but I'm just confused.
