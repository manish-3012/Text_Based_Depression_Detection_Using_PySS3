So idk if I'm a douche or not My mom was at a beauty salon getting her eyebrows done, the lady there is very rude btw. Anyway, my mom brought up the cross tattoo I wanna get on my wrist, and the lady barged in our convo and said "no, people get tattoos there that have cut theirselves and have scars, they do it to cover them up" and like I was kinda shocked she just told me no about what I'm getting on my body that I did kinda a wtf and nervous laugh thing. More like those "excuse me?" Laughs ig. She then said "its not funny, I'm telling the truth. You can't get it there that's stupid".. I didn't do an LOL laugh so idk what made her think I thought it was funny, I was like wtf because idk you. Ig idk if I was actually a dick
