question for French native speakers or if you also study French at school do you really say  "Ã§a roule ma poule?" to say "how are you doing?" in a friendly context? and if not so, how do you say it? I mean no hate with this question, I'm just genuinely curious because I study french at school and my teacher gave this video with friendly expressions. thanks.
