I'm officially 16 So it was my birthday on the 27th I was trying to post some pictures but apparently you cant no more it's so to anyone wondering

My mom cooked steak it was my first time eating it considering in my home country it's more of a luxury food i.e restaurants and hotels I also had a pretty damn good chocolate cake and I got a $100 

I'm now able to legally drive as well but I wish I was able to celebrate with my friends from Dominica but they wished me happy birthday via WhatsApp so I'm happy enough
