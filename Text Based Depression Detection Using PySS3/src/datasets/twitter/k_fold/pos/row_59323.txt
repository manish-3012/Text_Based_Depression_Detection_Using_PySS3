I found her... A couple years ago this girl who I mad loved for transferred schools and by the time I found out she was, I couldn't ask for her snap because it was too late. I was definitely miserable to say the least. But finally after over a year she came to a football game of mine and we talked! It was easily one of the greatest nights i have had in a long time. (The final score of the game was 52 to 6 and we mercy ruled before halftime btw) But this morning I got a text from a friend of mine that gave me her snap code, so I added her and we talked all day. This is the happiest I have been in a long time and tbh I really kinda lost hope there, But I'm mad consistent and I just never forgot. I feel like I'm floating! 

Anyway that's about it, thanks for reading and I hope you guys are doing ok
