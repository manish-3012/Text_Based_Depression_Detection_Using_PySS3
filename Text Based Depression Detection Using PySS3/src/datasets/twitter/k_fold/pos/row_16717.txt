Should I tell him I like him? The guy I like has no interest in me, and I know I don't have a chance whatsoever. He isn't in a relationship, so I'm not disrespecting anyone. I just think it'd be nerve wracking but harmless enough. At the same time, this could be some stupid impulse thing. Idk what do you guys think?
