I miss feeling cute [after breakup] I have gone through a suuper shitty complication with my girlfriend (16y/o, been together for over a year) and weâ€™ve pretty much broken up. Neither of us wanted it, but it was for the better. (I wonâ€™t go into too much detail, she just became too dependant on me and I couldnâ€™t take the responsibility anymore.)

Now, Iâ€™m attempting to move forward. Itâ€™s going better than I would have expected, but itâ€™s not perfect. I particularly miss how she made me feel like I was super adorable and pretty. Iâ€™m a closeted femboy and only with her, I felt truly like myself (in this regard, at least). 

I am trying to get validation from myself. And yeah, to an extent I can- I try to remember things I like about myself and sort of give myself compliments. But it isnâ€™t enough. 

I would like to let out more of my inner self, to feel better- Wear a skirt / other cute and girly clothes, try shaving my legs and painting my nails etc., buuuut I am extremely embarrased and scared of what my family and other people would think...

I am pretty sure that being more feminine would help me feel better, because whenever I got a chance to cross-dress, it was amazingly freeing and nice!! But uuughhh, stereotypes and shit...

Anyway, not sure what I am expecting from this post. Just wanted to ramble and maybe talk to somebody...
