I hate when people are all like â€œstop bragging about your bad traits.â€ If someoneâ€™s actually bragging about their bad traits then obviously itâ€™s bad. I think itâ€™s good that people are aware of whatâ€™s wrong with them though. Thereâ€™s something wrong with everyone and the fact that theyâ€™re aware of it means their one step closer to getting help. If someone says they think theyâ€™re an asshole thatâ€™s better than someone whoâ€™s an asshole and isnâ€™t even aware of it. Yeah if the only thing theyâ€™re trying to do is brag about it then itâ€™s not okay. Itâ€™s just good that they have enough self awareness to know it
