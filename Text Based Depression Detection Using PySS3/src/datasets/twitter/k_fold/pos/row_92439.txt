Can you all plz help? [http://chng.it/HzMxDRjcYs](http://chng.it/HzMxDRjcYs)

We have all been affected by the pandemic. Our lives, studies, relationships disrupted. Our school has been conducting online classes and examinations for almost a year now. But for the final examination they have decided to call us all to school. We havent even been asked for consent. Our exams will be starting from 1st march and they told us all of this in february. We have less than a month to prepare. Plus we have to prepare for practical files, VIVA, ASl and we have got less than a month for all this.

Everyone feels nervous before exams no matter how much you have studied. And this time nobody is prepared. We all know how good online classes have been. In a situation such as this nobody is feeling comfortable in coming to school to give exams. 

Though the pandemic is slowing down it still hasnt gone and in india the number of active cases are still quite high. We tried talking to our school administration but they didnt listen. So we created a petition and are trying to get some signatures. I would be quite thankful if you would take a moment to sign the petition.

THnx in advance!
