Yay doggo So yesterday i had a dream that I had a dog ( I don't have a dog) it was so fucking awesome. It felt so real  i was amused. I never wanted to wake up. So i told my mom and she was like "you guys really want a dog " i said yeah. She said that when we are going to get a dog you guys have to take care of him. SO MOST I AM GOING TO GET A DOG! But idk when but i am very excited and happy. She also said we were going to get a  small white puppy. Yay!!!!!
