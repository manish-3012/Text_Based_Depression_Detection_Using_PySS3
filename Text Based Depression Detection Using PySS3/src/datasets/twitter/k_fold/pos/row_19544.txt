What are your serious thoughts on tiktok? Obviously plenty of Redditors hate it or feel obligated to dislike it. But Iâ€™m an open minded person, while tiktok does have many negatives, especially the fact that pretty teens doing 15 second dances get more clout than creative comedians on tiktok. But also, i think there are plenty of positives,  Iâ€™m not defending or going against either side but I think while it can be cringy, it can also be very heartwarming, hilarious and interesting. Hope I donâ€™t get downvoted to oblivion for saying my opinion that tiktok isnâ€™t that bad, lol
