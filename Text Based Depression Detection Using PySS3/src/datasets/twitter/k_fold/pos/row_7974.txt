Anyone else just feel directionless? I'm getting to the last year of high school and I'm terrified. I'm academically gifted and try my best to leave as many open doors as I can but this has worked against me as I'm very talented but just... disinterested. The only overlap is maybe with band but that's not something you can easily make a living off of. I'm wanting to spend my last year doing job oriented classes but I fear 18 weeks will be miserable if I don't like it. And it's really not like I can just go to college for something else, I'm not poor but I will have to pay some of my college tuition. Maybe it's just late and I'm worrisome, idk. Also probably tagged this wrong.
