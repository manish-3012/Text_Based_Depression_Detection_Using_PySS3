Why do you have to write essays for a test How TF am I supposed to write a perfect essay within 30 minutes? Why can't we just write an essay the normal way??? I mean, fuck I didn't even have time to look over it, and barely wrapped up the conclusion. Fuck I'm gonna have a stroke because I can already tell I'm getting a F for that
