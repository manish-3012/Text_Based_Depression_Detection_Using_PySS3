feelin lonely lol small rant. i just finished catching up to a great manga (horimiya) and now im feeling that emptiness after you finish binge reading or watching a manga or anime. whats worse is that the manga releases new chapters monthly, so I have to wait so long ;-;. luckily its airing an anime right now and episode 2 came out a few days ago, so I can still enjoy that while im getting used to waiting for new chapters. also the reason im feeling lonely rn is cuz i was looking at some pics of cute anime guys and now im sad that i don't have a bf or gf lol. hope ur doing well :)
