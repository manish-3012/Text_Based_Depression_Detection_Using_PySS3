canvas and tracking tabs I bet you all heard the rumor about canvas tracking tabs. it is partially true, if you go near the canvas sidebar or up to the adress bar it will say so in the logs it also means you could be inactive. it cannot, however tell what tab you opened, so you are not toatilly exposed. however, if you have a pattern of leaving for each question for a similar amount of time, you can get in trouble. What you should do is get a phone  or keep a doc with notes splitscreened to look at. however, do not make a habit as it makes teachers suspicious. canvas is spyware, as it does track your mouse however.
