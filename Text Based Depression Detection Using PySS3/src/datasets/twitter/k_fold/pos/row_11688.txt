Hey, I LOVE music and I recently tuned in to a country station and somewhat enjoyed it? From someone that enjoys indie rock, indie pop. What country bands do you recommend?! If you want a taste of my music, hereâ€™s my main one!

It consists of JoJi, Blossoms, HARBOUR, Claire Ernst, Tom Walker, Grady and more.

I just wanna make a country playlist for myself to enjoy but I donâ€™t know where to start! I like the â€œcurrentâ€ country music but I donâ€™t want to over listen to them yenno?
