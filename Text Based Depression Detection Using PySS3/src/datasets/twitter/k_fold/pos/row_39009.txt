Goodnight everyone I know itâ€™s probably not night for all of you but I just wanted to say goodnight soo yeah thatâ€™s all I guess. I feel like shit and hopefully I wake up better but I usually always feel like shit in the morning. I think getting too much sleep makes me wake up sleepier and I canâ€™t even get myself to brush my teeth(I do eventually though, ur probably thinking thatâ€™s nasty)
