By the horns of Baphomet, why are you fucken doing this to me? Seriously, why do I have to wait 15 minutes to comment something? I commented something, was looking through this sub for like 2 minutes, then I wanted to comment a different post. When I hit send, a snoo appeared and told me is be doing this 'a whole lot too much' and I'll have to wait 13 more minutes before giving another comment. 

I mean, this is a community with 2.100.000 members, with hundreds of posts uploaded per minute, and I'm given a whole 4 comments an hour?
