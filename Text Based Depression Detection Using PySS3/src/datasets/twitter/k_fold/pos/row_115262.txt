You may be broken. Cracked. Dulled. Dirty. Lost. One day youâ€™ll find the person who fills the crevasses left by people who blindly swing their axes, not realizing that theyâ€™re hurting you. One day youâ€™ll find the person who keeps you sharp, on your toes in anticipation of the days to come and the adventures that will follow. One day youâ€™ll find the person who makes you shine again like new even on the days when you feel like you donâ€™t deserve it. One day youâ€™ll find your person, and if you arenâ€™t looking then theyâ€™ll find you. Stay strong, weâ€™re all rooting for you.
