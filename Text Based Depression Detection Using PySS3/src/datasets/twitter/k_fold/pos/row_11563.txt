Anyone else think MatPat is incredibly annoying? It's like he saw what Michael from Vsauce did (essentially playing a parody character of himself in his later videos) and did the same, but very poorly.

A very small number of his "theory" videos cover interesting topics, and they're largely just clickbait-y and trend focused.

Plus, the way he talks and the way the show is animated just comes of as very childish to me, like his target audience is 6-12 years old, but he also tries to sound super intelligent when all he does is measure pixels and plug stuff into the quadratic equation.
