How do you guys meet girls/guys? I haven't had a girlfriend in a long ass time now (almost a year) but all my friends just find people so easy by using Instagram and other social media. How the hell does this work? Like they never knew the person before hand, they replied to an Instagram story and boom they had a gf after like a week, most of the time when I reply to insta stories the conversation goes for like an hour and then ends. What is their secret?
