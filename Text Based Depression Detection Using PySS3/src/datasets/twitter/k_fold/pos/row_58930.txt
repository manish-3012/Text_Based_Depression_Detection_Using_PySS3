Whatâ€™s ur favorite hero and villain dynamic Mines a bit basic but itâ€™s Batman and joker. Itâ€™s a simple concept but I love the idea that Batman has the ideals of not killing people while Joker wants to bring out the inner monster in Batman. Thatâ€™s why Joker never kills Batman, he tries to torture and torment him. Love the story between the 2, especially in the Batman Arkham games



Also I wanna give a honorable mention to Maul and Kenobi
