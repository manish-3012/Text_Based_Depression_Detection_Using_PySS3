I just realized that I'm a simp I was recently talking with my crush on training, when some of my friends pointed out that I'm really too nice/cheerfull to her, and that it smells like a simp.

After that, I was thinking while about it. I came to conclusion that he was right, but not just about her...
I was like that to everyone.

Always when I meet new people, (no matter gender or age) I'm extremly simping to them so they will like/respect me more.

I was thinking while about to change it, to start showing my "real face" to people, but I'm afraid that no one will really like me. That once I open up to them, they won't care about it and will ignore that.

I don't know what to do about that... 
I don't want to be like that anymore, but I don't want to lost friends who find me "cool" because I confirm each of rheir statements...
