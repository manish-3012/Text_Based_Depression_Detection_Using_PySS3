I kinda feel terrible I wasn't born later ... Like idk now ? Anyone else ? It's really weird, I think of everything I'm gonna miss out on because I'll either be dead or too old to enjoy, the amazing technologies we'll develop, colonization of mars, crazy virtual reality ... I kinda wish I was born in 2020 or even later, but here I am 17 and feeling like I'm getting old lel
