A tip for those who dont like dropping a load with someone else around So, you walk in a public washroom and it is completely empty. So a minute goes by and you're doing your business when someone walks in and now you cant shit because its gonna make a loud splash. What i do is i put a thin layer of toilet paper on the surface (maybe 2 thin layers) to absorb the shock from the turd. If done properly you can do what you need to do without making a sound. Im sure people already knew this but this is for those who didn't. You're welcome.
