A short poem or smth, idk, might delete later. Lonely Boy.


Lonely boy, lonely boy, where have you been?

Shut up in a house, staring at screens.

Lonely boy, lonely boy, why are you so?

It's 2020, hard to go out, you know.

Lonely boy, lonely boy, where are your friends?

You are an introvert, your friends are pretend.

Lonely boy, lonely boy, what do you long for?

A girlfriend, (like everyone else) to adore.
