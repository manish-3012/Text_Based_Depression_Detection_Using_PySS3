wait do americans actually have a whole class for just one type of math? (like trigonometry, or algebra)?? here in australia the class is just maths, and then it goes up to harder levels. you learn all different types of maths tho. like why would they have a whole class on just one specific type? idk seems kinda inefficient lmao
