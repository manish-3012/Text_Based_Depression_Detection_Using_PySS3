Hoi hoi! Do you have itchy and easily irrated skin? Do you have eczema or a skin condition that makes your skin easily irratated? Wel i got good new for you bud! Im no doctor by any means, but i am a guy who has eczema, so i guess it applies too:

1. DRINK WATER. AND I MEAN A LOT OF WATER. Water is quite nescessary for the rehydration of the skin. Id say about an average of 8 glasses a day, or better yet, a glass every hour of the day to keep yourself refreshed and rehydrated.

2.Use Lotion that helps rehydrate the skin. This one is optional, since not all people can buy a skin moisturizer cause they are EXPENSIVE AS SHIT, but for those who can, i reccomend you buy it. Apply it about every time
after you take a shower or a bath.

3. Use Cold or warm water for bathing. It feels good, and irritates your skin less than hot water.

4.Sleeping Gloves(Optional) This is for the people who unconsciously scratch their skin while sleeping, so when they wake up it feels like they accidentaly Scuba dived in a Lava lake. Wearing gloves helps solve that issue by preventing you from doing too much damage on your skin, since the gloves are made of cloth.


i guess thats all i have for you redditors, See you all next time!

Sincere Regards,
