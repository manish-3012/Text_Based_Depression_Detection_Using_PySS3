We gotta let ourselves laugh at imature jokes Today I watched captain underpants. I know, I'm 15 and the target demographic is like nine, but it's a great movie and I really enjoyed it. It's still a children's movie, but it's not bad, don't let the title influence you, it's actually very enjoyable. 
The main villain's name is professor poopypants. I know, I laughed. His goal is to make kids stop laughing because he has a funny name. Thru out the movie you get fart jokes, but they're not gross like most kids movies, you get toilet jokes, jokes about the school system not allowing creativity, poop jokes. It's never disturbing or disgusting, and it's never meant for you to laugh, actually the jokes are there because the main characters find it funny, and that's part of the plot. I'm not saying it's a brilliant movie, but I enjoyed it.
Now if you roll your eyes to the villain's name, or the whole concept of the movie and the books, there's no more salvation for you, ur already dead inside sorry :/ 
But really, sometimes I'm sad, sometimes I don't want those crazy intelligent rick and morty humor when I'm in a bad our dark place, sometimes I just wanna laugh at professor poopypants.
I used to think that I had to be mature all the time, never childish, never stupid, but that's simply not true. I'd rather sit down with my twelve years old boy cousins laughing insanely at the word uranus than with the adults discussing if ppl like me should or not have rights. Or any politics with adults, really. They just think they're always right.
And I stick to my humor, to my personality. I will always laught at the name poopypants, I will always laugh at uranus, and one day maybe I won't, but I will certainly understand why someone would.
That's part of life, really. Laughing at stupid shit because why not? The world is a mess and there's serious stuff going on all the time, is a kid changing the letters of the schools lunch frame thing to smell my armpits really that ridiculous?
