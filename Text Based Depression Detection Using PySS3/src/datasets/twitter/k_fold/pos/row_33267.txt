vent on former friends Why is it that pretty much the only people I can make friends with irl are the shittiest people ever?

**Things they've shamed me for:**

* ***in the past*** **- being a masc gay guy**
* ***now -*** **being a traditionally feminine girl**
* **being in a monogamus relationship**
* ***in the past -*** **reading BL because it "fetishizes gay men" (keep in mind it's BL not Yaoi &amp; at the I was still a gay guy)**
* ***now -*** **being a fan of a show that was made about women by a man**
* **saying bitch**
* **not supporting Yarichin Bitch Club**

I haven't done anything wrong, like why is it that I can't seem to make friends who aren't dicks? We aren't friends anymore. How can people like that even exist? It blows my mind how people who act like their better than everyone else because "they're accepting &amp; inclusive" can be such bigots. It's so fucking stupid.
