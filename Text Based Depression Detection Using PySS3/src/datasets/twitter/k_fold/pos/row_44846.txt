Any avatar fans? Hello! I have a small comminty of Avatar enthusiasts, we all play Minecraft together on Java edition using a plugin called Project Korra. This plugin allows us to bend the 4 elements, and also Chi block if anybody want's to be a chi blocker. Our server is a semi-roleplay server which means, there's roleplay elements, like how the Avatar works, laws and economy, however it isn't super serious like many other rp communities where you will be kicked out if you don't do things a certain way. We allow everyone to build up their own story and become their own bender!

We also randomly choose one Avatar each month who will get to learn all 4 elements and need to travel between all nations to learn them.

We are all working together to build up all cities and nations. It's an ambitious project, but we all enjoy it and seeing the cities from the series we love slowly come together, is a feeling like no other! We also have a custom dimension, being the Spirit world!  


**(The server required no mods at all)**

We are always open to new players to join our community, this is not an open server either, so you will need to be whitelisted to join it.
