A message to my fellow teenagers I've seen and heard so many people fall to this disease "depression". I, myself,  was almost included at one point among those people. You may be thinking that your life has no meaning, that every second of your life is just meant to make you suffer, and that you cannot get help. I just want to tell you that there's nothing wrong with seeking help from a specialist. For a very long time i had left my depression unchecked until it eventually completely took me over, i could not focus on anything, friends were seemingly abandoning me, i was feeling completely hollow, and the only way i was able to feel something was by inflicting pain upon myself. I even started with suicide attempts at a point. Then i realized that this cannot continue, a spark of realization that finnaly ignited change in me. After this, i started doing therapy, and after about 3 months of it and a lot of work, i finnaly realized what i needed to change. And with even more work and determination, i completely changed my personality around and finnaly became depression-free. My story is a lot more complicated than what i told here, but i just wanted to let people that struggle with this depression know that it is possible. Wherever you are, whoever you are, know that there's hope and that you are NEVER alone on this planet. You can switch your life around, you just need someone to help you get back on your feet. I hope my little story and advice brought some light upon someone's day.
