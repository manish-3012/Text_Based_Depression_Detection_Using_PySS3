What happened this morning at 10:14 am Okay just to be clear Iâ€™m not being a karma whore so please donâ€™t say that. What happened though was that my grandpa died of cancer this morning (Iâ€™m saying this late because I wasnâ€™t in the headspace earlier) and you guys all seem really nice and I just need someone to comfort me because Iâ€™m scared, need to rant, and Iâ€™m just really upset and donâ€™t know what to do. 

He was only 74 and this year before covid we were planing to go cat skiing with him and my dad.
Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m talking about at this point but I just need support. 

Thank you.
