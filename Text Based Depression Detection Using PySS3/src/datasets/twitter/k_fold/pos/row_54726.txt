be like me when posting I am a boring person right now and don't have any ideas of what to post.  I don't go post horny shitposts every two minutes.  I don't post racist things.  I don't say one group of people is better than another.  Be like me and remember these few ideas when posting in r/teenagers and have a nice day!
