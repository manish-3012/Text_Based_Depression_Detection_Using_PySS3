could we lower the amount of self deprication? i see people everywhere putting themselves down saying theyre ugly, will never get a gf/bf, really bad at certain things, etc...

like cmon guys lets just be a little bit postitive. i know not everyone is flawless at everything and looks like a god, we all have weaknesses and theres strenght in acknowledging that but having such a negative mindset that people do on this sub is unhealthy and doesnt help with low self-esteem.

im guilty of this myself i have to admit but im working on it and trying to be more positive in life because its really important. i just ask for a little more positivity, thats all guys, it would be nice to see.

everyone have a great day, youre all amazing ðŸ˜Š
