I think Iâ€™m going to try and write a story Iâ€™m going to Take it one chapter at a time 

So what Iâ€™m thinking chapter one is gonna be: 

So basically the main character is going to be a guy named Erik. Itâ€™s going to start off with him having a nightmare about when he was captured by a secret group of ppl who kill off evil people and pretty much is forced to choose between working for them (as an assassin) or dying. Obviously heâ€™s going to accept and they force him to mutilate his fingers with acid so he canâ€™t be recognized by them. He then wakes up to a message from said organization giving him a target to take down. 

Thatâ€™s pretty much the only solid idea I have at this point, I have ideas but have to think of how Iâ€™m going to weave them together to make a decent story.
