WW2 is the trequel. 7 years war, the napoleonic wars and the unification of the German and Italian states are the prequels. The Cold War wars is a spinoff series. Here are my suggested titles â€œthe Great Warâ€ â€œthe Great War 2: rise of the redsâ€ â€œthe Great War 3: revenge of the Prussiansâ€ â€œColonial conquests (a Great War movie)â€ â€œNapoleon. (agwm)â€ â€œthe new powers (agwm)â€ â€œeagles against bears:[clever name to refer to event] (agws)â€
