I think More People should watch norwegian ww2 movies. I think most People dont know about all the epic shit Norway did during ww2 and sugest some good movies like "max manus" or "kongens nei" if you are scroling past new and see this i recomend you watch  max manus because the movie is great, its thriling and the lead actor Looks like steve buchemi. Thanks for reading
