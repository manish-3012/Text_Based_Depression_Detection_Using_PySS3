Well this sucks So like a month ago my friend mentioned me on their story on Snapchat and basically this girl added me and we basically got to know each other really well and I generally considered her a friend even tho we lived in different states. But anyways she said her parents were really strict and basically today I got a snap from her saying her account was getting deleted by her parents because she was talking to a boy. So yah this fucking sucks cuz she was a really good friend and I kinda had a crush on her. Also I kinda feel guilty cuz I feel like itâ€™s my fault her account got deleted. Idk just needed to rant a bit
