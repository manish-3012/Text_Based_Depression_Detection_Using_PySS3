I missed out on Reddit premium because Reddit suspended my account for a stupid reason. I missed out on a week of premium because my Reddit account got suspended. Why did my account get suspended? Well, I posted the Navy Seals copypasta, and my Reddit account got suspended for 7 days for it. A few hours later, I received Reddit gold on one of my posts, giving me 7 days of premium. However, the problem was, my suspension was almost as long as the premium lasted. So, I barely have any time for premium left.
I was so depressed about because it was my first time ever receiving gold, and my first time experiencing premium. I guess I kind of feel better because I found out premium isn't really better than no premium.
