A tip for artists, musicians, writers of r/teenagers or basically anyone that's received mean comments that make no sense: Method 1: ignore after downvoting (or upvoting out of spite)

Method 2 : snap at them with a nasty burn

Method 3 : be nice to them with an 'each to their own' kind of phrase after expressing confidence in your creation/post, and watch them feel bad and apologise. if they don't just ignore them

Method 4 : stalk their account and decide what to say or do (i.e decide to be mean af or nice af)

Optional : cry yourself to sleep
