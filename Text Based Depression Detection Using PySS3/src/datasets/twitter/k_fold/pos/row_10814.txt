I hate myself, but not in a bad way...  I do hate myself, I'm not depressed, I don't want to kill myself or anything bad like that, I just hate myself and what I do. I sometimes think that my life ain't crap and I'm worthless, but that isn't enough for me to jump yet. I feel like a bad person, and I feel like once I die, nobody will be there to care. Sure my usual mom or dad, but I don't think I'll have friends or a husband, I'll just be alone, but I want to be alone, you know? 

I want to be alone but I don't want to be alone. 

I hate myself but not in a bad way
