My genuine interest in a subject has just straight up DIED because of my new teacher. This year, Iâ€™m now on my 3RD HISTORY TEACHER. Itâ€™s confusing, and I dont wanna explain. But his teaching style is absolute shit, WEâ€™RE the ones reading ON OUR OWN TIME. He doesnâ€™t use Google docs when he assigns us something, he uses GOOGLE SLIDES. And now he wants us to write 3 page essay with an 11 font, ABOUT WHY YOUâ€™D RATHER CHOOSE CITY LIFE OVER SETTLER LIFE DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.

WTF. 

Merde that entire class. That means â€œfuckâ€ in French.
