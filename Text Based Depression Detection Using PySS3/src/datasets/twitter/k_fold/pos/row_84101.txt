Just got banned from r/memes I saw a chain post being put up on memes and I decided that it would be fine to take it and repost it as a joke like all the others have. I get what I did was wrong but I wish stuff like chain posts should be warning based instead of immediately banning you. Now nsfw stuff being insta banned sure, but something like that?! Bruh. What I'm annoyed most about is that I have made tons of memes through the day whenever I come up with them and post some every day to get some karma. Now that I cant post i dont know where to send them other than discord in dms to my friends which doesnt feel as satisfying as posting to reddit.

I get that i shouldn't do chain posts because they aren't really funny to most people but based on how I saw in the post that it was on memes at least 7 times in the last 15 reposts I thought I was fine.
