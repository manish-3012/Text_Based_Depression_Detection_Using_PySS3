How do I change myself permanently to fit in? Basically, I want to change how I sound, look, and act.

I don't like being called the weird friend/kid at all. It makes me feel like I'm not an equal to them. I've been ridiculed and such for all my life about it and I just want to be like everyone else so they don't make fun of me anymore or think that I'm different than them.

I want to be able to jump into any conversation as if I belong, or be my true self without people thinking that I'm weird/crazy, or even have that look that makes me seem like an average person and no one does a double-take. Better yet, that average voice that doesn't catch someone's ear.

But every time I act as something I am not, I am not happy. I want to be happy while being myself but I can't because people just don't like the way I am.

What are some ways that can change the way I think / act to the point where I feel like I'm being my true self without questioning if I am not?
