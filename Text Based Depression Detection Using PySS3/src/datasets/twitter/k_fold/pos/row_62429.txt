So my first period was CANCELED! My first period is AP Biology. Like most people, I kind of hate this class. So you must have felt my dismay when I woke up this morning and saw that it was time to start.       

But Alas! I receive a text from my group chat saying that my first period is canceled! The kids at school were having a substitute teacher! The teacher didn't know how to use Zoom, so we were off the hook!
          
Overjoyed, I returned back to my bed an catch up on some much needed sleep. I took note of how much time I had left until my 2nd period. All was good.       
         
Then I slept through my second period.
