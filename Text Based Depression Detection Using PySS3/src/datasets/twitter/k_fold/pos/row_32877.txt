day 2 out of 3 my thoughts were mostly around the bad things that happened through my life and the people i thought i was friends with

i thought about the many times i've lost the people i cared about, how all of it happened because of what everyone else did, and how it affected me

first time first experienced losing someone was when i was 6 and i was forced to leave my grandma's house, i cried so much on the way to our new home. it hurt a lot because my grandma has been more of a mother than my actual mom could ever be, she took care of me for most of my life while my mom was barely with any of us 

then when i was 10, i lost people i considered friends for years because of my dad's mother being greedy and taking away the house we lived in

then when i was 13, same thing happened except this time it was because of my mom doing what she thinks is best for me, that translates to changing the school i went to because she thought it wasn't good enough for me, ignoring the many times i told her i didn't want to leave and how hard it was for me to make friends again

i've been in the school i go to now since i was 13 and i haven't made a single friend

what hurts more than losing them is the fact that none of the people i cried so much about considered me a friend, everyone just talked to me out of pity and they'd leave me the second they could

i've spent most of my school days alone

the fact that i finally had a friend that didn't talk to me out of pity and genuinely cared about me left me because of everyone else hurts so much

i still miss him, i still cry every night because of what happened, i constantly think about how he's doing, i constantly think that i could've avoided this from happening, i still have dreams about him

those thoughts are the ones that don't let me sleep

everything reminds me of him and it hurts so much. i just want everything to end

it's always the same with everyone, i'll get attached to them then they will leave because of someone else

why should i keep going if i'll just be constantly hurt by people.

sorry for the long text
