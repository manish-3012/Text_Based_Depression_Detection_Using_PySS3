I need help from girls So a boy here that wants to start crossdressing. Since I live super rurally and canâ€™t ship stuff to my house, the only way I can get stuff is if I ask my female friend to buy me the clothes and then I pay her for the clothes and pay extra for the help. The thing is is that I donâ€™t want our friendship to be weird, so I have 2 questions 1: what would you do if you were being asked and 2: do you think itâ€™ll go fine? 
Weâ€™re both 13
