Poem, also fuck you automod, let me make single word titles Orange and grey

Smelt out of ash

&amp;#x200B;

Crimson and blue

Ooze from my heart

&amp;#x200B;

Pebbles fall and ring 

Like raindrops on my glasses

&amp;#x200B;

I forgot it, I let it die

I had lost it and couldn't go

&amp;#x200B;

I went stray, homeless in my room

Tastes of blood and regret

&amp;#x200B;

Orange and grey, 

become fire again

&amp;#x200B;

Crimson and blue

Flow through me again

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.
