As a teenager who just graduated High School last year let me tell you take as many dual enrollment courses in high school as you can! This might seem obvious but unless you don't plan on going to college any time after HS you should definitely see how many of these classes you can take in advance

Not only are they much cheaper in high school but they also come with the benefit of getting you through your gen Ed's and start you with a few extra credits

That being said, this does come with a couple of things to note, you're going to have to settle for a school in your state (if in the US idk how it works in foreign countries) some will make an exception if they're close by but this is generally the rule and try to go for a state college/university because they are guaranteed to accept them

And of course, these classes include college curriculums so be prepared for a class that is a little trickier than your average and expect some more long-term assignments and projects rather that nightly homework. Personally this wasn't too bad for me but I'm a pretty good planner so it might be harder for others
