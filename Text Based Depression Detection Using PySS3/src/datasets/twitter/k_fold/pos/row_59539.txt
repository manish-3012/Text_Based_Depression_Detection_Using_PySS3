I hate hotels with my family Im on a staycation downtown in a city near where I live and I have to share a tiny hotel room with a single bathroom with my 2 siblings and mom. My mom isn't bad at all, but my sister is disgusting (smells like piss and shit, leaves toothpaste on the counter, doesn't flush after shidding, smears her shitty makeup all over the white blankets), my brother is jist annoying and entitled, and it all makes this whole trip into the most physically and mentally uncomfortable trip I've ever had. These 2 nights at the hotel are horrible if im being honest
