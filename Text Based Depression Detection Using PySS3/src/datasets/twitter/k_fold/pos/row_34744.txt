Random Compliments I think we all forget how much random compliments can brighten a personâ€™s day. In my case, brighten the rest of my lifeðŸ¤£. So I have really low self-esteem and I think I have some form of body dysmorphia (thinking Iâ€™m fat and not eating for awhile to lose weight when in truth Iâ€™m actually not fat in the slightest. Iâ€™m writing this now but Iâ€™ll stop believing it in about 10 minutesðŸ’€). I was talking to my friend while we were doing our French homework and I forget how this conversation started, but he mentioned midway through that I was a â€œprettyboyâ€. He said it in a slightly teasing way, and Ik in certain terms this isnâ€™t a compliment at all, but the subject we were on, it was a compliment. And if Iâ€™m being honest, I think thatâ€™s the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me in my entire lifeðŸ˜‚. So to sum all that up, letâ€™s normalise random compliments. He didnâ€™t realize how much I needed to hear his offhand compliment, and you might not know how much someone else might need your random compliment.
