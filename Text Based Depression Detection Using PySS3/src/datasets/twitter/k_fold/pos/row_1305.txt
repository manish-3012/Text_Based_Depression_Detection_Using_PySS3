Putting yourself before others is stupid Ultimately itâ€™s you who matters the most. Sure, itâ€™s alright to make a selfless thing like working at a soup kitchen or giving a homeless guy 20 bucks, but being a crowd pleaser and being overly nice is stupid as shit. Almost none of the people you meet today will have any real impact tomorrow, so why invest so much time in them?
