what happens if you miss too much online school? okay so you miss like 20+ periods irl and itâ€™s like a fine or court sentence if theyâ€™re unexcused but what the fck do you do when you keep oversleeping and missing classes because you stay up until 4 am trying to do all the extra work youâ€™re getting for being in ap and honors classes as a junior while also studying for the sat?

tell me, is it really my fault thereâ€™s not enough time in the day to get that crapload of schoolwork done?? worst of all everytime time I oversleep my parents get madder and madder and threaten to unenroll me and shit.

Iâ€™M SO FUCKING TIRED.
