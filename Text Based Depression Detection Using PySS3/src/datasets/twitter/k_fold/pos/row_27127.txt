Just death So I have just gotten into year 10 and I have just realized how bad my school. First they kept telling us that in year 9 was our last time to chill but barely let us into how much work we would get for year 10. Secondly me and someone else got the same grades pretty much but he got put into core (easier math's) and I got put in extended (Harder Math's) and I cant switch to core even though I got a bad score on my first test and because of my parents and the teacher I cant switch. Finally I had around 8 assignments first week back and now I have to do 3 things but cant have it done since I'm running on 3 hours of sleep.
