Im glad how people in this sub are starting to realise how porn addiction is a problem Its bad on many levels and ways for mental health. It lowers people self sterm, makes people apreciate women less and seeing them as nothing but a sex toy, puts high standards on both male and females, people becomes dependent on the dopamine hit porn gives them, on the long run regular sex will be not enoungh so people will end developing wierd kinks that will make them feel worse about themselves. And in the hentai case people will deviant more from reality and lose atraction to real humans.
