I just remembered ine of the most weirdest and most facepalm worthy moments of my life So back when I was in a waterpolo club, I had this guy who liked me because I protected him from a moron who was usually insulting fat kids (the guy was really fat tho) and so our "friendship" began. And one day we were chatting over whatsapp and talking about our gaming consoles, like is his XBox 360 better than my PS3 and such shit 11 year olds talked about at that time. And then one day he gave me some PS2 games he had because I had a PS2 too, and day by day the dude was being more of a burden than a person I can chat with. One day I got promoted as main goalkeeper while this dude stayed in 3rd setup as a reserve left wing defender. He was mad because "he wasn't promoted so we can be in the same setup" not to mention he was a slow swimmer and I was a torpedo. And so he broke our relationship which I had no feelings for. So where's the facepalm part you ask? It's him being a fucktard and thinking the club is doing what he likes.

I must thank you for reading all this text that took me 30 minutes to remember the moments and 5 to write.
