What do I do... So basically I joined this discord server and started working on this big project (Iâ€™m not gonna explain it all) with like a few other people who are all in their 20s.

So Iâ€™m only 15 but I lied and said I was older so I can be a part of the group cus I really wanted to work on the project with them. So things were going great until I found out that this one rich rich girl is coming down to orlando (which is nearby where I live) and she wants to meet up at Universal, and she knows I live near and everything.

So I donâ€™t know what to do because if I was actually an adult like I said I was there would be no problem meeting up in a public space, but I canâ€™t go or else sheâ€™ll find out Iâ€™m not an adult and Iâ€™ll be kicked out of the group...

So basically I need your help to come up with an excuse as to why I canâ€™t go. Please help me out I CANâ€™T BE KICKED OUT they are literally like my online best friends.

TL;DR: I lied about my age and my online friends wanna meet up so help me come up with an excuse of why I canâ€™t meet.
