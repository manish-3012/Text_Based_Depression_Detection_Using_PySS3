Sometimes Iâ€™d rather be dead than live the life Iâ€™m living Am I such a horrible person that I want to go in person. I went online this semester and my dumbfuck school doesnâ€™t allow changes so here I am, 500 ft from my school wasting away online. I can see my school from my house and yet I canâ€™t go. I went to the school to drop something off today and it just makes me sad. I wish I had gone in person this semester, I love my grandma but I canâ€™t take this anymore. We saved a bunch of old people with lockdowns but it killed a bunch of others. I seriously want to die sometimes, Iâ€™m probably a horrible person but I honestly donâ€™t give a shit about old people anymore. Most are getting vaccinated by now but was saving the old real worth murdering the youths mental health? Because Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more often than now. How do they expect us to survive like this. Iâ€™m tired of being alone. I donâ€™t even think like this  most of the time, I just think about dying more often now. I want to go in person, my shitty school could have scheduled it to choose your learning mode by quarter. Iâ€™m sure they could have figured it out. I donâ€™t want to stay at home anymore. The pandemic is coming to an end, biden says people are gonna get vaccinated and they are. Why canâ€™t my school just let me go in person. Why didnâ€™t they offer an option to switch by quarter. A bunch of people are in person at my school living 10x better lives than me and as of now Iâ€™m more likely to die than them. I donâ€™t care about the vulnerable anymore, why doesnâ€™t anyone care about me. Iâ€™m also vulnerable. I understand all of those anti lockdown people now, Iâ€™m dying too. We sacrificed the youth for the old and Iâ€™m getting sick of it by now.
