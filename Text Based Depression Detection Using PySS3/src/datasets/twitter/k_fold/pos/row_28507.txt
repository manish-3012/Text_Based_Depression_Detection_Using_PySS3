Help with short-term memeory I seem to have a problem with this, like sometimes I can be talking about another, and the next minute Iâ€™m talking about how I went on this trip, and was driving down the road, when the hair on my arm stood up, and I was like â€œwoah this is like that one spiderman movieâ€, which by the way, was a great movie in my opinion, and I went to see that with some of my friends, and we went to get some food, oh and I had a good breakfast this morning. Wait, what was the point of this question?
