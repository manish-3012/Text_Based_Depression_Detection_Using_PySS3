I just realised that I missed an obvious sign from a girl to hang out with me. So there was a hot and pretty girl in my class. One day I and my friend (who was her friend) were going to ground from the 1st floor and I saw her quietly standing in the hallway so I ignored her and rushed down the stairs. I stopped to see my friend because he was not behind me and I saw him standing and staring at someone. He called me twice or thrice but my response was "NAH IM NOT CLIMBING THOSE STAIRS AGAIN YOU BETTER COME DOWN". Then a voice came from the hallway whispering "Don't Force ---------- I -----------later" and my friend was like "oh later, alright then". I asked him what was the matter he said ill tell you later and then I forgot to ask and he forgot to tell me but today I figured out that that girl was asking for me! She WANTED TO HANGOUT!! A GIRL WAS TRYING TO ASK ME!?. but I failed miserably and I'm still single Idk why I'm telling this but remember bros! NEVER EVER MISS HER SIGNS OR YOULL REGRET IT. :/. (Really sorry for bad English I ain't native English speaker) peace. (never ever let your lazy ruin you)
