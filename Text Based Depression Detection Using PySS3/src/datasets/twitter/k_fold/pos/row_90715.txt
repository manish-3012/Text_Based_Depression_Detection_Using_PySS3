I have no hope for my future I am 15 years old and both of my older sisters already know how they're gonna live their life, my 18 year old sister wants to own a bunch of animals and my 16 year old sister wants to become a psychologist, I wanted to become an animator back in middle school but I've since given up on that dream.

I doubt i'll even go to a real college

really the only possible way I'd be able to be successful when I reach adulthood is dump all my dignity and become a sex worker, even then nobody would want my ugly ass.

I'm prolly gonna end up mooching off my parents for the rest of my life and being a failure since I simp for legally aged cartoon men and lego minifigures voiced by big name celebrities while being the only straight person in most of my friend groups
