So I freaked up by making a yo mamma joke So I  was sitting at lunch with a kid talking, and another kid comes up and asks, "What are you doing"?

I say, "Yo Mom, OOHHHHH"!

It was supposed to be a joke, I even laughed. I got a few stairs and people whispering, the kid just leaves shocked. 

His mom died.
