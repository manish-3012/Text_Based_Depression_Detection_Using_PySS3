I took two annoying extremely overused tropes and made them into a gay plot twist 1. The trope where the father disapproves of the daughter's boyfriend
So the relationship is actually faked, and the pair are both gay but pretending to be in a relationship because thier in the closet
2. The trope where there are two guys fighting over a girl in a love triangle
You know the thing where they try to make the girl choose them by making themselves look more hot or impressive? They realize they were actually trying to impress each other more than the girl, and then they're gay
Someone write this into a short story ( im awful a writing stories) cuz like there is very little LGBTQ+ representation
