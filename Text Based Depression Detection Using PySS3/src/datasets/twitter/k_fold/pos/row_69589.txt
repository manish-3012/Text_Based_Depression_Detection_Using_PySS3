wait guys I need to ask something when us girls hug you can you feel our boobs? If so is it weird?? I give and take a lot of hugs from this one guy and it just hit me that it might be weird or something and I need to know if it is

edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH for a second after I had that realisation I got really insecure so I'm glad that most of you don't care :)
