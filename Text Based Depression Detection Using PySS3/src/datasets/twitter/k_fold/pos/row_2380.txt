After recovering from covid do you randomly shiver for no reason? So about a year ago when covid first came to light in the US I caught it and over the last year since I recovered I've noticed that I would randomly shiver. Not all the time but when I did I would shiver for like 30 minutes. It doesn't even need to be cold I could be hot and still shiver. A couple of my friends reported the same thing after they had covid.
