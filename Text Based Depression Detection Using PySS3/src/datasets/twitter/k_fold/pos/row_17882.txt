I Know Why People Hate Me For a long time, I never understood why so many people hated me. Even one of my teachers didn't like me.
Until one day, it clicked with me. So many people hate me because I'm "inappropriate"
In elementary, I was alienated until I learned to copy other people's faces! I learned to be such a great actress, that even I forgot I was different from everyone else. I forcefully learned to stop jumping around and do those flappy arm things when I got excited, I learned to only look upset when appropriate or when I was alone, I learned to bottle things up. But that ended up making me alienated again. They didn't like how my facial expressions wouldn't change very often very much and it didn't help that I couldn't even look at my closest friend in the eyes. I was then seen as the inconsiderate, sadistic, bratty, child by my peers. Obviously, I hated it so, every now and then I would dip my finger in melted wax to make myself feel better. I never did it often but, it felt nice. When I moved schools right before middle school, I made a friend that genuinely liked me. She brought out a side of me that I haven't met in a very long time. I'm in highschool now and she moved away quite a while ago. I'm very grateful that I met her and I'd like to tell her that, but I don't think I'll ever meet her again. Thanks to her and a couple other people, I can now make friends at least a bit easier. I now recognize that I á´ÉªÉ¢Êœá´› have a mental disorder and it's only gotten worse and more obvious, but I'm just glad that I wasn't hated for something I did. I have no backbone, I'm a push over, and I still have trouble showing a lot of emotions, but I'm happier now and I'm working on it. That's all that matters to me right now.
