Mamaaa my time has come... So it's the time of the year to become karma whore for the day, but don't worry I got a gift for you all.... a gift of personal experience.

Here are the tips which helped me during high school and they are still useful in college for me at least.

1) The secret to look cool in front of everyone is giving respect. The bad boy theme is sooo 90s.

2) All the boys and girls who think you are not good looking or pretty, it is just in your head. You look fucking amazing. Just groom yourselves properly and see the magic yourself. You will be oozing out confidence like never before.

2.1) Don't fell bad if you don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you will eventually get one. These things shouldn't be rushed. If you are making relationships just for the sake of having one, there is a huge chance that you won't be happy in the long run and might miss the chance to meet someone who is actually perfect for you. So just relax...and enjoy your single life also.

3) Give respect to teachers who are nice to you and don't be a jerk to them, they also feel bad and have mental breakdown. For the bad teachers....show them hell.

4) Never compare your wealth with other kids, it's not cool.

5) Don't worry about your studies and do what you like the most. That doesn't mean to completely neglect your studies, try as hard as you can and if it still doesn't work then don't stress yourself too much. Just have faith in yourself and you will definitely succeed.



Hope it helps to some of you ðŸ¥‚
PS: Sry for bad grammar.
