Ok ok ok, You will never guess what i saw So i was in math class, and my teacher is presenting his screen, then comes in a message, Nothing out of the ordinary, But then, i notice the name, and it says:Sent by:Lupita small momma:Hey when are we gonna meet againâ€Winky face.  No one except me noticed, it ainâ€™t nothing big i was just surprised to see my that my 50y/o teacher still gets those kind of messages.
