I really hate how some people are always think that there tradition is the right way. When I use to believe in God, I saw him not as a all powerful being ment be worship but just a cosmic being who was powerful enough to birth the universe. I saw him as flawed and pron to emotions just like human beings. But no, my mom insist that God is all perfect, all knowing, and all powerful. And that he actually does give a fuck if you worship him or not. Here is another thing I can't stand, worshipping. Such a primitive human behavior that should have no business in the first place. 
Especially the flag. For some reason, Republicans love to worship the flag when in my opinion, the flag isn't what represents my national but instead it's all the people who are apart of it. I hate it when some who doesn't stand flag gets told that they are disrespecting the nation and the people who fought for it. Basically the "My way is right and your wrong" mentality. There are other ways to respect the people who fought for this country instead of worshiping and damn peace of clothe.
