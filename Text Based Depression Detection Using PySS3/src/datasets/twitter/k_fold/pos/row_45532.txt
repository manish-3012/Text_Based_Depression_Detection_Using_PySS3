Anybody here notices that this subreddit is turning into like twitter 2.0? Sure I agree on alot of the crap people are saying sbout "sexism, racism, homophobic." and stuff. But I've realized that these posts are now everywhere, it's just getting annoying. I don't know what's been going on so I really can't speak, haven't been on reddit for a while. lol
