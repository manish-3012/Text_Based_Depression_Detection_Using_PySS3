Are faces supposed to be so difficult to memorize As I've gotten more into art I've realized every face I draw tends to be deformed not only that but I cant visualize faces even of those I know really well I can only visualize certain facial features and never a full face and if you took away said distinct feature(s) I wouldn't be able to notice them, is this normal?
