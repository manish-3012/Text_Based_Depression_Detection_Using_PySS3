Hi all..I need some guy advice So I when I was 10 I changed schools and like literally the second I entered my new classroom I immediately developed a crush on this guy..it was literally crush at first sight .I was completely obsessed with him but I never spoke to him because I'm an introvert and it sucked even more because I didn't even get to know him before I liked him, thankfully he was really smart and would usually top almost every class.I told a few friends about him and almost openly admitted that I liked him but as soon as I realized that he wasn't receptive I immediately shut down all the "rumours".

We would usually get compared a lot by the teachers in class because we were really smart and were also used as friend examples in class while explaining stuff in sums and other stuff but we never spoke because he was kind of arrogant , something I realized later on. Well time flew by and I was in 10th grade before I knew it and I had barely said a few sentences to him over the years and I thought that,that was it and told myself to forget about him cause he's never notice or think about you now .(The school that I was in was only till 10th grade and we would have to join some other school to attend 11th grade.)

Well we graduated 10th grade and 4 months later there was an event in my area that everyone would usually attend..it was kind of like a gathering that people would go to for like 7 days in a row. So I was kind of late and my friends were already sitting (on like these huge steps of an open ground auditorium)and well there was like this one space next my crush and I had no other option but to sit next to him.He was showing everyone my friend a picture of his grandmom's 250 year tree that got uprooted in a storm and coincidentally I was born where his grandmom's from so I told him that and he just got interested in where I was from and we had our first conversation ..turns out we have a lot of common interests and he really shared a lot about himself .He then said that he never related to someone as much before and looked forward to meeting me tomorrow .I almost fainted lol. So we talked to each other for like 2 more days till the end of the functions .2 months later there was another function where most of my classmates were present and he completely ignored me like he didn't even say hi..he literally said hi to the girl standing next to me and not me. A week later we were called to school for some post graduation ceremony and the conversation we had was just so forced and it was so weird .Any thoughts on why he turned so weird?
