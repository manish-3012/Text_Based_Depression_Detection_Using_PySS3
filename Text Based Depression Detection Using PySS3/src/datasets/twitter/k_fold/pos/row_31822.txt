Guys we arenâ€™t the youngest generation anymore Wow, we arenâ€™t the youngest generation anymore. I just turned 16 two weeks ago. Thereâ€™s a baby being born somewhere that is gonna go through a completely different education system than I did. They are gonna be affected by the educational policies instituted by the government our generation has a part in electing. They are gonna look at the war crimes that those elected governments commit, just as we have. They are gonna be left with a higher national debt, higher student debt, and more environmental issues than weâ€™ve ever known before. Iâ€™d like to have hope, but I honestly donâ€™t. I know that Iâ€™m gonna give my kids an honest fair and enjoyable life that I never got, but Iâ€™m not confident the world around them is gonna improve. But there is something we can do. We have become the people that kids look up to. Siblings, strangers, or kids at our local church. All these people younger than us are looking up to us. While we may not be able to solve all the problems the older generation expects us to, we *can* be our best self for the next generation. The only hope I have left for humanity is the strength that I believe our crossgenerational relationship will one day have. Enjoy your night Americans, Good morning asian cultures, and sleep well Europeans.
