I don't know where to post, so I am posting it here I have no idea how to start so it may be abrupt. My uncle died around 5 years ago from cancer and my aunt died around a year ago. She died from brain hamerage. You get brain hamerage from extreme stress or trauma or a huge impact to the head. The doctors were confused but we never gave too much thought to it. Around a week ago my cousin(23) found his mother's diary which explained how his grandparents mentally tortured her. He doesn't want to share it with the relatives because the relations were already tough. I don't know what to make of this. I am so confused, shocked, and angry at the same time.
