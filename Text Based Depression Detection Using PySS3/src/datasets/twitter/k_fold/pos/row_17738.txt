Using this sub as a diary day 7 The most destacable thing today was that i woke up to a nightmare about my old house LMAO. It was sock af, but just laughed my ass of ngl other than that a normal day. Going to school is as fucked as always but who gives a fuck im the good kind of number at least.

Rating my day 7/10 focused on escaping not school or abusive parent will stop me that's for sure but we'll see tomorrow
