Need advice for crush Iâ€™ve never met. 17F and a Senior in HS  :) 

Iâ€™m currently needing some advice for a friendship/relationship that I donâ€™t know how to progress.

I met this guy during zoom meetings and asked for his socials to talk about the subject in class. 

I was ULTIMATELY captured by his looks and how he talks. 

Heâ€™s very smart as well considering we were in the same AP class. 

At the time, I only wanted to be friends and was interested in what he thought about the class. But we started to text more and more about each other. 

He mainly talks about himself and never asks me questions but I enjoy our conversations online. Iâ€™m usually the one to start the conversations as well. 

Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m annoying the guy since Iâ€™m constantly texting him, not the other way around. 

I also feel like Iâ€™m forcing the conversations onto him. 

I donâ€™t think heâ€™s one to call (I donâ€™t have his number Iâ€™m fairly scared to ask) plus I think itâ€™d be weird since we havenâ€™t even met in person. 

Due to covid, we canâ€™t really see each other and Iâ€™m currently in a different state as I had to travel to visit family (donâ€™t worry i had my mask on at all times) 

I also transferred schools in the same city so talking about our class is out the window. 

To all the people on here, could you please give me advice on how this friendship can turn into something more? Or what I can do to make the conversations feel less â€œforcedâ€.
