Stop the 'positivity' posts Seriously. Nobody in the planet has ever been helped by a random person on the stranger saying 'you're beautiful' or 'I love you'

You're a random internet stranger. I don't love you. You probably aren't cute, and because you're on reddit you're probably ugly

All these fake positivity posts downplay the real meaning of phrases such as 'I love you', so stop fucking overusing them

thats all
