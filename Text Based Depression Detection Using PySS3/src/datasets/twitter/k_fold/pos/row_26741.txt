IM FINALLY OVER MY EX WOOOOOO She broke up with me three months ago and up until this weekend, it was destroying me. After the breakup, everything in my life went downhill.

Then I started texting this girl and it was awesome, it was fun as hell, and for the first time, somebody made me feel the way my ex did when I first started texting her. She asked for a song recommendation, so I gave her my favorite (which my ex recommended to me), Age of Consent by New Order, and while texting her I listened to it and couldn't stop smiling. It was the first time I could listen to it in the last three months without crying.

This made me realize that if someone else could make me feel this way then it doesn't have to be my ex.

The girl has since stopped texting me for whatever reason, which is a bit sad, but there'll be someone else out there, I just know it.

I lost all remaining hold I had on her right there laying in my bed listening to that song and it was such an amazing feeling.
