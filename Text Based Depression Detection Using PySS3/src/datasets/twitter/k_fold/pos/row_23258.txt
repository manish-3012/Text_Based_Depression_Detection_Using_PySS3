How da hell do you make friends online? All my life I've never known how to make friends online, people on "make friends" discord are dry and boring. Vrchat is too cluttered with multiple people looking in the mirror and i just don't know where you find cool people. I've been trying to get more into gaming like league of legends and valorant (played the first time today) and it's just i wanna have some pals to play these team based games with yunno? 

HOW? Where are all the funny and nice people hiding?
