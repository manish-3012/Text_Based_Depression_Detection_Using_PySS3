Recurring nightmare Right, the backstory (may not be relevant to this idk)is on my profile so go there if you want details but here goes...

For the past few months, I've been having a recurring nightmare of me running down a dark street with tall bushes and trees stopping me from leaving the road. I'm sprinting down the road as hard as I can with footsteps coming extremely fast towards me. When I turn around and nothing there but the footsteps go behind me again and I run in the opposite direction. The dream wakes me up at around 3.30 in the morning and I sit awake the rest of the morning after being touched on the shoulder and jolting up out of bed. I'm now always tired, can't concentrate, cry often, scratch myself even though I'm not itchy, among other things. I don't think I have depression but I don't want to pester my parents for therapy or diagnosis or things like that because they are expensive.
