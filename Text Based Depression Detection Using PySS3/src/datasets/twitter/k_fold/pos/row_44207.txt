it seems like iâ€™m the only one who doesnâ€™t have a crush on this sub every other post i see is talking about how they â€œasked out their crushâ€ or how they got rejected. but all the girls i know are either pieces of shit or lesbian. like there is no one that i can trust or that wonâ€™t spread rumors about me or stab me in the back. is that too much to ask?
