My dads priorities are a bit weird So i was taking a shower while my dad was taking a crap. Once i was done the shower head decided it would be a wonderful idea to fall directly on my shoulder. I yelped in surprise but refrained from shouting a cuss. My father then told me to be more careful because it would be expensive to fix the shower if the shower head damaged it and didnâ€™t acknowledge the fact a shower head just fell directly on my shoulder blade. 

I love the man but his priorities are a bit strange
