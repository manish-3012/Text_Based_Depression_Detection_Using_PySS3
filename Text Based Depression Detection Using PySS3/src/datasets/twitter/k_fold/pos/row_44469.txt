I was the person who posted the Cyberpunk 2077 post yesterday, and someone got it for him! Yesterday, I posted a photo (it got removed) of my friend who wasnâ€™t able to afford Cyberpunk. As it turns out, someone actually gifted it to him! Whoever did it, I donâ€™t know who yet, I, our friends, and more importantly he appreciates it. 

Iâ€™m just honestly amazed that he actually got a copy of it. Even I donâ€™t have a copy of it yet!
