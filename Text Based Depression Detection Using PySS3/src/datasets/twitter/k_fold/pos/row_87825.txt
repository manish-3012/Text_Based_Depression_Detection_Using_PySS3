Just something to say to you It dosent matter what your going through, if it's depression, anxiety, or worse, could be anything. But out of all these thing your going through, all of them thing, your scars from all the torment the physical or mental thing has on you, it just makes you stronger inside. It shows that you made it through once, you can do it again.
