I was successful at ditching career day, but kinda regretted it. I didn't got in trouble, I actually visited one class, where the vice mayor spoke and I had a very big interested in serving in public office, so I went there by zoom link and I actually had a good time. I kinda wish I didn't skip it but at the same time, I still had a fun free Friday. 
No calls from the school so I think I'm good.
It was entirely virtual so that's how I ditched
Wouldn't recommend it though and won't try it again, but once was enough.
