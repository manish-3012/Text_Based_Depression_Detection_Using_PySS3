Man, yesterday was actually a great day. We grilled with some friends, drank, joked, did stupid ass shut and we generally had a great time. I actually my best friend drink for the first time and tbh he isn't really someone who should drink. He is like a cat when it comes to such things and his walking unbalanced.
