constantly have the feeling that Iâ€™m not doing conversations right I donâ€™t know why it feels like Iâ€™m always doing something wrong whenever Iâ€™m talking to people. Youâ€™d think that as long as it isnâ€™t awkward and you both keep talking about shit then you are doing things right. It just feels like I got all of it wrong. Maybe I havenâ€™t talked to enough people and maybe I just forgot tbh
