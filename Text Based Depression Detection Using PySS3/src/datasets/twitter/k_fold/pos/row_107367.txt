A heart to heart with you random people. Iâ€™ve known my friends for the longest time. Theyâ€™re all I have anymore. And I know they are trying there best too isolate and embarrass me to staying. Iâ€™ve branched out and every time they embarrass me to the point I myself stop talking. I want to fight back but they are all I have. No one else likes me. Iâ€™m 15 and would be an outcast if it werenâ€™t for those guys. The only one that cared is now 8 hours away. My mental health has reached bedrock and Iâ€™ve developed clinical depression and severe schizophrenia that runs in the family. Iâ€™ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. Panic attacks and paranoia are commonplace and my friends have pretty much held me hostage with the blackmail of my embarrassing stories and issues. Iâ€™ve never been to this point before. But school has drained me to the point getting up seems like the stupid thing to do. Iâ€™m failing school, no one likes me except my â€œfriendsâ€ and I canâ€™t be left alone anymore. Please, help me. However you can. Or donâ€™t. 

Thank you for reading if you did. Sorry itâ€™s long.
