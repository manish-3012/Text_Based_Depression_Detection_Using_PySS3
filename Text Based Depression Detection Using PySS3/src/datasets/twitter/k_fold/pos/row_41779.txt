my brother tried to commit suicide me (13 year old male) and my brother (11 year old male) share a room. we've both been dealing with depression for about a year now. my brother had a panic attack before bed, he was crying and screaming that he isn't good enough and life isn't worth living. we had thought my mom calmed him down, but i guess not. i was sitting on my bed (top bunk) listening to music. i noticed my brother pacing the room and didn't like much of it since he's pretty fidgety and does this often. he sits back down and a few minutes later i hear glass shatter. i ask what's he's doing and he says nothing. obviously, i know that's a lie, so i watch him. he's hunched over the broken glass then runs out of the room into that bathroom. i take this chance to turn my phones flashlight on to see what he broke. the first thing i notice is the dark shit on the glass, then i realise he broke a small hour glass he'd got for christmas, so the sand inside could have been that dark shit. but me being the paranoid motherfucker i am turn the real light on to examine. it's fucking blood. so i run out and get the attention of my stepdad, he asks what's wrong and i show him the glass. he helps clean it up while my moms in the bathroom helping my brother. my stepdad gives this whole a speech about how you get over depression and blah blah blah. i'm fucking traumatized, shaking, and crying, my brothers upset and bleeding, my moms panicking and agitated, and my stepdads still going on about how life is great. 

my mom helped me get a bed ready in the spare room so that's where i am now. 
i don't know what to do, i've got school in a few hours, i'm worried about my brother, everything's a wreck.
