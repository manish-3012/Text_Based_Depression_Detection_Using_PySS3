It's confirmed I'm a fucking idiot You know that Kylie Jenner lip challenge thing that went around the Internet like a few years ago. I just did that like 20 minutes ago completely curious as to what my lips look like if they were bigger but I fucked it up and now my lips are bruised, There's purple and red dots all over them and I'll never do this again.  It doesn't hurt ehen left alone, but it stings when I bite at them which is a habit I have.  And the most sad part is my lips looked the exact same other than the bruises.
