It's snowing! I know that it's not a big deal in some places, but I live near the Baltic see in Poland and it hasn't been snowing for like 4 years. And definietly not that early in December! It's even 0Â°C, so snow will stay. I just wanted to share this, because it's so bizzare for it to snow so early...
