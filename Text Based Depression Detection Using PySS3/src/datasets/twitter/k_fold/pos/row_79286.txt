Working out (for me) is just a healthier alternative to self harm. I'm asthmatic. I'm really thin and unhealthy (BMI 15, you can imagine)  because of all the weight loss, due to all the stress caused by my parents. Up until last week, self harm was the only thing that gave me a little bit of peace followed by lots and lots of pain but last week, I finally had the courage to quit that and start working out. Plus, it still feels like I'm harming myself due to hypertrophy. Idk how to feel about that, but for now, it's working as an alternative to self harm.
