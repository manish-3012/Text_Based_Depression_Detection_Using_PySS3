Posting some song lyrics bc i cant build the courage to text my crush And I'm always where the

Sun don't shine the

Tears don't show won't

Hurt me now 'cause

Hearts been broke I

Hate myself but

It won't show I

Constantly lose all

My remorse and it's

10 for the wolf and

3 for the shepherd and it's

1 for the sheep who

Lead by a leopard often

Gave it's perception as a 

Handle of weapon took a 

Bite of your apple give me

All you can offer now I'm

Trapped in a changing maze

Setting my soul ablaze

Couldn't control the pace

Where is this going hey

Heartless is recklessness it's 
 
Word of a pacifist to

Word of a masochist I'm

Off of the map my lord I

Spoke to a baphomet he

Said he would save me if I

Gave him the thing he needed

What is this thing I pleaded 

Boy it's the key to even

Yeah
