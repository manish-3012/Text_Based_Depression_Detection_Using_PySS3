I don't know what more disgusting....... The fact that some countries are willing to put lives of kids in risk by not doing online teaching or that parents are okay with that......probably latter one because "kIdS nEeD tO sOcIajahhenah"......like shut up, yes people need to spend time together.....BUT NOT WHEN THERE IS A FUCKING PANDEMIC OUTSIDE.

But I don't know why I am suprised, these are parents that think beating kids is normal and acceptable, these are the parents that are homophobic and transophobic, these are the parents that dont even act like parents, that don't give a fuck what their child is doing until its tarnishing their image, not kids image, but parents image, because, for whatever reason, your kid being successful student is fucking more important then their mental FUCKING HEALTH SO YOU CAN BRAG TO YOUR STUPID FUCKING FREINDS HOW YOUR CHILD IS BETTER THEN THEIRS.....WHAT THE FUCK......

I seriously hate Bosnia, it's a shitshow, as one Bosnian YouTuber put it "you people deserve every last bit of suffering you get", they could create a country that can be seen as normal, but because of their own fucked up minds they do exact opposite and allow corrupt idiots (actually, forget that, they aren't idiots, they are geniuses without morals) to exploit them even more, while those who actually want normal life are leaving for EU countries.
