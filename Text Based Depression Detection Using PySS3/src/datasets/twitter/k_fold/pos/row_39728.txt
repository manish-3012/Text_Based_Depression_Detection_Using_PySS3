Ik I'm only 19 but i think i want to marry her A bit of context. I'm not used to getting gifts. I've never gotten a Christmas present and on birthdays,anyone remembering those is a gift in itself but I digress. 

We've been dating for 6 months &amp; this is my first serious relationship. We pretty much plan our whole lives together now. And we got a savings account together,pretty big deal. 

So,I'm really into gaming. And she feeds the monster by getting me games and stuff. Early today,we were talking, and I said I wanted a Series S but I wouldn't have enough money. And she says we could just use the money we saved up. I thought she was joking but apparently not. 

Remember how I'm not used to getting stuff? This is pretty big for me. I haven't cried in years cause toxic masculinity yay,but bros,it happened. I don't deserve her. I don't even know how to show her how much I love her. 

Sorry for it being so long.
