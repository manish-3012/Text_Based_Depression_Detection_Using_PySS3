I just realized my friend is better than me at every aspect of life So I've been friends with him for years and I just noticed that he is actually better than me at everything. He is just naturally talented. I don't know what to do or how to build my self-esteem. I don't want to always compare myself to him, I want to have hobbies and talent too but I feel unmotivated. I know practice makes perfect but I just don't know how to be better. I just look at him and realize how much of a better person he is than me.
