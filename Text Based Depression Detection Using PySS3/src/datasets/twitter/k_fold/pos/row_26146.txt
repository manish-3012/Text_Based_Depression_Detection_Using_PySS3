My friend pisses me off My friend is so fuckin dumb. His only thoughts that he's shown about the situation with women's safety is "Is the 6pm curfew gonna happen" and "oh she's a feminazi bitch". He doesn't even know half the fucking information, he's just heard that somebody said a 6pm curfew for men. Its quite clearly just a point being made that if women are being told to stay home at night to stay safe why shouldn't men stay home instead. Why do the victims have to change their lives instead of the people who have the potential to cause the harassment? I've tried explaining this to him multiple times and he just ignores it and just kinda shrugs and it pisses me off. Plus he always brags about knowing more about business than me and I'm just like no shit maybe thats cause you took the subject and I didnt. So he keeps bringing up the idea of starting a business together as soon as I finish sixth form but I dont wanna do that, I'm interested in physics and technology, why would I want to sell shit from a warehouse. Also the other day he was trying to suggest that we live together in a house along with another one of our friends so we can afford accommodation and they were kind of pressuring me into it by asking me "would you be up for it?" over and over when they've already decided on the location and I want to go to university and I dont want the university I go to, to be decided by that. And on top of everything I've got to handle the shit of telling this guy that I'm bisexual, knowing that he doesn't want to hold any homophobic views but on some level he does. Sorry if you read all this and thanks for giving up some time.
