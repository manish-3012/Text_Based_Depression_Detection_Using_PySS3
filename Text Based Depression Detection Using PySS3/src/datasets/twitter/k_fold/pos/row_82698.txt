I don't know what to feel She literally left because she said she lost feelings, it makes no sense after we literally spent every day possible together and made so many promises, in the end it's your fault for trying to have sexual activities and sext when on MULTIPLE occasions I did NOT give consent, but hey now your back with your ex which you called horrible and abusive. I'm ashamed I ever felt anything twoards you.
