Ending my life would be better than living it God I need to rant now. My parents are the most unhappy couple I've ever fucking met. They yell divorce insults at each other every now and then. I blame myself for them to still be together. Dad is a miserable cunt who influenced me wrongly for a long time teaching me to hate people. Mom told me to my face I suffocate the house and she doesn't want me here. I'm in grade 12 and I can't study shit cause I can't concentrate. I love my girlfriend but it's very long distance and she's losing feelings for me, no matter how hard I try to give her space, be there for her or anything she ever needs. All my good friends live a 100 km away and now due to Covid I can't go out too. School was escape for me but online school sucks. I'm 17 so I don't wanna be high 24/7 and so I've been trying to control to smoking weed twice a week only. 

Life is so fucked up I got a knife with me and all I wanna do is stab myself to a point I don't feel anything anymore.
