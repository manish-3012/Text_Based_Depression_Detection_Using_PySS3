I need dating advice okay so me and this girl have been flirting for a while but she keeps on sending random pictures of this guy and we exchange videos and pictures just like as a thing(sorta like snapping each other but I don't like snapping), But she also sends pictures of guys who snap her weirdly and like with tHiEr shirt off and shit (whenever we do this) but this guy is fairly attractive (no homo) and I'm not sure if I should be intimidated or something. I think we're flirting because we make jokes abt each other that are sexual in nature like I was asking her if she wanted to play among us and she responded with IM JERKING OFF and so I said "to me obv" and she responds with a yes.
