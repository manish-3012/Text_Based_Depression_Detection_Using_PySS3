Born from trash, Iâ€™ll die like trash Iâ€™m a foster child. My mom was a whoâ€™re, I donâ€™t know who my dad is. Prob som black dude called Lamar. Iâ€™m mixed. I live in a better world. But I keep harming myself and others. Iâ€™m gonna die from overdose someday. Itâ€™s what my sister told me. Sheâ€™s only 6 too. I am lucky enough to have access to the internet to share this story. So, goodbye. I wonder what god will say to me.
