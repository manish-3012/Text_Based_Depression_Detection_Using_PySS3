So pissed off right now I saw this vid on tiktok where these two girls went â€œI miss when men went to war and never came backâ€ like to you know how fucking offensive that is. And it had 14K likes aswell. My dads in the army and him going off to war is one of my biggest fears we live in Ireland so thereâ€™s only a small chance of that happening, but heâ€™s been close to death before. Itâ€™s just plain sexism that those girls think they have the place to say that and it really makes me sad.
