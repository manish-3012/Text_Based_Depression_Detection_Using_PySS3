I'm making a VERY SERIOUS webtoon series and I need some ideas. It must have something to do with explosions, because the punchline is exactly the same at the end of every episode; something explodes. I usually title each episode the thing that explodes, so just give me a bunch of things that explode and I'll make a episode out of it.
