I just started talking to this girl from school for a few weeks I have been in a really dark place and this girl from school reached out to see how I was doing because she could tell something was up. She just let me vent to her and I let me confide. Over a few weeks sheâ€™d talk to me in and out of school and made me feel appreciated. She became someone who I could rely on which brings me to my point. Reach out to people in need bruh. Just let people know they matter not only to you but to others.
