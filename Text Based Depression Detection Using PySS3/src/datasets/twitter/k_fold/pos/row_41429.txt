How to get over my best friend cutting me off for a misunderstanding? My former best friend cut me off four days ago and Iâ€™m still upset about it. I thought are relationship was pretty solid but she tossed me to the side of the road over a 5 minute exchange that happened at a party. How do I cope with this?
