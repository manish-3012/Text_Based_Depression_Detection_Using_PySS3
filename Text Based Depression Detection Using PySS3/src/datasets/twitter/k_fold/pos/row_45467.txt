How do I make sure Iâ€™m not giving my friend the wrong impression? So Iâ€™ve got a really nice friend at school, and I talk to him a lot. Weâ€™re both pretty opinionated about politics/world events and itâ€™s just really neat to discuss. Itâ€™s actually one of the few topics that I can talk on end about, like with other things Iâ€™m a lot more awkward and uncertain about so I can totally get where he others might get the idea that I like him because of how often I talk to him and the energy(?) I guess. And while I really do care, heâ€™s a great friend and I really enjoy hearing his thoughts and talking to him in general, Iâ€™m looking to keep it platonic. And my thing isnâ€™t that Iâ€™m worried that he will like me, since (I think) heâ€™s been alluding to that heâ€™s not into girls, and heâ€™s also said heâ€™s ace earlier on in the school year. Iâ€™m just kinda worried I might make him uncomfortable.

Any advice is appreciated!
