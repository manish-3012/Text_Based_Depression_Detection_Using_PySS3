I don't know what's wrong with me and it's making really really hopeless I'm mainly just venting and if you don't care skip

I've been to doctors, tests, therapy all that stuff but nothing has happened yet, nothing has changed. I'm so done with this, I'm tired. 

I'm really happy, confident, I can actually do stuff like try new things, I feel like I'm on top of the world for weeks, and then it just drops. I get really fucking depressed, suicidal, I hate myself so much I get angry and all I wanna do is die. I'm currently having that and I just want it to stop, I want everything to stop, I wanna go back in time I just don't wanna be here right now. I feel so hopeless because it feels like there's no cure, and I can't with this feeeeeelingggg, it's like a bottomless pit I just keep falling no matter how I try to grab onto something I just fall and fall and fall into eternal nothingess
