I love bread and will do everything to get as much bread as possible I love bread it has been with me my whole life
My life is dedicated to eating bread
I just love it
I'm eating bread every day and It is always delicious 
Bread made my life worth living and I don't  think I could 
Be here if bread wasn't there to help and support me
