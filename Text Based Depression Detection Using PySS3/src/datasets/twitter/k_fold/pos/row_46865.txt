Films that are rated 12A now should be rated 15 most of the time. For example, thereâ€™s a movie on NowTV called Welcome to Marwen (with Steve Carrell as the main character) in which there are themes of sex, thereâ€™s suggestive nudity, and scenes of torture. Now, itâ€™s not real torture, so I can see why they could get away with it.

You can think of me as a snowflake, but I donâ€™t think that children at the age of 9 should know about sex, PTSD, and/or torture. Some parents are irresponsible and will allow children below the age recommendation watch films like this. 

This is my opinion and you are free to downvote the hell out of it if you disagree.
