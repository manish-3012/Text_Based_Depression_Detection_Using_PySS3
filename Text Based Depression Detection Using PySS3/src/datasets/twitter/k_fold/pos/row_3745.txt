What the actual heck is up with girls and zodiac signs? I've always seen it as some 17th century facebook mom thing but one scroll through Instagram shows that it's way bigger than you think it is. And its almost exclusively a girl thing. 

I don't understand why. Of all ridiculous ideologies why that?
