The "krabby patty" incident, another crackhead story Back when we lived in a trailer, about 10-11 years ago, me and my sister somehow got the idea in our heads that it would be a good idea to use the bottle of flavored water we found in my dad's room and use a syringe to "spray" krabby patties onto the ceiling, it stained the ceiling and it's probably still here to this day.
