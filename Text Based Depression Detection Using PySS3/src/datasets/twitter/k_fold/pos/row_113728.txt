Do you ever discover a song and completely relate to it? "I talk to myself, self,

I think I need help, help.

So what if Im na-na-na not okay?

Im na-na-na not okay.

Im bad for my health, health,

My headâ€™s on a shelf, shelf.

So what if Im na-na-na not okay?

Im na-na-na not okay.

I sing to myself, self,

Who needs to get well, well?

So what if Im na-na-na not okay?

Im na-na-na not okay.
