I'm actually proud for once I'm not an athlete in any way and anyone who is will probably laugh at this. but for me, it's an achievement and it's good to celebrate those. 
finally got a new personal best mile on a treadmill. it was 9:25, which I know isn't impressive or a record but it means a lot to me.
