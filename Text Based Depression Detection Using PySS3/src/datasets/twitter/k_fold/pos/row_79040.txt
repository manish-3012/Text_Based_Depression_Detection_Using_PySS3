My parents apparently donâ€™t know what â€œoptional extra creditâ€ means I got all Aâ€™s, right? More than 90% on each test. My grade is alright, so I didnt choose to do the extra credit points over thanksgiving (the extra credit isnt even that much). So they decide to take a look at my grades today. They say â€œWhy didnt you do this assignment?! Itâ€™s 0%!â€ But they ONLY notice that one missing *OPTIONAL* assignment that I didnâ€™t fucking do and didnt notice how 1) My grade didnt go down 2) It says fucking *OPTIONAL* on the side and 3) The rest of the fucking tests I did AFTER the extra credit assignment. And here they are complaining and angry over one fucking optional assignment that I didnâ€™t need to do. Geez.
