I am Trans (MTF) I am been having thought for many years and Iâ€™ve been feeling different with my body but Iâ€™ve been putting it to the side, This been hard for me since Iâ€™ve had depression for a long time and Iâ€™ve been getting better havenâ€™t been accepting it and I know that I am so. 

For a long time Iâ€™ve been confused in my gender if I am a man or female but Since Iâ€™ve been home for lockdown and since there no school so Iâ€™m home for a long time Iâ€™ve been able to check on my self and know I I feel and know I am. 

My family see me as there little boy/man and itâ€™s hard for me to even try to tell them and due to being the first boy I am very special and the one that change all familyâ€™s and what brought all my family together Iâ€™m like there key but I feel itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a boy and thatâ€™s really for my grandpa really wanted and I feel that Iâ€™m stuck because of him but I donâ€™t feel that way.

I havenâ€™t told anyone yet not even my friends other then hints due to the unknowing if they will accept me and even if they do theyâ€™ll will disagree, I feel they wonâ€™t believe me since I never mention or act like I am due to me doing â€œmanlyâ€ thing like having a beard and such but in reality itâ€™s not me I donâ€™t feel like thatâ€™s me

So I feel that itâ€™s a new year new me so want to try telling my family and if anyone could give me advice for telling them

(TL;DR) Iâ€™m trans and I could use advice on telling my family
