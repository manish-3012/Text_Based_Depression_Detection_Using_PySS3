Yea i need some advice So Iâ€™m going to try to make this as short as possible but is a bit complicated 

Basically I have a friend who weâ€™ll just call A
And A has been my main man for the last few years and one of my best friends 

But we have both recently started hanging out with a girl whoâ€™ll Iâ€™ll call S and S is the cutest girl Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of being around so naturally both me and A have caught feelings for S and we are both pretty thirsty for a romantic relationship since none of us have ever had a girlfriend 

A side note is that S is extremely physical with both of us and show signs that indicate wanting to be with us to both me an A 

And my dilema is that I really want to get together with S but I am scared of ruining my friendship with A so Iâ€™m asking random people for help 

What should I do here? Let A go for it and suppress my own emotions? or try dating S and possibly ending my friendship with A?
