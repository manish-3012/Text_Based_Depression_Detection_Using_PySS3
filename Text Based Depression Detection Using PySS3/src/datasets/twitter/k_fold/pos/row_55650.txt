i just want to go outside and explore i am beginning to get bored doing what i do everyday. like gaming.
i just want to go outside and not come back for a day or two.
i always see those amazing cool forests when im going somewhere like vacation.
i have been afraid of the dark for a long time to be honest but i really want to walk around a big forest or something at night. everything feels more relaxed and looks nicer at night in my opinion. no people around, no loud noises. just the wind and maybe even some little animals.
i dont know if anyone here has the same lol.
sadly my parents want me to be home everyday at 10pm, not even 1 minute later.
i also dont know why i am telling this on reddit, maybe because people think im weird when i tell them this irl.
