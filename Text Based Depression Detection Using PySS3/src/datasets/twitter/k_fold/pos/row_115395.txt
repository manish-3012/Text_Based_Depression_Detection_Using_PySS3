Be honest, do you think what my Dad said makes sense? Today I felt kind of feverish and sick and so when I got home from school I told my Mom and went to my room to kind of â€œquarantineâ€ myself away from everyone else in the house. I texted my Dad that I was sick and it would be better if so didnâ€™t do my chores so I could prevent spreading anything I could possibly have. 

I guess he didnâ€™t get the text or see it because he came into my room at the end of the day asking if I had done everything and I said no and told him no because I was sick and didnâ€™t want to spread anything but he argued â€œBut you have enough energy to be on the phone?â€
 
To me this doesnâ€™t even make sense... because laying down drifting off to sleep on your phone takes so much energy...

Can someone please explain what he could have meant to me? And please tell if I should apologize or not?
