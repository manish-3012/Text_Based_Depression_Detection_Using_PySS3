How can I help myself with anxiety attacks/depression/giving up mentally/hating the world problems/having no irl friends? Any kind of answer will be nice. Please I beg do not look over this I donâ€™t wanna make a long caption but imagine being alone for 5 yrs, getting to the point of talking to yourself, doing nothing but studying (and sometimes u study so much u burn out and cry/panic), and having major trust issues because of betrayal from humanity? I literally canâ€™t stand living anymore. I havenâ€™t eaten in like an entire day either... itâ€™s getting worse. No one helps me and it feels like mentally Iâ€™m slowly dying. I also hate seeing ppl not help others... making me realize how fucked humanity is. I NEED AN ANSWER TO THIS! I canâ€™t I... I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not trolling or anything (proof in my page) I just need desperate help. Does self harm and weed help be honest? Like when I break down and cry, I feel like I should go the extra length and cut, but idk. I want someone to lean on tbh... I canâ€™t get a therapist either since I donâ€™t have enough money. Maybe some good Meds I can secretly order? Oh and I donâ€™t enjoy anything either other than jojo, so thereâ€™s that. Itâ€™s all that gets me through my day tbh. Laughing at memes.... Iâ€™ll just stop. If u wanna message me or whatever feel free. I like jojo bizarre adventure so I mean if u do too hit ur depressed boy up... or not :/. Also this is a repost bc ppl thought I was lying abt my last post which hurt me a lot mentally but itâ€™s whatever. Thatâ€™s all from me. I hope this doesnâ€™t get skimmed over.
