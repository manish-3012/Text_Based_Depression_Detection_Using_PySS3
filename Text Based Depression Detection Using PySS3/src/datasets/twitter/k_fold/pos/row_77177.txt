The feeling I get when my see my math teacher read the memes I posted to my WhatsApp status is indescribably awkward Itâ€™s not just that a teacher seeing the memes awkward itâ€™s that he is a teacher at a religious private school and that he just reads, itâ€™s like he is silently judging me based on my memes.
