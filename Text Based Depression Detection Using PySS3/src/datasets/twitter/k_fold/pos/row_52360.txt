I did the stanky leg and really fucked up I think I did the stanky leg and think I fucked it all up



So Iâ€™ve liked this girl for an unhealthy amount of time, 6 years almost but the timing and everything was never just right, either I had someone or she did. I used to help her a little bit with one of her exes way back with advice and stuff, after they broke up and I broke up with my girl at the time we seemed to get close and talk almost every day but she was a shy type so nothing more then the ill text you tmrw and the over use of :) stood out. I was getting major signals from this other girl and I went for her instead an we didnâ€™t talk much ever since then. After that relationship didnâ€™t work out I messaged her like a fucking idiot saying that I â€œusedâ€ to like her and wanna be close again and shit hoping that I could work things out but I think thatâ€™s where I really fucked it up (she completely ignored the part of the message where I said I liked her and didnâ€™t comment). Itâ€™s been 3 years since then and out of most of the people she knows Im one of her older friends. I get a shuttle feeling that she tries to avoid me, not very noticeable where as I show up she leaves or something just leaving things early not talking as much and just being different around me, sheâ€™s very nice to me and all that so itâ€™s nothing bad. But for an example sheâ€™ll tag 30 people on Instagram a lot of witch she doesnâ€™t even talk to as much as me, but I never get tagged anymore. Iâ€™m really wondering if she had something/ has something for me but is trying to avoid me and push it out of her head cuz of my stupid shit I said.
