Iâ€™m scared I like this boy but I donâ€™t talk to him at all the most I do is tell him to move over because I canâ€™t see the board! Iâ€™m awkward around guys that I like ! My friends always say â€œoh go talk to him â€œ but the thing is what do I say?! I donâ€™t even think he will take the time out of his day to even talk to me! I donâ€™t even think he acknowledges me . I need more confidence in myself. I just want him to notice me to be honest .
