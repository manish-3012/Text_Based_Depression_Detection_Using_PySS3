man, i feel so lonely. i have no quality friends to spend time with. my sibling's kinda busy with her mother. i can't find a girl who's smart enough to understand me. i don't have a computer so that i could play some favorite titles and forget the sadness forever. i got hurt yesterday because of my asshole dog and broke my new fucking expensive phone in the process that i bought with my own money which i earned by working at my father's office. mamoni has gotten frustrated over something and rash behavior is driving me crazy. i don't talk much or, at all so uh, i feel like exploding someday. damn, what do i lack? i have an opened mind, broadened knowledge, urge for learning skills, good fitness, caring mind and most importantly, being polite. yet, i fail to acquire anything i want.
