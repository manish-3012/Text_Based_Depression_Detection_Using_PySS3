Instagrams Pedophilia Problem. So I recently stumbled across numerous accounts on instagram that claim to be young girls (usually 14 to 16) selling their own nudes and photos to older men using cash app and amazon gift cards. I was scrolling through my explore page about a week ago when I started to notice these random shoutout pages amongst the hundreds of memes, or tiktoks that I was watching on the daily. They typically promoted girls and other tiktokers that were around my age (17) while also occasionally posting younger girls that looked to be about 12. It wasnâ€™t until 3 days ago that I would stumbled across one of the most disturbing accounts that I have ever seen. It was another shoutout page...except they were posting images of teens as young as 14 in their bras, underwear, and even censored photos of them completely naked with captions that promoted the selling of their nude photos. I clicked on many of the accounts the page promoted in hopes that reporting them would help even a little bit. Every time I did, instagram claimed there had been no violation of its TOS. Even the page that had the censored NUDE PHOTOS OF PRETEENS was not taken down or seriously reviewed. The accounts of the girls selling their explicit photos followed hundreds of other accounts doing the same thing. They had bios that stated they were selling their bodies for cash and would even post preview photos of them in bikinis showing their butt or breasts. Itâ€™s absolutely inexcusable that instagram has yet to crackdown on these Child Pornography rings and itâ€™s absolutely devastating that I and many others can barely do anything about this.
