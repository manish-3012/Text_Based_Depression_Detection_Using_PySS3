Imagine being ann introvert with extravert friends ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘ And then they start talking with the other extraverts and you feel awkward because you kind of know who they are but youâ€™ve never really talked to them and you arenâ€™t sure what to say or if you should introduce yourself or something and you just feel kind of awkward ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Š

I donâ€™t do that though ok guys thatâ€™s totally not me
