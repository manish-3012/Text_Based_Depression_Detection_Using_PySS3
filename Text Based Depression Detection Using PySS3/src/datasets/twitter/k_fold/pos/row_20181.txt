Fuck the post I just made! Yeah, some people would call me lazy. I don't give a flying fuck anymore. People can call it lazy. Iâ€™d call it not being a slave to the corporate master to conform to societyâ€™s ideals.

My issues with working and school wonâ€™t go away if I work more and play THEIR game how THEY want. I would just become better at lying to myself that I'm okay.

I'm trying to have as much free time as possible. That is my only goal. And if that means that I will have to deceive people and lie to them then so be it.

The worst that can happen to me is me committing suicide because everything else fails.

The majority of people are basically guilt tripped into saying that they are 'fine with work and school' by others throwing the condition of the homeless and dispossessed in our faces.

Fuck school, fuck work. I'm too weak to handle it and I will find ways to reduce the amount of work I'll have to do.

I'm not even poor enough to end up homeless. Welfare is still a thing if all else fails.

If I will end up homeless and everything goes to shit, then I will just kill myself.

Fuck it. I don't care anymore. People who try to unsettle me with their bullshit fear-mongering can go fuck themselves. That simple.

Itâ€™s not just â€œoh I donâ€™t like going to schoolâ€ No sane person does. Itâ€™s HATING the entire process even before and after school.

And itâ€™s just a cycle. Every. Fucking. Day.

If I'm happy and able to meet my needs fuck what anyone else says.

I'm through with it!
