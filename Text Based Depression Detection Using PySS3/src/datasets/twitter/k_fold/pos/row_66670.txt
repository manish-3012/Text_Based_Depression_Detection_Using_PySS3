TeleTubbies, The Creepiest Abomination of the past century Today I was just chilling on the couch, then my brother came to watch TV and so I handed him the remote. I was feeling kinda bored so i decided to just watch whatever he's watching (He's just 6 years old) so he was going through some channels and then he stopped at one. First I didn't understand what he was watching, and then i recognized the creepy smile of those creatures, TELETUBBIES! The name of the creature who I despise since my small ages. Actually I never had an interest for that cartoon, It was just creepy to the next level. Man I seriously regret seeing its face after such a long time. They aren't only creepy, but also cringy af. That sun baby and how they have a TV on their bellies and it turns on by rubbing it \*ugghhhh\* . I couldn't bear watching it for more than a minute. So, Have you all have any experiences with this Abomination of a Kids show?
