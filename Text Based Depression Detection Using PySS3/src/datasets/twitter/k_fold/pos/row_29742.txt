This is just me talking fell free to ignore I think Iâ€™ve being so much time thinking that everything is fine ,ignoring everything I feel and pushing people away ,that itâ€™s to late for me to get fixed ,like Iâ€™ve being avoiding everything for so long that Iâ€™m beyond repair, I mean that Iâ€™m already a bad person and there is no turning back for my even if I wanted to try and get my shit together I am already done without even starting and if I try to be good it would be only for my benefit ,i already hurt a lot of people I break every friend I have making them leave, like shit I even pushed my own mother away ,I mean yeah she was never the best but I am the one who hurt them everything I think of doing I need to think it a hundred times and there is always a way it hurts someone its like if every idea I have is design to hurt people like if my head was cursed with thinking of ways to hurt others and Iâ€™m just tired of being so bad to others no matter how much I try I always fuck it up and I just want to apologize but every time I try people tell me there is no reason to and I know they are lying I know I need to apologize but they donâ€™t leave me Iâ€™m just to selfish
