Love is such a strange thing Like even the word love sounds weird. Itâ€™s just a weird concept. Like you can love your pets, or an inanimate object. But you can also love someone. And *be in love* with someone. And â€œI love youâ€ is said a lot, but I wonder how many times people donâ€™t actually mean it
