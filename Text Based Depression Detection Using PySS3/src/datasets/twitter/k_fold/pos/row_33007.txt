How can I tell my parents that I'm not religious? Im 15 and was born into the Jehovah's Witnesses. Up until I was about 12 I was preparing to get baptized. But after doing some of my own research (out of different bibles and such) I realize how corrupt this religion can be.  


My sister who was baptized around my age was dis-fellowshiped a couple years back. In case you don't know what that means i'll quickly explain it: Basically once you're baptized you "make a promise to god". And if you break that promise everyone you know and love from the religion is forced to exile you until you come back. Literally blackmailing you into staying as a JW. (Obviously this is all bullshit so I've been talking to her anyways.)

I've been trying my hardest to muster the courage to tell them but I just cant. Huge thanks to anyone who can offer some advice.
