Vacation homework is bullshit I just remembered that I didn't do my summer vacation homework. That was 2 years ago. I was suppose to give it to them 2 years ago or else I would get more homework. Right now, at 3 am I just realized that I didn't get shit. No extra homework or anything. They didn't even mention that we needed to give them the homework. they just forgot that they gave us a shit ton of work.  Dude I feel bad for the people who did them.
