A list of my problems which I shall delete later * Depressed for atleast 8 years epicly
* Self harming for 3 years but sh free for over 2 months
   * I self harmed with massive knives too :D
* Extreme poverty
* I don't know whether I'll be able to sleep under a roof or on a bed next week
* Health anxiety
   * Thought I had 3 different types of cancers
      * It was hard living knowing (or thinking) you have 2 cancers
   * Brain stomach/colon and skin
   * Also thought I had appendicitis
* I can't eat for some reason sometimes, I take so long to eat as well
* I realise I'm eating food and I just stop
* I get full easily and hungry easily
* Excluding family and my girlfriend, no one cares about me at all
* Pretty sure my 'friends' have wanted me to die at one point
* I have people to talk to but I don't talk to them much, nor do I consider any of them a friend because I'm not close to them at all. They consider me a friend though
* I've been "friends" with a guy for 11 years. "Best friends" even.
* Also a very very picky eater
* I'm extremely extremely underweight and short (5'6 and 44kg/97lbs)
* I eat unhealthily all the time not bc im hungry but because fun
* Have been physically and verbally abused by my parents and a tutor since I was a kid but not anymore
* Hearing loud voices even when they're positive makes me so scared I probably have some sort of PTSD
* Have been suicidal since I was 10 atleast
* Sadly attempted suicide 2 days ago but I'm okay now
* Dysfunctional family
* Apparently look ugly but some people say I look pretty so idk
* I'm tired all the time
* Have seen sooossososo much gore (murder, terrorism, suicide, animal abuse, torture porn, rape, child murder and abuse etc.)
* Have unfortunatelyyy seen child porn on the clearweb when I was 12 and felt guilty for not reporting it I was just scared
* I've seen it 3 more times since then, 2 on the dark web by accident because I'm an idiot and once intentionally because I was catching 6 pedos/groomers
* I still remember the look in that 11ish year old girls eyes, she was following orders and when he wasn't looking I could see how she really felt about it and it was devoid of hope
* I'm completely desensitised to most things at this point
* Apparently look solemn and extremely serious and have dead or empty eyes??
* People think I'm a psychopath and I understand but I'm really not I care a lot about certain people and I'm very loving, I just can't open up to people
* I've cut people (with blades and scissors) and made them self harm under the guise of "It's a joke"
* I only regret the forced self harm which I did multiple times to one guy. The rest I have no remorse, they deserve it
* No life skills or street smarts at all
* No motivation to do any schoolwork or anything
* I don't have privacy or my own room or my own phone because my parents don't trust me. If I weren't a decent person I would have been doing so many bad stuff by now (drugs, sexual stuff yk) but I don't do it
* I'm not allowed a step outside and they do not give permission at all
* No freedom basically, all I have is technology and that's really it
* Overthinking and doubting and doubting my doubts and aaaaaa
* I wish I were normal
* I've watched a guy die in front of me and I felt nothing, I still don't care. I was actually amazed I was seeing all of it unfold
* I see flashes of violence randomly. If I see someone holding a knife doing normal stuff I have to get away or else they could stab me
* I'm scared to hold a knife near people because I might stab them intentionally or unintentionally
* My brain is extremely manipulative which is also the reason why I attempted suicide
* I'm.. manipulative.
* Have been close to killing a certain person but I never attempted thankfully
* I'm incapable of a lot of things.
* Only recently I learned how to cross streets and stuff, before I wasn't able to walk to and from school; my parents don't "want me to suffer"
* My parents are literally suffering so much and I want someone to end their suffering right now. All they feel is pain and torture physically and mentally. Someone end it.
* I can't cook or do anything for myself, I'm spoiled i guess
* Severely dehydrated

That's all I can think of for now but no one's gonna read all of this anyway. I'm happy though which is awesome, and I'm looking forward to being married with my girlfriend or future wife :D. I love her very much and I like making her happy, I wanna make cookies with her and go to the Louvre with her and loaddss more. Sooo despite all of those problems I'm happy
