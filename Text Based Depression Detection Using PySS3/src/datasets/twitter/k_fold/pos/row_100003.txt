Yay more getting emotionally and verbally abused by family members This time: my grandma

So I hadnâ€™t been using a pricey acne soap she got me for 3 weeks cause I didnâ€™t even know about it

She then, knowing I have severe depression and that the computer is my only escape, starts screaming at me about that â€œidiot boxâ€ distracting me from anything. Basically saying i donâ€™t care about anyone or anything aside from the computer and calling me a bad person because of it.

She acts like the computer is the reason for how shit i feel but itâ€™s really being treated like this and way worse (my mom is a piece of shit and my dad is almost as bad.)

I know this isnâ€™t that bad but it is just the incident that was the tipping point for a total mental breakdown (straw that broke the camelâ€™s back) and I have had my parents be way worse but this is on my mind rn.
