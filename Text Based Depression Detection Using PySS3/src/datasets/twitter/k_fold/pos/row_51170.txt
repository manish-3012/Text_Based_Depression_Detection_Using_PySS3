Do you know the song? \[I removed a few verses to make it a bit more difficult\]  
{Don't search the lyrics up, that ruins the game}

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck a princess, I'm a king  
Bow down and kiss on my ring  
Being a bitch is my kink  
What the fuck else did you think?  
Fuck a princess, I'm a king  
Bow down and kiss on my ring  
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting  
Spitting your blood in the sink

I'm crazy, but you like that  
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand  
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight  
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice  
I'm terrifying

I'm no Cinderella, but I like the shoes  
Big glass platforms, bitch, I'm choosey  
Long blue hair, blue as a bruise  
Only trust a fella for some light amusement  
I'm no prey, but I am pursued  
Pray for me, not on the churches pews  
New dickstraction, can't confuse me  
Whiskey in my hip flask, nothing fruity
