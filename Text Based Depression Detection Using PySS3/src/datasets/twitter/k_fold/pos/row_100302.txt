I don't know what to do. Help. So basically this girl I had known for like 5 years started asking me out every few months about 2 years ago. About 6 months ago I gave in and finally dated her, we dated for 4 months and it wasn't working on my side so I ended it. She still sends me messages telling me that I'm her everything and that she's thinking about me. I don't know how to take this. PLEASE HELP, I don't know what I'm doing.
