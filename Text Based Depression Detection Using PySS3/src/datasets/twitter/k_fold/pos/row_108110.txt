I broke the system I have really been wanting to do 100 pushups a day but just couldn't muster up the motivation, my solution? I can do 10 push ups right? I can do 10 push ups ten separate times right? And it worked, i literally just told myself "you're not doing 100 push ups you're just doing 10 sets of ten" and it worked, i did 100 pushups, you're alot stronger then you think, start off small it's not a race, keep grinding it will pay off i promiseðŸ™ðŸ™
