Help Me Write A Song. Hi bored teens! I am seeking writing prompts to inspire lyrics for my songs. Do you have a short story about life, relationships or friendship that you think would make a great song concept? Maybe you have an idea for a song that would really move you or be meaningful or even just cool to you? I love to hear new ideas!

Share your ideas and if I choose your story or idea, I will share the completed recorded song with you &amp; include your name in the credits if you want. 

Keep it short &amp; keep it clean please. It's hard to convert a novel into song lyrics and I won't consider inappropriate posts. Please DO NOT INCLUDE PERSONAL INFO in your post. I will message the user if I choose your idea to build on. Thanks everyone!
