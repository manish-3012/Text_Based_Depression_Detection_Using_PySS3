Remember to give your eyes a break from the phone/computer every once in a while Like seriously my eyes will be all dry and I could prevent it a lot if I just take time to look away from the screen. So look out the window if you have one. 

And stay hydrated (this is coming from a person who is dehydrated like 50% of the time itâ€™s not fun)
