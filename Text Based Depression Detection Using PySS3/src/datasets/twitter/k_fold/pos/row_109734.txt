ola r/teenagers, i come seeking sage advice Recently, iâ€™ve started talking to this girl, who seemed really nice, but shits been happening recently thatâ€™s just confusing. about a week ago, she ghosted me for a few days, still making an active social media presence. she later explained her actions, â€œcut loads of people off, regretted not talking to me blah blah blahâ€ (i also forgot to mention this but we both have feelings, though she doesnâ€™t want to act on it mostly out of fear of relationships) when she started talking to me again shit seemed normal for a while, just friends but yk thatâ€™s fine i enjoy talking to her either way. recently though sheâ€™s been a bit more distant, even though sheâ€™ll still reply to any image of myself with compliments, and before the ghosting, would send paragraphs in appreciation. i think sheâ€™s starting to ghost me again, making an active social media presence while not responding to my text, and iâ€™m rly just confused as to why, cause it makes absolutely no sense to me.
