Please tell people you care about them I'm drunk right now so I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. My friend told me she cares about me and I realised that i never hear that. I broke down and started crying. I feel so alone all the time and this was so helpful. Please make it a point to let those you care about know that you care about them. I know I don't say it enough, and i wish i did. Let's normalize affection for those we care about. I'm sorry if this is dumb, but it's important
