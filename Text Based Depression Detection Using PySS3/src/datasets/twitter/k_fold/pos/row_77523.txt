Yo I have r/teenagers conspiracy theory You know how there's Megathiccc, and Megathicccc and Megathicc jr, etc?

And how most people theorize that it's just Megathiccc controlling those alts?

What if, Megathiccc is actually a hidden project created by a secret organization to help people cope and escape reality.

Escapism is a coping mechanism which is quite something during the pandemic, helping people forget about their worries and just live a different life.


Thoughts?
