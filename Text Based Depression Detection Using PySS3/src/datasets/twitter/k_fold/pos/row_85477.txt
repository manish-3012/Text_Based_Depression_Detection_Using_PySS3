When you die, would you rather be reborn, or just die forever? Discussion. Think about it. We weren't born early enough to do anything remotely cool, and in the future, there is a huge chance the Earths going to be effected more and more by pollution. Aaaaand, if you're in America, in about 80-150 years, scientists predict Yellowstone will erupt.

I just think unless were reborn as something in a different time or universe, there might be a point. But who knows? Maybe some if us will thrive in a wasteland
