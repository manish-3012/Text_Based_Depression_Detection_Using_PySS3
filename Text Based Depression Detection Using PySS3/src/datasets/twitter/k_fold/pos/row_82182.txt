Confronting morality is the only way to make life enjoyable And before you get worried, no, Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m just saying that people will enjoy what they have when they fully understand that life is short. 

Itâ€™s just a fact that we have to face. Without death, there would be no life. So we need to enjoy what we have while we have it. 

Instead of wasting our lives away looking at forgettable social media posts. We need to do what we love. 

Pick up that game you havenâ€™t beat. Solve that puzzle you havenâ€™t solved. Finish that project that youâ€™ve swept under the rug. 

Life is a beautiful thing. So letâ€™s make it great while it lasts!

Letâ€™s leave a mark on this world! Make yourself stand out! Ask your crush out! Something! Anything!

Just do what you love people! Because all good things come to an end eventually. So letâ€™s enjoy everything that we can!!!
