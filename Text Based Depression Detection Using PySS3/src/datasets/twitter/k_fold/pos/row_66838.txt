How do I deal with an absolute asshole? I recently reconnected with a group of friends and all is going well except for one person. 

When ever I say anything (only online cause I don't see him in person luckily) he replies very quickly with a snotty sarcastic comment when it has nothing to do with him. He tries to speak for everyone when I ask something and it's getting hella hard to ignore. 

This guy is one the reasons I took a break from that group in the first place and yeah I was and still can be a very sarcastic person but I don't think I did anything to aggravate him? I came back and "hi" and it started there. 

What is the most effective way to deal with this prick without causing a bigger problem with him or anyone else?
