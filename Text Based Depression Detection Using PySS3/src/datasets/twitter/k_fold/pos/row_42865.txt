Just got my first ever election ballot today- Please register to vote I'll keep it short. Please don't ask who I'm voting for, I'm not here to debate about politics. **Just here to remind you to register and vote if your eligible!**

[Voter turnout](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13347080/voting-age-election-16) among the age range of 18-24  was a pathetic 39% last presidential election, which is less than half that of the age ranges 45-64, 65-74, and 75+. Do you really trust voters in those age ranges to consider the long term consequences of their decisions if they wont live to see them? I don't. And neither should you.

P.S. There are way too many people who don't want to see us vote, so stick it to them by doing just that. Think of it as an act of defiance.
