Losing weight Iâ€™m 15, 180 lbs, and Iâ€™m 6â€™1. Idk if thatâ€™s normal but Iâ€™m pretty damn insecure about it so im attempting to do a water fast up until Christmas. With all the pandemic and shit my family canâ€™t really afford a gym membership so this is the cheapest way to loose weight in my opinion. Iâ€™ll update every day around 7-8 pm, central standard time.
