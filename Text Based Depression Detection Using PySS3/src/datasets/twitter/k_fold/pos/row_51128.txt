To: Ppl who say this subreddit is messed up rn Sort by new, not only does that mean you can help bring good content into hot, it is much better than sorting by hot itself. Like seriously sorting by new is refreshing, and you see actual content, people asking for advice, and just general talking. Sure there is some trash, but its easy to scroll-past/down-vote if needed.
