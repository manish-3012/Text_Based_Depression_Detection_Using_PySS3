Ok so I Don 't Know what to do I Will cut straight to the Chase. I have had Very Very low self esteem and confidence for many years. Being bullied a Lot and other stuff. But i hate having low self esteem. So I started trying to get self esteem by getting confident. Which ive been doing with fake it till you make it/become it. And Yea well it has kinda worked out but Maybe in a wrong way. Because it seems to me that some of my "friends" think its because i think Very highly of my self (I Really dont). And my mom has said you Know its good to be confident but not too confident. So Yeah. Idk what to do pls help
