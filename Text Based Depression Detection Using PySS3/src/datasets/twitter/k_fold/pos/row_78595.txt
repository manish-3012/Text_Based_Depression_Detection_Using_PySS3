i almost said that i was happy that biden won in front of my very conservative dad my dad's very conservative. pro trump. pro life. anti legalizing weed. etc.

Well he came home from work sulking cuz of biden's victory. he asked how my day was, and I estatically said:

"Great!" cuz I was happy that biden won.

then i had to quickly come up with other reasons why my day was great. i said i was estatic that i had no homework to do (which is a lie) and that's all I could come up with. The only thing that made today great for me was biden and I almost said that out loud.

glad i didn't lol
