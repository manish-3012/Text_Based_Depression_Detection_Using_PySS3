I am crocheting a queen sized sunflower blanket for my crush Hey everyone I'm a 20M boy and I just wanted to tell someone that I am making a blanket for my crush! It takes 300 starburst granny squares and I've chosen the queen size naturally as it's for my queen!!! It's about 70% done and I'm going to give it to her for Christmas. I hope she likes it :)
