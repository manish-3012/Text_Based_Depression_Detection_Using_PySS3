Question before going to bet bed Just want to ask, is it normal and do any of you have the same, when you get in the bet you think about suicide and how it would be better then living cuz my life will suck but then start thinking about the ppl you care about and you just there, don't know if you should or shouldn't do it, it happens to me every time before sleeping
