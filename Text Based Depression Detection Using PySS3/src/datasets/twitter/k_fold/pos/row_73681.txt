My friends had a Halloween party without me A few days ago, all my friends except me had a big halloween party and they posted pictures to their instagram and they looked like they all had fun. All of my friends. They never even asked me if I wanted to go, or said anything about their party to me. Its not like they thought I had other things to do either. I'm feeling really bad about this.
