Why is 140lbs considered skinny for a girl? Like this is not my preference, I donâ€™t really care but I know quite a few guys who prefer girls around 140lbs. But then people were saying that is a middle school girlâ€™s weight, etc. 

140lbs is a healthy weight until you reach 6â€™2 (according to BMI calculator). Then you become underweight. Like how many girls are 6â€™2? I donâ€™t understand why so many people think 140lbs, or even 130lbs are â€œso skinnyâ€ for a girl when they are healthy weights for the vast majority of girls.
