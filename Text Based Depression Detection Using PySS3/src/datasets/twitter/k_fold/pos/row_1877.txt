Tables Turned (149) When we go through the pain, the anxiety, the sadness, the darkness, the depression; everything that is constantly pushing us back and trying to push us down, **one day the tables turn.**

**One day, we get to the point where all the time, energy, effort, sweat, tears, blood &amp; our entire soul is seen by the Universe and given to us 100 fold. Until that day, keep pushing, keep going, its all worth it.**

The times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day, to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility. Something that helps me is knowing when I am feeling tired and wanting to give up, **I take a step back. To reset. I go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be.**

Everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of, that we expect, but the Universe already knows and thats all that matters to me.

**Keep going.**

**I love you.**
