I actually feel like Iâ€™m dead I donâ€™t have any real interests and all I do at this point is see other people having all this fun. Iâ€™m bored out of my mind, Iâ€™m extremely unproductive, I donâ€™t feel like doing ANYTHING. I just donâ€™t see myself having a future. I have no idea what the fuck Iâ€™m supposed to do and Iâ€™m just this person who doesnâ€™t have any aspirations or hope for anything. I kind of just go along with whatever happens to me. I genuinely donâ€™t have anything to say about myself. I have no impact on anyoneâ€™s life whatsoever and I donâ€™t know what my purpose is other than taking up space. I seriously donâ€™t even know how to RELATE to people sometimes bc theyâ€™re so into things you know?? Like they have stuff they enjoy doing and they have an actual life to talk about while I have NOTHING. Nothing at all
