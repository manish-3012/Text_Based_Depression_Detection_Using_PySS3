Making a Diary like thing on Reddit Day 193 Yay, yet another Day is through. I am happy to announce that is going okay with me and the girl from yesterday that i mentioned. She seemed to ignore me at first, but now we talked like before yesterday. At least a bit. And i forgot to mention this, but for Some reason, some of the people ship me and her, because we make fun and are friends. Linda like how my teachers used to make fun and saying me and my crush are together. I am not a big fan of it, but i dont really care too much.

Well, i spent most of my Day on my computer, yet again, and talked over discord mostly. I am begining to find my Challenge to get less challenging because things are getting easier to do. The pushups are becoming less and less of a Challenge. Still needs to do 40 squads today. You can find the link to my Challenge in Day 189 or so.

See ya tomorrow.
