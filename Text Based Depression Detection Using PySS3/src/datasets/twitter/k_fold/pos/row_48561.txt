Which tattoo in your opinion should I get? The tattoo will be on the opposite place of my chest where the heart is located.

Option 1: Bear, for bravery and resilience in the face of no hope.

Option 2: Wolf, the courage to keep going and the integrity to keep on going.

Option 3: Phoenix, to symbolise transformation and rebirth. From the ashes of the past Iâ€™ve been born anew.

It will be quit small but I need a permanent reminder of where I can from and what I came from.
