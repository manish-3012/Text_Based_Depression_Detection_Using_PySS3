An interesting post How is the thought that aliens outside of our world dont exist ever taken prominence? Where did life come from to Earth? It sure as frick cant be a coincidence that life eventually came to a habitable planet. As well as the fact that life definitely didnt just suddenly exist on Earth, it had to come from somewhere.
