Idk were to post this so here you go Happened like 3 years ago, I was at chillis and ready to leave, I had a little left of my meal to take home, so naturally I requested a box (should have said take out box) from my waiter but this dud comes back 15 minutes later with a big ass fucking shipping box like this ðŸ“¦ and then just leaves, like doesn't say anything just puts it down and leaves before I can say anything, I ended up just asking another waiter for one but I never saw that dude again and I went there alot, saw him the times I went there before but only obce like 2 months later after
