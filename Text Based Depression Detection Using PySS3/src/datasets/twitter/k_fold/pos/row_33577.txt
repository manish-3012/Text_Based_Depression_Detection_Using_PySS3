Ok so I need advice Up until middle school I was a really good student but then middle school rolled around and I was meh. I passed with 16/20 which wasn't really hard. I was a decent student at things like philosophy and pretty bad at things like physics,math,geometry 


But now I'm in the second year of middle school and things are really tough. I'm pretty sure I have learning disabilities but also maybe not. This year I'm particularly bad at the things I was pretty but last year and meh at the things I was decent at.


My teachers all suck they dont take the time to explain things and my mom thinks its because I dont study enough. But the problem is I do exactly what I'm told ts do except if I dont understand it. If I dont understand something I will leave it there but especially at physics I dont understand shit


My grades are dropping and I dont know how to fix them. Any help?
