anyone elses parents ruin their halloween plans? loving life right now it sucks because anyways i literally havent hung out with anyone in months, last time i can remember was january? i may have hung out with someone in february or march but honestly i cant remember??? like i literally dont see anyone and i have no friends so you would think she would be happy for me wanting to go out with a friend that i finally have and she wont let me go. and its halloween. i wanted to do something fun this year and do some fun shit but like fucking whatever i guess right!!
