I swear physical affection is like a chemical addiction Like one moment you're holding hands, but you keep craving more, then you have your arms around their shoulder, then your kissing, then your cuddling, so on and so forth. It doesn't stop, I just keep wanting more, and can't seem to settle for less. It's frustrating. And of course you think getting alot all at once would be a great relief, but it isn't, it doesn't hold you over, it just grwatens the craving feeling
