How should I DM girls from my university? For context, I'm a 19 year old guy (borderline teen, I know)  and a page of my university said in a story that we could tell them what we were looking for in a girl or guy and they would put some suggestions for each person on a post. So these three girls were suggested to me and these aren't exactly  matches since I'm pretty sure that they didn't contact the page like I did. 2 out of 3 are aware as they commented like "oh you got one" and "oh you too". So the only thing I have in common with them is that we go to the same university. That's it. So I guess I should DM them, because that's the point but I have no idea what to say. I don't wanna seem like a total freak nor that I want to be with them. So what should I do? Keep in mind that I'm 19 and I've never been in a serious relationship before and I'm a bit insecure so I'm really overthinking about this and I want to contact them just to see. And there's a third girl but idk why I just feel from her profile picture that she's out of my league. Idk why cause the two others are pretty and I'm thinking that there's a slim chance that maybe something could happen.
