My cousin told all his friends that Iâ€™m his girlfriend This afternoon I had opened my dms on Instagram to see that I had 1 request pending so I opened. For the sake of my cousins identity Iâ€™ll refer to him as Jim Bob. A random guy had texted me asking â€œAre you dating Jim Bob?â€. At the time I didnâ€™t know who Jim Bob was considering him and I have different last names and havenâ€™t talked for about 4 years. I asked this guy who Jim Bob was until it hit me that he was my cousin. I told the guy that he was my cousin and that Iâ€™d rather die than even thinking about dating my cousin. I asked him why he had asked me if I was even dating him and replied with â€œJim said that youâ€™re his girlfriend and that youâ€™re dating.â€. I literally had no idea who this guy was and why my cousin told him we were dating. I told the guy that if Jim ever told anyone that I was his girlfriend ever again that heâ€™d better watch himself. I was so disgusted to find out that my cousin had told all of his friends that I was his girlfriend to the point where I had a panic attack because I was so angry and confused. I havenâ€™t texted Jim asking why he would say things like that about me but at the same time, the jokes on him cause Iâ€™m not actually a girl.
