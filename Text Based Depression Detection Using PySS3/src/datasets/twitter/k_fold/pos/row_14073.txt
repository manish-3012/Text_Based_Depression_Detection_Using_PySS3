I feel like a horrible person after breaking up with my girlfriend. I just having been feeling the same way about us recently, so I decided it would be best to break up. I really care for her and the last thing I wanted to do was to hurt her, so I told her I just wanted to be friends. She got real upset at me and now I canâ€™t help but to feel bad. It feels like a pit is in my stomach right now. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m not even asking for help here, hell I donâ€™t even know what the point of this point is, but I just feel so horrible. She keeps on telling me that I was lying about loving her when that wasnâ€™t the case and I just donâ€™t know what to do, I just want her to calm down.
