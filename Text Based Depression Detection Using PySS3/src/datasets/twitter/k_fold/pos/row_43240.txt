You know what, I get why she's taking a break from it... This girl told me she's not gonna have sex for a while now. I wasn't sure why and I really don't care, that's her choice. I know why now. The conversation continued about sex and we were talking about how supposedly girls fake orgasms a lot.

 She said it does happen and I said something like, "well clearly you know guys can't fake it and most don't have to." Her response shook me. She said, "No, they just hide it when they don't use protection." This was a caption on a picture and she looked distressed so I'm pretty sure a guy did that to her.  

PSA for all guys: Unless the girl's good with it and unless you're good with the possibility of kids, don't fucking do that shit.
