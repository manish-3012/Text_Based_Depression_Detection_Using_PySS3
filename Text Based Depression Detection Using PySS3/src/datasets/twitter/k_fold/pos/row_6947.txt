Words cannot describe how utterly disappointed i am with life right now Everything just sucks omega. Can someone tell me why its my job to deal with this shit? God its really gotten on my nerves lately, "oh don't worry it'll get better" when, tell me WHEN? Everyone else's lives seem to work out somehow, why can't mine? Pain and I'm exhausted of it, lorn am I of companionship and friendships, happiness and contentment are no longer even memories.
