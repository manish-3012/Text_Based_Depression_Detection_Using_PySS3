I donâ€™t think I can handle this I just have to many things , to many things on my mind 
That I am tryna deal with , but I just canâ€™t , Iâ€™m tryna be happy 
And school at the same time , Iâ€™m tryna give myself time 
And just tryna think in positive , but school is just tearing me down 
I just donâ€™t think that I can handle all this load , I know other people can 
But I am just not that strong , Iâ€™m tryna tell myself 
That there is a point for all this , that someday I will get something I deserve
But if this is what I deserve being hell bound and never reaching a better place , I wish I was somebody else , because I see everyone with their friends , and there , I feel so fake , like come and watch this weird kid
With zero mental health , and see if he can lead us to a treasure  that he canâ€™t posses . I canâ€™t Iâ€™m sorry , I need to crash , I need a vacation 
But not from school , from my brain , I need a break from me 
I need to stop pushing my problems away and start facing them 
But every time I do l I just drown . I canâ€™t handle it 
And I canâ€™t handle knowing that sooner or later I  will have to ready or not 
And I canâ€™t handle knowing that everything is pointless 
I canâ€™t handle knowing that I cursed myself to this 
I like blaming the old me , but I know future me also curses me
Blaming me for not getting out of here , 
But I donâ€™t even know if there even is a road
I donâ€™t even know if there is a reason to keep forward 
I canâ€™t handle all those doubts , all those questions , all those regrets
, all this anger I hate toward myself , 
All those things that i wanna say but canâ€™t because no one listens

I feel like Iâ€™m on a prison , 
Who am I kidding I know how to get out 
Just walk out the door , there are two outcomes 
It works or you get shot 20 times and get out here again ,
And just looking at the data .....
And Im being pressured everyday to do it 
But I canâ€™t because I know that I end up losing 
So do I just wait till the time has end 
Until someone pulls me out the this place 
Do I even have someone I could call a friend
Do I really have to do it all it by myself 
Because if so then all that comes to mind and killing myself

I know my problems are probably not as high stakes as most of you 
And I know yâ€™all probably screaming at how lucky I am and how easy Iâ€™ve got it , but I feel bad they are really just shredding me , 
Sorry for making you go thru this rant
