I got called a racist My friend was taking about BLM and I said, â€œALM, Iâ€™m not trying to discredit black peopleâ€™s suffering but blacks are not the only ones who suffer police brutality there are other people who suffered too like Asians and Hispanicsâ€ and I got called a racist trump supporter, like I donâ€™t support trump and like I said Iâ€™m not trying to be racist like those people who say blm is anti white Iâ€™m just trying to explain that other people also suffer
