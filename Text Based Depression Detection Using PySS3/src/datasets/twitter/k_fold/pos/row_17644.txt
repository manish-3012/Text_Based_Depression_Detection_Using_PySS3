Zoom bombing is not funny and it never will be Going to a class just to blast music or shout slurs is not funny at all. My youngest sibling was in class listening to the teacher speak, when some 13 year old thought it would be funny to join and bomb the meeting. They used their younger siblings information, joined the meeting, and started shouting racial slurs at the teacher and the students. They were later kicked and now authorities have gotten involved. Zoom bombing is wrong and just stupid. Donâ€™t zoom bomb, kids are just trying to go to school during the pandemic.
