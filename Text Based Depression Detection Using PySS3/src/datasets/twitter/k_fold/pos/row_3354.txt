Posting daily until I grow a spine and come out to my parents as trans: Day 4 It's day 4 and I'm already running out of shit to talk about. 

I'm kinda stressed ngl. I have a lot of assignments due tomorrow and I should probably get working on those. If only school wasn't so boring lol

Anyway,  how are you guys doing?
