Please. I need advice. This is the fourth time I felt suicidal this year. My brain is dying from stress and high expectations, along with all the projects and events I need to plan. No one seems to know I had spent time and effort into everything to to the best of my ability, and either punish me or limit my screen time with Family Link, which gives me no privacy and has the ability to ban you from using google, which just made me more addicted to my phone. And now everyone is saying I use my phone too much. Please help. My brain is going to explode and I don't want to live any longer
