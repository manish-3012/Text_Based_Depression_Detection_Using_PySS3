I have an 82 day streak on duo [Iâ€™ve been switching between French, Norwegian and Swedish](https://imgur.com/a/t5Qk4EU), switching between French and either Norwegian or Swedish would probably be fine but Norwegian and Swedish are very similar, itâ€™s like the difference between English and Scots yeah if you speak one you can probably understand the other but if your learning both of them at the same time it would be confusing
