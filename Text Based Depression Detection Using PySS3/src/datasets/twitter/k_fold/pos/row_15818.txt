Update post cus u/Lemons_Wiiu asked for it, yup i got ghosted, blocked on everything, fuck this hurts, and what makes it worse is that normally when this shit happens im fine cus i didnt care that much but she made me happy, like really happy for the first time in a long fuckin time so now that normal sadness that i constantly feel feels so much worse
