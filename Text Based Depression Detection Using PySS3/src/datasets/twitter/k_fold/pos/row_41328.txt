what important truth do very few people agree with you on ? I was reading this book called ' Zero to one ' by Peter Theil , some of you might have already read it. He wrote he ask this questions from everyone before hiring people.

The answer should have two things it should be true and rare , for example The truth is X but everyone believes in Y.

He gave example of wrong answers as the following:

\#1 There is no god (no one can give theoretical proves for gods existence or inexistence)

\#2 The education system has many flaws it needs to be changes (true but so many people agree on this)

&amp;#x200B;

correct answer are as follows:

\#1 Madness is rare in individuals ,but as the larger amount of people gather together it's a rule. for example parties ,nations.

\#2 Everyone thinks socialism will help the humanity but the truth is privatisation will help us more.
