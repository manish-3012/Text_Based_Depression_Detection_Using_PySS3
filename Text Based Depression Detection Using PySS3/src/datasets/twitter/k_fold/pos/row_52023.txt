Does anyone else act gay with their friends? Like Iâ€™m not gay, but with my friends I am, idk how to explain it. like my best friend is gay, and I usually act 'gay' with him, so he feels more confident in our friend group, but yh. Like even my girlfriend told me is a 'nice' thing I'm doing. I don't know.  

I believe, It's just because we all know that we're straight so there's no risk of something getting a little hot for the room.
