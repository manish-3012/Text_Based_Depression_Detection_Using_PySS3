So... i have a scenario for you guys... You just woke up, but wait. This isn't your bed! In fact, you suddenly have no memory of who "you" is. But just as you start to gain your bearings, you hear a familiar voice. "Last night was crazy bro, let's do it again" Its him. It's shrek. You look over to see him but blocking your view is none other than Danny Devito. Before you can say anything at all, you hear someone else speak. "WAH" Says the voice behind you. Somehow, without turning around, you know exactly who it is. Waluigi himself. You turn around again, back at Shrek and Danny. They wear the same expression waluigi does. They expect you to say something. What do you say?
