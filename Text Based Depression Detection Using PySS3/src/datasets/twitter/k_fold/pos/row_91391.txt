Boys, I couldnâ€™t do it I was planning on asking out my crush tonight but I couldnâ€™t do it, and I donâ€™t think I will ever be able to. 

She once said to me, that there were no guys my age that are like me, this made me think I had a chance. But then tonight happened, it may not seem like a big deal to you or anybody who reads this, but it is to me, I just need to vent

She came over to my house tonight and we were hanging out, my brother was there just being himself blasting mayhem/Rollins band, and we were all cooking sâ€™mores, when the topic of relationships come up somehow, I donâ€™t remember why. 

Well she is bi, and she has a girlfriend now, but I was holding out hope. Then she throws a bottle at the wall as a joke, and they make jokes that Iâ€™m a SIMP (personally Iâ€™m over all the jokes, I just have basic manners) and that Iâ€™ll take the blame, I tell them screw you, clearly jokingly, and she said â€œIâ€™d bet youâ€™d want toâ€ Still in a joking fashion, but then she says to me â€œno seriously donâ€™t touch meâ€ in the most serious tone she could have at the moment.

My brother then goes in for a hug on her, just to spite me, and she fully embraced the hug and my brother... they both laugh at me and start running away. I went inside got a water, shed 2 total tears, and stopped crying. 

For context on why Iâ€™m mad and sad at the same time, my brother is a POS, and calls his current girlfriend, a â€œh*eâ€ and â€œa piece of meat to him.â€ In front of her. And I donâ€™t understand why girls all flock to him... heâ€™s an awful person but heâ€™s the most physically attractive guy in my family. 

Tl;dr: my crush thinks Iâ€™m physically repulsive and
