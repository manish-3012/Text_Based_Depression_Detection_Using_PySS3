Incoming college freshmen, how do you feel knowing we're most likely doing our first year of college online? I'm pretty upset to be honest. I was looking forward to the last year of hs and first year of college but covid really had to fuck that up.

Wus homeschooled for the most part but got back to regular school during junior year so yup, senior year would have been memorable.

How yall coping?
