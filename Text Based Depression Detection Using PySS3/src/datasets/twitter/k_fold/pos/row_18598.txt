for the first time since May, i feel alone again June was one of the best months of my life. Met new people, forged *amazing* friendships, and finally, finally got to open up to *someone.* Hell, they encouraged me to finally start going to therapy.

Then October happened. I happened. (Rather it was the result of a buildup of several of my actions over the previous few months, but the night prior was the last straw)

There's so little fun in youtube videos or video games anymore without my friends

I feel ignored and unwanted

I constantly feel sick and worried

I feel like my friends dont care about me anymore (and these were some pretty damn close friends) but i dont blame them because they have all the reason to not care or to cut me off

do i wish ****** had kept the problem(s) between us? yeah, i do. i think *** does too. the fallout was a mixture of both of our followup actions. but i have formed so many new regrets since then.

i just want to say "im sorry" to everyone in the group but the notorious fear of rejection steps in and says "what if they dont want to hear it? what if theyre Really Done with you? theyve seen who you really are. theyve made their choices."

i swear ive changed. i know i have. but i dont have the guts to show anyone

i wonder who of them would notice first if i disappeared
