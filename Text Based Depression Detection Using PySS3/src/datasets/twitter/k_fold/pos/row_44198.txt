Okay girls spill the beans. So basically Iâ€™ve gone to this all boys school for like five years (secondary school in uk) and I really donâ€™t know how to talk to girls. In school I imagine conversations usually spark from talking about school but thatâ€™s not an option for me. There are other schools around that girls attend, but I have no clue how to start conversations on the bus and I think it would feel really awkward. Also I havenâ€™t properly talked to a girl in like five years so that doesnâ€™t help my nerves. Any advice for me?
