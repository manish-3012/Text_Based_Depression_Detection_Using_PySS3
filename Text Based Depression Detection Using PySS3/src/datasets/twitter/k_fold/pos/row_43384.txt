Is it too late to be angry at my "friend" about this So a couple weeks ago I was on the phone to my friend and my little 6 year old sister wanted to talk to him because she hadn't seen him in ages, he spoke to her and when I took my phone back he said "might have to fuck that when she's older, lmao nah I'm joking" in my head I was like wtf but i have anxiety issues so i just kind of laughed but that shit was so fucking weird and it pisses me off that I couldn't be pissed off, I'm kind of scared to bring it up because I hate confrontation but that was weird as hell
