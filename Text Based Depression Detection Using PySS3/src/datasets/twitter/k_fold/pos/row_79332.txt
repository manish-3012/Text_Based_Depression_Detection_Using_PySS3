Ya know when you're talking to someone... And it's going great then all the sudden they're pushing to date when in reality you don't actually know if you want to date them officially or anything yet and they're taking things a little too fast so you set boundaries and explain that things need to slow down a little. Then, things kinda go downhill and suddenly they're talking to someone else who is a few years older with no warning? Because daaaang that's interesting.  Any similar experiences?
