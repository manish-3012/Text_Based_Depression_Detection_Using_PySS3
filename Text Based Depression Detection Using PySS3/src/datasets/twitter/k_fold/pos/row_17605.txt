iâ€™ve been told driving in real life is easier then driving in games i donâ€™t buy it. driving in games is really easy, and most people seem to be way worse at it then me

i play a lot of american truck simulator. driving in that game is basically follow the rules of the road, and donâ€™t crash. driving irl must be more complicated than thatâ€¦ right
