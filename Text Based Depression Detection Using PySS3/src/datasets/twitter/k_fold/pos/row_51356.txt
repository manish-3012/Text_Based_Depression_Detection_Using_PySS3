Dawg its crazy So I talk to this girl and she's great. My beat friend and honestly just amazing. But I'm not dating her, nor do I think im going to because of

1 she's not dating right now

2 she doesn't want to date friends

3 we've established that we're close friends

So whats wack is how we interact because sometimes I can't deny that we are either dating or flirting/she just likes me. Or just if we were seen by someone who doesn't know us it could be immideatly assumed we were in a relationship

I don't think im missing just crazy to be that im this close to someone just not... in something at all.

Thanks for reading i guess.
