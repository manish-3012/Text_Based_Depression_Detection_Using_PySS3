Day 3 of me moving on. Lol I shortened the title, it was too long to read. Anyway, it's been day 3. I started distracting myself by playing games such as minecraft, call of duty, and other games. The person I mentioned yesterday was a nice person, like a lot. She's the first friend I've ever made here on reddit as well. Nothing much happened this day but tomorrow I will be attending a church seminar. Things are getting a bit better for me, I feel more comfortable as time goes by, especially right now that I met my new friend. I can say that I'm already healing, but not too fast. I will take my time.

I'll be back tomorrow.

Ciao.
