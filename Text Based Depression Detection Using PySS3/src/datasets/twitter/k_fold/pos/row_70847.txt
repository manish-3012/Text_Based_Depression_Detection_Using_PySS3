Looking for girls to talk to I want to clear some stuff up, as short as i can:


1. I want to invite new friends to my small discord group (idk if this is forbidden in this sub, i apologize if that is the case)


2. We are around 5 people there only (2 introverted, including me), but we talk about serious stuff too. Basically, a small corner for girls who can't talk to their friends for some stuff, whether embarrassing or not.


3. Don't reply to this post, please. DM me if you are interested.


4. If this post breaks any rules, i am sorry. Feel free to take this down. Have a great day.
