Hi I'm annoying and you shouldn't read this post Hello, strangers. This is me complaining about something that I should really just deal with (and likely will very soon), considering it's very likely a problem that comes entirely from my own self doubt.


So. Onto the actual problem.



I consider myself an artist. Not because I make great art, just because I do make art, and I'm trying to treat myself how I treat other people. I would consider a person that makes art to be an artist, but in my opinion I don't count. But people have gotten annoyed with me for being so harsh on myself, so...


I am an artist. I do a variety of things, and while they're all rather mediocre, I enjoy them and I tend to share them with people. One of those people happens to be my SO (significant other, in case you're not aware c:). With other parties, such as my friends who also are artists, I usually at least get a short sentence about it, which I enjoy. I especially like when someone gives constructive criticism. I strive to be better with what I do, so really I appreciate anything. The problem is when I show my SO my art, he usually doesn't say much about it, usually a single "Cool." or whatever. Sometimes they don't even acknowledge it. Now, I realize the problem isn't with him. It's really with me. When I don't get any feedback I automatically assume someone doesn't care at all. Like I would rather have someone hate what I do than have them be neutral. At least hatred is an opinion. So I assume they don't like it. And then i get really upset even though I realize it's dumb.



And that's it, really. I should probably just uh... Go back to therapy and force myself to talk about my problems instead of tucking them away to later purge on reddit lol.


Feel free to make fun of me. 


Have a good day. 



TL;DR: Title.
