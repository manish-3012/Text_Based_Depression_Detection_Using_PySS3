There are two kinds of people: There are the good ones, they know that they can't out-pizza The Hut and respect it. And then there's the bad ones, they can't stop themselves, they've always got an urge to try and out-pizza The Hut in some way, shape, or form.

But that's the thing about people, we all have a little bit of both, some only have a little of bit the bad kept in the back of their minds, some go outright ballistic and think they can out-pizza every hut they see. We can't control it, nor can we change it, but one things is for sure...

You can't rape people. Like what the fuck? Who the hell does that? Who in their right mind just looks at a person and says to themselves, "I'm gonna have sex with them against their will" Like fuck that man, don't rape people
