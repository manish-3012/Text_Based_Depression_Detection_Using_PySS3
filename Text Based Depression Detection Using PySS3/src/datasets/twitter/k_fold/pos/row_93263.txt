TV shows set in space don't deserve their stigma I wasn't interested in anything set in space until I finally played Mass Effect at the recommendation of a friend. That led me to shows like Babylon 5, Farscape, Firefly, and Battlestar Galactica. I have across people who watch Game of Thrones but are downright dismissive of this genre.

Space sci fi doesn't deserve it's stigma. What if instead of another reality show we dared to dream about humanity's future and space again?
