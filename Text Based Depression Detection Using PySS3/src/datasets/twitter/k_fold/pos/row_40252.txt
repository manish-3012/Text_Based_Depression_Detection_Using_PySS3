I cant tell if this girl likes me but I'm probably tripping So when online school started this girl messaged me because she needed some help on an assignment, after I helped her she asked me for my phone number, we exchanged numbers and Instagrams, and ever since then she has been constantly texting me, starting of the conversation. Today I liked one of her messages on Insta, and then she started sending them to me, and even sending pink ones. I dont want to seem rude and maybe I am just over reacting because I just got out of a relationship last year. Can anyone help me understand if I'm just overreacting?
