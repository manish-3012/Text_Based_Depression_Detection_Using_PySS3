My sister got scammed. Hi. Iâ€™m 14, younger than most here. My sister is 16, sheâ€™s an amazing person. So me, her and my mom drive to meet up with my aunt and cousin. Me and my cousin chill in the car while my aunt, mom and sister go inside to get her sweet 16 dress. They also got a crown from the business. Idk if I should say the name or not. So we get home and she takes out the crown to show us. The second she took it out *pop, a jewel came out. She touched it one time other than when she first got it and today, that day nothing happened. Today she takes it out, puts it on her head, and two of the gems popped out. This crown was apparently $100, and the adhesive they used sucked. Sheâ€™s freaking out because of it. They most likely got scammed.
