Iâ€™m an artist who makes stickers and I need ideas Iâ€™ve been spending a ton of time on Inktober lately but want to keep making sales bc this is how Iâ€™m saving for college, anyone have any ideas of stickers that they want/would buy if they had money/would buy if they were into stickers

I also sell notebooks, pin buttons, backpacks, clothing, tote bags, masks, phone, ipad and tablet cases, and stuff like that, if that helps or is important
