Please help! I spent a lot of my parent's money on a game. Should I confess? I know I will get a lot of negative responses on this post calling me a jerk, etc. but they are welcome. I did smth terrible and I should face it. But it is not that simple.

I am 14 years old and I am devoted to a certain game. Now this is gonna all sound like a terrible excuse but it isn't or probably is, I don't know. I am confused. Anyways, the thing is that I wanted to focus on my studies but I will always get distracted by the game. The main factor is it's progression system. U will always be on a 'quest' to max level everything. I thought just spending money to get maxed will help me *not* get distracted by it. And I spent a lot of money on it. And... didn't tell my parents about that. I live in India and 99% parents don't allow their children to spend money on games.  We also don't live in a very good condition so I knew they were gonna refuse. Long story short, a spent around 120 dollars on it which is a huge amount in INR. But I deleted all tracks of the transaction. My father isn't a technical guy at all so he didn't found out. But I knew he was gonna soon. And that happened today. In short, he went to the atm and after the transaction found out that little money was left after the withdrawl. Story short, he is streesed rn. And I know he is gonna find out. But I don't want *him* to. I think I should till him myself. Perhaps he is gonna punish me, perhaps he won't. Does that matter? I am terribly confused. What should I do? I don't care about pusnishment, i care about our trust, which will break terribly either way. What should I do? Pls help me. 


P.S.- I don't think the game I play offer refunding purchases but I will check anyway ('I am not a technical guy either').
