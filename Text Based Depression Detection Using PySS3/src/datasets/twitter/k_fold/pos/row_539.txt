How do I stop feeling stupid I always feel stupid around people, except my friends.
Every time I'm with my dad and he tries talking to me I always answer stupidly like I'm nervous and it's not what I even wanted to say or I do something without thinking, I feel like I'm being judged the whole time. I accidentally make the wrong decision for myself and when I'm asked why I did it I have no idea how to answer because I know I'll look stupid.

I feel as if on the outside I come off as this serious and well thought out person but then I open my mouth in public and ruin my whole "image". This feeling makes me want to crawl into a hole and never come out but after a while I get over it and stop thinking about what to say. This makes me think that the reason I'm a quiet person is because I know I shouldn't open my mouth otherwise I'll regret it later.
