My dad treats me like Iâ€™m a resource For some backstory (not necessarily a backstory but whatever) Iâ€™m using an alt account. My original account, u/in-till accidentally got deleted so Iâ€™m left with this. But anyways, we are moving to a different house and my dad asks me to pull down the flap on the back of his truck so that all the shit on the back doesnâ€™t fly off. I go out there to do and heâ€™s just being an absolute dick. While pulling it down I cut my hand on a nail coming out from a board stick up from the bed of the truck and Iâ€™m bleeding pretty badly. I retract my hand and he fucking yells at me saying â€œI didnâ€™t tell you to stop!â€ While obviously being able to see my hand bleeding. I just canâ€™t take him seriously anymore. Itâ€™s like anytime he asks me if I could do a favor for him I have to force it out of me to say yes. All he does is just treat me like shit for just saying something the wrong way. Thank you for letting me discuss this with you all.
