letting off steam All of my energy and feelings disappeared within 5 minutes like I was putting up a facade. Just sitting here like an empty shell without a purpose.

Honestly I can't tell how I'm supposed to feel or what I'm supposed to be doing. My mind just races through unpleasant thoughts and ideas that I don't even want in my head. I can't tell if I want to cry or go to sleep and never wake up.

I made a new friend and now I'm scared I'll ruin the friendship. I know I'll mess something up, I say something or do something wrong. Then he'll hate me. Things will go wrong, I know it. 

I like I'm walking on clouds and everything sounds like it's underwater. And when I get up I'm just dizzy and I can't even focus on anything. Now I'm stressing myself out over something that's probably not going to happen.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
