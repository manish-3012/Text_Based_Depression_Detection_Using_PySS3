how can i make lyrics to my songs better? here are some of the lyrics i wrote about a song about halloween (not released yet or recorded, personally i think they are good lyrics): if u need help understanding some parts lmk

**Chorus**:

Once as a festival

AKA Samahin

Put on the new threads

In their costumes they trick or treating

Kids cramming in that candy 

Feeling electrified

Reporters roll for fiascos

They presume we should be careful for an incoming genocide

Recall the cliches:

Phantoms, ghosts and ghouls

Niggas held for, ransom like they fools

Festive gatherings, sugar rush, and more

Wonâ€™t go out this month

Weâ€™re enforced to be indoors

**Verse 1:**

This the one time where we can give praise to the dead

Thats what it once was

Letâ€™s neglect the bloodshed

Celtic once believed the slain would return to the surface 

You niggas clowns, uh

Thatâ€™s why you done glued to the circus

Letâ€™s keep this on point

Ensure your clear of the eerie 

Damn right we mischievous

We confirm we don't get spotted

Yeah we the rascals 

Famous for city destruction

When lock on you must escape

Cause we need no introduction
