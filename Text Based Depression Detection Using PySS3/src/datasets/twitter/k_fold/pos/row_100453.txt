Anyone here with strict and snooping parents that can give me some advice? I'm wanting to get some adult toys and need to have a good place to hide them and also need somewhere to have them delivered. I've got the money to pay for a PO Box and I've got one near me that won't take a suspicious amount of extra time to drive to.

The thing I need help with is hiding them in my room. I don't have any room in my dresser and that's the only place I can put something in where it's closed.

Any ideas?
