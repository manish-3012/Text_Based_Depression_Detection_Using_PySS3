I'm really confused right now. Can someone please tell em what to do? So my friend's mom made her breakup with her boyfriend. And it's been rough for her these past two months. I've been helping her with it as best as I can and it's starting to work. But if course over these times I caught feelings. She's literally perfect. But her number 1 priority should be getting over her ex. And I've met her mom and she seems very reasonable so whatever reason she made her do it should be backed up. And I've told her that her mom has done this stuff before and she probably sees something doesn't because she just wants to see the good in him. But I've been helping her and I'm starting to see improvement. But like the idiot I am I decided to tell her how I actually feel. And of course she said she is worried wheel get hurt like she did last time. And I said I completely understand, but she said maybe in the future something could happen. So we just put all that behind us. But I wrote down stuff continuously about how I feel about her. Not just relationship but being friends. And I concluded all of it with " and until you are ready I will be the best friend you could ever ask for" I know it sounds super cheesey but I genuinely mean it. Part of me wants to send this to her and part of me wants to just be patient sonic don't screw this up. I want to be completely honest with her but also don't wanna rush into things. Like phil collins said "you can't hurry love". I just don't know what to do here. Can someone help me out?
