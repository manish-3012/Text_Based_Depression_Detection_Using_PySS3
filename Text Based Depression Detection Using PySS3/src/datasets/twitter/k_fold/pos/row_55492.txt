Bruh I'm never getting help again. I haven't been depressed in like 2 months and I'm doing better than ever at school, but I still have to go to a psychologist because I cut myself early autumn. 
bruh. 

Well they did their job. I'm not getting depressed anymore because I'm afraid of it now. Too hard to explain why. Mostly because I get distressed going there.
