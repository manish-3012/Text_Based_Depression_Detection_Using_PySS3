I understand why old people are cranky and mad all the time. Just imagine living up to 70 or something. All of us would be cranky too. Like most of us are like 15 or something and already hate life. Imagine how we will be when we 50. If someone doesn't kill me by 50 doing it myself.

End to my weird thought.
