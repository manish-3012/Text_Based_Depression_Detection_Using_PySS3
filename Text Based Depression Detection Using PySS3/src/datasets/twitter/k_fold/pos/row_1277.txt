Should we postpone until next year? My friend and I started our activist org this summer. We want to make it a club at school, but since everything is over Zoom and it'll be a new club I feel that people won't be as interested. I'm also a sophomore and have heard that starting as a junior is better. Should we just do it now? Next year?
