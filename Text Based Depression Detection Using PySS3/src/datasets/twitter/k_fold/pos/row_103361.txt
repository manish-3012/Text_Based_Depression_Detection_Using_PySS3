I made a really cool post, but the format butchered it. So, I spent a really long time make this cool post, but when it posted the format changed and it got ruined. [This is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ljj8us/reddit_be_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) You can't even tell what it says. 

But, I got Imgur and uploaded a screen recording of the pre-posting format, and it would mean a lot if you guys could check it out. [Here is the link.](https://imgur.com/gallery/CkpnUvl)

Thank you guys :)
