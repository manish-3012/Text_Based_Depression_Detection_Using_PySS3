Day 19 of telling my girlfriend I love her on Reddit Because I know she checks every day to see if Iâ€™ve posted anything. Iâ€™m so sorry I almost forgot
Iâ€™d been looking for a time slot where I could do it at school on my laptop and I almost did have time in English but we had to pack up, I was gonna do it at home but it had already left my mind
Iâ€™m so so so sorry darling
I love you so much &lt;3
