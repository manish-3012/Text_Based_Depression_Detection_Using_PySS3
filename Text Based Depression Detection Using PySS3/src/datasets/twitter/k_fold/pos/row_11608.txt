I want to run away from home but i can't So i really don't like living with my family, it's not that i really hate them but it's starting to get there.
So i should just explain my situation:
My dad left when i was 12, so my mom was alone with me and my brother (14 at the time)
It was fine for a while up until i left for my exchange in 2018,when i came back a year later everything went to sh*t.
My mom is never home, neither is my brother, and when they are home all they do is yell at me for stuff i didn't even do.
I always clean up after myself and my brother, plus i cook for him when he's home.
But when i leave one dirty cup on the table he thinks he can yell at me and my mom always chooses his side.
I've known for a long time that my mom favored my brother but it has become really obvious lately. On top of all that, my brother has a horrible girlfriend, for reference: she once threatened to kill me because i SUGGESTED to move a party so some people could make it. 

Anyway, i just can't take it anymore because today my mom threatened to send my dog away or even kill her.
And i want to run away but can't because i have to take my dog with me cause i dont want to leave her with my mother.
I also have no money, i soon start college and my mom pays the dorm rent.
I am also scared to leave my dog at home when I leave for college for reason previously mentioned.
