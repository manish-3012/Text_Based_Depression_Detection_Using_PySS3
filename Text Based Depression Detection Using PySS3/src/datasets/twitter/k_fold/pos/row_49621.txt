Tik Tok in my class So first thing first, I live in Asia, where everyone (almost) is an extremely influenced by TikTok. Well, apparently my teacher, which is the best teacher I've ever had, might be transferring school next year and we might never meet again. 

The thing is, she is a very unusual teacher. She treats us like her own kids. Other teachers gives us homework and stressful stuff, yet she let us sleep, and even let us do PE!

So it is sad that we're gonna lose this teacher, so just afternoon she told us a plan:

***As a memory, I would like you guys to create a TikTok video as a remembrance. You guys can dance in the video and use famous song, like BTS.***

Lol guys I love my teacher, I want to follow and create a video, but heck I don't even know how to dance. Can someone teach me anything from TikTok? Because I knew nothing about singing and dancing XD
