Wtf is wrong with teachers My friend was told, by a teacher, yesterday that because her hair was dyed an "unnatural" colour, it was distracting others. As a result, she has about 3 days to dye her hair back, or she'll be excluded from school as punishment. 

Her hair was dyed blonde. Keep in mind that there are also girls in our year that have their hair dyed blonde, who got told jack shit. 

And the worst part is that there are literally people in the same year with their hair dyed green and pink. And they were told absolutely nothing. One of them was even talking to the same teacher earlier that day!

What complete bullshit.
