what is the point of life?. life feels grey and pointless, if you think about it, there is no point of living, we all grow up and die, why should i make decision if im going to die in the first place, does heaven even exist, or is it just a myth, im really done with this "everyone has a purpose in there life", life feels bland, nothing.  
so tell me what is the point of life?.
