Iâ€™m tired of my sister and her friend Itâ€™s summer and quarantine so much family is home all the time and weâ€™re at my moms and itâ€™s the first day of my week with my mom and I already want to die first itâ€™s small things like not covering you ramen when you microwave it then itâ€™s spraying my face with axe and killing my eyes for 5 minutes then itâ€™s lifting our cats up and down quickly and when I tell them to stop because they can get sick itâ€™s no they canâ€™t and the keep doing it then itâ€™s throwing wet towels with ramen on them onto my chair and jumping up and down when I yell them to stop because there are people under us and blaring tik tok songs on the tv and then I call my mom and tell them whatâ€™s going on and itâ€™s ok Iâ€™ll call her and talk about it later and the constant yelling when they are only 6 feet away and then her friend is taking part in this but she keeps on hitting me and and I tell my mom and she does nothing I want to ask if I can go on opposite weeks then them so on the week they are at the house I go to the apartment and vice versa
