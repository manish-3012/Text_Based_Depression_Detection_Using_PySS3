I think I'd be okay with ending up alone I'm already "alone" in the sense that my group of friends is very small, and I have no current relationship going on rn. But its interesting, I'm so happy.

That's not exactly the interesting part. When I was younger, maybe 11-14 I was so terrified of being alone. I made friends with people who wern't great for me, got into relationships with people I had no business dating. Basically doing everything I could to avoid ending up alone, cause that was the worst thing in my mind. 

But, now I feel so free. I'm happy, I'm content, I love going places on my own, I take myself out for dinner dates, I go on adventures on my own, and I love it. I love me!

I love my small group of friends, and the people around me. But when I imagine my future now, I no longer see this ideal of having a husband/wife and kids. I just see...happiness, wherever that is. I just figure life will sort itself out, and if I'm destined to grow old and alone, I'll find happiness in that.

I wasn't afraid of being alone, I was afraid of being unwanted. But now I want me, and thats all that matters.
