Kinda karma whoring but I really am excited and need to share this. I just got my hands on a lawnmower, I painted the fence and my dad gave it to me. Now, this is now ordinary lawnmower, it is a giant ass 140cc lawnmower I plan to transplant onto a bike and make a motorcycle.

What do you guys think?
