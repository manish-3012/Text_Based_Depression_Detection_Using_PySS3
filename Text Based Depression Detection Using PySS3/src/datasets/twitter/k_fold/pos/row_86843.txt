I can't live like this anymore. I (MtF 17) have been feeling awful today, (reasons in comments if you lovely folks would like to hear); dysphoria and all, my stepmom has been an absolute peach *wink wink sarcasm wink*. I haven't even been able to get out of bedroom to eat or get water. I get up at about 5pm so I can get coffee, (woke up at about 3:30 am) and my stepmom blows up as she was right outside my door, I had thought the parents were at work, so I was dressed up in girl clothes, I'm walking out wearing a huge trans pride hoodie , black skirt, black knee highs, and some LGBT pride fingerless gloves... Big mistake... She went AWOL, absolutely nuts.... All I did and wanted to do was slam the door and change into more boyish clothes so I could hopefully shorten her wailing session. This, unfortunately did not work. She "kindly" told me how it was "wrong and dirty" for me, and that is never be a woman. Along with any other slurs she could possibly have in her thick skull. Oh boy was I livid, but all I could do was to let her go nuts and get my coffee. Things die down after a while and later, I get some food, first and only meal of the day, she surely has to be okay with me getting food... Right? Wrong. Turns out she had bought 90% of the stuff in the fridge for "her diet", when in reality she lets it sit and sit, but if you grab a single crumb, she claims that she was going to eat it that second. I was eating Chinese takeout. Welp she complains about me being antisocial and not eating... Can ya blame me?
