Fellow gamer is happy!! Fellow gamers, I finally got my first girlfriend and  Iâ€™m finding it hard to open up to her that I like planning minecraft and watching anime because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll loose her :(

Well gamers, fast forward 7 months, she now loves watching me play mine raft and gaming with the boys. She loves watching anime with me and she also really gets along with the boys.
Gamers I think sheâ€™s a keeper!!
