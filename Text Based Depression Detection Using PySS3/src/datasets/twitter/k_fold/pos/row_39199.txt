My birthday's coming up and I want some advice on video games from the experts, please. So, my birthday near the start of April is coming up, and I think I'd like a new game for our Nintendo Switch. Here's a list of the ones we already have on it, and the ones I don't like/ don't wanna play as much are being crossed off (also please don't try to convince me some of them are great, I've played them all for a while) :

Among Us

~~Animal Crossing~~ 

~~Mario Kart 8 deluxe~~

Super Mario bros. U deluxe

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity

Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild â¤

Minecraft ofc ðŸ’–

Are there any games you would suggest that are either similar to any of those not crossed off, or that you just really love? My dad was really into the original Halo as a kid, is any version of that/ shooting games, in general, any good?

I appreciate any feedback!
