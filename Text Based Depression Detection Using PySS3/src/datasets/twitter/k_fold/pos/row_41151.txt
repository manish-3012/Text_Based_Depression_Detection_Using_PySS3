How should I tell my parents that I started dating someone? So I just confessed to my crush yesterday and now weâ€™re dating. I want to tell my parents about it but Iâ€™m a bit nervous about what theyâ€™ll think. My mom never really discussed anything related to dating with me so I literally have no idea what sheâ€™ll think. Meanwhile my dad constantly teases me and my brothers about it whenever we even mention a girl, so I feel like he wouldnâ€™t mind as much but I still feel like heâ€™ll be annoying about it, he even said that I should go to a restaurant alone with my girlfriend (I mentioned her before but they think weâ€™re just friends) at some point during spring break. Feel free to question me in the comments if you feel like having more info will help. 


TL;DR- I want to tell my parents about my girlfriend but idk how I should
