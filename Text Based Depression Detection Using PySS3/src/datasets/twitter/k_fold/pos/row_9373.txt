Whatâ€™s your high school like now compared to before the coronavirus? School doesnâ€™t start yet and Iâ€™m wondering what itâ€™s going to be like, Iâ€™m curious even if itâ€™s some simple things.

Example: 
At my school theyâ€™re having two lunch periodâ€™s now instead of one. 

Thereâ€™s a shit ton of hand sanitizers everywhere.

No more water fountains.
