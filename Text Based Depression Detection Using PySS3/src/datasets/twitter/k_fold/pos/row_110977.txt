I feel like some of you might need to see this. It gets better A response to a tenth grade suicide note:Â 

Luisa,Â 

Thank you for pulling through. Thank you for not giving up. I know how hard it was. I remember how hard it was. Itâ€™s still hard. And itâ€™s getting better. Thank you, for giving me this chance to try and get better. I wish I could go back in time and give you a hug, tell you itâ€™s ok, that weâ€™re getting through the worst of it. I have so much empathy and compassion for you. I wish that was there when you wrote this. You are not a bad person. You were never a bad person. No one is better off without you. You make people's lives better by sticking around. I donâ€™t talk to Maya and Mattan anymore, and thatâ€™s ok. I know when you wrote this you thought that you needed them in your life to survive, and that survival drained them so drastically that the only solution was your death. It wasnâ€™t. Itâ€™s not. You didnâ€™t need them. Iâ€™m doing so much better without them in my life. That relationship was toxic in so many ways. Iâ€™m so proud of you for moving through that, for moving past it. I know how hard it was. I remember the tears, the pills, the self harm. And you still made it through. We made it through. You deserve life. You can get better. I got better because you took a chance on me. In a time when you saw no future, you still let me have mine.Â 

I love you,

And we can get through this,Â 

Luisa
