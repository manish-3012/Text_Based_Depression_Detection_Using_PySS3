I'm not sure if I'm crushing constantly or if I like people. So I've noticed a pattern, whenever I start texting a girl regularly, I develop a liking to them.

Now this isn't me switching every week, but it's consistent (every few months), and I need to know if this is just me being a teenage boy or if I actually like them?
