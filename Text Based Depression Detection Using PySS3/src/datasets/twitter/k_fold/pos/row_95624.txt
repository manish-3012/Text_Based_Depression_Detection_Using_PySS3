I'm happy being Single. I'm used to this already haha. I am content with what God gave me (I thank god for this). I will just work my way up slowly but surely. I don't need a girlfriend for now because I think I'm not ready or unworthy for a relationship. I'll just focus on myself first. Finish my education, Achieve my dream/goal, get a nice job, maybe even get a house.   


Now, I know that my future Girlfriend/Wife (never had a girlfriend before if you are askin) is somewhere out there. Alive. and hopefully well and safe. So every night i pray that she is safe and sound (whoever she is, God knows). I hope right now and in the future that she is fine and she will achieve her goals and dreams. One day I'll meet her. Who knows when?   


  
Have a nice day/night to you all. God Bless.
