My genius friend is conducting an â€œexperimentâ€ So Iâ€™m gonna get this out there: thereâ€™s this girl like in my school, and weâ€™ve been walking there and back frequently now, so a lot of people are thinking weâ€™re a couple. And whatâ€™s worse, they they think I gave her a hickey. I WOULDNâ€™T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO THAT! My genius friend, on the other hand, knows whatâ€™s up. Apparently Iâ€™m not very subtle. He says that heâ€™s been conducting experiments where he has two people pretend theyâ€™re a couple, and see the results at the end. Apparently, the result is usually a friendly relationship. So, not a friend zone, but friend with a sway towards the romantic side. And, I gotta be honest, I donâ€™t mind that. The main thing here is that I have no sexual experience. Like I said, donâ€™t even know how to do a hickey. Never kissed anyone, never held hands, Iâ€™m a bit sad, honestly. So if this works out and my friend gets the result he expects, itâ€™ll be fucking amazing. He says weâ€™ll try it in December because:

1: No Nut November
2: He thinks itâ€™s romantic, lol.

Anyway, Iâ€™ll keep posting in new posts in the subreddit. Letâ€™s see how this goes.
