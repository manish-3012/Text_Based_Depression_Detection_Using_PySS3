Using Quantum Mechanics to prove that your crush likes you Quantum Superposition states that due to the dual particle and wave nature of everything, an object can exist in many wavelengths at the same time, to simplify this, let us take an unknown object and put it in a box. Until we observe said object, we do not know what the object is.

&amp;#x200B;

 Let us say that the unknown object can be an Apple and/or an Orange. We will never know whether or not the unknown object is an Apple or an Orange until we observe it. Therefore the object is both an Apple and an Orange. It will only become one or the other once we observe it.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this information we can apply it to a multitude of other things and aspects of life. Let us use your crush as an example. Based on what we have learned, your crush both likes and dislikes you at the same time. We will only know for certain which one is true once we observe it (ask her out). Therefore until you ask your crush out she both likes and dislikes you at the same time. it is only once you ask her out (observe) that we will know for certain, which one is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are afraid of your crush not liking you, do not ask her out, because if you do not ask her out she will continue to like and dislike you forever.

To sum this all up, ignorance is bliss, take the blue pill.  My name is /u/sboulah and thank you for giving me the time to talk to you today about fundamental issues in our society.
