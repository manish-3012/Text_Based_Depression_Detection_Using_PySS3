Am i the only one that wants to have a dream about a certain thing when trying to sleep but never gets it? But when I sleep without thinking about it i get the dream i want. Thats why i remind my self every night to not think about the things i want to dream. But most of the time I fuck up and think about it and never dream about anything.
