Does anyone know anything about art history? I need help with an assignment Thank you in advance if you can help me!

I have to write three questions regarding the Parthenon. Questions based not on factual knowledge, but questions which you need to think about to answer.

A good question would be: 

The Parthenon is seen as the most important achievement in ancient architecture, as it was built when the political system was, for the first time, democratic. What do you think of democracy? Is it important in our daily lives? Why? Why not?

A bad question would be:

What material was used to build the Parthenon? When was the Parthenon built?

Thanks in advance if you can help me... I really have no idea. The example I gave is mine, so I need two questions more only.
