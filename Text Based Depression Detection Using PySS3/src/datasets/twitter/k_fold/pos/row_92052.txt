(Guitar players) I never knew I never knew I could solo the pentatonic scale on the 4th of the original pentatonic like in key signature. 

Idk how to explain 
I figured out I could improve solo for a key of D major song on the pentatonic of G. Interesting and this would have been nice to know like a year ago.
