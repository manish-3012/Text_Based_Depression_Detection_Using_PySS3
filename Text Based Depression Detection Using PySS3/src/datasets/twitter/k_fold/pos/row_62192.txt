Little rant So my parents are divorced,  (they are still friends tho). And my mom thinks I get to use my phone to much at my dads, and thinks that I only want to go to his house. But one of the main reasons I like my dads house is my mom gets angry over to many little things.   Like I had a soccer game a couple days ago, and it was my third game that day, and after, the first thing she did was get angry, and say that I was acting to lazy etc. and thatâ€™s sheâ€™s not paying for me to walk around on the field.  But during the other to games when my dad was there, he was just saying stuff like good job etc.   also a couple weeks ago she yelled at me for cutting sausages wrong,  cause I was holding the fork the wrong way.    Oof

Thanks for coming to my ted talk
