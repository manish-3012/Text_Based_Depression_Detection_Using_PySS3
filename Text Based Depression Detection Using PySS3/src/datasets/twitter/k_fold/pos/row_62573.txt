How do you make lasting online friends? I've never had lasting online friendships. I don't know if it's the games I'm playing or the lack of people wanting to have a lasting friendship or something else. I often see posts or stories about a group of 5 who played together for years. I don't really know how though. Sometimes I want to play games with the same people (like The Forest for example), but I don't know how to get to it.
