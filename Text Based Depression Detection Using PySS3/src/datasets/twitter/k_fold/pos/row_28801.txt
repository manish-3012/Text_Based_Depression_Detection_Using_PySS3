Would I be considered homophobic Hello fellow redditors, this will be my first time posting here. I have a very serious question. Would I be considered homophobic? I am 13 years old and am a conservative Christian. I believe that Homosexuality is wrong, and I do not support gay pride. However, I have no room to judge them, for I believe we have all fallen short of God's glory and will be punished. The reason I am asking this is because I feel unaccepted in modern society for this. I am not sorry for these beliefs. I am asking this because I genuinely want to know what you guys think of me, because I know many of you on here are gay or bi or what ever the accepted vernacular is, and I want to know what you guys think. Thank you for listening.
