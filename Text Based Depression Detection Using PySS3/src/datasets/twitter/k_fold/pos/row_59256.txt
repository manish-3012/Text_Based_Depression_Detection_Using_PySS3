Ok is it weird that I am newly 16 and have a proper beard and moustache ? Most of the people I know don't even have a single facial hair and I feel way older than my age and people treat me like adult and I experience a lot of weird stuff due to this ,I tried shaving but I look totally ugly without them ... Make me feel normal please
