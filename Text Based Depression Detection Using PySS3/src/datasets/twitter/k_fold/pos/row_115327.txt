false friends So im 14, and i am having exam week. Last week we had maths, and one of my friend got help worth 40m(total score is 80). The scoring was 32(gforms)+48(written) and in gforms he got 32 marks worth help and in written he got 8. Despite this, he scored 54/80. And we have exams in school in march. So i started telling him how casually he was taking EVERY exam and he should start studying. He started a fight. It was in discord server so everyone joined. He wouldve FAILED if we didnt have helped him. He started accusing me as a Flatterer, and 2 other started calling me the same. A girl is saying I hurt HIM but I dont know what to do. I blocked him because inspite of helping and grooming him he doesnt study at all. He doesnt care about the future. I was trying to make him understand but still he doesnt. Am i the bad guy here?
