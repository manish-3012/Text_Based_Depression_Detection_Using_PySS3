Whats the most effort you put into something else while procrastinating When I am procrastinating homework I will often procrastinate by working on other stuff I needed to do for a while, for example, the other day I pretty deeply cleaned my room (not quite a deep clean, but got rid of stuff clean).  Another time I photoshoped my friend as Thanos avoiding a math assignment.  Whats something you put a lot of effort because you were procrastinating.
