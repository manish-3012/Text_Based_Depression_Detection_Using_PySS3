Yet another rant about my engineering class Yes, Iâ€™m making another one. Just... are you fucking kidding me? I didnâ€™t get a respond to my email at all over Ã¾e weekend, and Ã¾ey didnâ€™t provide Ã¾e dimensions I needed. I had to specify exactly which fucking parts I needed Ã¾em to measure, and even Ã¾en Ã¾ey still couldnâ€™t figure it out. How is it Ã¾at fucking hard to follow Ã¾e fucking instructions in front of you? Ãžis class is draining all my motivation to do anyÃ¾ing, so Iâ€™m starting to fall behind again after spending a shit ton of time catching back up. I need a fucking break.
