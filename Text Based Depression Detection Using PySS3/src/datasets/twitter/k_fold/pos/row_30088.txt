I FUCKED UP Ok so college life just started and I for one have to stop taking things for granted. What happened is one of my closest friends' college already started while I am waiting for mine to start. She is having a lot of assignments lately so has not been able to talk due to time constraints, heck she can't even give time to her family properly. I just behaved like an asshole and could not really fathom the amount the pressure she is going through or the amount of work she has to complete before deadline. So I started blaming her like she was lying to me and ignoring me. We used talk A LOT but she is not even getting time to talk her own twin brother, let alone talk to me. It's been nearly 5 days and I kept behaving like a weirdo ("creep" as quoted by her) until I understood the depth of the situation today, when she broke up while saying how can I accuse her of ignoring and lying to me while not understanding her situation even if she considers me her closest friend. I told her sorry but got too apologetic (like I said sorry 10 times in one conversation) and again started behaving like a weirdo. I really fucked up and today was the climax ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ˜ž. I also got into few arguments, considering she has been mad on me for 5 days, the arguments might have been worse for her than I imagine. I don't want to lose a friend. Anyone's views r welcome. 

Thank you for reading this loooong post.
