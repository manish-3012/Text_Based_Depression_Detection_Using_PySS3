Posting something I'm grateful for every day until Thanksgiving: Day 1 I'm grateful for school. As surprising as that may sound, school has done a few good things for me (we're just gonna look past all the stress anxiety for now). If it weren't for school, I'd have missed out on what are now my favorite hobbies. In 6th grade, we had to choose an instrument to learn, and I chose french horn. I've come to really enjoy playing music now and I'm glad I had to make that decision. I also would not have gotten into woodworking had it not been for shop class. On top of that, I never would've met a lot of my friends if I didn't go to school. Plus, I've grown to develop a love for problem solving and engineering from having to do it so much. Being bored out of mind and having to deal with a boatload of work have also helped me to enjoy gaming a lot more :)

tl;dr while school as brought me a lot of stress, I am grateful for a lot of the smaller things it has done for me.
