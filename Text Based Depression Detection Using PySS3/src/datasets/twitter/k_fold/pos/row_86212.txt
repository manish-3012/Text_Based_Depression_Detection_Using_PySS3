A kid who used to bully me in 7th grade now skateboards in front of my house He used to live in a different town, so I thought once I became homeschooled I would never have to see him again. I guess he moved here recently? He has no idea where I live. 

I started skateboarding in July 2020. I often skate outside of my house or in the basketball court at the park. I knew this guy played video games but I didnâ€™t know he skated. 

I often sit on the couch by my window so I see people when theyâ€™re outside. My mom tells me that she sees some kids skateboarding outside and I should talk to them. Yesterday I saw this one kid skateboarding on the street in front of my house. He looked familiar, and I realized it was that guy who used to bully me three years ago. I saw him skating outside my house today as well. 

Fantastic. :(
