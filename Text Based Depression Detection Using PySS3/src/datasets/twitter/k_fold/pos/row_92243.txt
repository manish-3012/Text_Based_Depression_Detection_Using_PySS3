Random dude thought I was a girl and sent me â€œpicsâ€ Um, so I donâ€™t know what I posted that made him think Iâ€™m a girl. I never really said or included my gender in any of my posts (except this one, obviously). Anyways, I received like 6 â€œpicsâ€ of him doing some very weird stuff, like immediate R rating.

Anyways, I responded to him by saying, â€œBruh, Iâ€™m a dude.â€ 

He said, â€œItâ€™s still fine, bro.â€ 

...

Trust me, this isnâ€™t a joke.
