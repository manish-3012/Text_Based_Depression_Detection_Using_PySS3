I hate my country and I think you will too after reading this. 
In this country if your a girl you just shouldnâ€™t exist because most of the men here are uneducated fucks who just look at girls like a tool of reproduction girls get scared to walk alone at night even if itâ€™s like 10 pm, if your a guy no one gives a fuck what you do if your a girl thatâ€™s a whole different story. 

(Okay so I it might get a little dark here forgive me for that but I want all of you to know how big of a shithole my country is) here there are hundred of thousands of unsolved rape cases. The women here are frightened to report the cases because it will DESTROY their and their family reputation everyone says that girls should dress properly if you donâ€™t wanna get raped wanna wear jeans? FUCK OFF wanna wear shorts? FUCK OFF wanna wear anything that shows a bit more skin than usual FUCK OFF. Here so many little girls even younger than 8 months get raped and what does the government do? NOTHING. Oh a guy just raped a 10 month old girl and you want justice? Well good luck because heâ€™s the son of minister and he slaps some money on the corrupt cops and itâ€™s just like nothing happened. 

The cops here are so corrupt if anything of yours gets stolen well good luck getting it back. My neighbours silver brick got stolen that was passed from generation to generation a few years back and he didnâ€™t get it back.

In this shithole of a country if you love someone but their not from the same race well, good luck getting married you get to either choose your reputation or the love of your life.

And oh boy donâ€™t even get me started on the education system here. The teachers here will beat you as they wish. Couldnâ€™t comeplete your notes because you were absent? Here take a iron ruler to the hand. Borrowing notes because you got beaten? Here take a iron ruler to the hand because the teacher thinks youâ€™re talking. Explaining to the teacher you werenâ€™t talking but taking notes? The teachers wouldnâ€™t give a fuck. tired of all this bullshit and want to stand up? Good luck getting justice. And this is true as well I got suspended for 3 days because I spoke loudly to the principal because I was tired of this shit. Few years back in 7 grade a boy smashed another boys head in to the window and thay guy was bleeding all over and had to be sent to the hospital. What punishment did he get? A week of suspension because his dad threw some cash on the principals face (I donâ€™t know if his dad actually did this I just think he did because his dad is rich) and the poor boy had a stitches.

And everyoneâ€™s parent are sick (luckily I have really good parents) if your a girl your parents will make you a doctor if your a boy your a engineer. You donâ€™t have a choice 

Just ate something? Throw the wrapper and leftovers on the ground anywhere you wish no one will say anything to you and even if someone does say something he will be made fun off

Guess which shithole of a country it is. Itâ€™s India 

People say that theyâ€™re proud to be an Indian even though stuff like this happens here and I can say proud Iâ€™m NOT proud to be Indian
