Iâ€™ll always be thankful that my parents are chill as fuck. They talked to me about masturbation when I was younger, and said it was normal and natural and all that.

They didnâ€™t ban me from dating 

They got me a door that locks 

They respect my privacy 

They donâ€™t check my phone or computer 

They donâ€™t snoop around my room.
