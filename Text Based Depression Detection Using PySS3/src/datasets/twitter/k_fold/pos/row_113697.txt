Sooooo I'm in a bit of a pickle So.... I (14M) recently moved overseas from Australia but dont speak the language, so I wanted to speak to a certain friend from there who happens to be female, and she was saying that she couldn't talk that day, so I asked if we could do tommorow and she says it's nice that I want to talk to her so much, and I say I need to talk to some friends who speak English, and that she and 2 others were my best friends from my previous school, and she replied that 'you're so sweet'... Anyway we say a few more things and that's it... Now I don't know if she 'likes' me or even if I 'like' her (I legitimately could I dont know....) and even if I do if the relationship would work since we're sort of half way across the earth from each other. What do I do? Help. 

Also please don't make this blow up she has Reddit and it's likely she'll figure out who this is if she sees this...
