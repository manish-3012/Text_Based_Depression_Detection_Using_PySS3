I am no good at drawing and have a mission for any who are. So, I had an idea yesterday for a mini comic, but was thwarted by the fact that I can't draw. Any of you who are, I have a mission for you, should you choose to accept it. So, it starts off with me (a chunky boi w/ glasses) standing out in the yard picking up sticks. In the next panel, I bend over and the back of my shirt blows up (include asscrack if u want). In the last panel, I stand up, pull my shirt down, and, blushing, say "what are you doing step-wind?" I get if it's too shitty a idea to draw, but if you do, please DM me with the results, then you can post it yourself it you want.
