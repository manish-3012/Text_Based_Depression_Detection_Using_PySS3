I'm thinking about dropping out of school but I want another opinion Hey, I'm thinking about dropping out of school. I honestly just don't know how much longer I can handle this.

For context, I live in Australia so we've been back to IRL school for quite a while now. Schools here are pretty good. We're ranked 7th in the world for education standards. But everything just seems so hard

I study all day to get 90+% in most of my subjects. And it feels good to get those scores. But it just wears me out so fucking much.

I only like 2 of the 6 subjects I'm doing this year. Those being Mathematic Specialist and Software Development. Everything else is just filler to me.

I just feel like I have no time to myself. Not only that, but I have so much trouble getting up for school in the morning. I'm writing this from my bed because I couldn't be fucked getting up in the morning. And this just makes me feel so disappointed in myself.

It also doesn't help that I have Asperger's which means that most of the information from my subjects I don't like is just in one ear and out the other. I often find myself zoning out or falling asleep in subjects I don't enjoy. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm planning to move out of home and move in with some of my friends at the end of the year. But that will put me an hour away from my school by train. My parents also probably won't let me move out if I can't show them that I can get myself to school every day.

But that doesn't change the fact that it just burns me out. It always feels like I have some homework that isn't done, some task overdue, something always lingering that needs to be completed. I'm just not sure how much more of this I can take
