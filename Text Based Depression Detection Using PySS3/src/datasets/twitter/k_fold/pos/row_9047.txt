Types of passive-aggresive wishes to use on someone, going from most brutal, to most calm (that I know) Most brutal:





Â·I wish you step on a lego



Â·I wish you get a cold and explosive diarrhea while stuck in traffic





Â·I wish you get a type of puzzel with the last piece missing





Â·I hope all your socks aren't in pairs





Least brutal:



Â·TBH, I don't know any brutal ones. But i do know one thats atomic.



#THE ATOMIC WISH:#





Â·#I WISH YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE ADOPTED.#
