Summer fling... I mean I knew itâ€™d happen but ya boi still gonna be sad as shit when this ends So where I am itâ€™s summer, Iâ€™ve just graduated high school Iâ€™m in the middle of summer holidays and moving away to a different city for University in a month. Me and my ex had broken up back in November but things had been bad for a while and then at the beginning of this holidays I went on a tramp and met a girl we started talking and then hanging out and I just loved being around her we could talk for hours and never get bored and Iâ€™m always laughing around her all that cliche stuff only sheâ€™s also moving away at the end of the holidays.... we both know this and both know anything serious is a bad idea but ya know live in the moment and all that (no regrets) so we starting hooking up and I guess itâ€™s a summer fling. Only despite the fact I definitely knew this would happen Iâ€™m now falling hard... Iâ€™ll get over it eventually I know but damn just wanted to rant cause I can see the end date coming and this shit is gonna STING!!! I mean seriously she reminded me of how everything should be after things with my past girlfriend were so crappy for so long... she makes me smile so damn much, sheâ€™s drop dead gorgeous, we can just sit and watch dumb movies or go on a road trip and pull an all nighter looking at the stars and no matter what it feels amazing as long as Iâ€™m doing it with her. Oh and her music taste is cherry as fuck (totally irrelevant but similar music tastes real seals the deal on someone u like being the greatest).

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
