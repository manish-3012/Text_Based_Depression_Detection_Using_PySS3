My dad survived a window maker- his main artery was 99% clogged. The only reason he survived was because:

1) there was an AED in our gym(I think it's called a defibrillator)

2) many medical professionals were in the gym today so the ambulance was called immediately

3) the ambulance was patrolling less than a mile from the gym

4) the hospital he went to (Hillcrest) ran tests quickly to check his arteries and had the correct equipment to clear them safely

Honestly, it's a miracle that he survived. We would have been on the road driving on a highway a few hours after(we dont carry an AED in out cars). I'm shaken up by all this but I'm so happy he's alright!
