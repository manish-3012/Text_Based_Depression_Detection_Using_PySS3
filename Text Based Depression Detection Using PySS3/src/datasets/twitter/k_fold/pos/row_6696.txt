Saw some posts about people saying itâ€™s okay for guys to hit girls, and I think itâ€™s RIDICULOUS ...That some people donâ€™t agree with this. Obviously you can defend yourself. Just make sure that youâ€™re hitting someone like AS hard as they hit you, not harder, unless itâ€™s an actual fight or smth. If someone like playfully hits you (lightly), most people just laugh â€˜cause they know itâ€™s a joke, whether it was a boy or girl who hit them. A lot of guys hit harder than girls, though, so just make sure youâ€™re like not hitting too much harder. Iâ€™m a girl, I can say that yes obviously guys can hit girls in self defense or when theyâ€™re play fighting. Hitting someone hard out of the blue is an asshole move though, whether youâ€™re a guy or a gal. 

Anyways, yeah.
