Is there a problem with me? I just fount out the girl Iâ€™m talking to has a boyfriend... again... I just donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. Every time I start talking to a girl they imply that they like me, sometimes they even say it out loud, but in the end as it turns out that they do it as a friend.

Take the current one for example:

My friend went to uni to a diffenrent city. I joined his instagram live and her cousin was really nice, and we started talking directly to each other during the live. She even added me on Snapchat randomly, without me asking. Weâ€™ve been talking for about a month, and now... as I see her on her story kissing an other guy.

I just start to think that the problem is with me.

TL;DR: Girls I talk to always end up revealing that they have a boyfriend after enough time for me to start having feelings.
