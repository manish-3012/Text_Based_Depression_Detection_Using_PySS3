I figured someone might wanna hear this So, 2020 huh? Been quite the rollercoaster with all this poplitical drama, quarantine and whatnot. I saw a meme the other day talking on something about how "you never now, 2020 might be the nuclear apocalypse" I understand it's probably just for jokes and laughs

But you wanna know something that much, much more dangerous than any disaster that could ever hit earth? Giving up

I keep seeing people talk about how bad 2020 is, and don't get me wrong 2020 hasn't been the best. But i fear that someone, might just take the jokes seriously, or genuinely feel hopeless. I fear that someone might look at this darkness and feel completely helpless. 

But I want to assure every single one that reads this, be it a dozen or a thousand. Things will get better! No matter what happens, humans will always always always find a light to follow, and if we can't find a light, we'll just have to make our own.

A wise man once told me that fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering. I don't want a world ruled by fear.

So if theres one thing to take away from this, 

Be brave. We can get through this, no matter what. I promise.
