My friend just said that mine and another friends lives don't matter to him I've posted about this friend before because I was concerned about him being sociopathic, he had been saying stuff about being able to kill someone easily. People told me to brush it off as dark humor. Tonight, we were talking about depression and Ego, and he said that he has a massive ego and says that his life is worth more than everyone else.
I asked what people around him meant to him, and he said that they didn't matter. I then asked if me and another friend didn't matter to him, and he said "Well it's awkward when you put it that way". 
I'm very concerned that he's a sociopath, what should I feel/do?
