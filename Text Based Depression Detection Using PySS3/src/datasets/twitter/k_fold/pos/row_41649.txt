Yes I do listen to girl in red thank you very much But I donâ€™t like â€œI wanna be your girlfriendâ€ because I used it to flirt with my ex. 

Literally I put on that song, looked at her and we both just giggled until I said â€œI wouldnâ€™t mind if youâ€™d kiss meâ€ and she was like â€œokayâ€ and then WE KISSED. 

She wasnâ€™t very good at it, but it was the first kiss I actually liked.
