When a kid calla you an "elitist white male" because you told someone to frick off when they said that appologizing because they were offended by a joke wouldnt make me less of a man. Like so I was texting and I jokingly called people "b*stards" cause they put way too many texts and they said just dont say bitch so I said "then I'll call you all put@" (puta is spanish for bitch). So the conversation goes along ans way later the girl says I didn't respect her because of that, and I say wait what it was a joke. And then that goes on and it's basically them yelling at me cause its offensive and me confused why they couldnt have said this earlier, etc. Then the girl says that it wouldnt make me less of a man to appologize (which I was already doing basically) and I say frick off, that's just rude. And tge conversation goes on and we are both fine, but then afterwords one of her friends calls me an Elitist white male for that. Thats when I left.
