Update: Now he wants me out I am 16, I have no job, I cannot get one and now my dad wants me out of the house. How the hell am I going to survive out in the world? I am broke and there is nobody around me to help me out. What does he want me to do, join the homeless population in Portland? I would die. Any advice?
