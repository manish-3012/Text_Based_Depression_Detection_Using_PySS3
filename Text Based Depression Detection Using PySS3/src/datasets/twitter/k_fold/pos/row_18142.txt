What's everyone's opinion on the term Commieblock? I heard this term first from a Russian youtuber describing his apartment, which is one of the giant prefabricated apartment buildings made in communist countries during the Soviet era to house huge numbers of people. After doing some research, apparently there is no legitimate English word for these buildings, which is interesting, and there are a variety of words for them in former communist countries. 

What are everyone's thoughts?
