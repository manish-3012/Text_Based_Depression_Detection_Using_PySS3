Would anyone be down to join a teen manga reading club?  As the title says, I have started a manga reading club with other teenagers on Discord. We have around 15 active members and we're looking for new members to join us. Alongside manga, we also discuss manwhas, visual novels, anime, web novels, and light novels. If you are interested in joining or have any questions, let me know! (Only teenagers, 13-17)
