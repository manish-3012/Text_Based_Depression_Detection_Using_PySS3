C'mon guys, don't be such a dick Y'all probably know about all pedos on subreddits like r/selfie or some even even here, which came into light recently. Ik most of you peeps reading this post rn are chill and well-mannered BUT some aren't!

Do you literally want to grow up to live in the same society that you are in currently? World isn't safe for girls and this is all because of us. Basically there are peeps among us, who are creeps and pedos, now you say 'what is my fault for that?' Your fault is that you should report that person and encourage others to report. If you come across such post about someone complaining about an inappropriate user AND it seems legit, why don't you report for a quickly instead of browsing memes.

Secondly(controversial af) stop simping. Girls aren't big deal. Life should not be like you trying to do 'hey shitass wanna see me speedrun getting a girlfriend.' Also I'd like to bonk people who send inappropriate messages because you are very likely to come in one of those second paragraph category. Just stop simping for sake of god, get a life
