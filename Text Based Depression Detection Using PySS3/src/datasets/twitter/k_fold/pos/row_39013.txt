Reviving my NMD collection Hi guys,

I want to make my NMD shoes look good again and therefore, I need something that can get them really white again on the part where this kinda Styrofoam sort of thing is. 

I already have tried with the best cleaning things I have in my home. Yet still they look trash unfortunately. I watched yt videos and most of them show a pen which can colour them back, but friends &amp; yt comments told me they don't work properly enough....

Do you have sth for me? Would be very grateful for it. 
Just every single knowledge you could share with me is perfectly fine for me

TL;DR: need something to make my NMD shoes white again
