I need help finding a Minecraft video from my childhood I figured this sub or r/minecraft could help me. So Iâ€™m looking for a Minecraft video on YouTube I canâ€™t remember what it was called, but I know it has something to do with a bronze creeper in a tuxedo trying to find his lost cookie. The video was in a compilation with two other(at least from what I remember) videos a monster school video  I canâ€™t remember the second video. I need help.
