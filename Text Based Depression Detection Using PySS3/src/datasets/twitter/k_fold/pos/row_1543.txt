Friends are cringe TLDR my friends keep saying that I'm super skinny with small shoulders, even though I'm bigger 


I'm quite skinny, and I promise this is relevant, and I'm 191 cm tall, or 6"3' 

I used to be insecure about the broadness of my shoulders, because a few people said they were narrow and weren't broad at all, "I'd rather be my height than be that thin" or "I'm much wider than you are, I'm quite a wide person" we will call these people, person A and person B 

Person A is about 5"8' and person B is about 5"7 

So I'm taller than these 2 people, so they keep commenting on my shoulders and how skinny I look, and then I saw photos of me standing next to them

This is the only example, also, I look shorter than I am because of perspective but that doesn't matter. 


They keep saying they are wider than I am, so this post also doubles and seeing if it's just my mind playing tricks on me


Edit: I don't feel that bad about it, I just want to nip it in the bud
