Dad turns off WiFi during class Hello the few fellow redditors who will read this.

So since we have a Lockdown again until February my school wants us to do our work from home and take some classes via video/audio. So I finished my second ever video chat and started working on my exercises to finish them and have a relaxing evening for myself. Turns out that because I had been working for some hours my dad came home and complained that HIS stuff was in the way and I needed to put it in my room for storage.

I refused to take it in my room because it's too small already and more stuff in here would lock me either in or out, so worked on my exercises again ignoring his rants about me. Since I used Google drive I couldn't save my documents about 30 seconds later.

He is still refusing to turn the WiFi on again so I could do my work and upload it before its deadline, so I used my mobile data for it and saved what I could. I already have contacted my teachers a while ago because that had happened in the first Lockdown as well but their only response was to try and upload my stuff as soon as possible.


TLDR: Was working online because of Lockdown, dad came home and complained, I refused to take his stuff in my room for storage, he turned off the wifi as reaction and refuses to turn it on again so I can do my school work.
