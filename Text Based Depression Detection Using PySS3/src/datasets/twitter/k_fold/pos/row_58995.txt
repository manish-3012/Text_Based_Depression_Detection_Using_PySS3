Advice about boys from a boy 1-Donâ€™t do that thing where you ask out a boy and then tell him it was a dare, it genuinely crushes us.
2-Donâ€™t be scared to approach us, the chances of you getting rejected is really low, also we suck at taking hints.
3-Do talk to us, about how youâ€™re feeling, if in a relationship, then talk to us like you would to your friends.
4-set your standards low, trust me, if I were you I would go for a guy that likes you for what you are, donâ€™t go for the popular boys just cos they make you popular, go for guys that you can see yourself with.
