The philosophy of XD I come from Poland, where we have the philosophy of XD. The basis of the philosophy, is that whenever shit happens, you just think XD and move on.

Lost your keys? XD
GF dumped you? XD
getting mugged? XD

I myself apply the philosophy of XD to my life, and ever since Iâ€™ve started, my life is ever so stressful

On another note, Iâ€™ve got my mock GCSEs tomorrow, should probably sleep but hey XD
