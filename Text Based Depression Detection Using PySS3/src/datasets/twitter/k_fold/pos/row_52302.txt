I just had a friend-fall out for the second time ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ Basically, my friend, we gone call her Beatrice didn't wanna accept the truth about her "relationship" (they were never dating, according to her stories and her "BOYFRIEND") and just told us we were horrible friends because we wouldn't tell her what she wanted to hear.



The first time, I actually dropped my friends. I made a post abt a while back, where I'd yeeted them to the curb bc I was tired of feeling like I came in 20th place. The problem wasn't really them and I didn't solve the crap I wished to solve by doing it. 



Anyways, thanks for reading and I think she made me so angry I think I'm gonna be running around tryna get all this energy out
