Uncle told me I donâ€™t have OCD (Iâ€™m genuinely diagnosed) because Iâ€™m not a neat tidy person. What a fuckin joke. Sick of this bullshit where people think itâ€™s cute to say they have ocd because they clean and act like a prick about it. You ever walk in the living room and find me flipping the light switch 12 times and starting all over again because I did it wrong? Thatâ€™s ocd. Itâ€™s not your fucking cute personality trait.
