Stop complaining about minecraft snapshots geez Like seriously! If you play survival on a Minecraft snapshot, you have no right to complain about the glitches and missing features. I see this so often itâ€™s absurd! Do you not realize that itâ€™s an *unfinished* update?? Seriously. Thereâ€™s posts on r/Minecraft about people with full diamond tools and probably hours spent playing but they still go â€œduhhh whereâ€™s the Warden?â€
