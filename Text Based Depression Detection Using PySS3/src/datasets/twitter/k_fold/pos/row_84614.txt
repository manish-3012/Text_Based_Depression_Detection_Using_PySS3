I am happy for my life No, I wasn't depressed with suicidal thoughts, neither my crush said YES

I am just satisfied with my life

Why? Because I try to push myself through things that make me get out of my confort zone. This quarentine I lost 9 pounds(?) Or 4,5kg . I also started drawing for real, I used to draw but didn't study anatomy. I take cold showers. I take care of my skin (which is full of pimples) . I don't eat desert as many times as before. I am improving my skills on SSBU.

So my secret to be happy is , I want to become a better person. By that I don't mean "I NEED to bevome a better person" so watch out for anxiety attacks









And also I am happy maybe because I totally ignored all online classes and didn't do any homework
