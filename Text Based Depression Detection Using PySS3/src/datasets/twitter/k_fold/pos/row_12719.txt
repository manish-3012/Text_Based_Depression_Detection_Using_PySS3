I'm scared of becoming an adult I'm gonna soon turn 16 and I'm getting closer and closer to adulthood, but the thing is, with everything going on in the world right now (systemic racism, police violence, Donald Trump, global rise of antisemitism, rise of facism, the terrible way leaders dealt with covid,etc), adulthood is scaring me away. I don't even know precisely what I want to do, idk how I'm gonna live, pay taxes, pay for rent and food and college and I used to think teenage years were a b*tch but now I'd wish I had more time away from this mess... Even more while being an autistic person in a still adapting society. Am I the only person this scared of growing up?
