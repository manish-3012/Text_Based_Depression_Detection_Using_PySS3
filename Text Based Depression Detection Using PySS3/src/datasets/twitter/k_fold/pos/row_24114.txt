My girlfriend has been cheating on me... This is going to sound so clichÃ© but here's what happened

We were supposed to meet at the park and we hanged around for an hour, talked and talked, and then we decided to go to her place as her parents were out to visit some relatives..

We were just watching Netflix ( stranger things S2 )
. She went the the bathroom and I saw her phone buzz , now I normally don't look at other people's phones but I gave it just a glare and all I could see were heart emojis and stuff like that

I figured it was her family or something and decided to let her go , but deep down inside me , I knew something was up..

So after trying not to peek a look , I opened the text without the passcode so I could look at the opening words and my heart fucking sank like it never did before

" Last night was fun â¤ï¸â¤ï¸ðŸ˜˜ðŸ¥° "

I just ran away and here I am on my bed half crying and im pretty sure she doesn't know that I saw the message , I don't know what to do....
