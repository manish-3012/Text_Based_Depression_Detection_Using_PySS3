I have no idea what I wanna do next. I am preparing for engineering but I don't wanna freaking do engineering. I wanna make movies. I chose engineering because at the time it was either this or medicine. I just couldn't accept the idea of me being a doctor. So I was like okay then, a couple years of math shouldn't be that hard. And boy was I wrong. But there was nothing really else to choose from. But now that school's about to be over and I have to enter the competition, this shit's getting real fast. I just wanna watch stuff and write stuff all day but there's no way my parent's gonna let me do that. I don't wanna end up like my sister or my cousins. I don't wanna be stuck. My parents are traditional middle class minded people. They are never gonna comply with this shit. I have no idea what I should do.
