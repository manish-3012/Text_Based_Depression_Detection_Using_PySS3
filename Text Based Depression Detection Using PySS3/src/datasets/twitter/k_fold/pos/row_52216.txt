I think she likes me I have a friend who found out my crush. The weekends went by of my panicking on what is gonna happen when she knows if she finds out and what happened just confused me. The rest of the class is playing a game and me, my crush and her two friends are just chilling playing darts and one of her friends randomly asks me this â€œSo what do you think of (my crush)â€ and I just respond with â€œwhy?â€ and she just replies with â€œjust becauseâ€ so I respond with another why and shrug it off. Later I hear them talking some â€œsecretâ€ that they have which confused me even more and even more later the same one of her friends says â€œwe have something to tell youâ€ and my brain started to go fight or flight and I bolted for it to the field. School ends we go home and I type this and we are gonna go on camp so Iâ€™ll probably make another post in a few days.
