Finally got a new gaming PC! Hey guys I just wanted to share that Iâ€™m so happy I just got a new gaming PC! Itâ€™s a Mac and it runs Minecraft at 24 fps (Just like the movies!) and Roblox at 9 fps (or maybe thatâ€™s my age when I played it I forget). If anyone wants to add me dm for my username. Anyways just thought Iâ€™d let you know. 

Also the model number if you were wondering is Powerbook G4, because it has lots of power.
