I really love my class My old class was better but i really love my new class. Its never boring to go to school anymore and the craziest shit just happend. So me and some friends went in to class first and well one of them accidentaly kicked the shoe stand. Where we put our shoes in and it literally fell to two pieces and we had to fix. It under 5 minutes so the teacher didnt notice. We managed to do it and well no one else noticed it so we where fine.
