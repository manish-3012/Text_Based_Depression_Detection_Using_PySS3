One of the most satisfying things is seeing a genuine feminist Itâ€™s so nice to see a feminist who believes everyone is equal but doesnâ€™t think all men are racists and bad. I mean I know there are lots of good feminist but all the ones you see in the front pages of social media seem to be saying that all men are nasty rapists who only think about sex. It just annoys me so much when you see the bad feminists that think women are superior like the people on r/thefairersex . I just want to say if you are a person who believes in gender equality (which is most people I think) you are a good person.
