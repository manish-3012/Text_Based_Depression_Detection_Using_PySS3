Confession Time So I have been open about the way I treated my ex for a while now &amp; it's something I'm not proud of. After I got over the breakup I decided to get my act together &amp; deal with the toxicity issues I have that cost me multiple friendships &amp; relationships &amp; that is what I spent most of 2020 doing leading to where we are now &amp; I'm very happy &amp; proud of the progress I've made in course correcting my behaviour. What makes me upset right now is the fact I told my ex I'd leave her alone as I feel it would be best for the both of us, rightfully so I thought, &amp; shortly after I recieved messages that I had been spreading rumours which were untrue which made my current moral dilemma worse. I want to give her a full proper apology &amp; not the half assed ones I gave her last spring when I wasn't in a clear mindset. I told her I'd leave her alone &amp; I still want to stick to my word.
The last year or so has helped me clear my head which was what I needed the most to help me started in this as I could finally approach everything without my prior bias/view on it. This meant I could see through my delusional lies, most of them revolving around how the relationship's failure wasn't my fault, I believed them to the point where I told others &amp; unfortunately they're are people out there who believe it was a 2 way toxic relationship when in actual reality you didn't do anything that would be regarded as toxic &amp; for that I'm sorry.

Em it's me Morgan &amp; if by some chance you're reading this I hope you're okay &amp; not stressed by everything happening right now, it's a stressful time we're in. You brought a lot of joy into my life for what little time we spent together even if my actions didn't show it. I remember all of it from meeting you in a french lesson back in 2016 with us both being 13 &amp; enjoying each others goofyness to the art lessons where we just used to casually talk, how about that steampunk day we went too? Where I didn't dress the part at all. I just hope that I was able to bring some semblance of joy &amp; happiness in your life like you did me &amp; thank you cause right now you're my biggest inspiration as I continue to right my wrongs but not just for you but for everyone else my toxicity affected.
If it is by some miraculous chance you're reading this &amp; want to know what I'm doing/ where I'm at the answer isn't much, but I have received an offer from my one of my chosen universities &amp; another one is willing to offer me a place if I can confirm my grades, I might finally get that fresh start I need away from this town.

I'm not looking for advice, I just need to get this off my chest.
Behaviour correction is probably the hardest thing I've done in my life but its absolutely worth it if it stops me from making the same mistakes.
