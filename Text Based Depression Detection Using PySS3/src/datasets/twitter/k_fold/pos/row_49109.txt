I just realized something about Clone High The 5 main characters were murdered...

Cleopatra was historically said to have committed suicide but thereâ€™s evidence that was just a cover up. Some background characters like Marie Antoinette, Caesar, and MLK were also murdered but most characters at clone high werenâ€™t, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a coincidence
