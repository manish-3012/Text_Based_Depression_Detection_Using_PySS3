Trying to get into gaming as a girl requires you to be anonymous. More often than not, I get flamed, trolled,  spammed with sexual messages. The internet culture encourages less respect to women and it's disgusting. I know this is becoming more well known but I had to rant after being greifed or flamed the 11th game of LoL for gender.
