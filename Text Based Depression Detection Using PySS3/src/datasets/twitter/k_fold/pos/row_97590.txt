A poem a day until I get my SAT scores back - day 6 Screaming, the truculent students drown out obsequious professor.

The wild brawl continues, fortune favoring the aggressor.

Fighting to fulfill their comment credit, all aboard the Battle Bus.

Intoxicated by the promise of points, none remembers to discuss.

Instead Socrates would be insulted by the infamy of his name.

Those that feel shame, will have their grades burn in flames.
