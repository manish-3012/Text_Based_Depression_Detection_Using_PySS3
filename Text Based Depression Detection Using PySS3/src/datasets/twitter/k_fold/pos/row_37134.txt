How hard is it for professors and teachers to just....reduce the workload for us? We're fucking tired of this shit. It was kind of easy to handle for the first few months but now it's unbelievably hard to keep going. Everytime we ask the profs for an extension they reply with "But why, the previous batches didn't have a problem with it. Stop complaining." It's such harder because social interaction would help us cope with work stress but we don't have that fucking option anymore. Jeez they never listen to us. There are so many unnecessary assignment that they could cancel but they won't fucking do that. They have the AUDACITY to say that "oh but don't you have extra time to do work because you're at home?" Do they think we're machines? Imagine grown adults saying this kind of shit. There's no fucking motivation left you pieces of shit. Atleast try to motivate us if you aren't going to get rid of a few assignments. They just have to try to make us feel guilty for even asking them to be more considerate. I feel bad for the class of 2021 because y'all have to prepare for entrance tests during this shitty time. It's just so challenging. I really wish it wasn't like this. All the best jeez *hug* I can't imagine how y'all are keeping up.
