Something that Parks n' Rec taught me 1st off, parks n rec is a great show go watch it

2nd.

Assholes are always louder than the sane people. You see anti vaxxers, COVID deniers and karens everywhere on the news and reddit, but just remember that they are in the *very* small minority.

People are getting vaccinated, people are wearing masks. Try to remember this :). 

3rdly, go watch parks n rec.
