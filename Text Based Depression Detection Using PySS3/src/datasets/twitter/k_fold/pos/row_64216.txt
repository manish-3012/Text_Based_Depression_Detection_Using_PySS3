Well, my computer stopped working, and someone I least expected helped fix it. My computer stopped working, so I asked my brother (the tech guy in the family) for help. I tried all the things he told me to do, and none of them worked. Then, my dad asked if he could help. I didnt really think he new much about technology until he fixed the pc. I and my brother were kinda suprised.
