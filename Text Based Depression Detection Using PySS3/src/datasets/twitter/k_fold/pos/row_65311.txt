someone I knew killed herself a few days ago and she was 12 ok so this girl, I sorta knew her. she was nice and shit. I was texting my class chat last night, and they kept talking alt this tragedy, I had no idea, so one of the kids told me what happened. she was 12. it was like out of the blue, no one had any idea that this was coming. im 12 too, but this changed me. I prayed on my knees last night. I am sorta religious, but ive NEVER prayed. I cried for hours, and almost threw up. anyone who has gone through something like this, can I talk to u, and, if you are considering suicide, please dont. Bless your soul if u r.
