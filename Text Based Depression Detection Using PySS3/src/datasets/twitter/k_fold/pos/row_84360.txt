I want to make games in unity (c# scripting) and my school has a Java class, Python class, and the AP Comp Sci principles (those are the classes I have the right prereqs for) which should I do? Like which ones will benefit my overall skills with c# scripting? (Im also going to take an intro to unity after school camp)
