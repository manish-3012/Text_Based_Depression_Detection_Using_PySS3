I need help So in 6th grade I had a girlfriend, she was literally the reason why I went to school. She has since broken up with me and got all of her friends to text me telling me that Iâ€™m â€œugly, and not good enoughâ€ I have since been really sad and depressed. I need advice on how to get a companion, Iâ€™m missing what she gave me cus she made me feel worth something and not just a single person in the billions of people in the world. Itâ€™s been hard to meet anyone cus if online school and Iâ€™m starting to think that my ugly ass self wont find anyone.
