I hate being a man. I'm tired of female privileges, like them being able to hurt and abuse a man and get away with it without any consequences whatsoever, and we men can't do shit because apparently defending yourself against a woman makes you a douchebag. but Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold. "Mars theme starts playing"
