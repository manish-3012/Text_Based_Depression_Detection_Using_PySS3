Can y'all stop please? Look, this is r/teenagers where everyone is a teenager. So we have people talking about their crushes, depression, anxiety and being rejected. Telling people to stop posting about confessing to their crushes and how they feel is just rude. I know there are people doing it to karmawhore but all those post becone a burden for the people that actually want to share their feelings. Just stop


I am the one that asked them to share their feelings, if someone says I dont see who asked under those posts
