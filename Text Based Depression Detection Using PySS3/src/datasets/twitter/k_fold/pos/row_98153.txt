this last couple weeks has been pretty shitty girlfriend of over a year broke up w me a couple days ago. lost the only person i could talk to about anything. i literally based my whole life around her so now that shes gone i dont know what to do with my life. i got wayy too much free time which sucks ass because its just more time to think about her n cry. 

also today i fucking broke my toilet causing my bathroom to flood and water to pour out of the lights in my kitchen somehow. mightve also costed my family a fuck ton in damage if this water starts rotting the ceiling

unironically wanna fuckingdie
