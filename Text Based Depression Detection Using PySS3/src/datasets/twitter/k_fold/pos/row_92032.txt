You know what I donâ€™t understand about some gaming communities? When you ask a question or post a clip or something you did that you thought was cool and you get downvoted. Like weâ€™re all in the same sub for the same reason. Fuck this karma is really getting to my head, Iâ€™ve been on reddit too long. Wait have I been using karma for dopamine? Crap. I donâ€™t even know what the point of this post was anymore. Sorry for wasting your time
