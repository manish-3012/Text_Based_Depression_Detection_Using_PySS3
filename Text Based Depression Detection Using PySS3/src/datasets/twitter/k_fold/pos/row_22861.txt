I really miss my old friends. I used to have some old friends that I spent about 5 years with. we used to play together, eat together, and have just had amazing times together. we used to do a lot of activities and we were all so close. I even remember getting GTA 5 on its release date and finishing it together. about 5 years later, I and my family had to move from the apartment and we started to eventually split. I was like 4 streets away from them but the problem is, almost all of them travelled from the whole country itself. these were really good old days and I really want to go back to them.
