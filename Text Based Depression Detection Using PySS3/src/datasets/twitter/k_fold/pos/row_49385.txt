Advice for a nonbinary who's on their period. (13, they/he) I really fucking hate my period.
For one, it makes me feel like a girl.
And it hurts.
Blood triggers me. (self-harm); and I'm trying to stay clean!
I feel hungrier on my period, but I don't want to eat. Because if I eat, I'll eat too much, and then I'll have to chuck it back up again. 

(TW FOR EDS âš ï¸Today, I just ate a jacket potato, and two chicken thighs (I don't really like eating meat, but I was in the zone of 'food, eat it, now!'). I was eating with my Mum, and she said she was going to go tap out some money.
I was like okay- this gives me a chance to get that food out of me.
I went and chucked up in the toliet, I never-ever do this when my Mums home, so I was kinda happy that she left. I missed the toliet. I knew I wouldn't be able to clean it, and I didn't have the time. I called her and said 'Mum, I've just been sick.' 'was you playing guiatr?' 'yeah, and then I went and jumped around to that song, you know, Planetary Go?' * I then started singing it*   (my mum:) 'yeah, a don't jump around after eating'.
She fell for it.
I feel bad for lying to her.)

And also on my period, it smells like blood. The pad is uncomfy. And I hate it.
I jus hate fucking everything. 

My tummy hurts so bad. But I don't want to take any painkillers for it.



Uhhhhh.

I probably have 5 more days of this. 

Fuck this.
I'm gonna go get a coffee.
Any tips for how to stop feeling dysphoric on my period? 


On the bright side... I guess the pad kinda looks like a penis? 
So I don't have to pack with socks.
I can't anyway, I can't pack on my period because I can't wear two pairs of boxers (sensory issues). 

I wanna get up, go for walks (not now, too late, but tommorow), but I just want to cry.
Fuck, I think I'm broken.
