How to deal with being self-conscious Hey fellow teens, this is not probably worth your time but I just need to vent. I don't mind if you skip over this but anyway

Ever since I went into secondary school I have just been feeling like shit and that was almost 4 years ago. I hear the same insults back and forth and for me, it does not get easier,  mainly due to my friends, they insult me, berate me, make fun of me and I feel powerless, they all team up and i feel excluded. They all came out as gay recently and I couldn't of been more proud of them but they make fun of me still. They exclude me from birthday parties, meetups, going out to the town and group chats. they have group chats all about hating me which i always think is a joke but at the back of my mind, I really don't know. They say the same shit to me. It's always:

* You're small
* You're weak
* You look gross
* You are poor
* You are a 'straggot' (whatever tf that means)
* You're a terrorist (I'm brown and Muslim faith)
* Your voice is so high pitched
* You have no facial hair
* You will never find love
* \[Make fun of my last name (Butt). its not even fair, it just handed to them, its pronounced and spelt literally 'Butt'  i hear the same shit they don't have to be creative\]
* You are ugly
* You're so skinny
* Eat something bones
* Remember that time u/Tubiey did \[insert embarrassing or cringy thing from past\]
* You are stinky
* Your teeth are so gross 

I feel like shit, i hate the person i see in the mirror so much. I actively try not to look at mirris cause i hate what i am. I hate my teeth, I hate my braces i hate my glasses i hate my skin colour i hate my faith i hate my height i hate my voice i hate my face i hate my eyes i hate last name.  

I used to be so idgaf-y and I am an extrovert i like starting a conversation with new people to try to make new friends but now when i meet new people i fear they will see all the flaws in me i see. and the reason i feel so much shittier is its somewhat bearable if you are the only one who thinks your shit but to know your closest friends think the same just breaks me.  granted i have not been the best friend either, for the first 2 years i would deny what they say and just insult back but theses last 2 almost im giving up. I just agree with their insults I've made sure to just stop insulting them as it made it worse and its just so fucked.

This is my second main friend group. My first one excluded me berated me and all that jazz but then when they would all go out to do fun shit. they would spam me picture of them having fun. i feel i have no fucking power against them at all i feel like I'm horrible. and even now outside of school i hang out with some of my online friends but a new guy who recently joined that every one likes insults all my skill all my shit so much racist shit i hear every day. I hate taking photos just because when i see my self i just see a list of flaws.
