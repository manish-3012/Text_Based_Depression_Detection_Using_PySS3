Posting something daily day 31 My girlfriend is ghosting me so I have decided to do something that I have done for many years prior. I shall be botting up all my emotions and shoving that shit down to the deepest parts of my soul. You cant get hurt if I dont get out there right. No matter how hard I try No One in my family understands. I barely get sleep and therapy doesnt work any more. I am exhausted all the time. No meds help. No I am not karma whoring.  Ill be back tomorrow
