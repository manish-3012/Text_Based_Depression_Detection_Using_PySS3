2020 May have been a sucky year for everyone but hereâ€™s my top 5 highlights of it. 1. I got my first girlfriend in August and weâ€™re still together now. 

2. I got my dog a few days after that, and sheâ€™s super hyper and I love her so much.

3. I got my first kiss in December.

4. I finally got my first pieces of music artist merchandise.

5. I got my first butterfly knife trainer so I can learn a new skill through this year.

Also Happy New Years every one! Hopefully 2021 is gonna be better and make up for last year.
