UNPOPULAR OPINION: Fall Guys is better than Among Us ( Í¡áµ” ÍœÊ– Í¡áµ”) The modes in Fall guys are so fun, hugging each other, pushing each other to our deaths, the competition in it and the skins! 
 
Among us is good too, but I feel like it's repetitive. Bad guy(s) vs Good guys, seen the story a lot, I just ain't doing it again and again

Fall guys just gives more flexibility and also the sound effects and soundtrack is awesome

Thank You for listening to my Ted Talk :D
