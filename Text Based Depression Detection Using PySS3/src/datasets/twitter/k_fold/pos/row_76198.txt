You wanna know what sucks? I cant go to spirit Halloween. My ex-stepdad works there, and hes not allowed around my family. Long story short, he was abusive. Social services got involved.

So now Idk what I'm doing for this Halloween. I would ask my stepsister for his schedule so I can go there when he isnt, but shes forgetful.

Yaaaaaay
