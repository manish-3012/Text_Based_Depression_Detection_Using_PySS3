The reason people are always saying â€œmen canâ€™t control themselvesâ€ or â€œall you think about is sexâ€ is because of the sex culture Like Iâ€™m a teen and itâ€™s too much, the music especially new rappers like Megan, cardi b just rap about pussy. Iâ€™ve never seen a song that has pussy in every single verse until around recently . Obviously dudes rap about sex but nowhere near on this level, if you dedicate entire songs to rapping about dick and pussy you are weird, Iâ€™ve never seen a guy dedicated his whole song so dick and shake his half naked body throughout a music video .This music and sex culture are ruining the youth, they are influencing boys, especially teens to masturbate to these women, then the worst part is the little girls that see this, they think â€œthis is fame, this is successâ€ and they go on their version of being famous, TikTok Instagram and shake their ass. Keep in mind a lot of them are underage and on TikTok, itâ€™s getting ridiculous, itâ€™s too many little kids twerking and wearing revealing clothes. This culture especially the music would be considered pornography back in the 80s but sex has become way too normalized.
