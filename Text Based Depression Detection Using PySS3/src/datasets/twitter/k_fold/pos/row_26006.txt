Introducing the COVID-19 Bot (Version 1.1)! Hello fellow teenagers!

I am here to present you with the COVID-19 bot. Problems with current coronavirus trackers include you having to go out of your way to look at the data and long troves of information. This tracker simply shows you the **most important data** within your Twitter feed. While browsing, this bot will show you the information in just a few short seconds, and you can move on and continue looking at what Trump did this time.

The messages are tweeted automatically at 3PM GMT. I am working on an update which is going to be *barney voice* LEGEN- wait for it- DARY!

If you like this, *please* share it with your friends and family. I cannot tell you how much just one follower means.
