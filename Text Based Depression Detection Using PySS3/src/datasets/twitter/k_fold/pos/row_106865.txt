Kinda having an issue with my parents and I need help I've lost all trust in them.

So I was a giant idiot when I was 12, was an idiot and got into some things I shouldn't have on snapchat. Ended up getting into dating and found someone from like halfway across the country. It was a mistake.

When my parents found out they put a lock on my phone that prevented me from getting anything with a 12+ rating. This means no social media and almost every game was unavailable. I eventually got enough trust with my parents after 6 months and was allowed to remove the filter. But they forgot the password to unlock it so I had to reset my phone. Still kinda mad

They told me that they wouldn't look at my phone unless they had reason to. I haven't done anything malicious, I swear a bit on reddit but I think they're fine with it.

But just a few days ago I caught my mom looking through my texts and she kinda was just laughing saying shit like "I was just joking". I lost all trust in her and installed an app that locks apps unless I have my fingerprint. I set the backup code to something they wouldn't know

I'm going to turn 14 in 7 days. I really want to start getting back into social media because my friend group is dying and their parents don't want me visiting them because of COVID. Fine but I still need person to person interaction. So I wanted to get snapchat back again because that's probably the easiest way of meeting people with this social distancing shit.

Should I get snapchat again and just password lock it? I'm not going to tell them that I got it because they're just going to snoop through my phone

Thanks gamers
