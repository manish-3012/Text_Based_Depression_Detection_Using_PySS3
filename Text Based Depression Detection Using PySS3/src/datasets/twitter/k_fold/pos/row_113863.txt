Iâ€™m not going to do anything in life 
 
why do people genuinely give a shit about anything weâ€™re all going to end up in a hearse eventually. To be happy maybe? Yeah Ig for some ppl but Iâ€™m not happy anymore. â€œ Well you might be successfulâ€ no I wonâ€™t and Iâ€™m so tired of ppl saying stuff like that Iâ€™m stupid, Unathletic, and ugly. Iâ€™m a fucking failure at 15. And ppl still have hope for me. Thereâ€™s no reason to be proud of me I havenâ€™t accomplished shit in life and I never will.
