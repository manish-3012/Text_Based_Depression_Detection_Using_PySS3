Gay, straight or bi I donâ€™t give a shit but Please stop eating each otherâ€™s faces in public. I canâ€™t go anywhere without seeing someone sitting on anotherâ€™s lap and making out. Itâ€™s rude and nasty. Hold hands? Yeah thatâ€™s cool. Just keep your tongues out of each otherâ€™s throats. Iâ€™m just trying to go out in public with my family without feeling so incredibly uncomfortable.
