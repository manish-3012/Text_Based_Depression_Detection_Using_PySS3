Anyone know any good,beautiful, wholesome, cutesy romance anime? I just finished watching Tonikaku kawaii and I fell deep into the anime void, looking for another good anime. I wanted to watch Josee, the tiger and the fish but itâ€™s not released yet and the 2003 version is a live action, which contradicts what iâ€™m looking for. Anyone know any good anime that fits the description?
