Anyone else just like in constant pain? Iâ€™m literally in constant pain.... nonstop

Not to mention I have MS so Iâ€™m uncomfortable constantly too!! 

At this point I kinda just try to act like itâ€™s not even happening. But like itâ€™s always there

Almost constant headache, teeth hurt, back hurts, neck hurts, feet hurt, stomach hurts, throat is killing me, that spot where your nose and throat meet hurts, my chest hurts when I breathe, jaw hurts, ears hurt, hands hurt..... 

Everything just hurts! ALL THE TIME!! I just want it to stop!! Why canâ€™t my doctors fix this??! 

Can I just have one day where I feel normal...
