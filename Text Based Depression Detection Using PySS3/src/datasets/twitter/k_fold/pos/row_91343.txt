whats the point?! every year gets more worse than the last, i try to be a good person to everybody i meet because i believe in karma.but why do i bother?! everytime i try to make things easier for myself something goes wrong, i dont think anybody rearly understands how sad i feel on the inside. on the outside i like to make my friends laugh and show them a good time but theres something missing in ME . 

im not sure what to do with myself everybody says it will get better but im honestley starting to lose hope.
