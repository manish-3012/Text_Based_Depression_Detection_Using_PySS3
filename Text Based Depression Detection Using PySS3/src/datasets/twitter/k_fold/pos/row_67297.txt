A weird thing happened once To give a little context in my country schools have uniforms and u don't go to classes the teachers come to your class kind of like in a university, the classes are continuous but teachers take time to come to the class like 2-3 mins.

So I was in 11th and one day I was just coming back from the washroom and while I was coming I was noticing that a girl was standing with her friends at the door of the class and while I was going towards the class she started looking at me and not how I  looked at my crush, she was straight away  staring and I reached near her I was standing in front of her and she was looking (in my eyes) at me I made a weird face kinda confused and went to my seat.

She is the hottest girl in my class and all of 11th grade I have had other weird interactions with her heck we don't even share a common friend. Currently I cant have any interactions with her because of some reasons we started conducting classes online and everybody stopped going out of the house. I have no idea why tho.

What do u think was on her mind?
