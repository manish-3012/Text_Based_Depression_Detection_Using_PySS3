I confessed to my crush and she liked me back! We went to the same party I was nervous but eventually told her I liked her, she said she did too. We made out the whole night and she wouldnâ€™t stop following me. Then when I got picked up and went home, I was sad to leave her but happy cause my crush likes me back! Then just found out she made out with the most popular guy in the school and he took her home after I left. :(
