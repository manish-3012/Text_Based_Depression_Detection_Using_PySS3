this might sound weird but if I had a boyfriend and he was upset I would definitely drive to his house or let him come to my house at 2 am and sit with him hold him while he cried and listen to his problems. idk why. I just would do that. Iâ€™d do the same for a friend but definitely a guy friend because I feel like nobody listens to guys and cares if theyâ€™re sad. yeah thanks for reading I guess
