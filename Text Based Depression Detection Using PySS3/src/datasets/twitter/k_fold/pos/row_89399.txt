I'm gonna tell u guys a crazy story.. So, I've decided to go back in time, 1912 to be exact, so..my baggage will consist of 

1.200$

2.A Lenovo ThinkPad

3. 2*Reinforced HDD and SSD, 

4.a Digital Camera

5. A WiFi USB and several boosters

6.audrino based Aqua sensor (wifi controlled)

7. A Gun

I would arrive at Southampton, London at April 5,1912... upon arrival, I would get myself an attire that suits the time (I don't wanna walk around in a hoodie)..., I would also visit a White Star Line's Office to purchase a first class ticket to the unsinkable ship, I would spend the rest of my time exploring Southampton, secretly taking pictures.....at April 10, I would board the Ship ...


I will write the rest later...
