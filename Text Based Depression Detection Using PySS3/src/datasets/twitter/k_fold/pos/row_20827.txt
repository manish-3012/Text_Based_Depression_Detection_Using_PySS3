My eyes opened I just finished watching a Youtube video on life in Japan and it really opened my eyes how different it is there, how neat people are and how beautiful and rich their culture is with amazing people, unlike your average ex-soviet state where people look like they sit in a depression, don't smile and hate everything that moves.

It made me think how life can be different in other parts of the world. I want to experience it all, if not, then a small fraction of it. I want to meet new and different, amazing people and I want to immigrate to a place where I can be happy and safely call "home", to start a family there and be proud to say "I actually made it out of this soviet praising hell hole". It's safe to say that the video opened my eyes and inspired me to work and study hard to achieve all of that, because prior I was depressed, lonely as fuck and, well, suicidal. I still am, but my goal that I just set for myself, to make it out and be happy, perhaps it'll help me take baby steps forth out of the slumps of depression that i'd fallen in.

I just wanted to share my thoughts. I will start working on my goal and refuse to give up!
