My classmate broke my window for a TikTok I was chilling at night listing to music and playing Minecraft on Hypixel. And then I hear glass shattering. I close my game  and look out the window, low and behold it was shattered to pieces and a big ass rock on my floor. And when I look there was someone running with a phone in their hand but I didn't know who it was. The next day a friend of mine who is a good friend with the girl that did this sent me the video of the friend throwing the big ass rock at my window and running away giggling. Like what the fuck my parents had to pay 135$ for a new window just so you can do a fucking tik tok? I reported her to the police but she took down the video and the friend that sent me it deleted it. And there was no evidence. Now I'm glad America is banning TikTok but I like in Romania SO THATS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
tl:Dr-Classmate throws rock at my window for a TikTok and then deletes the video when I report her to the police.
