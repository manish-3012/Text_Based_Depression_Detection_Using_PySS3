My life is a lie I'm actively living in a fantasy ... everyday,every single day,i imagine what would happen if all males and trans people just vanished thanos style except me and i arrive at slightly different conclusions every time ... i am always the hero/the villain ... other people are just a decoration in my life...in a few years i'm gonna have a totally different social circle , that scares me...i don't know when i'm gonna die...or if i'm happy when i am old...and as a coping mechanism i just imagine my life how i want it to be and then i just live there ... everything is so much less complicated over there...and i still don't know why am i here on this earth...and it's kinda giving me an identity crisis... but right now...i am happy...i'm so scared of the future.
