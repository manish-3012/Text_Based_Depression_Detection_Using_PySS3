My friend got assaulted buy her friend and idk what to do Iâ€™m extremely close friends with a girl, we talk all day every day and have for a while. And a guy she went to hang out with forced himself on her and I donâ€™t know what to do. We are more than just friends, I genuinely love her and I want to make everything better but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know how to deal with whatâ€™s happened. Iâ€™m doing everything I can to help her but I donâ€™t live close enough to be any real help. I canâ€™t even think about what he did to her because it makes me want to throw up
