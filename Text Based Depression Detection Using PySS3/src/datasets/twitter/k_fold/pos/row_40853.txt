So i need a hobby. After struggeling with heart problems and hyperventilation i have been at home for a year now and i am at the edge of a mental breakdown. I now go to a shrink who adviced me to go get a hobby. After trying out a few things photography and design seems to have a good affect on me so i decided to share it on an instagram page. I have a very low self esteem and i am afraid to get laughed at for doing this. So i am not trying to beg for followers but seeing a few followers would change my mood hopefully and boost my self esteem up. 
So if you want you can go and follow ( antheunis_design_fotografie ) if not just skip this post don't feel like you own me.

Thanks in advance
