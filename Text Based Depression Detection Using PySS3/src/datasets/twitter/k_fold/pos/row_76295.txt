this post is for those who want the recipe for those chili glizzys i made yesterday here's the recipe

Ingredients:

Chili cheese doritos

Hot dogs

Chili

Shredded Mozzarella cheese

Sandwich bread

Instructions:

Step 1: boil frozen hot dogs until hot and wiggly and boil chili until hot

Step 2: put hot dogs on sandwich bread, put chili cheese doritos beside Weiner pointy side out and then cover with chili, shredded mozzarella cheese, and chili cheese dorito bits

Step 3: put in tray that goes in toaster oven and put on toast on the fully toasted option

Option: if you'd rather not see the doritos, then I recommend crushing up doritos and putting them on the hot dog (after you cooked the hot dog that is)
