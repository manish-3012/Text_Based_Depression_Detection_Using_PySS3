My sister needs something fun to write on her house before the Sheetrock goes up. Any ideas? Itâ€™s pretty much exactly what it sounds like. She bought a house and saw this thing where people write some quote or draw something on the wood before the layer of sheet rock goes over it or something. Anyone have any cool ideas for that?
