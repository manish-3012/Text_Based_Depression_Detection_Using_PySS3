Guys yâ€™all gotta try welding its so cool. In school (in my country we are in physical school cus there is not that many cases pf the virus here) we have to make a metallic paper towel rack that represents an animal. We were required to weld the legs to its body, and attach its neck by welding. First time I was very nervous, but on the second time I had fallen in love with it. 

What we all can learn, is that if you want to beat your fears you have to face them. Experience is the best weapon in the battle against your fear.

(Sry for the long babble.)
