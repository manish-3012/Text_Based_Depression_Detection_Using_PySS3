How do people get into the talking stage on snap? what are conversation starters i can use? i genuinely have no clue. iâ€™ve snapped back with tons of guys but i donâ€™t know how to get beyond that. i want a boyfriend but idk where to start. whenever i talk to them i get paranoid and feel like iâ€™m annoying them. but like fr i need good advice, no one understands how confused i am since i got into all this stuff late. how do i get close with someone online do i just use random conversation starters like whats ur favorite candle scent like what?? please let me know. lost and horny and sad.
