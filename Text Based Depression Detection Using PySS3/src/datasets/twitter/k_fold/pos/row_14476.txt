Almost got hit by a fucking milk truck So i was walking home and suddenly i see a huge fucking milk truck coming at me at the speed of light. I was like "thats a bit fast for a fucking milk truck" and "i hope it slows down a bit" was like a 50 km/h zone. 

It didn't slow down

So the milk truck starts swinging around and was loosing control and going all like a heckin snake. The truck was atleast 10 tons (about the size of your mom)  with liquid inside of the milk place going all crazy. The road was icy and snowy so it was more scarier. 

So i was ready to jump to the side of the road and pray that i at least get a quik death and not those slowmo shits. I allready had my plans on how i jump to get the most quickest death. 

But then a miracle happens, a blessing from god himself



The truck slowed down and proceeded to go the required speed limit.
