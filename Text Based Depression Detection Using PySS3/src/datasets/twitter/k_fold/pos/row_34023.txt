Advice on bettering a relationship Ive been dating my girlfriend since September 2020, sheâ€™s 2-3 years younger than me. been dating since I was 16, but iâ€™m just worried that iâ€™ll run into legal problems. The age of consent in Pennsylvania (where she lives) is 16, but Iâ€™m 17 turning 18 this December. We love each other a lot but I donâ€™t know what to do I still love her so much, what do I do? 

(for reference, she was born in September 2006 and I was born in December 2003)
