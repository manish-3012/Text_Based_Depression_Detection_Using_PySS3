How could I ask my mom why I canâ€™t have Snapchat ? I understand that she may think that Iâ€™m to young to have it, or that itâ€™s not safe. But my mom just wont give me a reason other than â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ My dad doesnâ€™t care and even told my sibling that he could when heâ€™s my age. But I just want to know why my mom doesnâ€™t want me to.
