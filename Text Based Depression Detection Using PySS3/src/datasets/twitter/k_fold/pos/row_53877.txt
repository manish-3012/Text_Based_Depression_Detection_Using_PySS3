today was fucking wild so, i've been questioning myself for years now, but i never knew exactly what i was. recently, i watched the reboot of she-ra on netflix and one of the characters introduced me to the idea of being non binary. once i did some research, it all clicked in my head. i came out to my girlfriend, and we talked for nearly two hours. during which, she came out as panromantic and asexual. i always dreaded the times when being ace would interfere with our relationship, but it turns out she's ace too!

sorry for being a rambling mess, but excitement kinda makes me go monkey mode. also, this is my first reddit post officially outta the closet. it'll take a while to get used to they/them, but i already feel so much happier!
