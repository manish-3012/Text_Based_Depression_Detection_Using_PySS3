I'm disappointed rn Hello i am a Male and  my boyfriend is talking crap a out me without me knowing. we have been together for a few months idk what to do I am very angry and and I feel like I'm gonna cry because he is so nice to me and always does the littlest things to make me happy but now I learned that he talks bad crap about me to my friends and I just dont know what to do. This is really messing with my emotions and I feel sad and helpless...
