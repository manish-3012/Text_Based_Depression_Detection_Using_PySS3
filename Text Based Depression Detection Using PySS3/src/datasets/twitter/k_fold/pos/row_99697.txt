What's your favorite "The man who sold the world" version Mine is Midge Ure's one

Idk why, I listened to it first, and then David Bowie's one, but I likes Ure's one more

It makes me feel like I'm in a hospital bed, idk why it has that hospital vibe 

But it also feels like you're in a desert with a red scarf on your neck

It's so weird
