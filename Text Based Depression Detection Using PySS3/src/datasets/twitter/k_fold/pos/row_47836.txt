I got friendzoned by my crush Iâ€™ve liked this guy for a while now. We have a friend in common that knows abouy my lil crush. This weekend my crush, friend and some other guys were out filming for this project for school. My crush kept glancing at me and his voice immediately got prominently deeping when I arrived. 
My friend today asked him why his looked at me and if he was interested. 
The convo:
â€œSoooo you kept glancing at â€˜my nameâ€™ a lot, are you interested?â€
â€œNaahâ€
â€œOkayâ€
Wouldâ€™ve it be kinda weird if I liked her, I mean, sheâ€™s my friendâ€

Thatâ€™s pretty much how the conversation went according to my friend. Can I get out of the friendzone or should I just give it all up? I really like him but I donâ€™t know if he can like me back. Heâ€™s never had a girlfriend and he never talks about relationships to my friend. I also donâ€™t want a broken heart. 
Is it even possible to get out of the friendzone and what should I do?
