My mom is being ridiculous So my mom is planning for me and her to go camping this weekend, and great I'm excited, we haven't really spent time together this summer. we are supposed to leave canp Monday morning. I told her I would have to leave Sunday for a few hours and come back because I had planned to meet up with my friends. Now this meet up can only be on sundays because our scedules are messed up and I have to be there or it can't happen (it's for DnD). I've cancelled to many times on them to do it again. This camping trip has been planned for less than a week and now my mom wants to cancel the trip saying how I'm ruining it. I would be gone for less than 4 hours??? Even when I realized how stupid it was that i was leaving camp for DnD and told her I'll just cancel again she told me to go away and now she is sulking in her room and crying. I legit said don't worry I'll stay the whole time but she's still thinking of canceling it. I can't deal with this shit right now
