Quick advice on replying to a crushâ€™s insta comment One of my college friends posted on instagram a selfie she took on a slide somewhere and then another (much blurrier photo) falling off of it. I commented â€œdid you fall off??â€ and she said â€œhaha maybe...â€ Is there anything I should comment back or just like the comment?

I know this seems really frivolous and stupid but Iâ€™m extremely shy and anxious so I want to try to say something...
