i have no clue of what to do basically, there is this girl in my science class that I think is pretty cool, I have pretty much never talked to her, and I want to kind of be at least friends with her, the problem is that I have no idea of what to do, the only class and place I see her is in my science class where people sit in tables of 2, she sits with another guy that she talks to quite a lot, and she is constantly texting on discord for some reason, i believe she has a a boyfriend or something but I'm not sure, so I guess a more deep relationship would be a no go?

I have been trying to figure out how to talk to her, but I cant agree with any of my ideas for one reason or another, my first idea was to sort of try to put a note on her table with my discord or something to see if we could chat, but since we sit in tables of 2, the other person would see that and it just would be awkward, also I sit with another person (i sit in the table right behind her so that's why i got that idea).

I have thought about just talking to her but outside of science class I can't find a way to do so, there are barely any chances for me to talk to her in that class, and there is no other place I have seen her, I can't even try sitting close to her during lunch because we have assigned seats because of covid, and I don't sit anywhere near her.

These are the best ones I can think of right now, and even if there was an opportunity for one of those, I would be extremely shy to do so for a number of reasons that include: English not being my first language (I can speak it well, but I get bumped pretty often), my voice kind of adds up to that, also my appearance a bit, but the most significant one being that I was in a filming class with her last year, and last year I was pretty much one those people who only speak in meme language (I too hate myself for that), there was also a very cringe video I was on that I made with some friends, which I looked like a complete idiot, there is a pretty high chance that she still has that memory, so it will make things weird to be honest.

I completely forgot why I wrote this anyway, I think it was to ask what to do, or if I should even do anything, that's all, any help is appreciated or something idk.

(Also thanks in advance to whoever took time out of their day to read this and give some help)
