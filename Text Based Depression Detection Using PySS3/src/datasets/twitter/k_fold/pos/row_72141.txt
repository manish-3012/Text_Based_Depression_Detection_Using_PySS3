If this kid copies what I do one more time I'm going to scream If I find something funny from a video they immediately recite it every two seconds 24/7, if I like a new song or artist they immediately add the song to their Playlist or start being a giant fan of the artist. If I make my own private joke or a signature thing they use it all the time and post it all over their socials and it's not special to me anymore.
I literally learned a fast rap verse and was proud of myself and they learned it a minute later and said "haha we both know it now".
They even copy stuff I do in GTA, I'm actually going to combust like seriously.
(psa I'm not special but when I find something unique to me I cherish it)
(probably going to delete this later but I need to vent)
