itâ€™s starting to get bad again. TW: talk of depression, ED and self harm

i used to struggle with depression really bad. all through grade 7 and 8. it got better in grade 9. of course i had times when it was bad but for the most part it was pretty good. now iâ€™m in grade 11 and itâ€™s back. and itâ€™s worse. iâ€™ve never felt this horrible. i have no motivation to do anything. i go to work only when i have to and have been on the verge of quitting constantly. iâ€™ve been clean from s/h for 6 months and havenâ€™t had urged anything like this. i have always had a bad relationship with food. normally i try to limit the amount of food and restrict my eating in an unhealthy manner but when it gets like this i binge eat constantly and i hate it. i constantly feel like shit but all i wanna do it sit in bed and eat and sleep. iâ€™ve gotten so far behind in all my school that thereâ€™s a good chance iâ€™m not gonna pass most of my classes. i feel just hate feeling this horrible but i donâ€™t have the motivation to change any of it.
