Bruh moment So basically i have braces, and need rubber bands to readjust my bite.

I was running low on rubber bands, and told my parents a week ago. They refused to go get more.

I just ran out of them, and now the orthodontist is closed.

And they are mad at ME for â€œnot giving them enough noticeâ€ and yelled at me when i pointed out i gave them an entire week to get more rubber bands.

Fuck this
