My parents won't let me buy a game I want and it's 30 bucks. I have enough money to buy it and I want to buy it myself. I never wanted my parents or siblings to even help me buy the game and my mom says "no you need to be responsible with your money". I'm the dude that bought my first vehicle at 15. I'm the dude that bought meals for my friends and family. I'm the dude that goes to college I'm taking my AA degree and I'm getting paid to go to college. And yet my mom says I'm not responsible with my money.
