At this point Iâ€™ve just given up Iâ€™ve been practicing for my french exam for 4,5Hrs now and I most likely wonâ€™t pass. I donâ€™t know how to explain it to my parents, but Iâ€™m just giving up french as a whole. In my school you can compensate grades, so Iâ€™ll probably just do that. Itâ€™s 1.12Am rn and I donâ€™t even know wheter I wanna even sleep anymore. The stress of all these tests is really taking a toll on my mental health.
