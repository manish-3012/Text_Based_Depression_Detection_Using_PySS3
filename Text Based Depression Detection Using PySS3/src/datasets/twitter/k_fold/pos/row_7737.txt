Do you ever get that feeling where you just see something and start feeling really sad for them? Like a couple days ago I was watching a movie and some guy was in jail and he asked for his iPod from the guards (idk if you can actually bring an iPod into jail irl) and the guard just threw it at the wall and it was the only thing he had left so I felt really sad for him. 
Does anyone else ever get this?
Idk if this is the right flair.
