My teacher just called me out in front of everyone because I asked if she could move the due date of an assignment from Friday back to Saturday because she decided it was too much time for us. This is only one of many stupidities she has done to me. I'm done with this class even if its an AP. I was literally ready to tell her to go fuck herself and leave.
