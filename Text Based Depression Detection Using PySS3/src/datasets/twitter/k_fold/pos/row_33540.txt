How do I comfort my friend Basically he's feeling sad,and thinks negatively of himself,I dont rlly know what are the right words to comfort him and make him feel better.He thinks that when someone compliments him,that it's nothing special and that everyone could do it and he thinks he's dumb and he hates the fact that he's introverted and he said he's rlly bad at communicating with girls,bcs hes afraid that whatever he says would come off as weird or unfunny and he also hates himself.He said he wanted to cry for no reason.He didnt have the mood to do anything.

 how do i help him and what should I say to him
