I need your help I'm a boy and I'm 14 and I love a girl since 2 years. She isn't in the same class as me.
I'm not friends with her and we doesn't have friends or hobbies in common so I literally never speak with her.

I don't know how to get closer to her and my friends also have no ideas.

I really would like to tell her before the end of the school year so I go here because I think you can help me.

Thank you in advance for your answer.

P.S. : sorry for ly bad english it's not my native language
