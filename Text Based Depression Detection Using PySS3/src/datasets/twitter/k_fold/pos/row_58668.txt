Country Puns I thought Iâ€™d share my secret sauce of being successful in life with you guys. If you ever want to achieve anything, in any situation, no matter who you are, or who you are with, for any reason, whip out some country puns.

1. *Uganda be kidding me?*

(Classic starter of the package the rest you add will flow in effortlessly)

2. *There is Norway you are Syria!*

(Double whammy two countries for price of pun)

3. *Kenya Bolivia it?* / *Kenya believe it?*

(Your gonna want to read the room first some people will be offended by the Bolivia and consider it too far)



Alright those are the main 3 that will get you the most success in life but there other country names and nationalities that will be absolutely rePUNgent if you throw them in the mix. Just experiment and see what works best for you.
