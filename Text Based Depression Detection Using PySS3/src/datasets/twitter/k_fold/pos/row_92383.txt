My phone got lost for 3 days My phone got lost for 3 days and i have been so bored and actually studied a lot, but there is a problem. SOMEONE GOT MY PHONE OPENED IT AND POSTED ON REDDIT AND DID NOTHING. For real this guy posted on reddit 1 time and cuz of that post i was warned by fuckin reddit. I hope i find the guy hwo posted and talk to them if they are an IDIOT. (Actually i didnt study that much ended up gaming ;))
