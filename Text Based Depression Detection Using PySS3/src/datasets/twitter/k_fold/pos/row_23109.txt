What is going on? Im 16, have Aspergers Syndrome and ADHD, can't concentrate on anything, and I also don't know how I'm gonna deal with people in job life. My parents don't like each other that much (my mom hates my grandma (the mom of my dad)). My mom gets angry very easily (but at least she can keep stuff together at work). My dad sometimes only thinks about work and doesn't accept a "no" and annoys my mom with his behavior. I also have a weird humor nobody likes (I'm on several discord servers, and the people there can confirm that, not even "Gen Z humor"  is that much nonsense). I think I annoy my crush with the fact that I love her (not in a "nice guy" way), and the fact that we don't see us that often doesn't make that better. I'm lazy af  and procastinate for no reason whatsover. I often have the fear to upset people (and I do, because I don't hide my feelings). I often get asked on why I am so negative. Because I often feel lonely and misunderstood, but also am sorry for my bad character traits. And because I can't figure out how stuff works. (Something doesn't work, I search for the problem, find no answer or the answers don't work). Reddit also changed my way to think, because it made me realize how messed up things are.

Sorry if this text is a bitty mess
