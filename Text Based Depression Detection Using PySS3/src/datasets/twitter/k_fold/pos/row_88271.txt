Sorry guys i just need to vent Im failing a bunch of my classes (all hp so my parents expect me to get straight A's) and the one I'm doing the worst in the teacher refuses to take late work without a google form explaining why it was late, and i really don't have reasons except for procrastination. So now my mom is super pissed. My dad has undiagnosed mental health issues that he refuses to get treatment for, or even diagnosed, and is borderline abusive. He blames all my family's problems on my mom going back to work after being a stay at home mom for 13 years, even though he was the one who always yelled at her to get a job. I think my crush is playing with my heart. My friend group is tearing apart, and my younger siblings constantly taunt and make fun of me to their friends because i write fanfiction. And we have had several nannies quite because of my brothers bad behavior. And on top of everything physical school is starting soon and everyone thinks im a furry (its a long story) when I'm not (not dissing furrys everyone just laughs at and bullies me for it). Sorry for dragging you into all this i just needed to vent to someone, anyone, and i figured someone out there might read it.
