Advice on getting thinner Iâ€™m 14, 5 foot 6, and average weight, but I, or at least feel like Iâ€™m wider than normal (comparing myself to people from my area).

Iâ€™ve gotten thinner from the past, and ages ago I stopped an addiction to buying unhealthy shit (the sugar/fat kind), and recently Iâ€™ve been going on runs a lot and exercising more frequently. I plan to carry this on.

However, I wanted to ask anyone if they have any advice they could give me to help me get thinner. My diet is average Iâ€™d say, if not fine, and as I said I plan to carry on frequent exercise, and when schools open again I plan to go to the gym, so is there anything else I could do?
