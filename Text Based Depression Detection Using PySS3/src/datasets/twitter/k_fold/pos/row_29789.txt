The saddest part about abusive parents is that it's hard to hate them entirely. 

Sometimes they're loving and gentle. At their worst, they're horrific and unrecognizable.

Yet, even if a part of me does hate them for it, the other half still clings to the happy memories they've given me. And in some strange way, I still love them. Some part of me still yearns for their love and acceptance. 

I can't pick and choose whether they love or hate me. Both seem real. I hate the disquiet it causes me. I hate myself for daring to even partially love the people who hurt me, and yet, I feel guilty for hating them. 

I don't want to keep asking what's wrong with me, but I sometimes I can't help but wonder... Why, at times, do they not love me? How can I fix myself so that I always get the happy side of them?

I wish I could hate them and cast them out of my life like they never mattered. How easy would that be? How much less painful?

And yet, I can't do it because I can't definitively say that I don't care. A part of me always will.
