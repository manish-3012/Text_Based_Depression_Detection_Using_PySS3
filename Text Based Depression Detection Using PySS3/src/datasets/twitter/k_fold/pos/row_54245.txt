Should i stop complaining my guy friends? I have quite a few guys in my friend group and i like giving complements toy friends. But i kinda started worrying if that's considered flirting??? Cuz i made a complement in the form of a joke to a fr yesterday and he kinda got flustered ig??? as if stopped functioning for a while of some shtt (idk if it was cuz it was a *bad joke* or a *compliment* tho...)

Like I've seen memes abt these kinds of stuff but I can't get take all social advice from memes so... am i accidentally flirting???
