Don't wach Citrus (or any kind of romance anime) To make it short, it gave me depression, and I mean real depression, why?

Well the anime is about lesbians trying to love each other, but after I've watched it I've realized that you can't have that kind of love and emotion with another person in real life. 
Love, even if it's heterosexual or bi or homo or whatever isn't real, or it's just not viable in today's world.

And if you're like me, sad teen that dosen't go out and dosen't have many friends, the problem just gets even bigger.

To conclude : Love it's just a human fantasy, it wasn't real, it will never be.
