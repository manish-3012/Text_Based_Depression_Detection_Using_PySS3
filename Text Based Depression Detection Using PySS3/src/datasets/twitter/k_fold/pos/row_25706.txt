Iâ€™m so fucking angry Thereâ€™s a club in my school for science olympiads and I made the team last year, as a ninth grader. The test is extremely difficult and I was only taking chemistry at the time. This year, when I was in the tryout tests, I got a notification that I didnâ€™t make the team, which literally makes no sense because Iâ€™m taking AP chem this year and am generally really good at science. Then it struck me, every single freshman this year cheated on the test by searching up answers, because almost 10 of them made the team when they probably arenâ€™t even taking chemistry yet cus Iâ€™m double accelerated, which makes me study 2 years ahead of my grade. Iâ€™m really pissed that all these kids just cheated on the test and thereâ€™s nothing I can really do about it... life is unfair
