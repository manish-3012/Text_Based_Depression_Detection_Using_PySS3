that 1 person who always tries to 1-up themselves with you today I left our triple biology lesson feeling pretty dumb, we were going through questions and I got all of them right expect for the last question, which I simply didnâ€™t understand. 

I said out loud â€œI feel so dumb after biology sometimesâ€ and another girl was like â€œoh I love biologyâ€ with no sympathy or anything, why would you bring up how good you are at something- especially if the other person is obv feeling bad about it ðŸ˜’
