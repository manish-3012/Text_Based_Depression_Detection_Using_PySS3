my harvard interview today went rlly well! ik i posted a lot abt it in the last week LOL but this is the last post since ppl asked me to update, the interviewer gave me dad vibes and he was rlly nice. he said i was a good match for harvard and if he talked to me again it would be to congratulate me on my acceptance which i think is a good sign ?? but yeah !
