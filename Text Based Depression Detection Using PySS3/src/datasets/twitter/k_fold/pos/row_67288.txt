If some of you could check my first future bass track, and give me some feedback afterwards, I would really appreciate it.  I started producing edm two months ago so I ain't on a pro level yet , but hopefully your feedback can help me to become better at producing edm, I'm not officially releasing the song at least not for now, so I'm not self promoting myself here. I can't give the link to the song in this subreddit because it gets automatically removed, so send me dm or comment on this post and I will personally send you the link through dm. 

Also be 100% honest with your feedback. Thanks.
