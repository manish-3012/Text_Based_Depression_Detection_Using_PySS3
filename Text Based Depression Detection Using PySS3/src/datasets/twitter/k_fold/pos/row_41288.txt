how can i help my best friend my best friend is struggling with her mental health.
i know she wouldnt admit it, but she is.

shes sad, confused, stressed, and everything else.

i feel so bad because i cant help her in person.
only texting and facetiming.

i hate to say it, but shes in these situations because shes a pushover.
she will do anything for anyone else even if it hurts her, and wont do something for herself if it harms someone else.
that is ruining her.
i cant get through to her that she has to stop that.

i love her to my wits end.
my forever.

shes not happy anymore, and i donâ€™t know how to help.
i dont struggle. i am happy. i feel guilty for not bringing her with me.

her self esteem is below low, and it sucks because she is very pretty. like gorgeous.

she wont let me help.
i know the usual â€œtell her parentsâ€
but i feel like that push her over the edge because then she would feel like somethingâ€™s wrong with her.

i dont want her to hurt anymore.
i dont want her to harm herself.

shes told me she wouldnt k*ll herself because too many would be hurt by it.

we talked about getting checked out, but she doesnt know how her mom would take it.

please help me help her. i love her
