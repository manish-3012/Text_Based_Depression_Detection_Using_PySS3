Is it okay to think about fighting? Have you ever just thought to yourself and think "I really want to fight someone." Like is it normal? I've been boxing in my garage for like a month or two and I think my ego is building up too much. I want to feel the weight of winning and losing, I want to punch some dude's teeth in, and they so the same. I want people to see me, to recognize me, build a reputation. I'd just fight anyone at the point, but I'm not going to do that for obvious reasons. I want to be  the underdog that nobody messes with. Is it me or is this normal? What should I do?
