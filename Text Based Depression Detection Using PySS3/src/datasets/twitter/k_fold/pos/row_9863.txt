So uh whatâ€™s up with this sub, it seems to hate tik tok, and many the posters seem sad, and just not motivated about things in life Iâ€™m just confused by this place. As much as yâ€™all meme and shitpost, there also seems to be a good amount that just wallow in their sadness, or just hate things because of their popularity, without ever having used it. 

Overall, it just seems like a somewhat weird, downer environment, where a lot of the people donâ€™t seem to want to put in the work and just wallow instead.

I mean a lot of you seem like great people, but there is a more active undercurrent of that stuff than Iâ€™ve seen anywhere else.

(Iâ€™m not trying to be an asshole, even though it sounds like it, just gain some perspective)
