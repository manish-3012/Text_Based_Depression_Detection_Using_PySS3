Your help is needed to save this man!  I am assuming there are other posts about the case of a young boy that is still trending in social media. There are extremists trying to get this young man lynched for being vocal about his opinion. A hashtag is trending on twitter which accuses him of blasphemy and all extremists are spamming it to gain attention. I'm asking you all to please help save him using these trends to try to bury the blasphemy trend. #btsarmypakistan #ImranKhanJawabDouÂ  #ImranKhanKhulwaoPUBGÂ

7)add this in the further description:

This is in light of a recent hashtag which is fast becoming a top trend on Pakistani Twitter. The hashtag is #BlasphemourMarufZaid It is spreading rapidly in response to a mob of Pakistani users trying to get another Twitter user killed in response for alleged blasphemy. As we know, Twitter has a no-tolerance policy for any type of hate-mongering, and especially for dangerous life-threatening hashtags like this. This is an urgent, emphatic request to take down the hashtag #BlasphemourMarufZaid with immediate effect. A young Pakistani life depends on it.Â
