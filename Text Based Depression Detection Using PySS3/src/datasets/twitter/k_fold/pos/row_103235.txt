I figured out how to get friends and possibly an SO! Stop giving a shit about what other people do. If someone likes to play Fortnite or some other game that you find â€œcringeâ€ it doesnâ€™t matter because thatâ€™s your opinion. Or if someone likes a social media app like TikTok it doesnâ€™t matter because it is their opinion. Just like how you have an opinion so do other people. Everyoneâ€™s opinion should be treated equally and with respect. People should be able to have a conversation no matter opinion whether thatâ€™s games, social media, or political.
