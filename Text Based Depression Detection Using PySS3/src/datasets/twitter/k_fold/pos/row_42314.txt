The smallest things can make a difference I get asked â€œhow do you jump so highâ€ a lot. I get asked this every time I play a sport or just messing around with friends. Itâ€™s annoying. Itâ€™s okay 1-2 times a month, but 5-6 times a day is so annoying. Itâ€™s not my biggest problem but itâ€™s one of the most annoying. People call me a freak of nature because of this. They say â€œno 14 year old should be able to have a 35â€ vertical, and a 17â€™ long jump.â€ Itâ€™s stupid. Sometimes I wish I couldnâ€™t jump like this. I wish they could deal with being called a freak everyday, and how it makes you feel. Sometimes I just feel like I donâ€™t belong where Iâ€™m at, I feel alone.
