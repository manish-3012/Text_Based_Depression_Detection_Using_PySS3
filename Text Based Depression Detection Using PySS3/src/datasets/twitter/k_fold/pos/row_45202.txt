My Aunt's Father got kidnapped- So, my Aunt's Father he is a wealthy man and has a fond of wearing gold everywhere on his body in the hands, in the fingers and in the neck. He went out to buy some groceries and some robbers came in, made him unconscious and kidnapped him. After robbing him they left him far away (like 100 kms away from where my aunt's father lives) on a rivershore. When he became concious he took a mobile phone from some stranger and called home and now my aunt has gone there to pick him up 


oof Such a scary experience god I hope such thing will not happen to anyone else.
