Hello ladies and gentlemen. I wrote an essay on why I am not a simp for this girl who called me a simp in band, I hope you enjoy I am NOT a simp
I have wrote this today to explain why I, Max Evans, am NOT a simp. 
I shall be going through these three points. First, I have never said anything â€œsimp likeâ€. Second, I have many female friends who do not think of me as a simp. And last (but not least), I would rather die than be a simp.

First, I have never said anything that could (even remotely) be considered â€œsimpingâ€ or even â€œsimpishâ€.
No one has ever had the misfortune of seeing me as a simpish person. They have not had the chance to as I have never said anything simp-like, whatsoever. 
If I had there would be evident proof. 
Since no proof has ever come forward of me being a simp, then how could I be one?

Second, I have many a female friend who do not perceive me as a simp.
A simp is a man who puts himself in a submissive position to a woman, almost worshipping her, is he not?
If that were true, then how come almost none of my female friends have come forth, accusing me of such a ludicrous action and lifestyle? 
As a simp, I would have to worship any female that comes before me, yet, most deny me being a simp. How is this possible?? Well it is quite simple actually.
I AM NOT A SIMP

And to finish off my price of persuasive text, I would rather DIE than be a simp.
A simp, is such a disgusting lifestyle, one I would never be a part of. In fact, it is quite amusing as to why anyone could believe I am one. 
They are very submissive creatures (already almost opposite of me) and willing to put a female before their own wellbeing. If you know me, you would know that I am the most important person you have ever known, therefore, it would not be logical to put anyone before me.
Simps are simply disgusting creatures, I do not have the slightest bit of respect for them.

In conclusion, I am not a simp. And honestly, you would have to be quite daft to still believe so, let alone believing so in the first place. 
This is because, I have never acted or said anything remotely related to simp-like behaviour, almost non of my female friends see me as a simp in the slightest and Iâ€™d rather die than be as disgusting as that simple creature. 
Thank you for reading.
Oh and one more point. I could NEVER simp for a LESSER bassist
