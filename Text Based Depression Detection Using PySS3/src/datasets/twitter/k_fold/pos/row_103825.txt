Guys I figured something big out Thereâ€™s been some ambiguity and I think if figured out why you donâ€™t have any bitches on your dick. So, everyoneâ€™s been saying if you get rid of that yee yee ass haircut youâ€™d get some bitches on your dick. And weâ€™ve all been reading that as /if you get rid of that/ yee yee ass/ haircut/ but itâ€™s actually supposed to be read /if you get rid of that / yee yee / ass haircut. So, we all need to shave our ass hair. Then maybe, hopefully, finally, weâ€™ll all get some bitches on our dick. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
