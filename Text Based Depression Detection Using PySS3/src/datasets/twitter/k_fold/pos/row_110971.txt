Iâ€™m finally ready to educate myself in science and listen to the experts. Iâ€™ve realized science has no ill intentions and that scientists are experts and should be treated as such. They know more than our political leaders and their knowledge will ultimately help the human race. 

I will do my best to learn about Eugenics as defined by scientists and this will surely help humanity learn to accept science for what it is; An undeniable field based on fact.
