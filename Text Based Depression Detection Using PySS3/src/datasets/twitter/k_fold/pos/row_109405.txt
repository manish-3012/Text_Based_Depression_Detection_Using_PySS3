So something very funny happened yesterday when I was on Xbox So I was on with three of my friends and one of them was playing call of duty, and he invited a guy he normally plays with, who is American (weâ€™re all British), to troll him. So he started playing drill music (the British equivalent to hard trap) into his mic and I was sat in with my mic off laughing. Then my other friend just out of nowhere started playing willy bum bum really loudly to this random American guy. I was just dying of laughter in the background. Anyway, thanks for listening to my story lads
