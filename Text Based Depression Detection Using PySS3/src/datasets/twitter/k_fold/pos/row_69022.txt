I know literally nobody cares But after quitting the gym because of depression, I just got back into a few weeks ago, and Iâ€™ve already broke my old record of 110 pounds, I was able to lift one rep of 110, but my new record is 5 reps of 120 and Iâ€™m really proud! 

Again I know nobody cares but Iâ€™m still super happy about this
