[Important] TikTok is NOT for kids. TikTok is a shady and mostly unmoderated area place with porn.

So this is just plain bad. Kids in GRADE FUCKING THREE are using TikTok and have (probably) seen porn before because of TikTok.

Types of porn on TikTok include people showing off their bare butt, full body cam of naked people, and girls showing boobs.

So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.

However, our school district not only blocks the website but also the API so TikTok is blocked, even on the mobile app.

While TikTok might be an "excitement" during the COVID pandemic, TikTok is NOT a safe place. Make sure to read the reviews of the app, website, or product before downloading/accessing it.
