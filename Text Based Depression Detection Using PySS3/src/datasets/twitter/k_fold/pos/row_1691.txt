Help ya homie please â™¥ï¸ Basically, it's birthday of my love ( Gf of one year) in a fortnight, We are in a long distance relationship and our families don't approve of our relationship (We are secretly dating) , I wish to do something for her to make it memorable , apparently, only way we communicate is through texts and we video chat when she's home alone. 

I write poetry and she likes them too, so I'm planning to write atleast a dozen of poem dedicated to her and I can make patterns on Rubik's cube ( So, I am thinking to write make I love you *her name* on it.)

But the problem is, I'm not satisfied and I wish to do more because I love her so much and I want to do more for her ( ik she'd love the stuff , I already mentioned) but I wish to do more.


So, I need some advice on what else I can do for her and keep in mind, I can't buy her gifts because of family problems.

Any advice would be appreciated,Tysm.ðŸ˜Š

Have a good day, y'all.
