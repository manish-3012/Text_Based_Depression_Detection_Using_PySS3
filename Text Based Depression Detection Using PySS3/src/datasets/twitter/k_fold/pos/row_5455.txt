School is weird Im currently on 9th grade, and my whole class (except 3) hates me, and its funny how they tell it to me every single day, yet still, ask help from me if they have problems in math, physics or chemistry. Like wtf, first they call me an idiot and try to make me angry. Then they ask me questions like im their best friend.
