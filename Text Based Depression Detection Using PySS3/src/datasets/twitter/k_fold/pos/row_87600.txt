Im hating 10th grade I had to quarantine for 2 weeks because I was sick and my brother had contact with someone infect. I came back to loads of things I didn't know and tests. I worked double what my colleagues worked and the chemistry test fucked me up. I had 2 philosophy tests (one thursday the other friday) and I had to study 2 different chapters. Today is Sunday and next week I'm going to have, Monday math test, portuguese test tuesday and an English test thursday. I don't know shit and I cant study because I have this constant headache. I'm so overwhelmed. 
I didn't know anyone in my class and I have an extremely hard time making friends but I somehow quickly fit in. They are cool people but I barely have stuff to talk about with them cause they don't like the same stuff as I do. I know I'm a pussy and It could be way worse but fuck it this is me
