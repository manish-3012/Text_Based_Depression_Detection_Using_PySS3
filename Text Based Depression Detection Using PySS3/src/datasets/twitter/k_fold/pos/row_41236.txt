Spongebob realisation I had for my fellow teens Okay so in the episode "your shoe's untied" the flying dutchman states he hasn't tied his shoes in 5000 years, on account of lacking feet and instead having a tail. BUT in the very first episode where he is mentioned, "squidward the unfriendly ghost", they show a picture of his body, still with his legs, being used to show off clothes in a VERY modern looking store. He would have had to tie his shoes when he was alive, as when multiple characters turn into ghosts, (e.g. Spongebob, plankton, etc,) they have the tail immediately. This means that he must have tied his shoes, "5000 years ago" as he claimed, when he was alive, and since we see his unrotted body in a modern store, on a photo with colour I might add, this has to mean that the show takes place 5000 years into the future, AT LEAST. thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
