Some things Iâ€™ve noticed now that Iâ€™m 17 Now that Iâ€™m 17 Iâ€™ve noticed that people seem to expect me to have my life and future in order. They seem to expect me to know what Iâ€™m doing and expect me to take control of my life.  

I no longer feel comfortable asking questions on the ask teen subreddits, no that Iâ€™m Iâ€™m older I feel like I should be answering more than asking.  Is anyone else like that?

Also I get allot of shit for not having  a driverâ€™s license.
