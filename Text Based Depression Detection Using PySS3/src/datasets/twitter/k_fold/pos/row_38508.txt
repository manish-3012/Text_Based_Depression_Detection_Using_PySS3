Reddit just added this new award... ...which is more than $120.  Why do they think that someone would pay that much?  WHO would pay that much for an award?! Why do these awards exist?! With all that money, you could buy something actually worth your time! Give a homeless person food! Buy yourself a couple games! Go on a trip! But instead, that money would go to fake internet points!
