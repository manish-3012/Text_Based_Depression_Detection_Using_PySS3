Fellas I just had a strange occupancy I just got Snapchat and a female friend I had added me and we chatted for a bit. She then was like â€œask me for a relationshipâ€. At first I was confused but I decided fuck it, so I did. She changed my name for her to [my name]/bf and asked me to change her name to [her name]gf. I complied. When I asked if we were seriously in a relationship, she was like â€œwere friend but we do couple stuff. So we like flirt and call each other babe and stuff.â€ She immediately started calling me babe.

I am absolutely confused as to how I got into this position.
