I pretty much jyst put a girl in jail for 2 months. Read the post. So one of my friends was dating this girl for about 2 weeks. She told him she went to a different school but was homeschooled. She said she was 18 and he was 18. They had sex on a few occasions and then got into a dispute and broke up. She then wanted to claim statutory rape because she was underaged. It went to court and my friend almost went to prison. He had no evidence she lied about her age, but I found some. Back when she first met him, on sc she was asking me about him because she knew I was his best friend. Well it turns out that there was a message when I said, yeah weâ€™re both 18 in our senior year, and she said â€œReally? Iâ€™m also 18â€ keep in mind she told him her â€œageâ€ multiple times he just didnâ€™t have evidence. and I had the message saved on sc for some reason idk. Long story short she either does 2 months in jail or juvy and she fucking hates both of us now lmao.
