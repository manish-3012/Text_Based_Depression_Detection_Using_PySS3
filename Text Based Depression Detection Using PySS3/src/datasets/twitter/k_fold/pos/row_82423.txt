Why do teachers try to make tests as confusing and anti-student as possible? Is there some kind of award for teachers putting in trick questions and then saying ha gotcha after half the class gets less than a C? Is there some kind of sick and twisted incentive that makes teachers put in answers that are basically the same with slightly different wording on each but only one is technically right because the question has the words "best describes" in? Do teachers get some kind og messed up joy writing questions that can be taken in over ten different ways that nobody understands how to answer it? Are teachers just prone to writing questions that don't even have anything to do with what they have taught and are just expecting you to know because they gave you over 20 pages to read last night as homework? Can teachers not give out study guides that completely misguides students studying plan and then blame it on them for not studying enough and forcing them to only be able to do a retake that gives back half points but is also twice as hard and has entirely new questions? And please for the love god why do teachers always use the "I get it, but trust me college is going to be harder," excuse. 

I'm done with this bs.
