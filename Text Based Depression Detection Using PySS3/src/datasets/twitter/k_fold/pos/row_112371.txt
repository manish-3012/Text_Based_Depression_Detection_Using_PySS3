At what point will you just say fuck it with all the restrictions and ignore them? I get trying to lockdown for a couple weeks in march, and clearly that didn't work, and the US just won't learn that restrictions aren't helping, and are just causing a lot of other bad stuff. Personally I said fuck it in June, but I can't do anything until I go to college. Who's with me though if any restrictions are still here by the end of this school year we revolt fuck yeah
