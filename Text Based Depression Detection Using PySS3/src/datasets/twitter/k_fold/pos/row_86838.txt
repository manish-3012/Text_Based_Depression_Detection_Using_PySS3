I just found out one of my classmates has been in the hospital the past 6 weeks because he tried to off himself multiple times He said he didn't want to talk about it because it just causes more stress, so obviously I respect that. I just told him to think of life in 24 hour intervals and celebrate completing one, and then look forward to complete the next one, and the one after that. He's currently typing so I don't know his response to that but is there anything that I could say to even try to put some of his thoughts at ease? Or more importantly, is there anything I could say that could make things worse?


I had no idea since we are in completely separate cohorts in school and I don't even really know the kid, but he's obviously opening up and I can't just like, not talk to him now. At first I thought all the times he was swiping on my story were him flirting (typically saying stuff like your so pretty or yoir so carefree), but now I think he just wanted to have a conversation with someone. I feel like a shitty person for thinking that now but yeah, please help
