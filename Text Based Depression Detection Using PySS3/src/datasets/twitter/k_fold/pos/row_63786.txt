Does anyone know where I can get a cheap iPhone 6s or something similar? I've been stuck on a bad Android and that's all I can afford. I'm from the UK, London specifically. Just want to have a slightly better phone and not spend too much. I don't use it too much anyway, mostly Tinder and bank apps.

Thanks!
