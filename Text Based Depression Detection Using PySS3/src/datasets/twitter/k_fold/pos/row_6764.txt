Do you have any tips for getting your work done faster? I need tips for getting work from school done faster. I need to have all As in school and most of the time I understand whatever Iâ€™m learning but when I come back home I just want to put it off later. In school, sometimes I canâ€™t even focus and take a very long time on my assignments. Do you guys have any legit tips on how to not do that and make my body act normally instead of not focusing and being slow?
