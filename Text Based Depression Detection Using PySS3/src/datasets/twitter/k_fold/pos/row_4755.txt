I don't understand the obsession with relationships Why are teenagers everywhere so obsessed by being in one? I will be 18 this year, and I have never been in a relationship myself and I have no regrets about this at all. Its not like I have lost the ability to get a crush, but I dont see why getting in a relationship is important. We all know very well how most of them go, and how they end. What importance does it have to my life that I waste time worrying about someone else in the age when I should worry about myself? I don't mean to be rude to those who are in a relationship, but why do we feel obligated to be in one? Is there nobody who enjoys being single and all the freedoms that come with it? 

Btw I am not American, and here you are not made fun of or called a loser for being single, but the obsession with being in a relationship is the same. Then again in younger generations, as close as those born 1 year after me, it has started to get similar to America where you are a loser if you never had a girlfriend, and it's very annoying because these people are prioritizing stuff that barely matters. Haven't we seen enough memes about middle schoolers who care too much about what clothes they wear and what games they play so they seem acceptable in the crowd, and then they lose all those unnecessary restrictions in high school happily? It can be the same way with being single. It's not a crime, it can be much fun. It's not like you will never be in a relationship, everyone gets their chance. So are there any single people here who do not mind neing single to agree?
