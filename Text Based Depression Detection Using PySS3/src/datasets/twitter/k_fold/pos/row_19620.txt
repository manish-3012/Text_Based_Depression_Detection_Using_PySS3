follow up to my last depressing valentines day post long story short i was rejected because someone had already asked my crush and she said yes to them, but a friend of mine (female) asked my crush about the person she accepted and apparently she didn't want to talk about him, meaning he could be fake (she and her friends have made up people before idk why)

my same friend asked my crush's friend about said crush's valentine and said it might be an actual real person she knew

so basically this is confusing and i dont like it and im sad 

u snooze u lose lol
