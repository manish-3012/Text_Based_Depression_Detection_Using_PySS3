I just found my cousin's Vibrator I was searching for an eraser which I left there and found it underneath a pillow. I honestly didn't expect it because she's cool with us staying in her bed when she's gone, and it's crazy loud.

No I most likely wont be posting a picture because that'd be a blatant invasion of privacy, but it was a simple, silver, remote controlled bullet [Just like this one.](https://imgur.com/ujwIX8O)
