Lost my best bud recently and i don't know how to cope with it I got him when i was 4 for honors in school he's an siberian husky and it's the best thing to have happened to me and I've had him for 14 years of the best times who's been with through everything with me constantly wagging his tail everytime i come home or when times get hard he would just lick my palms but now that I'm going home without hearing his tail hitting the door and him running and jumping on to me nor my hands getting slimy and wet from his licks that reminds me he cares for me through hard times but i couldn't cry not one drop did i just feel empty and don't have any motivation to do anything now I'm just want to hear how to get out of this shit feeling
