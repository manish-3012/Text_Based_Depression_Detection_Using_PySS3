Communication in a relationship is important as fuck. Iâ€™m pretty sure i lost a friend because she wasnâ€™t communicating. She had seemed off for a bit and I kept asking her if she was ok and she kept telling me yes and I kept asking if I had done something or if I was acting to clingy and she said no, so I thought everything was fine. Yesterday I find she had left our friend discord server and her brother tells me itâ€™s because she felt I was being to clingy and that I had been making her uncomfortable with my flirting. I had asked her about all of this multiple times and she said everything was fine. FUCKING COMMUNICATE PEOPLE!
