Talking stage So is it considered the talking stage if they live in a different state or like the other side of the country? Cuz Iâ€™m trying to figure out if Iâ€™m in the talking stage with like 3 girls, but Iâ€™m wondering does it even count if Iâ€™m probably never going to see them. Also Iâ€™m not a hoe, I used to be the typical shy redditor then I said fuck it and decided to be more bold and here I am now.
