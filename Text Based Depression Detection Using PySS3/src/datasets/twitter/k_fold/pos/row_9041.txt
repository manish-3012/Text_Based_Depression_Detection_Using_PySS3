Rich girls don't act like rich girls anymore The rich girls in Florida at least. They drive crappy American cars instead of Mercedes and BMW. It is obvious who they supported in the 2020 election.

They have devolved.

They are embarrassment! I miss the rich people of the 90s! They were more classy and had better taste in engineering!

Remember America it was a German rocket that took you to the Moon!
