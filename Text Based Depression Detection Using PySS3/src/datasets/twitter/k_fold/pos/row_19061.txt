Dented my Flute and just found out today So, I was in Band and was having extreme difficulty putting my head joint together with the body of my Flute, so I took it to my teacher. I had found a small dent the day before but thought it was "normal" (stupid, I know.). So, I showed it to him and asked, "Is this a dent?" And, guess what? He said, "Yes." Apparently, If I don't get it fixed, I'll end up stressing the keys out so much they'll also end up breaking. So yeah, now I'm sitting in my room writing this because my dad is pissed at me. For anyone who's wondering, the dent was on the bottom opening of my head joint, where you connect it to the body. It dented enough that it isn't a perfect circle there anymore, and it's REALLY difficult to put together without breaking a sweat. Advice? Maybe possible price ranges that it will cost to fix?

TL;DR: I dented my Flute's head joint and now I need to get it repaired, resulting in my dad being very mad at me. Advice/Price ranges I should expect?
