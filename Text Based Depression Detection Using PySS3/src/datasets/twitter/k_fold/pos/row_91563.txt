Does Waiting Till Marriage = Single Forever? So here is the thing, I am 19 years old and have never been on a date. I have never had my first kiss, never even held hands before. But what I have done, is had numerous boys ask me for one night stands. I have had boys be my friends for months, ask me for a one night stand, and then leave me when I tell them no and that I am waiting till marriage.

I am so tired of this. I know I would have a boyfriend by now if I just had sex. But I dont want sex. I a terrified though, that because of this, I will never find a boyfriend. Not only does every guy that I seem to meet only care about sex, my friends have convinced me that boys expect sex in a relationship.

I guess I am just posting this here because I have hope. I want so much to not agree with my friends. Do any guys actually care about us girls as people? Do all guys expect sex in a relationship? Will I be single forever if I choose not to give up my body until marriage?
