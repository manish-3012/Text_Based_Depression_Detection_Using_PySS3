Boy I used 2 like finally likes me back but I donâ€™t think I like him anymore I used to get butterflies (I think) but now I donâ€™t, if anything I feel anxious when we talk because I know he likes me and I feel like Iâ€™ll say the wrong thing and ruin our friendship or make things awkward. We talk all day but I probably seem really dry cause of how nervous I get. My brain is so confused, heâ€™s 1 of 2 guys that Iâ€™ve had feelings(?) for. Thought I was gay for the longest time and even though I have relationship experience Iâ€™ve never officially made it past the flirty stage with a guy

Maybe my stressors are suppressing the feelings I have for him, maybe I just lost care for a relationship, maybe I really am gay? Like frick, what do I do? Heâ€™s so sweet I donâ€™t wanna hurt him by letting him into my life and then discovering I donâ€™t like guys or something. This sounds stupid but I kinda wish I messed around, instead I was in what was basically a 2yr relationship with the same toxic girl because I was scared to reject her. This sounds so dumb jesus Iâ€™m ill
