I've been laying in bed with my eyes shut trying to sleep for close to literally 3 hours now and I just can't do it, it's 7 am and I'm not tired one bit. I was trying to get on a better sleep schedule but it's so hard when I got 12 hours of sleep yesterday. I'm probably going to stay up for a day and not sleep, then by the time it becomes 12-1am or so then I'll be able to go to bed and will then be on a better cycle.
