I broke the teachers speakers My teacher had his speakers in his classroom connected to the pc at full volume, so i blasted carmelladensen with bass boost, on the google meet, at full volume, all his speakers just went and started screeching like gods wrath, the speakers are fine, but i dont think my teacher is, also this was an accident too, i had carmelladensen on my headphones and the google meet took my headphone audio instead of my tabs audio
