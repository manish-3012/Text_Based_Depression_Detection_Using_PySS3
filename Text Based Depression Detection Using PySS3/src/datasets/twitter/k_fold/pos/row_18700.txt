I hate hypocritical popular high school girls To begin i will start by saying I am straight A student, I consider that I have my priorities in place, but for that I am considered  a nerd and a loser. Also i am shy and I rarely speak up about stuff that bothers me.

Long story short. On Tuesday all of my classmates were hating on wearing masks to school on the group chat so when i saw that i snapped. I wrote a letter long text saying how irresponsible they were and if they don't like the conditions, they can just do online school (and many more arguments). I spent a while on that text so I expected some sort of response. No one said anything. No one said I was right or wrong, not even my friends. I was very much ignored. 

Fun part of the story starts now. Today a popular classmate of mine, whom everyone loves, posted THE EXACT SAME THING I POSTED as a facebook comment on a post hating on the current conditions at school. It had the exact same arguments I made!!! And guess what happened, you're right, she got so much positive attention from that! My classmates were agreeing with her, congratulating her for speaking up.

The thing that annoys me the most is that the conversation was ended by her saying "i had to say something". OH MY GOD THE AUDACITY ON THIS BITCH TO SAY THAT. YOU STOLE MY TEXT

I really wanted to argue with them saying that no less than 3 days ago they would've loved that facebook post, but I couldn't. I knew I would get ignored yet again. After all, who cares about what the loser nerd girl says. Not even my best friend agreed with me, or even tried to console me. So here I am pouring my rage onto a reddit post.
