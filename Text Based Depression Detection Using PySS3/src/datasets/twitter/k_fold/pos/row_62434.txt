How Do Y'all Eat Kiwis??? So I was eating a kiwi the other day, and people said it was weird. They said that you're not supposed to bite into the kiwi and you're supposed to peel it.

I don't get it and I don't see the point to peeling it unless if you're using it in a recipe. If you wash it in water, you can't taste the texture at all (I'm guessing that's why people peel it). But honestly, just eating it after rinsing it saves a lot more time because for me at least peeling fruit is annoying.

So the discussion: how do you eat kiwis?
