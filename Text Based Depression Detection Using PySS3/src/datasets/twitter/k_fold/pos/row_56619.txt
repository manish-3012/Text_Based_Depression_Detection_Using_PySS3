Every night i get extremely scared of burglers I live in a pretty bad area, and every night i hear a lot of scary things. yelling, running, speeding cars, etc. sometimes i hear people talking and it sounds like theyâ€™re right next to me. its always super terrifying because iâ€™m only 15 and i donâ€™t know how to properly protect myself if there actually will be someone problematic. iâ€™m not asking anybody to try to help me or tell me i should do this and that, i just needed to talk about it somewhere, because its starting to take a toll on me.
