"Self-Depreciative" memes aren't memes at all, they're more like a call for help Seriously, there are a lot of posts in this subreddit and especially in the most famous meme subreddits that are considered memes to be laughed at, but should be viewed more seriously, especially considering the topics talked about.

Memes like "  Guys I need a girlfriend because I need company haha", " Haha guys I'm introvert with difficult in social interaction and I find this situation so relatable haha", " Depression is so relatable haha."

Things like that are too serious to be simply viewed as memes. The person behind the meme is probably using comedy as a way to call for help, a self-defence mechanism.
It's not something to be normalized on Reddit.
