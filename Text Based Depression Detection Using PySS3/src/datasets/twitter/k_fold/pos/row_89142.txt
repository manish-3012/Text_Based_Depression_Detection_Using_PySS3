How should I deal with being rejected? So at our uni class meetup we were talking about ourselves and this girl mentioned anime . Seeing as I am a weeb I proceed to talk to her about anime and she seemed really excited about having someone to talk about anime. 

About a couple of days later I mustered up the courage to ask her if she wants to hang out and talk about anime. We hung out for like 4 more times , and I really liked her and seemed to click with her . Yesterday I confessed my feelings towards her and she said that she is not yet ready to have a bf.  

Fellow teens , what should I do ? I have no  experience regarding dates
