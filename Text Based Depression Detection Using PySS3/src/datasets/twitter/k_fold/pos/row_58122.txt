Iâ€™m kinda stuck rn When it comes to girls Iâ€™m kinda stuck rn. Iâ€™m not unattractive, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m like 7/10, but I never seem to go anywhere with girls. Whenever I get a gf or am talking to someone I never seem to be able to take it to the next level yk. All my friends talk about these great experience with that stuff but I can never get it there. Iâ€™m not an incel or smn, I donâ€™t think the girls owe me anything itâ€™s just frustrating. I think my personality is ok I guess Im just stuck. Iâ€™ve had my first kiss Iâ€™ve touched some things but I just canâ€™t figure out how to get there, and it feels like Iâ€™m falling behind my friend group.
