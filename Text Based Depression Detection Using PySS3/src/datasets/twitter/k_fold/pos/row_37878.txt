I have the last online lesson of today in 3 minutes it's the 8th lesson, i woke up at 7:45 am, it's already 2:03 pm, my internet is fucking dying, and it's maths, which means i'm either gonna be writing the whole lesson, or imma have to do some equations, while lagging and being bad at math at the same time
