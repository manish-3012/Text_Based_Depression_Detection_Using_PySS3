Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im 15 and from behind one could realisticly assume a late 20s early 30s man was standing in front of them. This turns out to be really confusing for some people...

1.My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook.

The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time (this was pre corona).

As my dad and I were looking around, I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost. Initially I just assumed a middle age man (from his voice) was asking an employee, even if his question didnt exactly make sense (hard disk or ssd presumably), so I ignored him. 

The guy repeated his question a few times but again, I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him.

Now, I was wearing a fluorescent shirt. Mistake. The employees also wore flourescent. 

Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder.

â€œHow much does a terabyte cost?â€

â€œOh I dont work hereâ€I say, revealing my baby face.

The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude.

We still laugh at this instance today, even though its been a few months. Never saw the guy again.

TLDR: someone thought I was a store employee, I was not

2.My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together.

For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present, or should I say, all of them.

The dinner starts (it was all you can eat) and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents (its kind of their thing, they drink a lot). Of course, they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students. Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder (quite obviously talking to me):

â€œwould you like some wine?â€

I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing. They thought I was my dad (in this story i was 13 and roughly the same size as my dad). My stature had struck again. Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad.

TLDR: semi drunk parent thinks im my dad
