Arkansas has just banned transitionary treatment for any trans youth. This is entirely serious. Even if youâ€™re not trans, please spread awareness so other people can be aware.

Arkansas recently introduced a bill to ban all trans related healthcare for trans youth under 18. This includes: hormone blockers, hormone therapy, transitional surgeries, and can possibly include name changes.

The governer vetoed the bill, but that **means NOTHING.**

Both other factions of Arkansas government overwhelmingly approved the bill. This bill is now law in Arkansas.

To my knowledge, this bill may also cover necessary surgeries and treatment such as pertinent breast reductions, hormone therapy for trans youth with hormone issues, hormone blockers for trans kids with hormone issues

The trans suicide rate is already very high, with 41.8% of non-binary youth attempting, 29.9% of transgender women attempting, and over HALF of all trans men attempting sometime in their youth (source credit to [The human rights campaign ](https://www.hrc.org/news/new-study-reveals-shocking-rates-of-attempted-suicide-among-trans-adolescen) )

LGBT help centers are very concerned that this new law will cause those rates to skyrocket among trans youth in Arkansas.

Please help support my trans siblings going through this in Arkansas. Transitioning is frustrating, a long process. A lot of us donâ€™t feel we can live in the incorrect bodies until weâ€™re â€œold enoughâ€ to get it on our own. A lot of us are relying on parent healthcare to pay for our surgeries. I know I am. 

If you are from Arkansas and feeling suicidal over this new bill, PLEASE call either the [Suicide hotline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) or the [Transgender help lifeline ](https://translifeline.org/)

Always remember that no matter what laws are In place, **you are loved and appreciated.**

Stay safe everyone
