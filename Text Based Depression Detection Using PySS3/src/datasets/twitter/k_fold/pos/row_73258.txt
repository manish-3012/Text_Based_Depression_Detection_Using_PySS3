youtube's animal abuse rings a youtuber named Nick Crowley has made several videos on this topic, im just trying to bring awareness to this.

basically some youtube channels have been putting animals in dangerous situations and pretending to save them. there is complete proof that this is animal abuse.

and on top of that, youtube refuses to take these channels down and continues to monetize them.
