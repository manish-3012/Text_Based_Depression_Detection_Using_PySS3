Parents are pissing me off Passed drivers Ed nearly a year ago, have been driving nearly a year, am taking my test TODAY (written, practical is soon) 

I ask my father if I can practice parallel parking behind his car in our driveway. It's private, flat, paved and wide. 

He says NO. Not because it's illegal, but because he thinks I'll hit his car.

HOW TF Does he expect me to pass the test HE wants me to take if he doesn't think I'm capable of PARKING. 

And let's be clear. I've been driving him places for a year and never hit anything, not even a tree branch in the dark, I always park too far away, not too close. 

He could easily say "sure, but park a foot further than normal to avoid hitting it" or "sure, but go slower than normal" but NO, I'm just not allowed to practice at all.
