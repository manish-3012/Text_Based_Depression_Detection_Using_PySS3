Freestyle I wrote. Sorry touchy subject. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m fine right now. What do you think of it? Addicted to these cigarettes.

Keep asking, "Have I pulled the trigger yet?"

Not sure, if alcoholism is a bad thing.

Have these marijuana plants gotten bigger yet?

Drugs. Drugs. Consuming thems fine.

Take a couple Advil, wake up around nine.

O'clock. Im in shock. Anxiety is frightening me.
Has me ticking. Tick tock.

The time is near. One day I'll over dose, and my
mind'll be clear. Free from depression and trauma.

am a lama. Or is it a goat. Whatever it is I'm the
best at smoke. Smoking. Coping, with my pain, by shoving toxins down my throat.

My broken young brain. What haven't I wrote? Life sucks. My life is a joke. I'm a loser with more
problems than cloaks.

To hide myself. My emotions, I croak. My pain with jokes. I die of a stroke.

But that is fine. Because I want to die. Sorry
everybody, but just look at my life.

I'm just going to end it now, have no time for
goodbyes. I pull the trigger now. I fall back and
die. Finally at rest from all the shit in my life.
