genuinely debating creating an anon gmail and sending this to my school... so thereâ€™s a kid at my school, and i recently (a couple months ago) found his profile on tik tok. and to say the least, itâ€™s bad. racist, homophobic, just plain gross. weâ€™re in 9th grade, is it gonna matter if i send these screenshots and recordings to my principal? is it worth doing? iâ€™m debating :0

â€œdataâ€ iâ€™ve collected: ðŸ™ˆ
