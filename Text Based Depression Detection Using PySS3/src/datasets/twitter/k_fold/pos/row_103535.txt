Is it wrong that my biggest takeaway from Spanish class this year is that Schmetterling is butterfly in German? Step one you say we need to talk

He walks, you say â€œsit down, itâ€™s just a talkâ€ 

He smiles politely back at you 

You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to the right 

And he goes left and you say right 

Between the lines of fear and blame

You begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend

Somewhere along in the bitterness 

And I would have stayed up with you all night

Had I known how to save a life

*and todayâ€™s filler was brought to you by The Fray and their song, How To Save A Life*
