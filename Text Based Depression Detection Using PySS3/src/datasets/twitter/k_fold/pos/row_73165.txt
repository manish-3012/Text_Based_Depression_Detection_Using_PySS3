Rant about how teachers explain stuff They just go on about a topic for 45 minutes. My adolescent ass doesn't have the attention span to listen to 45 minutes of boring talk. The worst part is that you could generally summarize what they have been talking about in just a few sentences. And when they actually mention something important (e.g. about an upcoming test) you don't learn it because you are unfocused.

Or maybe I'm just dumb lol, this is just my personal impression of the situation.
