I am now unable to feel negaive emotions. Medicine is too stronk

A quarter of a pill makes me convert all my negative emotions into calm ones.

The bad part is that my fear kept me going to online school so now i can just not go to school and have pannic attacks whenever someone talks about school.


HELL YEAH

Should i test its effects by watching furry stuff on the TV  with my mom in the house?
