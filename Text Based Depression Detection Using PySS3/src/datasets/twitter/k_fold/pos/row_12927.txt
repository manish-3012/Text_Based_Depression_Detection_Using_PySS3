advice on how to feel good? also, rant hey guys, I can't feel happy without bad memory coming and ruining everything. everything feels wrong and yet I'm not motivated to do anything let alone change things. I'm trying to be more impulsive and erratic but nothing works and I still remember how ugly, annoying and stupid I am. looking at the mirror feels like mockery and yet I end up showing myself off to be pompous and annoying. I can't talk to anyone about this because people will 100% judge me for this but I almost always hear a booming voice telling me to cut my arms or just end it all. Two of my uncles have committed suicide and I'm scared that I'll be next. I overshare on my ig and tik tok but it doesn't make me feel any better or any happier. I feel like I make friends feel like shit but they make me feel like shit and yet they are the only people who could give a fuck about me.  I feel like I'm never going anywhere and yet I don't want to try because I know it will all be for nothing.  

if any of my friends read this (which they won't) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I'm such a piece of shit. I'm not victimizing myself because genuinely I suck and can't just be normal and nice. I do like you and I do care it's just I can't express that because every time I have I get shut down and it's not your fault Im just constantly scared of ruining the mood or coming off as touchy and clingy. I accidentally grew this shitty mean girl personality because I wanted to feel confident and cool but the truth is im not. im insecure, I hate my body, I hate my face, I hate my almost double-chin, I hate my stupid brain and its garbage thoughts.

long story I hate myself, I cant feel good anymore and im going downhill and there's nothing I can do. Any advice?
