Are you feeling alone? Are you slightly depressed?

Are you feeling like no one cares for you?

Are you feeling segregated from society?

Do you wish to be in a relationship; however, you never take the first step?

Do you want to be someone whom youâ€™re not? 

If the answer to all of these question is a â€œyesâ€; then, youâ€™re not alone. Youâ€™re just one of the billions of people on this planet; who identify as â€œteenagersâ€. Just remember, things ought to get better. 

Peace!
