idk who needs to hear this Stop caring about people who don't care about you!!!

Stop giving them your time, energy, and love. They don't deserve it! Keep that shit for yourself, and save it for someone who actually gives you back that same energy. I know as a teen sometimes it gets lonely, and you don't wanna be that kid who eats lunch by themselves or whatever.

As someone who was a huge loner in highschool, I fuckin loved it! I no longer felt drained and unloved cause I was no longer surrounding myself with people who made me feel that way. 

Respect yourself, set boundaries, love the fuck out of yourself! You see all that love you wasting on them, give that love back to you homie.

And like I love you, the world loves you, someone out there you haven't met yet loves you. Stop giving them assholes your love.
