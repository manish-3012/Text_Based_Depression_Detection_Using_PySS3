Guys I need your help!!! I have this really great French teacher , she is really fun and you can talk to her about anything and she wouldn't judge you which is a great quality for an adult in my opinion. I was looking for ways to show her what she means to me and my classmates and thought a good idea would be to grow her YouTube channel. The subscribers mainly  are only students of her class so it would mean a lot to her if she could get a lot of subs. Im doing this anonymously so she thinks it was her luck. Im not karma whoring or begging for subs but do what you can guys. if you don't want to sub then just leave an wholesome comment.
