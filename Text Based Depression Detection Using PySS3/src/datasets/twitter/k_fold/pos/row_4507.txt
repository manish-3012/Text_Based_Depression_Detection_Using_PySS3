Pushing through last year of High School is being hard. Hey guys n' gals, just venting.

I live in Brazil, so we're still at peak pandemic. I've been isolating for the last year and a half, and during that time, developed a lot of eye floaters, suddenly. Now, I can't concentrate in the classroom, or look at white screens, documents, papers, and so on - they slosh around, blur my vision, and just annoy me in general.

It's now being hard to follow school. I used to be an A/A+ student, and still have a lot of free time at home, but it's being difficult to keep it up. Hell, I haven't been able to at all. I'm satisfied with Cs and Bs, but my parents aren't.

Our school is also not investing in good distance learning at all. We're stuck with laptop microphones and an ultrawide camera that doesn't let us read stuff on the blackboard - where the teachers write stuff, even in distance learning - and I'm tired of complaining. Although we've asked for it this whole time, our school is still stuck on an awful platform as well, and teachers publish their tests and homework in multiple different ways, through three different means. It's confusing - they could just be using Google Classroom, Forms and Meet, and everything would be properly integrated.

Sorry for venting, mates. I'm just exhausted, and there's still eight months of this to go. I'll make it, but it should not be this hard. To say it feels unfair is an understatement, but it's not like I can change it, and there is a lot of people with it way worse - that's some comfort, I guess.
