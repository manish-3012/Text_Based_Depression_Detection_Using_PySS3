There are two types of teachers 1- Blames everything on you even though they don't explain the topics with detail. Common examples are:

\*if you don't know about X topic then get out of my class\*

\*That's a stupid question, read the book and find it yourself\*

\*No you have to do it my way it's much better. I don't care if the whole world uses your method you're going to use the one i'm teaching\*

\*All these gaming apps have made you all mad.\*

2-The nice teacher that actually helps the student and looks out for everyone. Common examples are:

\*Ask me any doubt a 100 times and i'll answer it\*

\*All I want is for the topic to be clear for each and every one of you\*

\*No question is a stupid question, ask me anything and I won't shame you infront of your friends, classmates and colleagues\*

Sadly, there is only one nice teacher in the entire school which proves why students are so scared to even clarify their doubts. Authority makes them think they can do anything, including berating and shaming students without even offering them help. Dismissing everyone's ideas and doubts does not set a good precedent for the students; In fact, it only lowers their self esteem and stresses them out. Stop praising one all rounder kid and actually appreciate the fact that you have the gift to teach the future of mankind. Treat everyone with kindness so that they actually pay attention in your class, instead of mocking us every single painful step of the way. Stop shaming us over every mistake we make and actually make an effort to help us fix it.
