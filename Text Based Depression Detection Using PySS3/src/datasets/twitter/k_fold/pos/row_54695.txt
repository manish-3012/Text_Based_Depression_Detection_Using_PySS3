Getting rid of / preventing crushes This is not a guide to do this or anything but this is just me sharing how I do this. 

I recently realised that Iâ€™ve set up a defence mechanism for myself against getting crushed on people. Now lemme tell you how it goes.
 So when I realise Iâ€™m getting a crush on someone, I just sorta just crazy ship them with another guy or girl in my class. (Usually a guy cause itâ€™s easier to just pretend they are gay so you get over them faster) 

And this somehow helps me out. Itâ€™s probably cause im just used to shipping people together a lot (fan girling over anime and webtoons) 
Iâ€™m just kinda curious if anyone else does this
