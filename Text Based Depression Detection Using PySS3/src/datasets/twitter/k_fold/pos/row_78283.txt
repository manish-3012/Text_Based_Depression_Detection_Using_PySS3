I FINALLY GOT A GIRLFRIEND SOME OF YOU MIGHT NOT CARE BUT IM REALLY HAPPY :D!

i've had a crush on this girl for so long, but I finally asked her out, I was kinda scared at first because she left me on read, after awhile i was getting anxious and regretting it. a few hours later she messaged me and said she would love to date me and we agreed on a date. the music at the place we went on a date was weird.  


  
and then my alarm clock went off
