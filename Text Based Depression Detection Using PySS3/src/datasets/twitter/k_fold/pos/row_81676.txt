It looks like Iâ€™m gonna get a girl friend This is great but Iâ€™m just wondering... what now? What am I expected to do? We havnt met in person yet but weâ€™ve met in online class and weâ€™re returning to skool near the end of next month. I just never expected to get this far. Am I supposed to take her out for like a movie or something? I havnt thought this far pls help. Have only known her for like a week or so and things are going well. Iâ€™m just afraid that I will end up in sorta an awkward scilence of what next. Pls help
