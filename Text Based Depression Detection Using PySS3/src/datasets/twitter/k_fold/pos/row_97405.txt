My favorite actor died My favorite actor, Chadwick Boseman died.  That man was a mad inspiration for me dude. His roles were such an inspiration for me since the thrid grade, from real ones like Jackie Robinson, to legends like T'challa in Black Panther.  I am sp saddened that he passed away at just 43 and that he had to have died at such a time of civil unrest and tragedy all around the globe. In the last 9 months we have lost so many legends, and except for Kobe Bryant, this one has hit me the hardest. I'm going to miss him and I wish he could have stayed longer and shown what other great things he could've accomplished.
