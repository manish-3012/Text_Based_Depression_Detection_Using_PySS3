Got suspended on my first day at school. I was just chilling and then I heard this kid pushed this teacher over. That teacher was my mom. I saw him in the hall and idk what came over me but I fucking stormed him when he was being walked to the office and drove him into a wall and kneed him in the stomach and he punched me which was a very shitty punch and then I socked him in the chin and he started crying. Iâ€™m suspended for 2 weeks and I think I chipped one of his teeth but idc. Worth it.
