Does my friend like me? So I was talking to my friend today and the conversation was going fine. Weâ€™ve know each other for a couple years and have been pretty close friends.

Then, all of a sudden, she says sheâ€™s liked me for a really long time and wants to go out with me.

Does she like me or is she just being nice? It kinda hard to tell, what with her being Canadian and all.
