Iâ€™m mad about the stupidest thing in the world So the other day my friend of 5 years is finally building a pc which I am so unbelievably happy for him but he said that his family is â€œnot doing great financiallyâ€ but yet they are paying 2500(Canadian) on a pc. So if they were really â€œstrugglingâ€ why is he spending the whole 2500$ on RBG than save that extra 150-200$ on things that arenâ€™t rgb and are just as good? And he always takes things for granted too. After maybe 1 year of having his iPhone XR he said it was trash. I was stuck with a old iPhone se for 2-3 years. One last rant, heâ€™s had around 3 computers to play games on that run more than 60fps but he still thinks thatâ€™s not good enough even tho he has a 60hz monitor. In my household we havenâ€™t TOUCHED a computer since 2011 so when I got my 2016 gaming pc in 2020 I was so unbelievably happy and here he is complaining about 60 frames. Donâ€™t forget tho Iâ€™m so happy for him it just a bothers me what heâ€™ll think of it after he gets to like a year with it.
