TWO DAYS! TWO FORKING DAYS! (Discord rant) I created a discord two days ago to talk to a friend whoâ€™s phone broke, and only two people know it. today I get a notification that says someome logged in to my discord from a town half an hour away. I asked the person who has a phone if they no anyone from this town, they said no, and that leaves the other person who has had a phew issues with my existence in the past few days and she knows my email...

sorry had to rant
