I never post on reddit, but I feel I had to make a special occasion This isn't karma whoring, by the way, I don't use reddit nearly enough to care about the little number of internet points in the top right corner of the screen. I just wanted to use this community for what it's main use is:

Telling other people you finally got a girlfriend.

I can prove it, I can show Discord messages, I just wanted to spread the positivity and let you now that it is possible, you just need to wait, let the right girl come to you. Thank you for your time, continue being cool.
