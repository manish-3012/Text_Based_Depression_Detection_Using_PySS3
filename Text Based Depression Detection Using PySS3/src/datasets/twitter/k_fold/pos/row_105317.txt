Anyone got muffin recipes? So basically for the next two weeks I'm going to be stuck at my house because someone in one of my classes at school tested positive for COVID. Today I got bored and made some easy muffins, but I am dissatisfied with how they turned out and want to expand my muffin horizons a bit. So for anyone sorting by new: do you have a good muffin recipe? Tell me your secrets.
