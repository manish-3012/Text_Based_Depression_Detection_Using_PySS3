Shovel Man I was walking around with my friend and we found these woods. So we being dumb kids decided to enter and settle. We are there for a good hour or two when a guy starts coming. 
He has a shovel so we start freaking out that we were going to get killed. He walks by us and we thought we were safe. He continues to walk around for a bit before I notice that he was carrying a dirty baby doll. At first, it looks like a baby corpse. We started to freak out, and he started walking towards us so we dip. 
Still don't know why he had a shovel.
