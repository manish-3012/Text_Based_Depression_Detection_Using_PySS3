anyone wanna try to make me not kill my self watched a movie, made me realize how fucking pathetic and worthless I am, how much better id be better off dead, how i should just run away and slit my own throat while chilling in an underpass. i just canâ€™t fucking take it. i want to be someone, I want to be useful, but I know Iâ€™ll never be, im fucking worthless and pathetic with no hope of being loved because I always push it aside. as Iâ€™ve been taught by life so far it doesnâ€™t fucking matter how I feel, it just matters that I do what I need to get done and move on. but whatâ€™s the fucking point of moving on when I donâ€™t have a future, when Iâ€™ve already fucked myself that moving on is like trying to fucking push a 747 as an anorexic kid. i just canâ€™t, and i would rather die trying. I keep telling myself â€œthere is hopeâ€ â€œit does get betterâ€ but lying doesnâ€™t fucking help anymore. i was always praised as the smart kid with a future, but I know my future is nothing. im pathetic. ive failed every god damn attempt at a good life because I never realized how good I couldâ€™ve had it. i donâ€™t care about getting the future I want, or a future at all anymore. i just want to be happy. please. for a single. fucking. minute. of my pathetically fucking miserable life. Iâ€™ve never smiled with genuine glee or happiness, itâ€™s all been to try and fit in. everything I fucking try to do to make me happy just makes me want to fucking run a lemon-covered knife along every fucking vein and artery in my body. i just canâ€™t fucking handle it.
