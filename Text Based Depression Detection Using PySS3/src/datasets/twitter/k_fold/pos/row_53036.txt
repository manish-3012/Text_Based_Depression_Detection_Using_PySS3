I donâ€™t know... So there was this girl I liked from Kindergarten to 4th grade. I was looking through my old stuff, and found a letter that she wrote to me, about being â€œStudent of the Weekâ€. But at the back of the paper, she said that she liked me. So should I chase her back down, or not? Iâ€™m not sure if she still likes me though
