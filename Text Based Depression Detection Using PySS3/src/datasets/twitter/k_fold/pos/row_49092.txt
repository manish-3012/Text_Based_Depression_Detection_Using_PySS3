Today is my bday BUT I actually forgot that it was my birthday until some friends started calling me and wishing me happy bday and stuff... and then my mom when i got out of my room... is this natural? (Pretty sure not) Has anyone else forgot that their bday or should i be concerned that my life is as low as it gets
