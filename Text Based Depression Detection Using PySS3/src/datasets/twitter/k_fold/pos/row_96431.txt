What's your take on teens / young adults who don't have or use social media? I'm 20 but when I was a teenager I didn't use social media, people thought it was very strange that I didn't have at least one social media account, at first they thought I was playing around until they knew I was serious then start asking me a dozens of questions as to why I don't use social media. (Still happens today)
