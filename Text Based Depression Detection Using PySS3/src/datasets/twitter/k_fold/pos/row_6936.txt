200 years of collective educational design experience So basically I had a dentist appointment so I missed class no big deal there was a math test that day so I email my teacher â€œhey I need to make up this test is there a available date in your schedule any time soonâ€ so 2 months later I get a response â€œIâ€™m sorry it is too late to make up assignments from that unitâ€ 
I did email her before the end of unit but my bad shouldâ€™ve been more responsible well plaid United States education system. Well played
