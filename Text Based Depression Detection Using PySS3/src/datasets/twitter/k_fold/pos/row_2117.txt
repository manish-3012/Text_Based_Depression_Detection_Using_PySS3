The secret to well peeled potatoes Step one, rinse your potato.

Step two, grasp on half of the potato firmly. All your fingers on one side.

Step three, now you wanna hold your potato with your thumb on the side, which will make it easier to cut. Now take your peeler and make strides fast and hard, peeling up till your hand. And for the poles, sorta smack it until the skin is gone. 

Step four, swap you hold on the potato. Make sure it doesn't slip. Repeat step three.

And if you were peeling correctly they should be well rounded out.
