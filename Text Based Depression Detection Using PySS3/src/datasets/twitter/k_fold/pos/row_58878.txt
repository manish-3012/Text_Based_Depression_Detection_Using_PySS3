Should I move to the US? Us Europeans are always wondering how the US is still a (partially) working country. But today I changed my opinion. 
Because a part of the dutch celebrities (Iâ€™ll refer to them as BNâ€™ers from now on, cuz thats how we call them) decided they wanted to become Karens. They just said to each other Iâ€™m done with this and went onto social media to say stupid things to undermine our government. 
News-outlets interviewed them and they didnâ€™t have any arguments for their disagreement. The only thing the BNâ€™ers could really say is that they were disappointed that their income is gone, given that they are mostly musicians.
Its kinda funny how they started a whole war within all the BNâ€™ers. Cuz now we have camp GoGovernment versus StopGovernment. But Iâ€™m mostly just disappointed with the stupidity I thought only existed with American Karens.
Thank you for reading my rant I just had to get it out of my system.

Tl;dr: part of the dutch celebrities turned into Karens
