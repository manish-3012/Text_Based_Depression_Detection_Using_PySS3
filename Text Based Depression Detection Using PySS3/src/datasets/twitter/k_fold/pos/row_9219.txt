Please turn on your camera during our Zoom class meetings. Hi, I'm one of your English teachers. It's important that you stay safe, so I understand why most high schools opted for distance learning at the start of the new school year. 

Still, it's rough. I'm not as effective as I was before. The quality of your instruction and my ability to develop meaningful teacher-student relationships have severely lowered. I've never felt as useless and as ineffective as a teacher before, and it's really weighing me down. I want to help you, to empower you, and inspire you to change this world that is so messed up. I'm trusting you with that responsibility. I've spent hours of unpaid overtime trying to give you my best just for this strange year.

I'm not an emotional teacher, but Monday was our first day of school and I cried after hours. It was my second cry during my whole career. Despite all the stress and the struggle I endured to not fail you any more than I have to, a majority of my students couldn't be bothered to turn on their cameras. I couldn't even look into the eyes of the kids I've made sacrifices for. It's discouraging.

This week, please do us all a favor and show us your face. I don't care about dirty rooms, go ahead and be curled up in a blanket on your bed, take your Chromebooks wherever you want. Just let us see you.
