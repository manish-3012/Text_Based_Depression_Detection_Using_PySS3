As a humanist I think Jesus had some very admirable teachings but he also condoned incredible cruelty and injustice. His moral failings aren't discussed as often as they should be. When people criticise the Bible's moral flaws, they tend to focus on the Old Testament. That's understandable, it's the section where a wrathful God commits mass murder multiple times, oversees Job's torture, endorses stoning blasphemers to death etc.

Jesus on the other hand, has a nicer public image. Obviously Christians think he was the perfect, sinless, miraculous son of God but even non-Christians who don't believe the Bible is true often still admire the character for his teachings. 

After all, he's the guy who famously rejected the eye for an eye doctrine in favour of "turn the other cheek" and "do unto others as you'd have them do unto you". We're also told he fed the hungry, cured the sick, told his followers to give to the poor, stopped a woman being stoned to death and even called for forgiveness for his executioners. All very admirable stuff I agree with.

The thing is, it's cherry picking to focus on the nicer things Jesus said and stereotype him as an ultra forgiving, all-loving paragon. My contention with this post is that Jesus - or at least, the version of him described in the Bible - had major moral failings. Yes, he had compassionate teachings but he also condoned or failed to condemn incredible cruelty and injustice:

* He never criticised barbaric Mosaic Laws (e.g. verses which allow beating slaves, keeping gentiles as permanent slaves, rapists getting to marry their victims, banning the disabled from altars etc). Instead he endorsed the idea those laws came from God and claimed he'd came to fulfil their purpose (Matthew 5:17).
* He discussed the flood and had no issue with the cruelty of God drowning all humanity, sparing only one family (Luke 17:27). 
* His parables discuss slavery (Luke 17:7-9) and even the beating of a slave (Luke 12:46-47), but he never condemns the practice.
* He endorsed the racist idea of a chosen people. He initially tried to turn a Canaanite woman begging for his help away because she wasn't Jewish and compared her to a dog (Matthew 15:23-26). He later relented and helped her but that doesn't excuse the racism.
* He compared divorce followed by a second marriage to adultery (Matthew 19:9) showing no regard for the reality that couples can grow apart or that relationships can be abusive, and that it should be okay to find love again afterwards.
* He taught that thoughts alone could be major sins (Mark 7:20-23, Matthew 5:28) rather than judging people by their self control and actions.
* Worst of all, he preached about hell and had no issue with it (Matthew 5:22, 10:28, 13:50). He spoke of wailing and gnashing of teeth inside an eternal fire, told a parable in which it doesn't matter if those inside hell beg or ask for their family to be warned (Luke 16:19-31), and preached that more people will go to hell than heaven (Matthew 7:13-14), all without condemning this system of torture.

But then again he may not have tried to stop this as he was born thousands of years ago and was a product of his time the same can also go for the likes of Julis Caesar and Aristotle.
