Found out I probably have juvenile arthritis. Iâ€™ve been dealing with joint pain for years and I have deformed feet and no doctor could tell me why my joints hurt so bad until the doctor I just saw said it could be juvenile arthritis and after doing some research that sounds very likely. I canâ€™t work cause Iâ€™m in so much pain so Iâ€™m applying for disability when I turn 18. I donâ€™t know who else to tell but I needed to tell someone.
