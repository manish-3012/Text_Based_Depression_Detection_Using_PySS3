I feel like Iâ€™m not as nice as I used to be I used to go out of my way to make others happy but now I donâ€™t have to motivation to do that and I feel terrible. People ask me for help and I just donâ€™t wanna help, and thatâ€™s the worst feeling. I want to be there for them but itâ€™s almost like I donâ€™t have the energy to. Idk what to do. I liked the way I thought before. I liked putting others before me but now I canâ€™t sometimes. Iâ€™m so confused
