Random thought #46? What're some over/underrated games? I'll try to list a few. ALL IN MY OPINION 

Some overrated games

#1 Among us. It was fun for about a week, but it got boring and annoying to play in random lobbies, eg not having a good ruleset and dumb / cheating crewmates. A good game that I'd definitely play more if I had friends to play it with but I think its overrated 

#2 animal crossing. Understand, this is a great game, but unfortunately it gets old quickly. Your villagers say the same things, you can't really terraform your island without it turning out poorly unless you're a god, and even playing with friends can be annoying as some things are restricted if someone is on your island. You can fish and go but hunting but there isn't all that much to do. 

Underrated games 

#1 Probably I'd say Shattered pixel dungeon. A fun top down rouge like where you go around a dungeon managing things like food, health and your weapon charges, and more. Surprisingly difficult for a mobile game with charming graphics and music. I've had it for about a month before I beat it. Four different characters with unique abilities and skills with some having strengths over others. A really fun mobile game you can spend hours on and still not beat

#2 Clank

This one is actually a bored game. You run through lower and upper areas of a dungeon building a deck as you go and defeating monsters, while trying to make as little noise as possible to avoid a dragon. You can find secrets, gems, people to help you along the way, crystal caverns that you can get lost in, and artifact rooms. 
You need to get at least one artifact before you're allowed to leave the dungeon. I could explain more but it's a complex game that'd take awhile to explain. 




That's it for now. I'd think of more but I'll be busy soon so I can't now. Have a good say :)
