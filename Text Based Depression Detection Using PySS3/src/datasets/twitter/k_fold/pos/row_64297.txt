My county's scholar system is a fucking joke In my "state" (not really a state but it's similar) we had a huge snow recently, the biggest one in over 50 years, so we couldn't go to school for 2 days. And because we had 2 days without school, they are gonna just delete 5 holiday days so we can "recover the time lost". I would understand this but the thing is, one of this days is the 8 March, which is the biggest strike day on the whole country and no one goes to school (last year we were less than 100 ppl on a over 1.000 highschool that day) so no fucking time is going to be recovered and the other 4 days are AFTER the grades have been submitted, so what the fuck are we going to recover AFTER the grades????.
But the shit doesn't stop here, on another "state", because of the virus their traditional partys won't happen, but it's still holiday. And the government is trying to make everyone go to class, because, you know, if the party is cancelled, then by logic holidays must be too (altho adults won't go to work because fuck us that's why).

And then they go like "why do teenagers have do much anxiety and depression??" "Why is there so much young people doing vandalism?" Well MAYBE fucking treat us like human beings instead of goddam slaves
