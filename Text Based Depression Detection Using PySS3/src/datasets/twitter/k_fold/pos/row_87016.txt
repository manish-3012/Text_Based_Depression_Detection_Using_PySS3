What would you do if you had Tactile Telekinesis? Tactile Telekinesis is like Telekinesis but you can only affect things that you can touch instead things around you and from afar. 

Better explanation: Tactile Telekinesis is the ability to move objects with the power of your mind by touching them.

Also, it activates as a field of telekinetic energy around your body hence why you can affect things that you touch. 

The field will protect you from damage but itâ€™ll be weak at first as itâ€™ll shrug off small gunfire and getting hit by a truck moving at 45 mph so you should probably develop this power.
