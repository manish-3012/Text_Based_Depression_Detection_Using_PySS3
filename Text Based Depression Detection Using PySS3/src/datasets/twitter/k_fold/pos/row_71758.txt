The following is a retelling of a true story Today I confessed to my crush, and she liked me back! I felt great, and we hung out all day until the evening. Then we went home and cuddled watching Disney+, talking about each other etc. I felt so great and lucky in fact, that I tried my luck out at pre ordering a PS5. And ya know what? I got my hands on one! 

Then my alarm for online schooling woke me up.
