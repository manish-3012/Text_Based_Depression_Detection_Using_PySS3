I enjoy seeing people post about their relationship... Iâ€™ve seen multiple posts saying how they hate that every post is about someoneâ€™s crush or virginity or something. But honestly, I enjoy seeing stuff like that (except â€œvirginity is cool, remain pureâ€, cause thatâ€™s just annoying and nobody actually believes that). I donâ€™t have a gf and reading that stuff makes me happy that people get to have someone in their life other than their family that they have a deep connection with. It also makes me more excited for the day that I do meet a girl that makes me happy. So keep on posting your relationship stories. And to everyone else without a SO, weâ€™ll find someone one day- donâ€™t lose hope.
