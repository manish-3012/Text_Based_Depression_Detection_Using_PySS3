Sleeping is so hard I think I know why I stay up or at least a small part of it. I canâ€™t effortlessly go to bed. I have to lay there thinking about how I need to stop thinking so I can sleep and I canâ€™t get myself to do it. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t force myself to sleep so I can sleep so what am I supposed to do? I donâ€™t even feel sleepy when Iâ€™m supposed to and I wanna just sleep in the middle of the day. I wish I could just close my eyes and then bam Iâ€™m asleep but no I gotta do this everyday and why does it have to be so difficult?
