Give me a second i, i need to get my story straight my friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the empire state. my lover, she's waiting for me, just across the bar, my seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' boutta scar.

So if by the time, the bar closes, and you feel like falling down, I'll carry, you home,

# TONIGHT WE ARE YOUNG! SO I'LL SET THE WORLD ON FIRE, WE CAN GO HIGHER, THAN THE SUN! TONIGHT, WE ARE YOUNG! SO LET'S SET THE WORLD ON FIRE, WE CAN BURN BRIGHTER THAN THE STARS!
