Dont try to play serious shit off as just a joke people So some backround: i broke up with a girl (lets call her S) about 2 years ago. This is because S cheated on me with my best friend. About a year later i get together with my best friend because i still respected her (lets call her C) because she actually told me what was happening. we had some rough patches before splitting. Then a girl i care not for (lets call her A) Calls me, And decides its okay to threaten to kill me. Actual death threats, unless i apologize for something that happened two years ago, i dont even have contact with S anymore, and something that C decided. Timeskip to last night, A Tries to send a "boyfriend application" to me. I brought up that fact that she gave me death threats. Her response was "it was just a joke" even worse, i was already in a rough spot, so i would have taken it if i could. Moral? Dont be a shitty person. Saying it was just a joke doesnt make it better. Dont try to turn things like *death threats* into a fucking joke.

Sorry....i just needed to get this out...
