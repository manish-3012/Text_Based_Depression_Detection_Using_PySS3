Aaa my childhood is getting tore away from me ðŸ˜€ Haha I just realised that I have a strict family that gives me no privacy, and judges my every move. I'm also homeschooled and I got not friends. My childhood is literally getting tore away from me. The only enjoyable part of my life was 2020s summer when my family went to work all day everyday. I could finally have fun and do things that appealed to me. ( dancing, singing, listening to music without headphones, dressing the way that I want) but I also binged in that time period. Seeing as I was even more lonely than before. Im also not allowed to have fidgets, or my own room. I'm literally forced to sleep in the same bed with my mom, and 17 year old brother. I can't wait to move out and become a stripper ðŸ–ï¸
