Update on my last post If you didn't read it, I talked about some rape cases, that a 10 yo is/was pregnant and people wouldn't "accept" her wanting to abort


The raper, her uncle, was finally arrested! I don't know much about it, I only saw a little bit about it, but knowing that he's arrested makes me happy

That's it, thanks for reading and your opinion on the other post
