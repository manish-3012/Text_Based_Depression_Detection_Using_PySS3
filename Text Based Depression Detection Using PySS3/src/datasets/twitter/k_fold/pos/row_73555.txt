Can somebody please interview their parents for me? I have a 9/11 assignment I forgot about Ask them these questions:



1) where were you on the morning on 9/11?

2) what do you remember about the news the day of and the days following?

3) what was the public opinion about 9/11?

4) do you think it changed the world as we know it? If so, how?

5) do you have any other thoughts to add? 



This is due Tuesday (its sunday here), thanks a bunch, y'all! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¾
