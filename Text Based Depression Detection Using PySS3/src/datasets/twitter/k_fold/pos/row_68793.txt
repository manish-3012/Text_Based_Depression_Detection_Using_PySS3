Talking to girls day: 7 morning Alright I'm sorry i haven't made an update in a while but I'll try to be more consistent from now on. Anyway for people who dont wanna read my other post about this basically I haven't talked to girls in 3 years and I'm trying to start talking to them now. I met this girl named emily on Friday and we've been talking on the phone since then and I had doubt she was just talking to me cus she felt bad or something 

Anyway over the past three days I think either she's become more comfortable around me because she seems to wanna share more and she acts alot happier than she did the first few days so that's great however most of this is online and i wanna somehow hang out in person and I have no clue how to invite a girl to hang out in person... help?
