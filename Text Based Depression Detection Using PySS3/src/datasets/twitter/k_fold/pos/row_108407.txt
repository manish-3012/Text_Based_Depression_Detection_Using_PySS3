Is it enough ... ? I have a friend whose his her birthday is like 20 days from now , and her sister is planning to make a compilation vidoe of all of her friends wishing her a happy birthday so I wanted to participate because she is a special friend of mine but I don't know what to say in my part of the vidoe , should I just wish her a happy birthday or should I add something extra ? Is it enough?
