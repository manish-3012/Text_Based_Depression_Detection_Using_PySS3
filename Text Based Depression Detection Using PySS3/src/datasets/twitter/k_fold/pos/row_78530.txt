Using this sub as a diary part 12 Let's just get it over with.  


Today was pretty chill, basically played videogames all day, did some stuff for school, etc.  
Honestly, I'm very comfortable with my work/life balance right now, as I can structure my day more freely because of homeschooling. The only thing missing is social contact.  


Fuuuuuuuck, how I crave to hang out with one of my friends. Not only that, but the self doubt is rising up again. It got better, when I could meet the people I love and notice "hey . . . they like hanging out with me"  


Well, all that progress is for nothing basically, because I'm in my "Everyone hates me, I'm just a burden to my friends, I should just stop trying" mode. My only hope is a meeting with two friends in March, maybe even with a sleepover. By then they are the only people I will have seen in 4 months, apart from my mother and strangers wehn shopping.  
I really hope we can make this work, I feel like I'm going insane.  


And with that happy message to you beautiful people, good night. Hope you manage yourself better in this crisis.
