Just for shits and giggles, what's your most unpopular opinion? I know there is r/unpopularopinion, but I was wondering how our opinions differs based on your age. We change a lot during our teenage years to the point where I carry a set of beliefs that is completely different from me 3 years ago (I'm 18 now). If you feel comfortable also saying your age, I feel it would be interesting to see how differently you see the world. Let's have a friendly discussion and I'll try to reply to all the comments :D
