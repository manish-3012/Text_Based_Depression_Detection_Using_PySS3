Tryina fight my insecurity of my bum Guys Iâ€™ve always felt insecure about how flat my ass looks in jeans to the point where I always wear shirts/hoodies that cover it up. A little bit ago I used this account I never use to post a photo of it to another sub (in jeans, donâ€™t worry) and Iâ€™m feeling hella nervous but excited.odds are Iâ€™m probably gonna get a bunch of creepy dms and take the post down but fuck it. I probably sound so lame rn but I just had to tell someone to calm down a bit haha
