Anyone got a minecraft server? I wanna play a server with some people and just vibe i guess. I'm really bored cause no one will play the server i made because of lag. so anyone got one? preferably a smallish one with like 20 people and updated to the newest version

Thanks :)

Edit: I'm looking for a java server (just to clear confusion)
