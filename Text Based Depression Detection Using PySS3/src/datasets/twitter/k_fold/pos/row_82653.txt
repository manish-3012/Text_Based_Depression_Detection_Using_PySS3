What this subreddit has become For me, the sub has devolved into just a state of absolute loop of handshakes &amp; hugs. There are far too many karma-farm account selling operations, and when you call it out you get downvoted to absolute hell, instead of them realizing that \[the people farming\] taking advantage of a demographic they pretend to be to get fame is disgusting. Some posts are really note-worthy and helpful, like the one that is top right now (I got kicked out at 17), but apart from that, it's just mostly the textureless soup meme format. Honestly I don't care if this is downvoted to hell, because my thoughts will drown in the ocean of semi-noteworthy accomplishments with 150+ awards.

That's my 1 cent on the sub. It doesn't help that there are specific days to post specific things. It restricts the sub by a ton, and honestly the text-post-only days are my worst nightmare.  


I shall now fully conclude this pointless rant with my 2 cents thrown in. Thanks for reading.
