Do you ever call adults by their first names? I don't even call myself by my first name tbh. There's this one guy I work for and he never told me what to call him but I just call him bob and it works. Teachers obviously are Mr/Ms/Mrs/other and at my church everyone calls each other brother and sister, which as weird as it sounds in English (its in Spanish) it really has the same sense of Mr to Ms/Mrs. Anyways, spread some pear love ðŸðŸ &lt;3
