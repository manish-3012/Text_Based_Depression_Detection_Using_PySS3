I'm lost and I lack motivation First post here so yeah go easy.

I'm on the 7th grade 3rd semester currently I have no classes til the 22nd. This online school thing took a toll on me and my grades it took a toll on my mental health and the way I think as well. This whole thing sucks. I was one of the top students on my last school, I always submitted my work on time and get great grades but recently I noticed that has changed I started putting of certain assignments I started procrastinating I started to sleep less and the list goes on. So For 7th grade I moved to a math snd science school and this school is known for raising smart and elite students. I dont think of myself very highly to begin with so obviously I didn't think I'd even pass the entrance exam but yet here I am 3rd semester wondering where i went wrong. I have left over work from the 1st and 2nd semester so now everything is piling up on me and now I'm stressed and under pressure, My parents have high expectations from me and they're really strict so not much I can do. Aside from this online school setup I have also been struggling to find motivation, this is one of the main reasons I started not doing certain assignments. I simply don't see the point in going on when some people my age make mountains of cash by doing youtube or streaming. I don't wanna drop out or anything I just don't know how to tell my parents that I may not make it to the 2nd year on this school for smart kids. I have no idea how to start going about  managing their expectations for me. I feel inadequate.
