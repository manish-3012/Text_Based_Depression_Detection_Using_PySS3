Reasons to Date Me (I'm so perfect) 1) I'm gay so I have limited options and will settle. 



2) I like science. If I talk for too long and you don't take the same classes as me, eventually it'll seem like I'm not speaking english. Even if I am, I talk faster than I should and your eyes will eventually glaze over as you play golf in your head for the next three minutes. 



3) I don't have the energy to be unkind



4) I'm so fucked on the head and everything hurts



5) run



6) I don't have a core temperature. I'm a fucking ice pack



#7) I have a cat. 
She is dangerous though (caused me to collapse unconscious in the kitchen, typed and almost sent a text that would've involuntarily put me out of the closet, nearly broke my dad's foot. 



8) I'm totally ready for a relationship and this definitely isn't a sarcastic point. 



9) you can be a total piece of shit and I probably wouldn't notice because I'm too fucked up.



10) social skills (or lack thereof)



11) keep running



12) people can no longer tell when I'm being sarcastic



Step right up... (Run away faster and avoid eye contact)
