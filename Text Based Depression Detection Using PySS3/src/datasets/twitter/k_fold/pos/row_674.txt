I hope all of you have a very nice day tomorrow and that someone else does something nice for you to make your day brighter That extends to everyone, not just the people who read this post. But if you did read this post, try to be that person that makes someone's day a little better tomorrow. Talk to someone about their interests, invite a friend to hang out somewhere, talk to someone who seems lonely, compliment someone. Even the smallest acts of kindness can make someone's day, so make it a goal to make someone's day tomorrow. It doesn't matter how you are feeling because when you make someone else's day better, it'll also make yours better since you'll know you at least tried to make a difference.
