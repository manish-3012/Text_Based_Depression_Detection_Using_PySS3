my dad didn't schedule my therapy appointment ðŸ˜œ so, I started therapy two mondays ago. mr therapist man was like "hey shawty, come on down every other monday, aight g?" So I tell my dad, he's like "For sure my guy let's make it happen." Last two weeks, felt like shit the whole time, only looked forward to this appointment with a 50 year old man who might not even be able to help me. fast forward to tonight, send padre a text like "yo mr. cool, whats the number on that appointment tomorrow?" He shoots back "tf you talking bout little shit?" and I'm just sitting there like ðŸ¥šðŸ‘„ðŸ¥š

no fucking way

this bitch really said "nah lets not schedule it ðŸ¥°"

he really said "nah I don't have A FUCKING ADMIN WHO SCHEDULES ALL MY FLIGHTS AND MEETINGS, AND WITH ONE TEXT CAN CLEAR MY SCHEDULE FOR THAT TIME SO I CAN TAKE YOU."

now I am SPIRALING.

the boys just hit me up for some good old neckbeard DND, and the whole fucking time I felt like shit and that I was annoying and stupid AND IM PISSED BECAUSE I KNOW THEY LIKE ME AND ITS FUCKING AIDS 

also, over the years I've had a few people DM me like "hEYYYY lets be friends ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜" and don't get me wrong i SUPER appreciate it, but it doesn't help me and honestly makes me feel more drained. i have a great fucking life with great friends and i'm getting help with mental health and i'm getting a fucking dog this week AND MY BRAIN IS JUST BEING A LITTLE PEEPEE PISS BOY SHIT HEAD
