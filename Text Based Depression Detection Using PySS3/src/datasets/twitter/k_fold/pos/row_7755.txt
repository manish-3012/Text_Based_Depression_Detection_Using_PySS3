I don't think I've been this happy for a little while. I haven't brought out my knife at all.
My mind has been clear of my normal anxiety and other negative thoughts and stuff that give me regular breakdowns on discord.soing the happy people on this sub has helped me too. Thank you all.

My knife under my bed that I keep for obvious reason s absent been brought out. It still feels weird to look and hold a knife there's a little urge but I've managed to fight against it.
