On Saturday I'm going out with my crush, whom I have never been face to face with. Since we met through "online college", besides some group zoom calls, we have never been on the same physical space per se.

We've been talking for over 3 months, with some flirting here and there. I was pretty nervous but I asked her if she would like to go out with me.

She lives 50 minutes away and she is coming to me so I'm pretty happy (of course I offered to go to her first, but she insisted).

 Hope I don't fuck it up tho. I can take advice from anyone who has been on some type of situation like this, but mostly wanted to share.
