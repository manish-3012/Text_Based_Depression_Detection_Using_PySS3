10/18/20: the best day online I have ever had I may be childish here because people gave me internet points, but I genuinely love how good this day has been. I went from a simple lurker to 700 karma and 4 awards. IK IK its childish as hell, but today has been one of the best online experiences I have ever had and I thank you all :)
