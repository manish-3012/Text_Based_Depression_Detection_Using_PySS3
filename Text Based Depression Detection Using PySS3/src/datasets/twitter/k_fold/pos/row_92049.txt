This is a very boomer way of thinking but Facebook has really done damage to my parents. Yes, it's facebook's fault that brainwashed my parents. I remember looking up to them as someone I aspired to be, now they're racist and doesn't care about anyone's opinion, including mine. Some say it's the people in the site that made them think that way and not the site, well it's the site's fault for exposing them the stuff that they shouldn't believe.

I want my parents back
