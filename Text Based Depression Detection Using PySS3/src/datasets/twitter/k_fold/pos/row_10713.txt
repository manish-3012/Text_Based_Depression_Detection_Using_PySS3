I've been depressed all fucking week and the thing cheering me up got fucking destroyed I've been feeling shitty, but I started working on a fucking sculpture and I was feeling better but it turns out I was fucking doing it wrong and it fell apart and holy fuck do I wanna throw up. I don't know what to do man. Fuck.
