What the fuck did I just drink??? I was at a private party - 7 people. I knew everyone there. We bought some beers, bottle of wiskey, brandy and some energy drinks. Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend's gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement. We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had ~60â€° alchohol. It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down, nice flavour and I didn't even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily. Got me fucked up in few mins. Realy strong, clean alchohol high. Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it (she did 1 shot and I did 3). Next day I had visual, audio and sensory halucionations - on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something, just like in that moment when we drank this stuff. I thought it was just me and didn't tell anyone but later I saw on my gf's insta story that she had absolutely same things going on - smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face. I am realy weirded out. Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol? We both were on alchohol, nicotine, caffeine and sleep deprived for 30+ h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects. Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it. What the fuck?
