A locked box There once was a locked box, stored up high

I dust-off the top and glistened the sides.

Adorned with black frames, and a pearly white finish

a sight to behold, shall its value never diminish

&amp;#x200B;

The secret it holds, the answer to my questions

My search for reason, an unhealthy obsession.

No matter how hard I try to pry it open

it keeps itself shut, its seal unbroken.

&amp;#x200B;

Days and weeks, the time has passed

I still cling to the hope, that it'll come at last

A certain key that would open this lock

Finding around clues, "Why wouldn't you talk?."

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember that one fateful day,

where everything seemed fine, on my bed I lay.

It seemed like such a short time has passed,

when you closed your eyes, were you at rest at last?

&amp;#x200B;

No one knew the hill you were climbing,

Battered and bruised, there's something you were finding.

But no one came, and no one listened,

I'm certain that what you felt near the end of it all,

isn't what you had written.

&amp;#x200B;

Calls for help, a cry of a final plea,

to revert what you had done, your final decree

But no one heard, and no one came

after which you realize, the world will never be the same

&amp;#x200B;

I burst out into tears, I never had the key

as I quickly remember, you never gave it to me

Gone to the wind, never to return

as I'm stuck with this box, the answers I'll never learn.
