Is it bad that im insecure about not having my car keys in sight... So ive had about 4 cars my last car was a sports car and my dad lost the keys and left the car sitting there for several months and then decided to get new keys and when he did my car never started again (i paid for that car btw) and now i have this new car and my dad went to go get a license plate for it and he took the keys without telling me and the cars still here locked and im practically sitting here shaking feeling uncomfortable as hell because i dont have my keys.
