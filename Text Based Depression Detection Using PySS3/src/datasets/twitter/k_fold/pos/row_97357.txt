Boys, I have an idea So I'm pretty sure that you guys have heard of #killallmen2020. if not, allow me to fill you in. The #killallmen movement was created by toxic feminists (also known as feminazis) that though that all men are evil (which is false BTW.) Anyway, my idea is to take over the hashtag with dank memes. Kinda like how LBGTQ+ people took over #Proudboys, we will take over the hashtag by spam-posting a bunch of dank memes.

So, who wants to help me put an end to #killallmen?
