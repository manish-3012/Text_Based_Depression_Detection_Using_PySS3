My stomach hurts And my guardians are just.. like â€œyouâ€™re fine youâ€™re still going to schoolâ€ and I feel like Iâ€™m either gonna 1. crap myself or my 2. Vomit

I feel like shiiiiit it sucks. Iâ€™ve been feeling sick to my stomach for like, a week or two now.

Any advice on helping stomachaches without meds?
