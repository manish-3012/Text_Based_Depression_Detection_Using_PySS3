Why does anyone want me dead tho? I cant change myself. I cant choose to get over my social anxiety, i cant change i am simply not so good at social interactions... 

I cant change my face. I cant change the fact im small in comparison to the rest. I cant change my fucked up mental health... i cant change all the headaches i get everyday 

I just try to be nice tho...
