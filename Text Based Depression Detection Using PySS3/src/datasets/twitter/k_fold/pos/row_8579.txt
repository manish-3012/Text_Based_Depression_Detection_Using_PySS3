Unlike every other continent North America is relatively stable Probably cuz thereâ€™s 3 military superpowers, two of which have a capitalism boner that wonâ€™t soften until the entire world is capitalist and trading with them, and the other wants to trade with them

Proportionately Canadaâ€™s capitalism boner is just as big as the us, and Mexico just wants to trade
