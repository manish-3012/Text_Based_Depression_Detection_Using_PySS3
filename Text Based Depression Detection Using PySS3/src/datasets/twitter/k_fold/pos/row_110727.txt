Approaching a girl, need advice Okay, so there's a girl (we're both 15 btw) that went to same class with me in elementary school. We were not something like best friends but we often talked and were good friends.Now we're starting high school. We are in different schools and that, combined with covid, could affect on our friendship.

However, some 1 year ago I started to fell something unusual about her, suddenly I havent recognized her as a friend, but as something more. I mean, she is super pretty but that wasnt a crucial thing. For me the personality is a little bit more important and thats why I think I started to feel that in my mind.

I'm pretty shy when it comes to dating, in fact I never dated with anyone so it is strange for me. I think that the best thing to do now for me is to strengthen our friendship, and to call her on "friend date" or smth similar. It should take some time but it is best approach imo, if you have different suggestion please tell me. 

So, my question is: how I should call her on date, should I do it personally (as I said, we will not see each other often) or via message. How to compose my date question, and what to do at that date. Everything is helpful as I never faced with it.
