FUCK THE NEW POPE  *That Argentinian windbag has ruined us! Prattling on and on about the poor... We are the House of God, not a fucking soup kitchen! And what does he do with the golden throne? Replaces it with a WOODEN CHAIR! Probably carved by more poor people. And do not start me on the homosexuals. Oh, if you love them so much, why don't you fucking marry them?! You seem so OK with the concept! And he has the gall to renounce the Old Testament as "mere stories"! "We should be more like Jesus and congregate with whores, and homosexuals, and POOR PEOPLE!" We are the congregation of a wrathful God! We shall begin a new papist succession*
