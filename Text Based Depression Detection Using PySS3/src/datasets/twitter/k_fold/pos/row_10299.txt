Am I in the wrong here? My girlfriend tells her friends she loves them and kisses them. I know she is doing this in a friendly way but this honestly makes me really uncomfortable. Would I be in the wrong for saying something to her about this? I donâ€™t want to seem controlling this just makes me uncomfortable.
