Alright so I have a question Every student was supposed to type in an answer for a zoom class meeting, and I typed in mine which was â€œstrikesâ€.

A bunch of kids put in their answers, and this one girl sent a message to me privately, it was â€œboycottâ€ which was an answer to the teachers question, except it was privately sent to me.

So uh what do you think happened, I donâ€™t think she was trying to give me the answer, but how do you accidentally send a private message to someone. You have to scroll through peopleâ€™s name to send them one.
