I really want my permit but we don't have my birth certificate changed yet, so I'm âœ¨anxiousâœ¨ The name and gender that they use for your permit goes off your birth certificate, and I don't really want my dead name on my driver's permit. Luckily we still have like half a year to get it changed but I'm still super anxious because of it.

TLDR: I'm a trans guy who hasn't gotten his birth certificate changed yet and I'm anxious about my deadname being on my driving permit.
