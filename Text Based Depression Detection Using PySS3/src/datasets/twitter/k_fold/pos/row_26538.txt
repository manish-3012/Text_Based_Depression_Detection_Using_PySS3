Feminine gay men are valid and should not be shamed because of "the stereotype" I saw another interesting post on Netflix representation that prompted me to make this post.

While Netflix is famously bad for its half-baked representation, it's done well in some shows, like Sex Education. The gay side character has his own fleshed out personality and story lines.

However, people still criticised that because he was a feminine, flamboyant character (i.e. stereotypically gay). This made me uneasy, and I would like to talk about both that and a wider problem.

I feel as if homophobia against feminine gay men is somehow more socially acceptable than against masculine gay men. The most egregious example of this is the sentence "I just don't like it when they make it their whole personality." More often than not, this is code for: "I'm okay with them being gay, just not *too* gay." That meme circulating around that is usually well recieved on this sub elevates this to a homophobic extent, basically shaming all gay men who have a certain style or like to express themselves in a certain way.

It's not fair that gay characters are held to much higher expectations than their straight counterparts. There can be the most one-dimensional frat bro or the most forced straight romance and no-one will say anything, whereas if a gay character is even the slightest bit fruity than people will complain about the "forced gay character." It's not fair that in real life gay men are held to certain standards to be accepted into heteronormative society.

We should accept people for who they are, not who they are if they act as straight as possible.

TL;DR it's okay to be a flamboyant gay man even though people are like "whOLe PeRsoNAlity"
