I blame ppl for my actions bc there usually the one to start it They encourage it and whatever and I act on an impulse. Honestly not my fault for beating ppl when they bully me. Like what you expect not to get a reaction. Like ppl tell me to ignore them but that shit don't work mate and I can prove it.

And if I start something without encouragement it is my fault. Besides I'm just menially ill so idk.
