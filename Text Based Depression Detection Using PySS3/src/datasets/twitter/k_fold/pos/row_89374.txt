anyone else met people on Reddit that you couldnâ€™t stand at all I know I waste time and energy thinking about random people but there are two people that I couldnâ€™t have a conversation with it on here. Itâ€™s funny because the majority of people are easy to talk to but talking to those people was like hitting my head against a brick wall. Itâ€™s like they had a completely different way of thinking and we just couldnâ€™t relate at all. As soon as I start thinking that maybe we arenâ€™t so different after all, I just hear people saying all this shit that you have to be crazy to come up with. Or maybe itâ€™s just strange to me because I just wouldnâ€™t think like that
