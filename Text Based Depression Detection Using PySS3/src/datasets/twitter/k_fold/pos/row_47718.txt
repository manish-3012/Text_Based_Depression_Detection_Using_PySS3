Cleaning your night guard or retainer with toothpaste? Stop, please. Hygienist here. I work at a family practice and see teens everyday. Each week I see a teen who got their braces of 6 months before, has beautiful aligned teeth, but a bunch of new, tiny cavities. That's because we fail to teach how to properly clean those retainers!

Because retainers stay in the mouth and on the teeth all night (unless you rip them out in your sleep) any bacteria on the retainer has a happy home to multiply and erode the enamel. When this happens enamel weakens and after enough time creates cavities that need to be addressed.

The dental profession is guilty of not properly training people on how to care for those retainers. If you have a clear cover retainer or a plastic + metal one, this is for you!

Here are some dos and don'ts of retainer care to keep your teeth as clean as they are aligned:

Do

* Brush your teeth twice per day and floss daily. This helps remove bacteria before it gets a chance to sneak onto your retainers
* Use antibacterial soap to brush out your retainer
* Brush your retainer with the soap under warm water until all the soap is gone
* Leave your retainers out to dry throughout the day
* Use anti-bacterial rinse to further disinfect your retainer

Don't

* Use toothpaste. Seriously, DON'T. Toothpastes are abrasive and scratch your retainer. Those small scratches get bigger over time and are an ideal place for bacteria to hide and multiply.
* Put them in the dishwasher. It gets super hot in the dishwasher and after the cycle you'll be scraping that retainer off the side of the dishwasher and it will fit nevermore.
* Soak them in water all day. The room temperature water is basically a petri dish for bacteria.

If you're still reading, thanks for caring about your teeth! Hope you are enjoying that amazing smile, it is well deserved :)
