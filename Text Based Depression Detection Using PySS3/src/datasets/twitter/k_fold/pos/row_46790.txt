Recommending a Metal Album until New Year: Day 3 Today I'm gonna recommend an album from the legendary IRON MAIDEN!

The album that I'm gonna recommend is Powerslave. My favorite album by Iron Maiden. The energy of this album is so awesome. It's not a headbang festival but it is filled with a lot of melodic riffs. Also Iron Maiden's storytelling is so strong on this album. Just great!

This album contains 8 tracks. Here is my favorite and least favorite tracks:

Favorite track: Powerslave

Least favorite track: Back in the Village

This is it. See you tomorrow.
