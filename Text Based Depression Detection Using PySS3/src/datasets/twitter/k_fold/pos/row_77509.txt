wanna be 17 again at first the old men at work were just friendly but now that they know iâ€™m 18 itâ€™s getting uncomfy 

i should just lie abt my age forever. i look younger anyway. which that actually makes it weirder that they talk to me like they do. 

line cooks will just forever be creepy no matter where u work
