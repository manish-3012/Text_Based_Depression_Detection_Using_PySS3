Livestream rant Livestream

I was supposed to join this online field trip (government owned) and I am hyping up the chat because they found a crawfish right, they ban me, so I hop back in to n an alt account and they ban me again, so I do it again and say please donâ€™t ban me then THOSE COMMIE BASTARDS BAN ME AGAIN AND MY TEACHER EMAILS ME AND TELLS ME TO GET OFF LIKE WTF THAT IS A BUSINESS AND A GOVERNMENT OWNED ACCOUNT IT IS LITERALLY ILLEGAL AND SUABLE FOR YOU TO BAN SOMEONE ON A CORPORATE OR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT WHICH IT IS BOTH!!!
