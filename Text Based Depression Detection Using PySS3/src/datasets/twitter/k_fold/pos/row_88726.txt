I just realized... ...that im probably not feeling lonely because im always talking to myself.

Like i see a lot of teenagers here talking about being lonely, but i barely feel like that (and there are almost no people around me). And yesterday i just thought that im probably barely feeling lonely because im talking to myself always. Its like an own world in my mind, with imaginary people and stuff. Its not bad tho, i would never go to a psychologist because of it, its not disturbing me nor annoying me. Im feeling comfortable with talking to myself.

Is anyone else talking to himself a lot?
