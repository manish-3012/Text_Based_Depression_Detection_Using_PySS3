I am but s humble almost adult for some life advice I'm not that active in this subreddit or many at all but I did want to wish everyone a good evening and hope that you all sleep well tonight. I know that school is hard sometimes especially the circumstances that we are in right now so i say stop studying and go do something that you enjoy don't waste your teenage years away. Love all you. &lt;3
