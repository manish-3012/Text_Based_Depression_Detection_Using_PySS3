I was betrayed I thought I had bought with my $1.80 a really nice, filled, berliner. 
First bite: No strawberry filling. 
Second bite: still no strawberry filling
I start to suspect that there was no filling in my berliner
Third bite: No filling
And then finally I realized it. I was betrayed. The filling is a lie!
