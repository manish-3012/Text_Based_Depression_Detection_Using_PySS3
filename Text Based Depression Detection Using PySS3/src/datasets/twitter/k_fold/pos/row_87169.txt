For the people who ever thought of suicide I was just listening to music and this one song reminded me of the time i tried to kill myself. I overdosed the saved me smh. Now i regret even thinking of suicide. someone loves you &lt;3 no one hates you. I found my soulmate, and you will too! We honestly can share personal things that we have never ever thought we would share. Someone loves you &lt;3. I thought no one liked me, i was the nerd, Braces, Glasses, Only passes with A's and occasional B's. Someone will always like you, and loves you&lt;3 and thats a fact. Idk where i would be without you guys. Thanks for everything! Advice, jokes, etc. ily you all! &lt;3. Ty &lt;3
