I think we all need a break Okay... so this is my first time ever posting on this sub, I am 16 years old and have never suffered from depression or anything of the sort so if I sound like an idiot then just ignore this post, also please note I am literally psychotic. So first off I would like to state that in this day and age and especially in this age group depression is a huge deal and is wide spread, I see tons of posts and memes about the topic. I have realized how the modern era has just added more stress to everyoneâ€™s lives. Think about it, back about letâ€™s say 50 years ago depression was a rarity. I think the big reason why depression has become so huge is because of the internet, now iâ€™m not saying the internet is some horrible thing that was made by satan, but it effected everyone in various ways. Letâ€™s face it a lot of stuff in this world is sad and horrific and since we have the internet we just canâ€™t avoid hearing about these things, after all ignorance is bliss! Now you probably donâ€™t want to hear why depression has become so common because thatâ€™s not helping anybody but what I do want you to know is no matter how dark things look, no matter how hopeless it may seem, donâ€™t give up hope. NEVER give up, life WILL improve, it WILL get better. Back to what I said about the internet it might really benefit you mentally if you were to take a break from social media for just a few days. Honestly social media is very toxic and dark so taking a break from it would help, and if it doesnâ€™t or if have tried already and it didnâ€™t work then downvote this post because iâ€™m an idiot. 
Anyways thatâ€™s it seeya!

P.S: if anyone who actually just read my rambling wants to talk about their problems iâ€™ll try my damndest to help, iâ€™m no therapist but I have helped some friends in the past
