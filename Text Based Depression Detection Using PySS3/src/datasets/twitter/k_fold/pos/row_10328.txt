So apparently I have a talent for writing scripts for skits Literally if my friends give me a writing prompt I can write a short script for it and they keep saying itâ€™s really good. All I really have to do is make characters and make the script. The turn-in button on the website my school uses for assignments, so if Iâ€™m done with work I can just write 

Itâ€™s really fun and Iâ€™m thinking of showing the moviemaking teacher some for seventh graders or even sixth graders since theyâ€™re so short (the scripts but there are some small sixth graders-)
