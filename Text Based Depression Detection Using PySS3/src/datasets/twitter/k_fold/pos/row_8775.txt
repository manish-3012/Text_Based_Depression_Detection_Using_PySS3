I just convinced my church pastor that Jojiâ€™s new song â€œlike you doâ€ was a Song about godâ€™s love Weâ€™re going to sing it at tomorrowâ€™s service. 

When he finds out that it wasnâ€™t a worship song and that Joji is actually filthy frank Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to be excommunicated but whatever wish me luck :)
