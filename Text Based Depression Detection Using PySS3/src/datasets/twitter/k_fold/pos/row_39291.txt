My pe class is so unreal I have a genuine question about healthy weight. For example, i am 5'7 and 14 years old male. And my pe class has this chart about healthy weights and stuff. It says ideal weight for me is 99 pounds. I have seen people in my grade 99 pounds a few inches shorter than me and are skinny as hell. I am literally having a hard time believing that this is possible
