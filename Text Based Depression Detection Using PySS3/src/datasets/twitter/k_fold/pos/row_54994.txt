Any facebook connoisseur here? Need your help/advice pls.  

I know it seems weird but I need to send a message to someone, (this is pretty important) however for a certain reason he shouldn't know that this is from me. Idk how I could achieve this so I'm asking for help.

* A good option was to talk to him as my fb page, this way I can stay anonymous but... it's impossible. I need to see him commenting on a public post to contact him as my page and there is no way to find his comments.
* I don't have a second account.
* I already asked to someone I know to help me but he wasn't avalaible

Years ago I remember that there were some sites or somekind of addon who could help you to find all liked posts or comments from a fb user but I think those kind of things doesn't work anymore.

By the way, basically my message is "Bonjour je vous transmets cette information, le client qu'on doit contactÃ© est ace entertainement. Pouvez-vous transmettre cette info dans le groupe de la gazette?" (yeah it's french) etc

Do you have any idea how I could message him anonymously?

thanks for reading
