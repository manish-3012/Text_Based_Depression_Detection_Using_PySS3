i fucked up i thought it would be funny to rickroll my teacher, but she couldn't take the joke and got mad at me, saying that if i do something similar again it will be communicated to the principal. im scared something will happen. and im scared i have a bad reputation now and that people think im like, an asshole. i fucked up. i dont want to have the class clown reputation even though that's the only clowny thing i have ever done.
