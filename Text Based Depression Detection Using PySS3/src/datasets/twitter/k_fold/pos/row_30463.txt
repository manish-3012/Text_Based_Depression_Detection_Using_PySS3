Oop, my friend asked if he think we would be in a relationship if we knew each other in real life. Like damn, I deadass almost asked him that last night. I got really scared so I deleted it. But today we were talking again and he asked me that. 

I was really shocked, but it made me super happy. 

Honestly I'm not really sure what to do now.
