Whenever you complain about anything in reddit, people just assume your a shill 
If i say I hate it when people give awards to ads, people will say "stop asking for awards"

If i say gamer girl posts are annoying, people will say "your just asking for girls to comment"

If i complain about the shitty memes, people will say "your post is just as shit" (that's true)
