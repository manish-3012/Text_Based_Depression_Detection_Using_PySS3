I find the Noah's Ark story kinda funny to think about mainly because I know that there is no way a Hebrew from 3,000 years ago could possibly know of every single animal in existance

so when they start showing up two-by-two you know Noah is definitely seeing skunks for the first time

"God, do I have to bring these things along too?"

**"yes"**

"how many species of skunk are there?"

**"twelve"**
