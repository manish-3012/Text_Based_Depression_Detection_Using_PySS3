Worst things about being a teen. 1. (Dating/Crushes/Rejection) Dating nowadays is rough  especially if your a younger teen dating  can feel more out of peer pressure then of actual love for the other person. Your going to be thru  Puberty  as well as SATS, and you gotta worry about getting rejected. It's hard to ask out your crush, and rejection sucks, but if you don't try asking anyone out you will regret  it for the rest of your life. 
2. School.... School takes a dramatic turn once you enter the later stages of middle school or of high school. Suddenly, every single grade will count towards you getting into college.  As well as waking up at 5am just so you could be ready for your 6:45 bus. 
3.  Puberty . (I'm a male) Well I can't speak much for girls, but I do know that guys have it pretty hard. Let's be honest most of us get horny wayyy to often. Most of us can't go 2/3 days without beating our meat. Another thing that sucks, would have to be getting hard. It sucks getting hard in public and sometimes you can't hide it. It's crazy embarrassing when you go up to the smartboard in math and suddenly get a boner. It's also embarrassing when you need your mom to change the sheets like half the time. 
4. Stress.  Whether caused by school, social obligations, or other things, stress is a part of every all our lives. Finding balance between freedom and responsibilities is the key to making the best out of your teenage years.   
5.  Getting a job. Your 16 and your parent's wont let you sit around the house all summer. You need money, so you begin looking for a job. You find one but sadly it's at the Mc Donald's around the corner. Although it's  humiliating  you need the money so you take the job.
