Iâ€™m having an anxiety attack. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna die So ever since last night the top of my throat felt like it was tight and closing. But itâ€™s not really. I just panicked. I thought itâ€™d go away by morning. But it hasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s throat cancer. I donâ€™t want to die. I canâ€™t stop crying.
