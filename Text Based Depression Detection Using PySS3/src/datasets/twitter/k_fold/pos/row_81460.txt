I feel suffocated i feel like i canâ€™t talk to anyone anymore

my family (besides my mom) are the biggest hypocrites youâ€™ll even meet and everytime i try to vent to one of them about the other, they try to tell me CaLm DoWn iTs NoT tHaTs SeRiOuS. the hell it isnâ€™t.! my dad is verbally and every so often physically abusive, my older sister loves to vent to me about her problems but wonâ€™t let me about mine, my other sister and i just donâ€™t get along and she gets offended super easily. the only person i can vent to is my mom who sometimes looks at me like iâ€™m being over dramatic. sometimes i vent to my mom and she looks at me like itâ€™s a fucking joke. and yes, sometimes the problems are kinda small, but thereâ€™s a shit ton of them. my best friend comforts me but isnâ€™t able to do much bc his parents actually love each other and him and his sister get along just fine. my female best friend comforts me too but still doesnâ€™t have to deal with my shit and always tells me to look to god. yes iâ€™m a christian but god ainâ€™t gonna do shit for me and i know that. yâ€™all need some examples cuz i got plenty

1- my older sister and dad hate when people interrupt them but constantly jut over me and then say SoRrY tO iNtErRuPt and talk about some shit that isnâ€™t even on topic. this one not that bad but it happens like every damn day

2- my dad constantly tells me how worthless and pathetic and disrespectful i am. on top of that he lets me know that iâ€™m gonna grow up to having no friends and everyone hating me. called me on occasions a fat ass (iâ€™m not overweight and barely that heavy, while heâ€™s over weight by like 10-12 lbs) and a piece of shit and disrespectful little shit that doesnâ€™t appreciate anything i have.

3, respect your elders!- my dad is constantly telling me that i need to respect him bc heâ€™s my father, but he refuses to give me respect. he constantly yells at me and is getting on to me over the smallest fucking things and says he deserves it when he doesnâ€™t

4- marks. literal red marks. he hits me so hard whenever he does it leaves red marks through my clothing, as well as whenever i start to cry bc heâ€™s being such a dick he starts yelling at me for crying

5-my family (besides my mom, again) is just so self centered on their own problems that they just donâ€™t think twice about mine. not that iâ€™m selfish about it, but i have a lot of mental issues like OCD and SPD which arenâ€™t too severe but itâ€™s enough to make me have breakdowns

in conclusion, turning to fellow teenagers seems like the best thing to do. i feel like i can talk to no one iâ€™m close to. i get all of the verbal abuse out of my three siblings. my sisters only get yelled at whenever theyâ€™re being extra rude or whiny. my dad is constantly yelling at my mom and being a total dickhead and then the next day acts like nothing happened. same drill with me. and everytime he blames it on HIS mom, who treated him like that. but then he claims weâ€™re lucky heâ€™s not like her but he is. 

hereâ€™s another example for my mom and dad

mom- is crying in her bathroom because my dad just yelled at her after insulting her harshly bc she â€œruns a kitchen differentlyâ€

dad- claims it was to make him look bad so refuses to apologize

me and sisters- force him to apologize

dad- goes in there and starts bitching again, wanting an apology from her

mom- doesnâ€™t apologize, bc she did nothing wrong

dad- gets angry, insults and raises voice. apologizes a fake sorry and said yOu WiN aRe YoU hApPy? YoU aLwAyS hAvE tO WiN.

dad- storms out of bathroom â€œwell iâ€™m sorry you canâ€™t apologize properly!â€

my dad thinks itâ€™s always a win lose thing, and never admits to being in the wrong, actually glorified how right he is all the time once

iâ€™m so sry this is so long and badly written. iâ€™m so distraught and angry that i just had to get it partly off my chest. if u read all the way through, thank you.
