Mental health issues I recently got into a big fight with my parents and accidentally lost control. After things heated up I started punching my dad and things got messy.

We argue a lot about my mental health and they think its best if they take away my computer. I donâ€™t have any friends or people to talk to, so the pc is my only option. 

I havent had it for five weeks and im starting to go insane. Talking only leads to fighting and theres no way out. They dont seem to understand that Im feeling worse. Im just really tired of not being able to do anything.
