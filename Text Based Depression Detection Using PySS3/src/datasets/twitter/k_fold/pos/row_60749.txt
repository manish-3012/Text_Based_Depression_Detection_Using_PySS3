I BEAT GETTING OVER IT!!! After (according to steam) 5.4 hours, I have FINALLY completed it. After everything, all I have to say is...

Bennett Foddy? More like Bennett Fuckboi, like for God's sake could you not have made that one jump with the anvil easier and not had to have added a literal jumpscare in for if you don't complete it in under 10 minutes? (yes it's real, look it up) Oh and also that jump from the rocks to the icy slope before that; could you not have made that just a slither of a bit less impossibly hard? Oh, and not to mention the literal mouse acceleration BUILT INTO THE GAME, which really doesn't help the many times my character has thrown himself off of a really hard jump because the camera can move your mouse without you doing anything.

But for real this time, thanks Bennett for creating a wonderful torture device that I loved, and hated, every moment of :)
