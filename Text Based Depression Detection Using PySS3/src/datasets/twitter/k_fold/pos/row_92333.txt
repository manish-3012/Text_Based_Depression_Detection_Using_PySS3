Google meet So my school decided to switch from zoom to google meet from online classes and let me tell you that google meet sucks. I can't hear properly. Screensharing takes so long and when it does happen it's mostly blurry. Like why are teachers using this app it sucks. The same problem occurs to not only my class mates but also the teachers. Honestly i think zoom was only better but i guess they had their reasons for switching to google meet.
