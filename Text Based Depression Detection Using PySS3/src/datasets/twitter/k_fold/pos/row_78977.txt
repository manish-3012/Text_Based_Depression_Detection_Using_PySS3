Today is the day I realized no one gives a shit No one gives a shit about my feelings. No one gives a shit about my mental health. No one gives a shit about my opinion or what I think. No one gives a shit about my struggles. No one gives a shit about my interests. Not even my closest friends who, when I tried to reach out to them for help, all decided Iâ€™m not worth the time of day and didnâ€™t bother to reply to my messages
