There's so many stories I've heard about guys having their phones accidentally pointed at children (which they were just using their phone, taking a selfie, etc) and then people accusing them of being a pedo and taking pics of kids. And then they call police without proof, that shit is sickening. Like they have to show their camera gallery to the police. I would be so scared I have pics of myself nude and hentai on my phone lmao.
