iâ€™ve never had real friends until high school before high school i had no real friends because everyone at my school before was not people i wanted to be friends with. they were racist and made fun of me for being mexican. there was only one good person from there so high school is like the first time iâ€™ve actually had a legit friend group but iâ€™m still an outcast. kinda sad because i see all these people who are really good friends and have known eachother for so long and thereâ€™s me who has friends iâ€™ve known for only a year other than one person i went to school with pretty much my whole life but we donâ€™t hang out much. i donâ€™t really care much because i like to just focus on myself and be by myself because itâ€™s what iâ€™m used to and i donâ€™t want any one to turn on me like the people at my old school so i keep my circle small anyways
