ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ Random Antarctica Factoid #31 ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ There's a lot of diamond dust in Antarctica, it's not literally made of diamonds though. Diamond dust, also known as ice crystals, is caused by water vapor in the air condensing to form ice crystals. These crystals hang in the air and when the sun shines on them they sparkle like diamonds. Diamond dust is what causes halos, light pillars, and sun dogs as well. Which are all cool optical phenomena in Antarctica.
