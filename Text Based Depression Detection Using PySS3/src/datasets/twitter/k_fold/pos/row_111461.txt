Is accidental simping possible? I have been chatting with this girl for quite some time now, and for long periods of time right. We have  become quite good friends and playfully flirting with each other.   
One of the things we do is playing ludo online.

We played with mutual friends, and today, I accidentally let her win. It was in the endgame, and I mislooked the piece of her's that I could have taken, and she proceeded to win.

It was an accident, I swear. 

So anyways, the previous game I destroyed her, and didn't let her win, and when she complained to me, I said I would let her win, and today, the events that took place led me to let her win.

So fellow teenagers, did I accidentally simp? I might add that I am very competitive, and have owned up to her that I let her win by mistake.
