Hello fellow Reddit addicts! I have a challenge for you So, i'm gonna do an experiment with myself. 31 days, no Reddit. For the entire month of December i'm not going to use reddit and i invite you to do the same. Now if you aren't as much of a Reddit addict as me you can just move on with your day. This post is tailored for the procrastinating, lazy and gets nothing done cuz they on Reddit all day types. If that's you i invite you to go do something else than Reddit for a month.

Reddit Free Spree (RFS) is what i've called this challenge. The rules are as followes:

\- Absolutely NO [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) or Reddit app. No form of scrolling Reddit is allowed

\- You are allowed to recieve memes from friends and search up memes yourself. But going on Reddit is stricly forbidden

\- The challenge starts at 12AM or 00:00 in your timezone December 1st. And ends when the new year starts

\- If a friend send a reddit link, that is also forbidden. You must keep off this website

This challenge is like NNN, where the goal is to resist the urge of going on Reddit. So more about self control than a punishment. If you are interested but have no idea of what to do with your new free time, heres some ideas:

\- Read a book

\- Hang out with friends

\- Try to learn a new skill (Instrument, cooking or somethin like that)

\- Exercise

\- Spend time with familly

\- Play a sport

Thats just some examples of the top of my head. If you wish to join this challenge i will be posting a follow up post in 2021 about my experiences and things ive done. For thoose interested i request you post your story in the comment of said post. If anyone is interested i would love to hear what youve done with your extra time.

Remember im not forcing you into anything. Its just a dumb challenge for others like me.

(Btw im not THAT good at english, so if there are any grammar errors that is expected. And i dont bother changing them if they are pointed out lmao.)
