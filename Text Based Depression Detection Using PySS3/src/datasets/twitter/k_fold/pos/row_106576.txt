This was a weird realization So one day I just started thinking about the future and decided hey I wanna be a father. Which is weird as I usually hate kids but just the process of them growing up sounds like a life I would like to live. Waking up every 3 hours to feed the child as a 2-6 month old. And then raising to be a proper man/ women/ anything they feel like being. Then seeing them go about their life seems wonderful.
