My friend Loves ME and makes me Uncomfortable I hate that I'm making this post

So hi everyone, I need help.  
My friend recently came out as bi (very cool I support).  
I'm the only one he's told it to, 'case I'm bi myself and ofc I support him all the way.  


That's NOT the problem, the problem is that he also loves me.  
Well not exactly, it's the way he expresses it.. and it makes me reaallly uncomfortable...  
**e.g.:**  


* he calls me "Daddy"...  

* he asks for nudes  

* he..demands nudes  

* he says he wants to f- me or me to f- him.  

* he wants to "massage my ass" and "put cream on it"  

* he wants to sleep at my place for miscellaneous reasons..  
\-  

* When I made a sims 4  family consisting of me and my best friends, he always told me to make our sims fuck.  


A friend of mine had the same save file, (I sent it to him) and the guy that loves me told him to make our sims fuck, all the time... and he did, not knowing why just thinking it was a joke...  


And now the most recent event.  
He changed his pfp on what's app, to which I sent a  "thumbs up" emoji.  
He then proceeded to say how hot he looked in the picutre..  
and then asked if I'd smash him like that.  
I said no, (duh)  
and he now wants to know why..  
He looks good, but he's not my type at ALL!

also the BIGGEST issue, ***I'M DATING SOMEBODY ALREADY!!!*** But I don't want ANYONE to know...   


I told my bf and he has no idea what I should do...  
*Helllpppp!*
