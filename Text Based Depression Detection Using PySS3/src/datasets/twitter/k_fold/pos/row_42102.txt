What is the word/phrase that means you're doing something that is on the edge of crossing the line? Like if there is a rule to "not cheat" and you did something that is debatable cheating, or if a rule is to "be respectful" and you do something that could be disrespectful or not depending on interpretation? I'm writing an essay and drawing a blank... I know there's an idiom for this 

I thought it was "toeing the line" but google says it is not.
