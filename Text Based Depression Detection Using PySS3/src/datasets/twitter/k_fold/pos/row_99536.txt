Went back to school , everything is normal , however .... So basically Iâ€™m a teenager in England . Going in to year 9 - 8th grade or something I think for Americans . Now weâ€™ve not seen each other for 6 months so there is a bit of a change . I go over to my friends - everyone is suprised Iâ€™ve grown about 2.5 inches . I speak to them and everyone is giving me funny looks . Iâ€™m wondering if itâ€™s a prank or something and theyâ€™re pretending not to hear me , eventually my best mate says â€œholy shit your voice has changed â€œ . I was pretty bewildered as I canâ€™t notice much of a change in it . That was only the start . EVERY SINGLE BLOODY PERSON I talk to says Jesus youâ€™ve grown and has the same reaction about my voice . EVEN THE TEACHERS give the same reaction . Just thought Iâ€™d put it out there because I think I havenâ€™t changed that much Jesus , quarantine mustâ€™ve really changed me
