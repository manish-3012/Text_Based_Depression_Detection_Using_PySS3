Y'all church is fucking wild... *Disclaimer: I'm not hating on religion, it's just I've been to church like 2 times in my life*

I had to go to a funeral (for someone I only met a few times) and they're like, super catholic.
It was so strange, I had no clue what the fuck was going on the whole damn time. 
The holy water thing where you go "In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" was basically all I knew.
And people just SAY THINGS. Seemingly unprompted. How do they know what to say? And when? Whole paragraphs were just quoted out of nowhere. 
&gt; "May peace be with you"
&gt;"And with your spirit" 
HUH? And the priest had a *thick* Indian accent, so I had no clue what he was saying most of the time.
Also, why the fuck do we stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down all the damn time?  We prayed like 8 times in a 45 minute span. 
I also didn't know the communion took that long. They have to bless EVERYTHING. And everyone got up except me. 

I felt so uncomfortable the whole time... I'm just glad we were wearing masks so no one could see that I didn't say a single word. I honestly don't know how people can do something like that every Sunday. 

*TLDR- I went to church for like the 3rd time in my life and was very confused*
