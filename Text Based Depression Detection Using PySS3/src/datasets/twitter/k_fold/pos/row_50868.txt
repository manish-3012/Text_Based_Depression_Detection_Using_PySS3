My High School (Long) So, I started HS today. However I have a big problem. So , the school system works with borders . That means that an area with one HS will go to the HS since it is in borders of it. For me though. I was exactly  on the border and I went to school which I was not signed [in.](https://in.How) How did it began , let me explain. So in June I singed for the school which was on the other area but closer to me . (I sent it by email.) I did not receive an answer hence my father went to ensure that I was signed there, they said yes. I went there they said that I did belong there  and belonged to the other school. In conclusion I am in a weird situation. Almost all my friends went there and now I only have 1 . I feel sad and mad because I was given false hope until yesterday.
