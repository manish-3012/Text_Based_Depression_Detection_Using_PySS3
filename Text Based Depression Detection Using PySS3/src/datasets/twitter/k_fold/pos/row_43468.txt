Australians be like: Righto mate, we're goin' for a Macca's brekky run, then off to Nandos for a feed, cos mumâ€™s cooked sausi rolls for dinner and they're rank. Don't forget, we need to stop at the servo for some durries, but avoid the Tulla cos it's chokkers at 6 p.m. and nothin' winds me up like c\*nts on the freeway
