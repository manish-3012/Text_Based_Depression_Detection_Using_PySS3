My Life Goal As I sit here in my room I realize that this is life, a thought passes into my mind. Life is short I want to smoke a blunt with a monkey. This is what I want in life. I have probably a good 65 years left in my life and at least once in that I time I just want to smoke with a monkey. Thatâ€™s it. A chimp, a little capuchin or something. Like thatâ€™s it. A blunt and a monkey. Is there anyone else out there who shares my one aspiration.
