So... kinda funny story So yesterday I was waiting for the bus on a bus stop and then a car pulls up to the bus stop and rolls down the window, there are 2 girls inside that I don't know, they were like 19 maybe 20 and they said to come to them so I go and they asked if I wanted them to drive me home and me being a good 14 year old said no (because everyone always said not to get into cars with strangers) and now I'm just wondering what would happen if I got into the car.
Thanks for reading!
Have a nice day
