I did something I never thought I would do. For years, I never wanted to go to college. I didn't think it was necessary. I started recently thinking about wanting to live on my own comfortably and decided I would apply to a college. Currently, I'm going to a career school for culinary. I decided to apply to one of the top 10 culinary schools in my state and this morning, I was told that I'm accepted! I haven't been this proud of myself in a while and I think that I'm actually able to move forward in my life!
