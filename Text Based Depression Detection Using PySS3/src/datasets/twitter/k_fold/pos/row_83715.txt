My crush deceived me. my english is bad lol

I met a really good girl. She was beautiful and she had an awesome character. She was my crush since 2 months. One day we went to my house to talk. I didnt know what were we going to talk about, so i was a bit stressed. Both of us were stressed, so we just sat on my bed for like 15 minutes and didnt say a word. I layed on my back, looked up at the ceiling and closed my eyes. Somehow, she was sitting on me and looking at me with a small smile. She were penetrating me with her beautiful eyes. I said to myself "frick it. What could go wrong". Sudeelny we started  kissing. It was my first time french kissing tho so i wasnt really good at it, but she said It was great. We both agreed that a relationship Has just started and i was soooo happy to hear that from her mouth. Both of us had a good time with each other kissing and hugging. One month later she called me and said that she breaks up with me. She said that she thought that she loved me but she was wrong. I was really sad. A week later my friend told me that she had a relationship with me just so i wouldnt interrupt her. I got so angry that i punched my pillow so hard that It just broke lol. I really want to talk to her. I want to tell her that i truly loved her and i was treated like garbage. I want to say that nobody should be treated this way and everyone deserves to be truly loved.

Have a wonderful day.

I'll find a better one.
