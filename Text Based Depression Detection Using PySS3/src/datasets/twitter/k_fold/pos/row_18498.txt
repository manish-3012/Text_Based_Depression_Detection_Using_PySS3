I would like a friend. I dont really mind who you are! I just constantly feel incredibly lonely.

I would ask for a friend who is a girl (as I never talk to girls) but I feel like that would be weird/creepy and I don't want to be seen as that...

So does anyone want to be my friend? Or does anyone have any advice on making friends.

Thankyou. :)
