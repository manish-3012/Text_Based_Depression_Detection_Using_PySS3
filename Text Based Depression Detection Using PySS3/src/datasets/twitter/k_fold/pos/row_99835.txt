Hey you, yes you, and anyone else reading this, I really really really need your help. I am trying to find an old friend who I lost contact with but I know is on this sub. I have been trying for so long now but I somehow have still not lost hope yet. I really need you to help me get her to see this. I really donâ€™t care about the karma from this I really only want this post to make it to hot just so she will see it. I am going to add a comment for you to downvote so that I will lose just as much karma as a gain from this, to prove that I donâ€™t care, because I donâ€™t want you to hate me for that.

I do not want to say much personal info about her so I will say probably the least personal thing I could think of that will still (probably) narrow it down to one person: She has a shrimp that she named Bernie Sanders because it looks like him.
