I need conversation topics to try to talk to my crush okay, so iâ€™ve only talked to him a couple of times and itâ€™s been about an inside joke we have about a gorilla pit, population control that type of thing. I feel like iâ€™m dragging it out now but I donâ€™t know what else to say. I want to be funny but it be like a topic I could mention often, please help. My usual go to is planning world domination together but seems a little early and hard to go for. Weâ€™re in band together and like politics/have the same political views. So far, Iâ€™ve tried making fun of a mutual friend and something else idk iâ€™ll edit this when I remember. I know that him not reciprocating this probably just means he doesnâ€™t want to talk to me but I donâ€™t care even if itâ€™s just as friends I need someone to talk to in that class. This is the cringiest thing iâ€™ve ever done but oh well i guess I need help
