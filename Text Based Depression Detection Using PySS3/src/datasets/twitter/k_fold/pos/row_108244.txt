apparently 69% of americans age 18-24 canâ€™t find the united kingdom on a map, and 11% canâ€™t identify the united states on a map idk whatâ€™s more depressing

59% couldnâ€™t find japan, 29% couldnâ€™t find the pacific ocean, 65% couldnâ€™t find france, and less than 15% could locate iran, or Israel (thatâ€™s the people that only located iran + the people that only located israel + the people that located both) 

if ur a french or british person ur probably feeling superior right about now. 24% of the french people surveyed in that study didnâ€™t know their own fucking country has nuclear weapons, 8 in 10 brits canâ€™t identify germany on a map, 1 in 10 canâ€™t identify ireland on a map, and 71% of brits were oblivious to the existence of Liechtenstein 

now iâ€™m going to remind the americans that 11% of them canâ€™t identify america on a map just so they donâ€™t forget about that and start feeling superior
