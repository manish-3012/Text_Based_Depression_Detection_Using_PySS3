Invitations to parties outside your own school  Hey teens,

So I have moved cities during the pandemic because my parents decided to send me to a private school for smart kids, (in no way am I calling myself an einstein here I just happened to get in). I come from a suburban town so everyone knew everyone thus I managed to get invited to a few parties last year despite me being pretty average and not really popular. Basically what I learned is there are rarely any parties at this new school that I go to and since I'm in a new city I don't know any kids in other schools yet. Once COVID restrictions are dropped, does anyone know a way that I could be invited to parties outside of my own school?
