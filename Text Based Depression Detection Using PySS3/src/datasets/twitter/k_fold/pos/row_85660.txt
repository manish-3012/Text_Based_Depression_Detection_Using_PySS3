Election update I didn't sleep last night because I was closely watching AP and NYTimes election coverage to make these predictions:

*Based on AP from 10:50 11/4/20*

**Biden wins Mi, Wi, and NV for a total of 270 electoral votes**  

**Trump wins PA, NC, PA, and AK for a total of 267 electoral votes**
