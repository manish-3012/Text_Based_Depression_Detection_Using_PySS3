I have a fever. Here is what I have done. I have had a fever ever since I came home from a BSA camp out this morning.  In that time I have played an hour of Portal 2, along with 1 1/2 hours of persona 4 Golden.  I have watched 16 episodes of the legend of korra, with 4 episodes of the dragon prince and 1 hour of homework. I am content.
