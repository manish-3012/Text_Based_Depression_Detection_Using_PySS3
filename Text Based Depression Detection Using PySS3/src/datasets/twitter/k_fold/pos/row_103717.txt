Tv Is Underrated In a world where we have Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Disney + and many others. We have options, so many in fact that sometimes we simply don't know what to watch or feel too lazy to pick something to watch.

The Tv doesn't have this inconvenience.

The Tv will pick what to watch for you. In fact, everything on Tv is designed to be as easy and brainless to watch as possible so you can totally relax if you have some time to spare.

Some might say that everything on Tv is garbage, and, they might be right. But that would be just pointless elitism because, come on, do you really watch "Intelectual" content all the time? You never watch dumb stuff like a racoon eating grapes? Come on man.

Next time YT, Netflix, etc fails you, just go to your living room, say "Hi" to your family and turn on the Tv.
