When you're suicidal and also a procrastinator Yeah i really wanna kill myself. Like, i have nothing to live for and i decided that ages ago.
BUT
I don't feel like getting up from the couch and filling up the bathtub and bringing razors and worry what will happen if i survive.
maybe tomorrow. Yeah. Definitely tomorrow.
*the same thing happens tomorrow*
