I tried to do the best for my GF and almost died in the process So some backstory. Growing up I never knew my father and some circumstances at a very young age made me had to move away from my mother. As such I got transferred to a different very religious school which was very serious about relationships. My foster family was the same. 

Anyway a little while ago me and my foster dad had to do a favour for the head of the place. Got to know him. Super chill guy. He seemed to be a bit iffy on the place being so religious and said that more aspects of life should be studied. Which I agree with. 

Now something that I've been keeping a secret from pretty much everyone in my life up until this point is that I actually have a girlfriend. The reason I kept it secret is because I'd get into deep shit if they found about it. And even deeper if I found out I got her pregnant.

So recently I was talking to the head in private. I think he knows what's going on with me. He mentions that I could do some things to help her out but it would go against the school and my foster family. 

Which brings me up to now. My foster dad found out about it and what I've been doing. We had a huge fight. We ended up surrounded by lava on platforms getting pushed around on top of it and at some point he got the high ground. I said fuck it I can beat him. I jumped up and he fucking sliced of 2 of my legs and my arm with his fucking lightsaber. I hate that bitch now. 

Luckily the head finds me lying there almost dead and gets me to his place. Gives me a new arm and legs and gives me some dope ass armour. I'm listening to this guy now, fuck Obi-Wan. I had to ask him though "Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she alright?"
