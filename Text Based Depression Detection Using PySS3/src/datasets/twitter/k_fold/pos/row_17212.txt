Dear bi, tri, and quadrilingual people: Do other languages have this 'intentional misspelling' in the writing? Like for example, in English we intentionally type yes as yah or just ye, no as nah, not gonna lie as ngl, to be honest as tbh, and we even literally sometimes type "hmmm" to someone when we're thinking (or at least that's what I do). There are WAY more examples but I don't know them. Do other languages at least do these?
