Don't buy wireless. headphones I bought a pair of wireless xiaomi headphones with my money I had saved up (20$) and ever since I bought the wifi in my house been getting fucked up. The second I connect them to my phone the wifi goes out for the whole family. Piece of shit headphones. I could have bought something to eat instead and it would have been more worth it. fucking waste of money.                                   Edit: my wifi went out while writing this. Fucking hilarious.
