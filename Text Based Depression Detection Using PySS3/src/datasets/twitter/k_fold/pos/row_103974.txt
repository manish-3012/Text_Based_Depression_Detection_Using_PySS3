Why am I forced to be afraid of COVID? If I don't want to wear a mask at school that should be my choice. It's more likely that I have already had it (and haven't noticed it) than it is that I'm going to get it. I'm not going to spread it to anyone else. COVID is no longer any more deadlier than a flu or cold,  we don't cancel schools or wear masks for those. I'm so tired of society being turned into an orwellian prison just bc of politics.
