How do I be more confident in starting conversations? There is a girl I like but I hardly know her, so far I just like what I've seen and heard so far but I want to get to know her better. I also want to get to know lots of other people because I have been feeling really lonely lately but I feel like everytime I talk to people they think I'm either hitting on them or they think I am weird and leave. I hate this feeling.
