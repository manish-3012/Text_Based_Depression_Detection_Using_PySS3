hey music question for anyone who knows anything abt latin american music/rhythms so i really like the beat and the rhythm of Body Language (Intro) by Kali Uchis. i know it's not bossa nova but i don't know what style of music it is. i really like it though and i'd love to find more like it, so if anyone has any recommendations or anything, please tell me!!
