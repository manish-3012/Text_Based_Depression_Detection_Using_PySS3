I'm a depressed sheltered kid I live in a group home where I have been abused and overprotected from innocent shit yet when I tried complaining they wouldnt believe me. I have no friends and no hobbies and no conenction with family and food is the only thing i enjoy in life and its making me fat and even more depressed. I tried seeking out help from a psychologist but shes taking forever, especially over Christmas period. I want to run away but its lockdown, my library books are therefore unreturned, and i have a huge book and vinyl collection in my bedroom. All i wanna do is just do drugs, then die. My life goal is to do drugs. I dont wanna die a drug virgin. Im really curious and highly enthralled by drugs. Someone please help.
