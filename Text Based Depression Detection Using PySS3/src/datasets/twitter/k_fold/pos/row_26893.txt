all of my memes have been deleted for nearly 2 years I have been collecting memes from Reddit and screenshotting them onto my phone to share with other people and today I went to not my phone and all of my screenshots were gone. on my photos app, there wasn't even a folder for screenshots. does anyone know how this could have happened? i went to my recently deleted and they weren't there and I have not backed them up onto iCloud in some time
