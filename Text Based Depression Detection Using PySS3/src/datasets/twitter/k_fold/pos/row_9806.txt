A little story When I was around nine years old or so, I was angry for some reason and drew a character saying the word "fuck". My parents, however, weren't very happy about that and took my drawing and placed it on a shelf they thought I couldn't reach. When they had fallen asleep I snuck out of my room, grabbed the drawing, shredded it to pieces and burned it in the fireplace to eliminate all evidence of me having drawn it
