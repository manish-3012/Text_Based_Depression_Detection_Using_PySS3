are my friends shitty or am i expecting too much? my grandma got diagnosed with brain cancer a month ago. because of her age she decided to not go through with surgery so we had no if it was terminal, what type of tumour, how the tumour started etc. her condition has deteriorated very fast and a few days ago the doctors checked up on her and presume she has a few weeks left to live. obviously my whole entire family was very upset and today i told my friend groupchat the news and only one of my friends replied. i'm really upset by this but idk maybe i'm expecting too much.
