So my dad has a golf R and a new Porsche gt4, and funnily enough he gets challenged at red lights a lot more in the golf than in the Porsche. He's got a stage 1 ecu on the Golf R, and an aftermarket clutch and downpipe. 0-60 in 3.4s.

Everyone thinks it's just a shitty golf and he just blows all the mustangs and challengers away 

Meanwhile everyone thinks the gt4 will smoke them in a race, while in reality, it "only" does 0-60 in 4.2 seconds lol.

I think it's funny how much people underestimate the golf
