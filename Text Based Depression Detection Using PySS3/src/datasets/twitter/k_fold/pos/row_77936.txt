It sucks being rejected but even worse When you build an amazing friendship with a girl Then confessing after being or at least thinking you were amazing friends for years and and she rejects you in a horrible way like ok sure you reject me Its fine but donâ€™t treat it like a joke donâ€™t treat my feelings like a joke like wtf a rejection hurts it will always hurt but you treating it like itâ€™s stupid and and being mean about it is gonna make it 10x worse 


FYI: if you are gonna reject someone take it seriously donâ€™t treat their feelings like a piece of trays you can just stump on and throw away be firm but nice about it please
