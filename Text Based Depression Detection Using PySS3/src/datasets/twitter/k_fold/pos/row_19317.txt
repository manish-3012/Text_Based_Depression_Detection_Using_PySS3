Straight guys are so fucking confusing Best friends = usually males

Which means they get along with males better

*DaTeS a GiRL inSteAd* who he doesn't even fucking know and doesn't really like but just wants to use her as a token to say he has a girlfriend and then it doesn't work out and he wonders why

Like that shit is so dumb like I would just date someone who's my friend so it would work out...........................
