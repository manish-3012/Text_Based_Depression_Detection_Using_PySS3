Just failed 2 classes for the first time. I donâ€™t know how to feel about it. A little overview, I just failed 2 classes for the first time in my life. Iâ€™m a junior and my sophomore and freshman year I had a 3.6 GPA unweighted. My school district hasnâ€™t reopened and so weâ€™re doing virtual and itâ€™s just not for me. Itâ€™s been really hard for me to find any motivation and I just got below a 50% in 2 of my classes. I had plans for my future but theyâ€™ve been squashed due to COVID but now I will have 2 Fs in my record. I feel like such a big ass disappointment. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™ll get into university. Iâ€™m bracing myself for the day my parents will start yelling at me and belittling me like the Asian parents they are. This is kind of a vent/rant but if you guys have any advice about how I could improve my grades. How does summer school or credit recovery work? Any advice would help a lot.
