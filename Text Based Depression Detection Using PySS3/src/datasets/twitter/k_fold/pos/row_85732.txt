What's a good alternative to instagram to post art online? I posted art on instagram for a year or so, then I had to take a break for my mental health. The thing is that I really want to post again because I miss it, but instagram's new algorithm is really bad and people have been losing followers everytime they post. Lots of artists are taking breaks, or even leaving the platform. Reddit is a nice place, but I won't really get a following there. Any idea where I could post?
