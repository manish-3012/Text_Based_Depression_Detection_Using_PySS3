I think I might be depressed but Iâ€™m not sure I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me and I just want tot be able to put a label on it so I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m just a weirdo anymore. Iâ€™ve started crying a lot more. I donâ€™t answer my fiends until the last minute because Iâ€™m tired and donâ€™t want to talk. During the summer I would stay up late and then sleep in late. Now I donâ€™t stay up as late, because I have school. Iâ€™m always either busy or on my phone. If I have free time I go on my phone or make myself busy with chores and stuff. I seem to get annoyed over the smallest things. For example, today I couldnâ€™t find a pair of shoes and I started tearing up because I had to go soon. A fricking pair of shoes. Who does that?! And the thing I do most is invalidate my own feelings. Whenever I feel like I genuinely might be depressed, I tell myself â€œStop doing that. Thereâ€™s people who have it way worse then you and youâ€™re crying over that?! Shut up. Youâ€™re fine, just dramatic.â€ I feel really stressed about small things too. Can someone with depression tell me if these are just normal teenage things? Or are they signs of depression. Should I tell my parents? Iâ€™m probably being over dramatic and need to shut up lol. Itâ€™s just part of growing up most likely. I know Iâ€™m going to get downvoted into oblivion for being so dramatic, but any advice would be helpful. Thanks.
