So one of my old friends (ye we stopped talking I didnâ€™t see him for like 4 months I consider that as on â€œoldâ€ friend) So one of my old friends just told me he liked me and that he never stopped liking me and idk what to do because at the same time I feel kinda flattered but I still wanna be friends with him even tho he said we couldnâ€™t be friends anymore because he liked me more 
Anyone got some adivve for me ?
