I feel so grumpy and partially sad I donâ€™t want to see my mom (personal reasons, more on that in my older posts). We have another lesson thatâ€™s going to be at least 1 hour long. Iâ€™m so horny, yet I donâ€™t want to be.

Only things that make me happy is drawing my fursona, watching yt vids, listening to music and being unproductive in general.
