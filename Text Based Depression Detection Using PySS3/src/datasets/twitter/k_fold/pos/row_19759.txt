I worry way too much about others (family) and often forget to work on myself. I considered Quarantine as a pause for EVERYTHING.
Before Quarantine i had finally made friend with â€˜the cool kidsâ€™ at my school (not as cool as you would think)
I got lots of school responsibilities that benefit me. 
Found my signature style in terms of clothes, haircut and all that.
Was pretty healthy. Not Vitamin deficiencies whatsoever.
And i can list alot of stuff that made me happy a few months ago.
Now we barely contact each other (my friend group)
Have no responsibility so my sleep schedule got messed up.
Acne has taken over, and i havenâ€™t gotten new clothes ever since pre-Quarantine 
Vitamin D definitely LOW.
Reaaaaal low.

Also Iâ€™ve been stressing over alot, my Sister and my Mother currently have bad blood, my sister actively avoiding her. And my mother is semi-begging just to check on her. 
Ok i wont get into detail.

But ive been angsty so much thinking about others, making sure everyone is doing well, that i forgot what i myself needed, and other than a sense of financial responsibility, a healthier-ish diet and a new hobby i rarely practice i barely changed in the past few months. 
I always thought me seeing them happy, will finally stop me from stressing, but im starting to doubt that.
Now even the smallest noise that resembles a sob gets me worried.

It would really help if you guys your stories, feels good to feel that youâ€™re not alone
