Be careful about your data. So I don't want to call out any Names. But if someone Dm's you and asks you to download their app. It's likely that they:

1. Steal your Data for a Quick Buck
2. Spam you with ADS for a Quick Buck
3. Just created a Ripoff for a Quick Buck

Please don't be a dummy. Use common sense. Even if you see whatever they asked you to download has Positive Feedback.

"Buying a person in China is cheap"

"Buying fake Feedback is cheaper"

So don't download that Shit. This is a Teenager Subreddit. Not everyone can think ahead.

Oh, yea. One more thing:

"DO NOT GIVE AWAY PERSONAL INFORMATION! THINK TWICE BEFORE TALKING!"

"Someone can do more with your Personal Information than you think. Even if you think you are careful. No one is safe from that"

Thanks for your time, have a wonderful day.
