got banned on r/amongus I got a 2-day ban on r/among us for making a post I saw here telling everyone to search "why is my pee red" on December 1st 6:00 PM GMT to confuse the search algorithms. (Do it). I know it has nothing to do with among us, but I still don't think the mods should have banned me. Thoughts?
