Tuesday marks the day for something big for me Itâ€™s either gonna be the beginning of something new or the end of my life in this city. My friend is taking me to this girls house party and itâ€™s a girl Iâ€™ve liked for a long time but things never lined up. And Iâ€™ve repeatedly put my love in the wrong people since I met her. If nothing happens between me and this girl then Iâ€™m gonna start making steps to move away and start over somewhere new. I feel like Iâ€™ve destroyed my life and made every single mistake and this is the last thing that I have energy for here. Ive made so many massive mistakes apparently and I just donâ€™t have the energy anymore. Iâ€™m honestly terrified. Iâ€™m typing this at 2:30 in the morning. I just want things to work out between me and this girl, and either there hasnâ€™t been a single sign from the universe that something will happen between me and her or Iâ€™m just oblivious to all of the signs. Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™ll get one soon ig. This is a strange rant and Iâ€™m sorry.
