Why is it ok for vegans to act like babyâ€™s in public So I got into a loop of watching idiot vegans dressing like animals and going into McDonaldâ€™s. My question is why canâ€™t they just leave meat eaters alone? We donâ€™t go into your Whole Foods and eat steak in front of you is it so much to give us the respect that you want?
