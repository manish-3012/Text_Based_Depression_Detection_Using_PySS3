I need to get this off my chest (Please delete if not allowed)

So, I guess I should start this off by saying that my name is Blayne, and Iâ€™m about 5â€™8 and 160ish pounds, and 17. Now, almost all my life Iâ€™ve hated being bigger than most people. I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m fat but Iâ€™m not skinny in any way. I used to be even bigger though, and Iâ€™ve lost weight but itâ€™s just not enough. There are times where I hate my own body and I feel gross, I tell myself Iâ€™ll never lose this weight, and now I believe it. Iâ€™ve tried, dieting, fasting, mild exercising, even making myself vomit, and even starving myself for weeks, just to lose this weight. I hate my own body so much. Iâ€™ve been doing online school for three years now so that doesnâ€™t help. I never have had any limits on food growing up, if I wanted candy or soda all I had to was just go grab some. That is one thing I do not like. Thankfully, I have decent self control and have been able to maintain a rather healthy weight. But I just need to be skinny. I know many would tell me itâ€™s okay to not be skinny. Or that it I should be happy with my body. But it only makes me mad when people tell me Iâ€™m normal and Iâ€™m not fat or even chubby, but I know I am. Those people just want to be polite and make me feel better but I hate it so much. I could never tell my mother about this because Iâ€™m sure we all know how parents tend to overreact. I just want something that will help me, Iâ€™ve literally been trying to figure out how to obtain an eating disorder, just so Iâ€™ll be skinny. Iâ€™m sorry if this post is depressing. I just need to let it off my chest. If anyone knows anything that could possibly help donâ€™t hesitate to tell me. Thanks.
