Challenging myself Im what people would consider a stoner ig. I smoke weed like 3 times a day, and when I am smoking, its not bad. Im not addicted, but I kinda want to quit, or at least slow down. Im thinking that, for as long as it takes me to finish Watch Dogs: Legion, AC Valhalla, and Cyberbunk, will be a good challenge for my sobriety, while giving me something to do. It should be like... weeks im thinking/hoping. Im doing this alone so thought this sub would be a good place to put this. 

Also dont be like me, dont do drugs, theyre fucking expensive
