feeling very unmotivated recently i havenâ€™t been very productive or motivated for about a month now and itâ€™s really been upsetting me. i used to be able to focus for long periods of time and now i just canâ€™t. i feel guilty and everything but i always opt for the instant gratification now instead of working hard toward my goals like i used to. i just feel lost and bleh. advice would be nice but i just needed to get this off my chest. 

iâ€™m sleeping now tho so good night and sweet dreams you lovely people &lt;3
