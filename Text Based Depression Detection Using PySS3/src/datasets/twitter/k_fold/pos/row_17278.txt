My teacher just told us to say why Hitler was a hero So basically, I'm in my history lesson for school at the moment, and we're learning about how the British Parliament formed, and Oliver Cromwell and stuff like that, when we were discussing whether or not he was a hero. And then she said,

"Explain why Hitler was a hero"

Of course, I don't think she meant to say that, but it was hillarious and I feel like everyone was laughing (we don't need our microphones or cameras to be on). I don't think she noticed though, because she continued like nothing happened. Nonetheless, it was the highlight of today.
