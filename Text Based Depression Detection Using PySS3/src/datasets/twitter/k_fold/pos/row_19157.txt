I hate driving school I just hate driving school and here are several reasons why

\-I was forced to do it by my dad mostly

\-I don't have the slightest interest as of the moment for owning a car or driving one

\-I won't most likely need a car in a long time as I live in a very walkable area and my ideal work I want to do would most likely take place in a city with good options to walk or use public transit

\-My motivation keeps getting dragged down as I can't advance through the theory part and I am not planning to actually cheat

\-I suck real much when it comes to learning practical stuff especially (I am more theory stuff like History, alternate history, geopolitics etc.). On top of this I definitely need to reread the material at least like five times so I actually get it but my brain literally refuses to focus when going through anything literary again leaving me incapable of doing the thing I basically would have to do

\-My dad is insisting on me getting through driving school and will not have it any other way, despite all these facts
