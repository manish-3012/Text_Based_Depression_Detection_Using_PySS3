Xbox live is now $120/Â£100 a year......what??!!! Apart from a PS2 in the past, Iâ€™ve pretty much always played Xbox and Iâ€™ve always supported Microsoft because the value for the Series S (which I have) and Game Pass actually outdid PS5 for me

Well thatâ€™s made a big fucking U-Turn. Xbox live is now double the price 

We now have to pay double the price for  service that should be free!!! If you remove free games per month then who cares, theyâ€™ve been piss poor for the past 2 years so nobody will miss it

Fucking awful decision from Microsoft, I hope this hugely backfires
