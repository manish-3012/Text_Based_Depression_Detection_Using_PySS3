Proof that being gay isn't against the church The priests are supposedly married to the church (since they can't be married with anyone else), the church is God, God made Adam to his image and resemblance, this means God's a dude, which means the priests are married to a dude. Furthermore, the church is gay itself so being gay isn't against it.

Also Jesus never stuttered when saying "love each other equally" so love each other equally
