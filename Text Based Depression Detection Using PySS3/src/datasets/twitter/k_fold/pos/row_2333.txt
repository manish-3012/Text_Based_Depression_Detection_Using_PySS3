I GOT DRUNK AND TEXTED TO MY FRIEND. Two years ago I met a nice girl and weeks after, I heard that she liked me and I also had the same feeling for her so... we went out a couple of times and she said that we couldn't date because we are too diferent (in short she said she is religious and kind while I'm the opposite of it, but of course I'm not an asshole with her or with everyone) so... I'm in the friendzone. Yesterday I went out to drink and got high af, then when I came home, for no fucking reason I texted her saying that I was drunk and still like her and some more shit like this, it was aroud 1a.m. and she replied asking if that was the reason I still talk to her after all this time 'cause she likes and love me like a friend and all. Hopefully I said "no" ,but also some more non-sense shit. Later, I woke up and didn't remember that , then I saw the messages and was like "HOLY FUCK", just wanted to die at that momment. Now, it's everything fine between us, but I don't feel it and I'm feeling very idiot too... I tried to talk with my best friend about it, but I didn't want to disturb him with this problem again, so I decided to share it with you. Is there something I can do about it?

Sorry about my bad english.
If relevant I'm not depressive or sadboy, but aways look dead and also don't care about many things.
