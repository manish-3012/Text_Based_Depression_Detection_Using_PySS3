I donâ€™t care if your dog â€œwonâ€™t biteâ€ Disclaimer: I donâ€™t hate dogs by any means and I see the appeal of then but I have cynophobia (the fear of dogs) so itâ€™s not that I dislike them itâ€™s that I am absolutely and utterly terrified of them.

If you are in a public place and someone asks you to please put your dog on a leash then do it. I donâ€™t know about where you the person reading this lives but in my country itâ€™s against the law to have your dog off a leash in public. Does anyone follow that law? No. And itâ€™s terrifying walking down the street because some idiot wonâ€™t put their dog on leash. Then when you ask â€œexcuse me sir/maâ€™am please put you dog on a leashâ€ they give you this look and donâ€™t do it. And then the dog comes bounding up to you and you either run in fear, scream and cry, or get absolutely petrified because the thing you fear the most is barking at you and gnashing itâ€™s teeth. Then the owner just laughs and walks away. Look I get you love your dog but some ppl are TERRIFIED of them. What are you scared of? Clowns, spiders, heights, your mom catching you jerking off, jump scares etc and then every damn day you have to be around the thing that scares you to no end. And ppl just laugh and say â€œitâ€™s not a real fearâ€ bitch a fear is a fear. I donâ€™t laugh at you for being scared of the dark so why laugh at me because Iâ€™m scared of dogs. â€œOh but heâ€™s my babyâ€ heâ€™s not your baby because you are not a dog and would it kill you to be somewhat considerate of those around you? Before you tell me â€œjust get over itâ€ then picture the thing that scares you the most and image someone saying â€œoh itâ€™s just my petâ€ while you cower in fear and everyone laughs their asses off at you. So please for the love of God just put your dogs on leashes so that they donâ€™t come bounding up to someone and give them a panic attack.
