For people who like Eminem What are some of your favorite lyrics from his songs. I'm genuinely curious mine are. "Put your hands down bitch I'm not gonna shoot you ima pull you through thus bullet and put it through you" -kill you




"said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9"-rap god 


And


"No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed"- lose yourself
