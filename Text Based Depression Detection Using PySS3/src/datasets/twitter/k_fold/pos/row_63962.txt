I dropped from 98% to 85% because of mental health issues and now I feel like a failure. What am I supposed to do? [14M]  

Yeah I know that grade 9 marks don't matter that much anyway, and there's always a new chance, but i feel terrible. Now I'm jealous of my friends who're getting 90% + , which is even worse. Why am I jealous of my friends? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I chased good grades sideling EVERYTHING, no hobbies, nothing. All my friends didn't put in as much effort but they had time for hobbies. Now I don't have either marks, or hobbies. I feel terrible. I've spent the last 4 hours doing nothing but crying. I can't even study anymore, I pick up a book and start thinking how everyone's better than me. So I just give up within an hour or so. Can there be anything worse?

Yes. Yes, this is my life we're talking about, of course it can be worse! My cousin's in Caltech doing his undergraduate degree and he's coming to visit me this year. He'll shove his achievements into my face and what am I supposed to tell him? That I wasted a crucial year of my life dealing with (diagnosed) OCD and depression?

And everyday is a struggle. I'm stuck in a serious of obsessive thoughts and I have to do compulsions for HOURS to relieve anxiety. It's exhausting. How about being unable to get out of bed or not showering in 2 weeks? Or feeling like your friends will be better off without you?

But wait, there's more ! I haven't slept properly in a umm... MONTH. Maybe 2. Even three. Why? Because apparently morning is no reasonable time to study, so my brain makes me feel guilty for doing nothing all day long and I end up studying at night to reduce some guilt. I sleep at 2:30 AM. Sometimes 3:30 - 4. There are days when I didn't sleep at all.

My chances of good days ahead are lower than the chances of a truck accelerating after applying brakes.

Is there really anything else to look forward to? I wish I had a terminal fucking illness.
