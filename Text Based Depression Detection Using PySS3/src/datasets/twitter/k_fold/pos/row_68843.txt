I just got 13,000$ I'm not sure if this is the place to talk about it but I got 13k because my boomer of a mom accidentally posted a  five year old vid of me playing with a sugar glider and hitting my head on snapchat spotlight. It went viral and snapchat had recently setup a creator fund where they give out one mil across every person who posted their top videos daily and you know the rest. I'm hyped cause I'll get a new pc that can actually play cyberpunk and a pretty big down payment for college so yeah that's cool. I felt like sharing to something but I don't have many friends so I cast it into reddit.
