I know I posted about this last night but I think it needs to be said again [TW] A student at my school committed suicide over the weekend. I was not close to him but I knew of some things that happened earlier in the year where he was seriously struggling. If you are thinking about commiting suicide, don't fucking do it. My classmates cried. I cried. My teachers cried. My fucking principal cried in front of my class. We had social workers come from another school and speak to us to make sure we were okay. His friends are absolutely devastated, blaming themselves for things they wish they would have seen.

You touch more lives than you realize and affect more people than you could ever fathom. Please stay. You are worth the absolute world. I didn't even know the kid well, but I'd do anything to bring him back for the people who love him most.

Please, keep going &lt;3
Don't make a decision you can't take back.
