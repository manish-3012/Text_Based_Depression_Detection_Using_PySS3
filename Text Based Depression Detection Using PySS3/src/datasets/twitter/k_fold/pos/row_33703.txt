I donâ€™t think iâ€™m gonna have an anxiety attack tonight!! Yeeeeeees Finally! Well iâ€™m 100% not gonna speak to soon but i donâ€™t think iâ€™m gonna have one! 2 nights in a row with 1 day break and 2 others. 

I have doubled up on my anxiety meds, i know that = bad but i feel calm, like really calm actually. Not that often with ADHD also i feel like this holy shit. Iâ€™m in bed with my favourite jumper on and reading through (trying to read through) advice and stuff to stay calm. 

There is a day tomorow at school where they talk about anxiety and iâ€™m fkn dreading it, i really donâ€™t want to go to school tomorow because i donâ€™t want to break down infront of everyone but i donâ€™t feel worried now?! 

Honestly if i donâ€™t have one iâ€™m gonna cry, but cry good tears. Legit, anxiety is fkn hard and anyone with it will know but it feels good to not worry about 1 main thing for once. Damn. 

Also, my anxiety meds help out with depression so i am happy! And iâ€™m never in a good mood on the evening ðŸ˜‚.
