Sharing your happiness with others. In latest months my life improved, and i got myself into a different mindset and ask if there's somebody who thinks the same as me.

We all know that world is full of toxic people, and some of them are just filled with greed and disrespect for other people success.
Lately I've improved almost everything i could, money, relationship with parents. Finally found somebody who loves and respects. And this actually got into some thoughts that changed my mindset.
Now I'm just kinda scared to share my happiness to other's, because i know that some greedy people can try to ruin it.
For example even though the fact that i have a girlfriend i don't really mention it in different conversations, or share it with people i actually trust. The same with money, i have money but i don't spend them on things like expensive clothes, or something that shows your money to other. And it's not because i can't afford it, it's because I'm scared to share my happiness with the world.

I just wanted to know your opinion.
TL;DR I'm scared to show my happiness to others because of toxicity and greedines stored inside of people.
