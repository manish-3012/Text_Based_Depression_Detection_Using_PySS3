Why do so many people mistake me for a Russian? Iâ€™m polish you pricks, where I live people tend to think that every naturally blonde person is a Russian. Like dude.... Since when do poles like me look Russian? Yesterday my driving teacher (who has been teaching me for 8 months now) assumed that I was a Russian during a conversation, I politely told him that I wasnâ€™t and that is not the only example of this, I had Russian people speaking Russian to me on the street (which obviously I couldnâ€™t understand) and teachers asking me to read things in Russian. I know that those people just made a tiny mistake which is forgivable tbh, I have never lashed out at someone for that but I just wanna know, is anyone else like me? Am I the only one?
