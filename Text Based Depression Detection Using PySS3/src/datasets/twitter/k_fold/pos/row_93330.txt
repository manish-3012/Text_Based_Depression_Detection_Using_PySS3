Need help getting over someone Ugh, I'll spare you the story, just need to know how to get over someone who I can't stop thinking about and I think I'm in love with, and is also one of my best friends. I've tried before, and failed. But it's becoming a problem since she got back with her ex. Cutting her out is not an option, and I really need help.

As I said, it's become a bit of a problem, she doesn't like me back, she lives across the Atlantic, so it's not like anything can happen, I just have these feelings but they need to go, 

Any advice on getting over someone, I think I'll take anything.
