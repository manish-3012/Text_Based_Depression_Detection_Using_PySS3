I feel really bad Iâ€™m going into a depressive episode. 

I said hi to my brother when he was talking/watching something with his gf over FaceTime. As I was walking away he said that I wasnâ€™t bothering them although Iâ€™m pretty sure I always am. Iâ€™m an awful person who doesnâ€™t deserve to live. I bother everyone. I feel awful. I deserve to feel pain
