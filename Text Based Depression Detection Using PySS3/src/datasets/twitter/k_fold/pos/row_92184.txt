I will try to make this short

&amp;#x200B;

im not sure if im living my "younger years" as i have to. i think that compared to all my friends im the weirdiest one, in my actual college im like the quiet guy that will start a gunshoot, im really shy with the girls,i mean i only get one girlfriend in my life and was an online girl so probably she didnt feel something for me in a serious way,and some of my friends are amazed that i didnt have my first kiss (im 15). and i dont like to hang out with my friends, or simply get out of my house i feel like more secure in my house playing videogames or seeing anime so,i just want to let me known if im like a weirdo or it is totally normal the life that im having as a "teenager"
