I need your help To start things off: nobody died, is in danger or anything like that. I (17,m) just need help for a school project.

I'm from Germany and my English teacher wants us to talk to teens from the US. Well, since I'm more of an introverted kind and I don't know anybody in the US personally I thought it would be a good idea to ask you folks on reddit for help. So if you'd like to be part of my project or if you got any ideas were I can get to know people from the US, please leave a comment, I appreciate all of them :D
