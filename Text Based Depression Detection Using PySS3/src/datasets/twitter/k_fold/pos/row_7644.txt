Why do people use ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to represent English It should be either ðŸ´ó §ó ¢ó ¥ó ®ó §ó ¿ or ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Idk this is all arbitrary, we should just decide on the Canadian flag and stop arguing, even though literally no one except me is thinking about this and arenâ€™t arguing about it cuz everyone already either settled on the Union Jack or the American flag depending on what hemisphere you live in with the exception of parts of The British isles

I think I might be overthinking this
