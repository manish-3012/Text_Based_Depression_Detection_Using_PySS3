What the fuck do girls want?! All these girls be telling me different shit and Iâ€™m confused. Like one girl broke up with me because I was â€œtoo niceâ€ so I was like okay Iâ€™ll be chill. Then no girls wanted me. And then this girl told me â€œgirls only like to date assholesâ€ and Iâ€™m like yo wtf why. To which she couldnâ€™t give an answer. Then others who only date douchebags be posting shit on their stories like â€œdonâ€™t date him unless he treat u like a queenâ€ and Iâ€™m like bruh wtf. Like what the fuck do girls want?
