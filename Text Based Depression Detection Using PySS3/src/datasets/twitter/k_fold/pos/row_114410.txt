Any advice for meeting people? So I feel like I (M17) am pretty charismatic and can talk to girls, but my problem is that thereâ€™s not really any girls on my radar that I would consider asking out.

Iâ€™m not sure if this is an issue of me being picky or just not meeting the right person (maybe a mix of both) but is there any advice you have for meeting the right person with my current catalog of options I am not interested in? 

Also itâ€™s important to note, Iâ€™m in online school and all my classes are over Zoom.
