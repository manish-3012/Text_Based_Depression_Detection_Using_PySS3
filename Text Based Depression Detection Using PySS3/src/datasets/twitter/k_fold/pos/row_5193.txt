Message to people in relationships: please don't ghost your partner i met what i had thought to be the love of my life about 2 years ago, freshmen year. during the second semester of that year, we became great friends, and within the first semester of the next school year we started dating. since at this point we were best friends and had been for awhile, i figured that i wouldn't really need to look out for red flags. also i thought that the "honeymoon phase" had already passed during our early friendship. well, we had a great 2 months, then she came to me and said that her dad and therapist wanted her to break up with me, out of the blue. this was so shocking because her dad and i seemed to vibe pretty well and i treated her to the absolute best of my abilities. she said she didn't want to break up but that we could just take a break over the holidays and then when everyone else calmed down a bit we would get back together. i didn't like it but i also didn't want to lose her so i accepted it. over the next 8 months i texted her a few times and tried to stay in contact, no response, ever. my birthday just recently passed and even then nothing. i don't have any other social media but she does and since i was getting impatient and curious i decided to *respectfully* stalk her twitter just for info. well i found out not only was she already dating another guy, and i'm pretty sure she just got dumped.

this was so painful because after all this waiting there was no payoff. it sucked, it was such a long burning pain, it fr hurt all the months i didn't know because idk i just felt bad. i would've rather been dumped and just gotten over the pain in like a month.

so yeah, if you're having relationship problems, please talk with your partner before leaving them and confusing and saddening the hell out of them
