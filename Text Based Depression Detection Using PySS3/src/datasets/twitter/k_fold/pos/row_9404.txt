A bit over 4 years ago, my life got completely changed I came to the realization last night that life goes by fast.

So, I used to live in a small city in Saskatchewan (I was born in Alberta but moved when I was like 3). I lived there for a good 7.5 years. I only had one real friend who I really didnâ€™t know too well until grade 4. School sucked ass. 

I moved to a large city in Alberta at the end of grade 5. I remember the day we moved in and unpacked shit. It was rainy and really crappy. I vaguely remember trying to get internet service using the landline thingy (my old PC had a port for that). This was a bit over 4 years ago.

I started grade 6 a few months (donâ€™t remember exactly) after the move. Grade 6 went better than the years at my old school but it wasnâ€™t the greatest. I had a small group of friends. Weâ€™d pick up garbage at recess and lunch for some reason. It was weird but the janitor loved it. 

Grade 7 is when life really got shitty. I failed every class, got suspended multiple times, took meds that fucked me up, and got into fights and stuff. Some other stuff went down that year but Iâ€™d rather not talk about it. 

Grade 10 now and that stuff seems very recent. Some of it, anyway. I moved yet again two years ago but Iâ€™m still close to where I was before. 

Anyone else feel like time goes by really quickly?
