Well, itâ€™s been fun, but now my parents are probably gonna kill me. So, I decided to order something kinda *risquÃ©* off the internet. Iâ€™m not gonna say what, but needless to say Iâ€™d get in serious trouble if it was seen. My plan was to buy with a gift card, then use delivery instructions to get it hidden on delivery until I can sneak it in. Well, turns out that delivery instructions arenâ€™t available for this package (for some reason Iâ€™ve yet to find out). This would have only been a small problem, since Iâ€™m normally home before my dad, who collects our mail. But, because my luck is a massive bitch, the day itâ€™s scheduled to arrive is one of the few days I have to stay late. Knowing my parents, theyâ€™ll probably wonder what I got and open it. So, itâ€™s been fun, but bye bye! Iâ€™ll probably be dead, grounded for several years, or homeless by the end of the week.
