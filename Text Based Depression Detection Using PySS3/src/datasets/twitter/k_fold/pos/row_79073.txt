My Spotify playlists I just want to share my Spotify playlists somewhere.


[AXE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/33rhzdLywPfs5Z51SHXOZ0?si=acAw1FkqQnmjBoBdA2paQA) - is the one with the most. Itâ€™s got a lot of variety and itâ€™s pretty long.


[162](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1cNASM8hqfUSkRwEg8iJUt?si=q0qUry9KQ1Csn0VZFAwHYg) - This one I think I made the same day as AXE and originally I added more to it but over time I pretty much mainly use AXE.


[LIGHTS](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Rho8yz9PdBdcfj498OG2H?si=Vcp0qwswQHKJkjXp5WLGKQ) - One of my favorite ones that Iâ€™ve made. It only has like 17 songs but theyâ€™re all really good and fit really well with each other.


[D Dusk](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Gmo6os7v11pv4JxCEz8g0?si=rvWic5oyTGCCZYL46_fMeg) - This one isnâ€™t great. Itâ€™s got a few songs in it but not many and those donâ€™t really fit each other well. They arenâ€™t meant to, the playlist is more to keep all of the songs for something together.


[DIM](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4It4rJzCXHGJbxvEOI157w?si=PWoitT2TQW-MATX4ZKwYZQ) - DIM is the one that can really get to you the most. The songs in it are all phenomenal and really make me feel something. I recommend checking out the creators of each song. 


[JOY](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6jZk26jlI2kihgOwa1ofRO?si=KqrNxWicS1C0Im5e-AZ7qg) - Like LIGHTS this one really goes well together. Theyâ€™re all pretty similar but in a very good way. Personally the beginning at least reminds me of a trip I took with my family because those were the songs I had been listening to at the time. And then from there I continued adding to it. 


Iâ€™ve got more but I felt this post was already long enough so if youâ€™re interested in the rest check out my account. Donâ€™t follow me.
