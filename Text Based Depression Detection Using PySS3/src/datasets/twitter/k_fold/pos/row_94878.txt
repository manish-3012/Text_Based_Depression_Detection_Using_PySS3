My friend Was supposed to get me a chocolate Bar on tuesday but he still hasnt found it So for context we were doing a dumb competition where we would see who could find a 4 Leaf clover first. It somehow took 3 days but i found one first. The loser has to buy the winner a chocolate bar. We agreed on a specific chocolate Bar that has somehow has become sort of An inside joke between us. I know i saw them in the store last week but apparently they havenâ€™t restocked them since then. 

This post really has nothing to do with anything but i Was bored And i managed to waste your time lmao gottem
