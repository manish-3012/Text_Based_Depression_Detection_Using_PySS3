Advice post... syke... ish I'm really more seeking advice. So, (and I dont mean to flex by this) I'm a pretty good looking guy, there's tons of girls who have asked me on dates and I could be in a relationship with a new girl every week if I wanted too. The thing is, there's this girl that I really like, I mean really really like, and she likes me too, but shes not sure if she wants a relationship at this moment in time. She just got out of a relationship and wants to remain single for a while. She still wants to hang out with me, but she just doesn't want to be an item. I'm fine with that, and I understand, but I'm not sure if I want to invest in a relationship if there's a possibility that it doesn't lead anywhere, breaking my heart. I've arranged to go on a date with another girl sometime this week, but the more I think about that date, the more I think about her. I guess I'm just wondering, what should I do?
