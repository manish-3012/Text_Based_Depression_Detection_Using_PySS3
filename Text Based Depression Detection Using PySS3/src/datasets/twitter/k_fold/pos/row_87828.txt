I don't know what to do with myself anymore So I think I'm starved for affection; I gave my friend a hug today, as I kinda had a bad day, and it was the most loved I've felt in like 3 years. I feel so alone, and I can't even cry to let away some of the stress. I don't know what to do anymore, and my suicidal thoughts have been creeping up recently, so I really don't have any clue anymore.
