If my appendix burst in my sleep and I die; I have a finally message to y'all. There's been ups and downs here, good, bad, ugly. But this place has always been one of my main escapes from the real world. It's probably shaped who I am for better or worse.

There's a lot of people I let down in this life, a lot of people I should've shown I cared about them more. I should've been more open and not cold and heartless. I put too much worth in the wrong thing and that fucked me up. 

Tell my momma I love her. This is u/TheVeryEndOfIt signing off.
