Im so fucking hyped rn heres why: So my friend that ive known for an entire year now, and stopped talking to for 5.5 months, and i just had a pretty long conversation.
Turns out they like MCYT, still have a godly sense of humor, AND HAVE MINECRAFT JAVA.

And you bet your ass im gonna play minecraft for so many hours i have to stop counting cause i run out of brain capacity with them.

Im just happy cause I didnâ€™t know they had java and theyâ€™re like one of my best friends!
So yeah im hyped rn, how was your day?
