I have no drive right now when I really need it Wasnâ€™t sure of where else to post this but I thought that you guys could help. 

As the title says, I have no drive right now and just generally apathetic to everything. My exams are in exactly 1 week and I havenâ€™t even started any solid study. These exams actually count from now on, and Iâ€™m entering my senior year of high school in 2 months. 

I have a lot to look forward to after exams and they should be enough motivation but I guess it isnâ€™t. Thereâ€™s so many shitty things about my life and itâ€™s just rlly tough rn. 

- I live right next to a school which reminds me so much of my old school, and I wish I could go there, but no, I have to travel 1.5hrs+ each way to my school. 

- My dadâ€™s a fucking asshole, he pisses me off so much. 

- I wanna slit my wrists but... I canâ€™t. Like I feel the urges and I wanna bring myself to do it but i guess I just cbb. â€œIâ€™m suicidal but Iâ€™m also a procrastinator so I guess it works outâ€ lol

- I dislike almost everyone at my new school. I like hanging out with a few of them and itâ€™s fun in the moment but i ppI donâ€™t feel close to anyone at school and just donâ€™t have a lot of support.

I guess I need a boost of morale or like something to motivate me. Not sure where to get it from. I was so motivated for the first like half of this year but then it all went to shit I guess. I was depressed at the start of this year, and Iâ€™m depressed now, so I donâ€™t rlly know what changed. 

Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll slit my wrists tho. Itâ€™s been almost a year :)
