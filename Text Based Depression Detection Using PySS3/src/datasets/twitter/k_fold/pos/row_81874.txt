Cant sleep, mind is full of thoughts Its 1:45 AM at my place, everyone are sleeping, and I'm sitting here and listening to some music to keep some thoughts at bay.

And what are those thoughts? Idk anymore, I feel like I miss someone; like I did something wrong, even tho everyone that I spoke to says that I did nothing wrong, that Im kind and good guy, even the girl that I love says this; wtf is wrong with me??? They are right, cause I help people, even when I can hurt myself in process, but smile of people I help is... something that repays all the pain.

So wtf is wrong? IDK!

I had to say it, I feel better now, so if you are reading this, thank you for reading (I can say thanks for listening lol)

And dont worry, I dont need to talk about my thoughts, but if you need problem, hit me anytime!

See ya guys/gals!
