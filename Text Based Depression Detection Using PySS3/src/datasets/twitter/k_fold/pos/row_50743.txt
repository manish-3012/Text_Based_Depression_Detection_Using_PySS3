Dear Parent - What I Wish I Could Say To You I wish I can be able to tell you things, and be heard by you. 

I wish I didn't have to shout my thoughts into the void.

I wish I could be enough.  

I wish you'd try to understand that I'm not a lesser being, just a developing one.

I wish you didn't have a fragile superiority complex.

I wish you'd be able to see that I must make mistakes to learn.

I wish you didn't panic and scream and throw things when you see me using the internet. 

I wish you weren't so anxious and obsessive and I wish you hadn't influenced me to become the same way. 

I wish you'd give me the same respect that you so desperately demand from me.

I wish you didn't downplay my strengths. 

I wish you'd see me as a complete person and see my successes, not just my failures. 

I wish I could live up to your standards, I truly do. 

I wish you could see how hard I try, and not make me second guess every thought I have, idea I come up with, quality and characteristic I possess and decision I make. 

I wish you'd give me some space to be independent. 

I wish you didn't physically hit me every time I attempt communication. 

I wish you had faith in me, and believe that I have the ability to become a better person. 

I wish you'd give me advice when I need it the most, instead of belittling me. 

And finally, I wish you weren't so hard on yourself to be the best mother you can be, to provide for every single physical need and go above and beyond to the point where you'd prefer to have a puppet for a daughter. I wish you'd loved yourself enough to be able to show love to your child.
