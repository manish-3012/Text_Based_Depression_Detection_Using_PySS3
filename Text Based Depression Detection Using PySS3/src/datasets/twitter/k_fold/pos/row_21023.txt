Something hilarious Idk why I decided to write and post this, but one day in 7th grade, in science, there was this girl who sat a table away from me. She had been taking off her hoodie, (you can see where this is going) and her shirt and stuff decided to go with the hoodie. I got flashed. I remember, my friend was like, â€œhey!? What are you looking at?â€ Bc I was just staring at her. He doesnâ€™t know what it was, and I do? ðŸ˜‚ (also me and that girl were really good friends at the time).So skip to a year later, in 8th grade, she moved schools. Every day Iâ€™d go over there and see her. Her school was conveniently across the street from mine. And Iâ€™d go there, and have a good time with her. About a couple of weeks after doing going to her school after I got out, we confessed to each other that we liked each other, and then I â€œmade the moveâ€. And to this day, weâ€™re together. And we have never spoken about this ever again. My friend, imma call him Trent, had also been flashed like that about a week after I was. I wanna say we were lucky? ðŸ˜‚
