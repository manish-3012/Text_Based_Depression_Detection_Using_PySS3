Throwing Away/Selling Childhood Possession 
A few months ago I made the decision to live a minimalist life, and it has made such a huge difference. Simply put, I feel that much more happier. I tend to keep only what I am going to use, getting arid of anything I do not have a use for. 

I used to be a pack-rat. I would keep everything. 

I have to go through a lot of my possessions from when I was younger, and I want to know if it would be a good idea to get rid of more things. If not, they would just sit under the basement stairs. I am never going to use any of these things again. 

A majority of the things I have already sold, Ido not miss at all. They would be very easy things to forget. 

Note: Of course, there are a few things I am going to keep due to the nostalgic factor alone. That does not account a significant amount of things I have left.

Do you think I will regret selling/throwing-away some things I used to play with from my childhood? 

My parents would give me the green light, but would this affect them, even if they do not say?
