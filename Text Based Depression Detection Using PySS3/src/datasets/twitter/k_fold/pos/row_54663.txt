For the first time I asked my crush if she wants to hang out, she said yes, but now I'm really nervous For the first time in my life I asked a girl if she wants to hang out with me and I really don't know what to do I am really nervous even tho it isn't even a date. I don't know what to do tomorrow and I'm scared that I make everything worse. Does anyone know anything we can do or talk about. Any advice is welcome.
