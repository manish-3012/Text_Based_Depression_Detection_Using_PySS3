i'm sad tonight here's why: \*!WARNING i talk about pouch!\*

my day was fairly eventful but the night is when it got exciting; as many may not know i'm writing a book. ii wrote a small bit in my book, cleaned off my bed, got the dog turned the light off, back on to adjust my radio dial anyway i was in bed by 11:00. i was trying to sleep but my left nostril was so pluged that i got a dirty cloth to clean but all that did was hurt. it was painful since half my airway was blocked, i went to the bathroom and tried something my grandma showed me to hold a  hot cloth on my nose. nothing helped so call me dumb or whatever but i took my toothbrush and repeatedly brushed my uvula i pouched once and felt much better since ALL the mucus was cleaned and i figured my nose would clear by morning. NOPE instead i was just tiredly leaning over my sink a sec when no kiddidng i involintarily opened my mouth and pouched so much, even some reason white foam?.  and now i am in bed again with a stomach ache, mostly cleared sinuses. my dad gave me pepto and know i'm on reddit with gatorade at 1 AM.
