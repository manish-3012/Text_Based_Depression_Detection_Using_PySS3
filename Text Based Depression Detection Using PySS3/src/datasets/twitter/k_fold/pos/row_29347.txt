â€˜Nostalgiaâ€™ - please read That feeling. The one when something sparks a thought. A rememberance of a past memory. Maybe in your childhood. Maybe feelings of pure bliss. Running through fields of grass. The feeling of summer. The heat from the sun in your skin. The smells. The pleasant sensory overload. You feel that feeling. Warm and fuzzy. Like your vibrating. Memories of pure happiness. And then you zoom out. Back to your life now. You become sad. Life was so much better back then. You miss it. You miss everything. Everything was so simple. And good. You were much happier. You want to live in that time forever and ever. But time flies. And 50 years from now youâ€™ll have this same occurrence. Thinking about these times. How they were so much better. Filled with joy. Maybe friends. Family. And now your all old. Parents are gone. Life is boring. Itâ€™s grey. You donâ€™t do much. All youâ€™re left with is memories. You wonder where the time has gone. Did it really fly by that quick. It couldnâ€™t have. I canâ€™t be think old already. Iâ€™m almost at my end. I had a lot more stuff I wanted to do. I never did this or that. Man I miss those times. Those memories. I wish I spent every living second to the fullest that I could. I shouldnâ€™t of cared about money. Or school. Because none of that matters now. On my death bed. All Iâ€™m left with are memories. Positive and negative. I wish I lived more. Traveled the world on foot. Met thousands of people. Had so many amazing friends. Amazing experiences. Fell in love over and over again. I wish I lived. Itâ€™s best to live your life. Break your addictions. Get rid of your phone. Save up. Downgrade to a flip phone. Switch your SIM cards. Find a cool group fo friends. Get closer. Encourage them to do the same. And keep going. Keep living. Have fun. Be alive. Be real. Be in the moment. Because one day thatâ€™s all youâ€™ll have. Memories of what you did now. Did you really think youâ€™ll be satisfied with laying in your bed all day on your phone. Do you really think you wouldnâ€™t want to just go back and knock some sense into your younger self. Live life. Remember when you were young and wanted to grow up so bad because of all the freedom it would give you. Everyone told you no. Slow down. You want to cherish these times. You didnâ€™t believe them. You had no perspective. You grew up anyways. And now. Now you realize they were right. Those were the best times. Iâ€™m grown up now. I wish I lived more during them. I wish I lived in the moment. Embraced being a child. Well thatâ€™s how it is now. Your current reality and everything youâ€™re doing at this exact moment is playing like a movie in your future selfs mind. What do you think they would say about what youâ€™re doing right now? Please. Live your life. Throw away your phone. Band up with some friends and LIVE. Truly live. Because life is short. Very short. And once youâ€™re on your deathbed. The truly most valuable things in the world will be your positive memories and experiences. So make the old you happy. Make them feel okay with their life. Make them feel consent. Like they truly lived. And didnâ€™t waste it. And werenâ€™t just wishing for more time. Shift your perspective for a moment. Ask yourself. What will you think about when youâ€™re old and canâ€™t move, thinking back in your life? On these moments. Right now? Will you be happy with these memories?
