My Best Friend Tried to Kill herself So today I was watching YouTube then I get a message from my group chat saying â€œGuys please contact (b/f) as soon as possible I donâ€™t think I have any time leftâ€ I tried texting and calling her and got nothing.After Mins of trying to call her and panic, she answered.I chatted with her trying something or at least anything so wouldnâ€™t do it.I told her to heal her wounds and she did.Then I talked to her saying â€œI know your going through one of the worst possible houses but you have people who care about you.â€After that she told me Iâ€™m sorry and thank you.I told her to please talk to me or anyone if sheâ€™s not feeling well. 

TLDR: Best friend tried to killed herself, but panicked me called her out of it.

Also please note: I donâ€™t wanna share her name for personal reasons
