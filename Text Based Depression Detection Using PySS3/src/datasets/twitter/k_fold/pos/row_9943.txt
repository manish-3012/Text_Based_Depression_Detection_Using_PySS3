Guys I need some advice here So I'm pretty sure everyone has this same problem as me, but how do you know if what you're feeling is a valid thing to feel? I go back and forth in my head between "I'm quite depressed and I need a therapist" and "You're only doing it so you can get some small amount of pity and affection you attention whore". This really applies to anything I do or think about nowadays and I'm going crazy because of it.
