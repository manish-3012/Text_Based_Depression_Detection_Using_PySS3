Discord server Iâ€™ve been in a discord server for months and all of the sudden, most of the good people left, then the owner invited a bunch of new guys and then I left. Now I have a new server and itâ€™s just gonna be a place to hang out. You can talk about school, games, anything. I will warn you however one admin is a complete simp. Literally, they have it in their name. But aside from that, dm me if youâ€™d like to chill with us in the server!
