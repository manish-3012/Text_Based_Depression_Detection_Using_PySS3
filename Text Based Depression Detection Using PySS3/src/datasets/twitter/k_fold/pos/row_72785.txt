my parents got new wifi and didn't even tell me the password so I can use my phone on wifi and avoid my parents paying $200 more on the phone bill. wish if my sim card was in my iphone but my iphone too old and I would need an adapter just to use my iPhone as a normal phone. I currently am stuck with using my android as it's the only device that can fit my sim perfectly.
