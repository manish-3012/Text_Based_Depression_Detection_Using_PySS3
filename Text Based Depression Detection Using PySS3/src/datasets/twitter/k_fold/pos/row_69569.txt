I need advice from a video editing musician I'm an 8th grade band player, and me and my fellow band mates are trying to organize a concert, so I need a free video editing software that can handle making a "zoom" band meet. Also, we are playing to metronomes, but any advice on how to get it to sync up perfectly?
