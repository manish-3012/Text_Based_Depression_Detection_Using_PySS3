Bro if I or someone else says something wholesome or uplifting, like â€œGuys appreciate your parentsâ€ or â€œMy brother told me he accepted me for who I amâ€ Donâ€™t comment shit like â€œlmao my dad abuses meâ€ or â€œmy parents both kicked me outâ€ and â€œlmao my brother told me he hates meâ€ like shut up, that shit genuinely upsets me a bit. You guys should know the time and place to talk about that stuff. All youâ€™re doing in that moment is ruining the wholesome vibe the post created and made it about yourself.

Donâ€™t be that person.
