What do you think of this song I wrote? Addiction runs in my family, right?

So does staying up, not being able to sleep at night.

Mental illness, Iâ€™ve had enough. I give up the fight.

All you do is judge. Depression and anxiety fill my mind, itâ€™s like. 

A balloon. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Itâ€™s like my hands are tied. My head expands through the roof. 

My emotions, I feel consumed. My family, I was abused. 

Wanting to commit suicide, like what do I really have to lose?
