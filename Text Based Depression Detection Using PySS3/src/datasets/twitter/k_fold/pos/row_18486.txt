I got an F today, do you think my teacher will accept my excuse? I got an F for my oral grade in a subject I did well in, I asked my teacher and she said I had many missing assignments. But in fact I did all those. I looked at the assignment system and they were done but it didn't show up so in the completion dashboard. So I took screenshots of every single assignment and sent them to my teacher.
