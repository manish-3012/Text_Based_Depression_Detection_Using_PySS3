Please help. //tw : suicide


*First of all, this post isn't designed to farm karma or some sort of such useless shit. This is a cry for help.*

Lately, well, for the past 2-3 years, I've been experiencing "episodes" of feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts. The episodes usually last 1-2 weeks, and during that time I feel like shit and even thought about killing myself several times.

 I've never talked to a psychologist/therapist before since; a) I personally can't afford it; b) my family says it's not a big deal and I should just let it be, and therefore won't fund sessions; and c) the councillors at my school speak a different language and no English (we moved to Germany almost 10 months ago, and I still don't have a good grip on the language).

I really don't know what to do. These episodes only get more intense every time and driving me closes and closer to suicide. Maybe it's a seasonal thing: these episodes seem to be more frequent during winter and spring, for some reason...

Any help is appreciated, please don't give me awards, this isn't a shitpost/meme. If you don't believe me, it's fine, I understand that people faking these types of things has made this topic  stale, but please, believe me, I'm not faking this and actually need help/advice.

Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.
