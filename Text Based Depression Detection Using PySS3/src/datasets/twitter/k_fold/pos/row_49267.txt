How do I tell someone I like them without getting hurt if they don't like me? I've been talking to someone recently who seems to be flirting (I'm not good at talking social cues) yet idk if it's just them being them or them wanting me to notice them. I've only recently started to feel like i actually like them (today) and i have no clue whether or not I should just ignore my feelings or tell them.... Advice???
