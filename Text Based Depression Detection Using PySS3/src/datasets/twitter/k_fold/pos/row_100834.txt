Third person self deprecation? Iâ€™ve noticed my internal dialogue is 1st person when talking about something positive or neutral, but negative is always in 3rd person. So I usually hit myself with the â€œyouâ€™re so f*cking fat youâ€™re such a looserâ€ or something along those lines. Does anyone else do this? I guess Iâ€™m just curious.
