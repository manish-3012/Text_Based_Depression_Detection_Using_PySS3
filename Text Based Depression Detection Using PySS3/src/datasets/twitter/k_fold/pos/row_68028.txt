I just need someone to tell me everything will be ok Life is really difficult rn and I feel like it's never going to get better. I'm only really happy when I talk with my friends but other than that I feel emotionally and mentally tired. I just want to know everything will be ok and for someone to tell me that because life just sucks rn.
