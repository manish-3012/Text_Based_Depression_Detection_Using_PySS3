I got an unpopular opinion, but letâ€™s talk! I donâ€™t  like rap. I find it boring and difficult to enjoy because I feel there is little to no â€œmusical integrityâ€ where the song was thought out and was composed with time and effort. I feel like rappers are just doing it for the money, cause they release like 4 albums each year, and itâ€™s always this guy featuring this person, and vice versa, to milk out of it as much profit as possible. Literally I feel like rap is just lay down a beat in like 4 4 time or whatever and just sing in a monotone voice over it, and I also feel like â€œgood rappersâ€ are determined by how much they can rap about sex, money and drugs. I listen to classical, rock, metal, jazz, funk, fusion, almost everything but rap, because they have some weight on a music theory level. People will say rappers are geniuses or whatever, but if you lay down the work on sheet music, there is little to nothing compared to classical or other music, and its so simple that it gets boring. Also these rappers, after they had their time, just seem to disappear without actually leaving a mark on the musical world. But letâ€™s talk! Iâ€™m open to learning something new. Who knows, I might be wrong and rap might actually be amazing.
