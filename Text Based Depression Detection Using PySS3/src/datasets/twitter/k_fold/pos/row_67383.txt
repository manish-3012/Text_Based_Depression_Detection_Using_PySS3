I bought a $1600 high end headphones setup now i decided i don't like it The sound of them is great, it's just that they're way too loud even at normal listening levels. Like speakers. And my parents room is right next to mine, they would not approve of the music I like so it's not enjoyable to use.

Also they're big and heavy and kinda uncomfortable. 

So idk what to do i can't rly return this shit. Oh well Imma probably get some good earbuds now tho I'm more used to earbuds.
