What are the do's and don'ts of this sub So far in the past few months I've really only gathered: don't make long posts because you'll get downvoted, don't mention tiktok (if someone could explain why this is I would genuinely appreciate it), and don't make political posts because politics (that I am totally fine with, I'm just here for a good time lol).


But do y'all like when people post their pets? Or just talk about life things? Or short rants about school?


All answers are welcome, I just want to know a bit more about this sub because I don't think I am using it well lmao. Thank you in advance!
