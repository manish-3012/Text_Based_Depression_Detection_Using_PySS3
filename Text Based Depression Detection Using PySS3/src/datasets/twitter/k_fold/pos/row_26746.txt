How hard is it to be realistic People are always on me about being negative, or something like that, but I'm just looking at things in the way that seems most likely to me. Looking at depression posts, I can see how they (generally) think, and how illogical it is too. Just be realistic bro. No, not everyone likes you, but I highly doubt everyone you know is only there to use you.
