Okokok so I have important info I want to share!! You know all those memes of how you are super quiet when parents are asleep but when youâ€™re asleep they are on the phone or hearing music? Well I was in the kitchen a minute ago and I overheard my mum talking about how she would talk on the phone or play music and clean when me and my sister were asleep when we were younger. I asked her why she did that and she said it was to make us used to sleeping with noises so that we didnâ€™t need the world to be silent for us to sleep!! I genuinely didnâ€™t know that until now!!! I just wanted to share it with ppl so that they know not to be mad, but thank their parents for this because it genuinely helps
