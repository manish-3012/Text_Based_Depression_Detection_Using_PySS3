Anybody here seen interstellar? I watched it a month or so ago for the very first time and honestly itâ€™s my favourite movie of all time

Although it can be confusing, itâ€™s just perfect. I mean when I dismissed the movie and the credits rolled, I sat there for 5 minutes with this feeling Iâ€™ve never had, just stunned at the movie

Anybody else watched it? Because if you havenâ€™t you NEED to watch it
