Question for those who are in university/college First of all, English is not my first language and I don't really understand the university/college thing, so I'm just calling it university (In Argentina we call it university and tertiary shcool and I don't know it college and tertiary school are the same)

I got into musical theater on a very late point of my life and my parents told me that I could probably make it my career and I really like that idea (I have to start my studies next year). Problem being that dancing is a big part of it (even if not every play has dancing on it) and these universities have a lot of advertising about dancing.

I'm not a dancer but  I would love to, and every single person that I know whose been on university went with prior knowledge/experience. 

I would go to dance classes but I don't live on a big city and most of them are for girls only plus with covid this is impossible.

So yeah, would I be accepted without knowing how to dance? 

(Oh also I always been into music and I know how to sing, the only problem i have is dancing)
