so... what am I supposed to do? what do I do? I girl and I met and hit it off, we even started flirting, then she found my age and freaked out. (I'm 14 she's 16). then I calmed her down and told her it wasn't that big of a deal. that was like, 3 days ago. now I've been thinking about it and it really is weird af. I don't think it's gonna work out, but I really don't want to hurt her. she's going through shit rn and breaking it off will make it worse. 

fuck I'm stressing out
