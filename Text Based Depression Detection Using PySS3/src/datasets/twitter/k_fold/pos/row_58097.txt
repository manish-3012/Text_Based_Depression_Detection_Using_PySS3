God, Iâ€™m such a loser JEEEESUS CHRIST I was scrollin thru reddit and saw this cute girl had posted a selfie on a sub Iâ€™m on so I went thru her post justify and instantly fell in â€œloveâ€ if you can even call it that. We have similar interests, sheâ€™s really cute, and seems to have a pretty cool personality. Weâ€™re the same age too. Could be bait or something, idk. Didnâ€™t seem like it. Anyhow, Iâ€™ve just been laying in bed imagining all the dates weâ€™d go on and how fun theyâ€™d be and gah. I hate my brain. I really only made this post to 1) get out my feelings about her and 2) have the sub agree with me by calling me a creepy idiot no-life loser.
