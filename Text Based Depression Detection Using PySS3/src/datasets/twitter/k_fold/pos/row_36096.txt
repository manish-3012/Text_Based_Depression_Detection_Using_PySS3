Hey there people I'm in a advice needing situation Alright so a few hours ago I dropped the school issued chromebook flat on it's cheaply made screen. Safe to say the screen glitched out harder then if it was on cocaine. After a quick Google search I know that the screen is the only component broken and nothing else is damaged so bad it needs repair. Now this would be bad enough except I have school in the morning and have no idea how to tell my parents they need to pay 40-80 to fix my fuck up. Zoom calls and attendence aren't gonna be a problem as I have my own computer but still a bit nerve racking ya know? Any suggestions on what to do?
