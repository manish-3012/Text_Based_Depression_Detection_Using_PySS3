A rant, if you will. 
This is almost everything i can remember about my life. I forgot sone but i don't want to forget more, this is what i know.

This is a documentation of my depression, what caused it, and my thought process at that time.

Warning, long. No throwaway because i don't care.

This story really starts when i can remember, so junior kindergarten. School was fine, nothing remarkable. Home sucked. My parent's had the *genius* fucking idea to have a kid in a toxic and abusive relationship. I got yelled at, then got threatened when i cried. My brother(who is 6 years older than me.) was rude, but not. 

He didn't want to hurt me.

He just didn't want me to know. He wanted me to stay innocent. But i didn't know that. I thought he was a fucking rude jackass. Me and him fought, alot. That is relevant later on,  **keep that in mind~*

So this awful cycle happened, until, around a few years. And then F showed up in my SK class! He swore, a lot. But he's just a kid, and so am i, so that was funny. We both swore because haha bad word funny. It was good times though. **was.**

He disappeared without a trace. Without a parting message. Without a warning.

*1 friend gone, 0 goodbyes.*

I had a dog throughout this. A great big dog. But he is a gentle giant. Would never hurt a fly. I'll keep it blunt.

**He got rabies, bit my parents, hard. Didn't change for me. He died anyways and my parents lied to my face.**

Back to the routine! Same old, same old. But hey! Someone moved in! A friend? *You betcha!*

We had fun playing on our DS and... Just generally messing around. Again, *had.*

They moved out one day. That was nice, thank you god!

*2 friends gone, no goodbyes.*

But that's okay, god! I forgive you! Hardships always bring better rewards, right?  **This isn't a happy story, if you haven't figured that out.**

Parent's yelling and then getting you involved in their problems isn't the *healthiest*, mentally, for an 8/9 year old.

That's the seed of depression that i never knew i beared.

And i only knew it a couple years later.

11 or so. L moved in. L showed me levels of friendship i never knew existed. She truly, undoubtedly, cared 100% about me. And i cared about her. Was it love or great friendship? I wouldn't know. All i know is that the seed of depression weighing so hard, so hard i needed saving from, but i didn't even knew i had, got destroyed. And then she told me she was moving. That's alright, she gave me her facetime info! So...

*3 friends gone, 1 goodbye.*

But this wasn't like last time, she was still here and we talked freely! Until... god thought i was too happy. I dropped my phone face first, like what I've done a million times; being a clumsy kid and all. This time was different. The screen completely shattered and the phone broke.

She was gone, truly gone. The depression seed was growing into a mighty sapling. But i know how it feels this time. I just accepted the fact. I felt like i earned a reward. Fate felt so too! My mom forced me to a small fair out of the blue, and L was there! My happiest moments returned, and i felt my worries disappear. I felt like i would bear any hardship just to continue seeing her. The best part? It was all mutual!

*2 friends gone, 0 goodbyes..?*

*I didn't know what hardship i had to bear.*

Just one mistake, that's all it took.

Just a couple missed words, and my life would've completely different.

"Hey L? What's your info? My phone broke."

But no. I didn't fucking do that. I fucking said **nothing.**

And she's gone! Funny, right?

*It's hysterical to me!*

I'll never see her again. Never! Because of a mistake.

*3 friends gone. 0 goodbyes.*

**But the biggest mistake is what i did next.**

The pain was so fucking bad. I decided that I'd rather feel nothing then the excruciating pain, so i willed my emotions into a safe and i don't know the combination.

**i still don't.**

But it wasn't instant, i could still feel.

I went into mania for a short time. Started misbehaving in school, laughing randomly, looking for fights. *Ending fights.* I was going insane. A suicide attempt, well i had the intent at least. Still went to school. Nothing changed.


Skip forward to grade 7, i realized that *nothing is ever going to fucking change.* my mania made friends inside my head. *Say hi~*

I just have to control the laughing and I'm good. I locked away the anger and madness in a fucking bottle, or at least that's how i imagined it. I locked my heart in a wall of ice, but my friends could melt it. So i decided to find another metaphor.

I thought to myself. 'A safe.' And so it was! It worked.

And here i am. Still apathetic and all too aware of my situation. I'm aware, but powerless. At least on my own. Don't ask if I'm okay. I am, but I'm not. SchrÃ¶dinger's depression, i guess. I still think about L. I'm forgetting her, but i don't want to. I want to cherish the memories i have of her. But it's slipping. I might go insane.

I might lose my mind if i can't remember her.
