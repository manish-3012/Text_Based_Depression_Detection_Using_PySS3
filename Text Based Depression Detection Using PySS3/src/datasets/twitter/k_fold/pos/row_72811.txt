Exsitance meme theory an element of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means. or an image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations here is my theory everything is a meme it all evolved from design of one true original being (God) who created the simplest materials (elements), concepts (time space, matter etc) with this in mind we can say that anything that evolved from those including the life itself is a bit changed up idea with source being the Creator. Everything is immitaion slightly changed from original passed down from not just humans but all living and non living creatures ever. For those that would argue its meme only if its funny go look at second definition of meme it says its "typically funny nature" witch suggests exsitance of unfunny memes .To disprove that memes are spread only trew internet i will take an example of inside jokes such you do with your friends irl such as saying something in specific way to achieve funny effect, the ok gesture (ðŸ‘Œ) etc . To disprove idea that meme is something "non-genetic"who decided that just bc understanding of genetics precedes the modern idea of memes doesn't mean it should not be included in this new idea of memes (and even with idea that genetics precced memes i disagree with even if you are with names non-genetic idea for example roman soldier 1800 years ago carved dicks near the Hadrian wall) for disproveinge genetics part of meme definition lets take a look at what genetics are â€œGeneticsâ€ is the study of how traits are inherited. A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. It seeks to understand how traits are passed from generation to generation. So it is in short just how cells decided to continue meme of living being with changing up the joke bit trew long periods of time. What is the point of this theory ? To prove that there is no limit to what meme can be so now that we know everything is joke what is the point of going on and to include religion/afterlife here is the idea point of life is to come continue or to do your best to fix memes for being a good memelord in afterlife you get to go back to original being The Creator to live in eternal peace for ruining good memes depending on how much you ruined them you go to meme purgatory to pay for your unfunny joke or to meme hell to burn in eternal fire for being a destructive normie
