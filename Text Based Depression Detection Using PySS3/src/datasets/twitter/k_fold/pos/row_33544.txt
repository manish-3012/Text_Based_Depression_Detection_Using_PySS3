Hello! i'm not sure if this counts. I'm making something for my boyfriend even though we are online and won't meet for 6 years. I decided i should make him a scarf because i love him. Is there a way i can keep it safe until we meet? any advise? please...? I don't think this counts but i thought it would be fun to share this.
