Speaking of NNN... One of my friends from school recently got in touch with me through Discord and made a server with a few other people we know, because of lockdown we haven't had school for 8 months. One day, I got a ping from that server, another one of my friends told me that he was caught fapping to his Skyrim porn mods by his mom, and was grounded. I still haven't heard from him in 2 months almost.
