Led Zeppelin on immigrant song be like Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh ah 

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ah

Our own selves come from thy land of thy frozen matter

made of extremely  cold liquid made of two parts hydrogen

and one part oxygen as well as frozen precipitation

from thy midnight sun, location thy sweltering springs flow

thy hammer of thy gods

the twenty-third letter of the modern Latin alphabet'ell drive

our ships to new lands

to fight thy horde, as well as sing as well as shedding

sorrowful tears

valhalla, myself am coming!

On our own selves sweep with threshing oar

our only goal will have being thy western shore

Ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ah

Ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ah

Our own selves come from thy land of thy frozen matter

made of extremely  cold liquid made of two parts hydrogen

 and one part oxygen as well as frozen precipitation

from thy midnight sun location thy sweltering springs flow

by means of soft your fields so green

can whisper tales of gore

of by means of our own selves calmed thy tides of war

our own selves art your overlords

On our own selves sweep with threshing oar

our only goal will have being thy western shore

So now yourself'd better discontinuation of movement as

well as rebuild all your ruins

for peace as well as trust can win thy period of twenty-four

hours despite of all your losing
