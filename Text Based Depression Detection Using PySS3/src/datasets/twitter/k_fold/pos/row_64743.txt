Am I just clowning myself at this point? So I got myself in another online relationship with this girl (we live in the same country but live in different cities). We kind of chatted for a while on reddit, after that we moved to discord, then messenger. We spent some time with each other like recommending each other some music other stuff. But over time she took long seconds before replying to me, then those long seconds became minutes, then hours, to days, and even a whole week she left me on sent. But that rarely bothered me because when we met, we both agreed that we will message each other on Valentine's day. 

So Valentine's day arrived and I made her a letter about how I hope that our relationship will last despite what's happening in our live right now (like being busy on online classes and stuff). So I sent her the letter I made on messenger and I was super excited because I really wanted  to tell her the stuff that's been going on lately. Then... Nothing. I was like "oh, she's probably asleep right now I'll go check on her later". And so I did, a couple of hours go by and I was already in the middle of my online classes and my message was only on sent. So after that I still waited until my I was done with my online classes and she still wasn't online. But I still kept my hopes high and decided to do my chores whilst I wait for her. But nope, she till wasn't online. I was kind of disappointed but still hoped that we'll have another time to chat with each other.

I waited a couple more weeks for her to reply or atleast left me on seen. But nope, she still haven't bothered. It kept on like this until I saw something, it was one of her stories. Her story said that she was really glad that she finally finished all of her assignments and projects. So I messaged her again, but nope not again. She still left me on sent.

It's been going on like this for a couple of days now. Am I just clowning myself at this point? :'))
