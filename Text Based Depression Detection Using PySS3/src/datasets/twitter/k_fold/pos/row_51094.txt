There is a person that moderates 2500 subs and is abusing his power,Spread this message. A few days ago i contacted u/7massaccountnukes
For his post about powermods,I asked the name for the powermod,I didnt believe him at first,But after a bit of research i found out that this guy moderates 2500 Subs,Yes you heard that right,2500!
Many people have been completely banned from reddit for criticizing him,Please spread this message,By your alt,Cause theres a very high chance that this person moderates the sub that your active on.
His name is u/awkwardtheturtle
When i checked from the moderation tab,It didnt actually show the 2500 subs,But when i checked manually by searching many subreddits i found that this is indeed,True.
