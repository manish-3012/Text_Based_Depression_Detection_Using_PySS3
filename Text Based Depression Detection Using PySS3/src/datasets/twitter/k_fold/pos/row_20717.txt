the people at my school are literally insane, and have no problem destroying property while on camera I go to an all boys highschool and people there can be totally barbaric. Our school has 2 exits: the front gate and the side gate. A fair amount of the school goes out the side gate (like me), but every once in a while, the person supposed to unlock the gate doesn't get there before school ends. On wednesday, when we got to the side gate, there was a whole crowd there waiting for someone with keys to show up. Here's where the problem starts. You see, there is a wooden fence that the school shares with another person's property, and there is a small gap in the wood that allows you to get over the fence, created a long time ago. After 10 minutes of waiting, and a handful of students already up, over and out, more people look at the fence as a more viable option. As more people want to go through, they start to put *more* holes in the fence, throwing planks of wood onto the grass. We know that there is a camera on the neighbours house (probably for this reason), but that doesn't stop them. More and more kids go over until *finally* a teacher decides to show up, after like 20 minutes, probably because some kid decided to try and get the gate open, and the flood of bodies is released. 

I can't say I really blame those students for just trying to get out of school, some of the people that jumped weren't even bad people, but it was insane that they would break stuff so unnecessarily. And I hope the teachers know that sometimes they are the reason that bad things happen.
