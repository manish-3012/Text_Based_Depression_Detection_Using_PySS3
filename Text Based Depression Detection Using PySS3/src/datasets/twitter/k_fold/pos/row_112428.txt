I need girl help, idk where else to turn to I met a special girl on october 30th. She talked to me for weeks instantly. Never left me on delivered or whatever. We have our inside jokes, humour in our convos, everything. Last week i asked her if we can talk more and she said we will. And she did. But now she's leaving me on delivered on snapchat. 

We used to say goodnight to each other every single night. and now we can't even do that anymore since she leaves me on delivered. (like i post stories, she views it, yet doesnt open my snaps)

I wanna confront her saying "Hey i know you said you dont like opening snaps, etc, but we dont really talk much espicially at night and we stopped our goodnight snaps, are you busy orrr are you bored of this lol " (with emojis so she can take this lightly and not me being desperate). 

should i do that? it just sucks and i miss the old friendship
