I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this Iâ€™m falling out with my only close friend, Iâ€™m going back to school on Monday (which is stupid.), Iâ€™m failing school, I got rejected from an art highschool I wanted to go to..

And I just want my friend. I love her so much. But I feel like Iâ€™m just too obsessed with her, and I feel like she gets annoyed by me.

This is how our conversations usually go

â€œHiâ€
â€œSupâ€
â€œWell Iâ€™m tired lolâ€
â€œJSJSKSKKFâ€


I just feel like our friendship isnâ€™t the same. I keep trying to stop talking to her, but no matter how hard I try I keep going back (Iâ€™m trying to do that thing where I test to see if sheâ€™d talk to me if I didnâ€™t talk to her, since I always start our conversations, and she ends them). I just feel like suddenly everything is worthless. Iâ€™m worthless. I feel like I donâ€™t have the strength to go on anymore. Iâ€™m too goddamn weak. I donâ€™t shower, brush my teeth, brush my hair or even get dressed anymore. I donâ€™t get up, donâ€™t do exercise, donâ€™t eat.. and going back to school is making me extremely anxious. I donâ€™t want to go back. Iâ€™m freaking out. Iâ€™m either gonna get covid or the numbers will go up again. Iâ€™m now crying over the smallest things. My friend shows the slightest bit of rudeness or ignores me? I cry. People criticize my drawings? I cry. Being tired, or feeling any emotion? Cry.

Iâ€™m gonna be such a failure in life.
