The story of my dog Juno So we got juno from someone who found him and knew they couldn't take care of him.
But before that this is the story we know. His original family dumped him in the woods and he walked around in the woods for a unknown amount of time before he was found by a couple who had a cattle ranch. 
When they found him they took him in but realized since he's a husky he can't properly live in this environment so what they did was make a facebook post where people can adopt bigger dogs like huskys german Shepard and golden retriever. 
When my dad found the post he decided to drive the 4 hours to the ranch and 2 hours back . Since I was home sick at the time I was staying home and they told me they were going to a doctor appointment. After 2 hours I knew they were probably going to get Juno because they mentioned it to me before. 
And then they brought him home to where he is now.
Thanks for reading I just wanted to tell this story and if you want a bit more story about him I will tell. Also if you want a photo of him I'll give you one.
