Why did this happen? I have an art account and my main instagram account.

I just started my art account and nobody that I know, knows about it.

However one of my friends somehow found it, and put it in my group chat w all of my friends (as a compliment). Everyone saw my art acct and my post but none of my friends followed/even liked the post... why??

This may have a factor but I have 49 random followers and following only 3 on my art account
