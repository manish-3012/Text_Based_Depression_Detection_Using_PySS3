For The First Time in 4 Years I Finally Have A Friend So I have ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and that makes it very hard for me to make friends and talk to people. I also have anger issues and flare up easily. This was my very first day of school this year, we went public, and I didn't expect it to go well. 

So I arrived and I immediately started talking to this one girl, we'll call her Julia. Julia was super nice and introduced me to all her friends, who were also super nice! People have never been nice to me and it just felt amazing to be included and wanted. I know there's a lot of stuff going on right now, with Beirut and everything, so I know this isn't super important, but I just wanted to share! :)
