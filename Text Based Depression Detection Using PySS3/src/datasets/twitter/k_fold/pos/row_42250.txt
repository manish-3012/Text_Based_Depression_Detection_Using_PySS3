I need dating advice So I've been talking to this girl (she's way out of my league) but she's been showing me a good amount of interest in me and she also likes to play roblox but I don't I'd rather play warframe and shooter games but I play it (roblox) so we can get closer (not simping btw) but I've recently been pushing her to play warframe and she isn't rlly showing much interest in the game so I wanted to ask what's some fun things that we could do online because of the pandemic(or else I would've already taken her out)
