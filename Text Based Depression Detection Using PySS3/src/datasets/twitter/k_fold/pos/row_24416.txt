I mess up really bad My family has a bearded dragon. My parents wanted me to clean out his cage. His cage is a big glass tank. So me and my brother took it outside and I washed it. Then I dropped it and it broke. Then I tried to fix it and cut my hand. My hand isn't hurt that bad, but my parents are going to kill me when they get home. I'm so scared and I feel so awful about breaking the cage and I don't know what to do
