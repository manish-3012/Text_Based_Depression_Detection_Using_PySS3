Being dysphoric at 1:30am fucking sucks. Iâ€™m just thinking about how much I want some fem but not over the top clothes to feel less dysphoric and maybe pass as a girl, and then I remember that Iâ€™m stuck in a fat 5â€™10 boy body with a masculine bone structure.

I was going to send a late night message to my friend asking her to help me pick out fem clothes tomorrow but I didnâ€™t. What is the fucking point? It wonâ€™t make me happy with my body. If anything it will remind me how much I hate my body.

I couldnâ€™t even stand to look at myself in the mirror if I wanted to right now.

If anybody has any suggestions on clothing brands or kind of clothes I could get that would be awesome 

(seriously, I am completely and utterly clueless when it comes to clothes. Iâ€™ve always hated my body so Iâ€™ve never really cared about clothes before)

Thus ends my dysphoric rant at almost two in the morning.
