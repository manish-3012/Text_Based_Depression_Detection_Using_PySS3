So my class knows my voice is high ranged now... So all I want for Christmas is you was played in Ela today. I knew the lyrics so why not sing. Plus my voice is high ranged so I tend to like singing high ranged songs to see if I can hit the notes. So the last note was very high. I knew I had to hit it. It was like seeing a flour bag at the store. You don't know why you just gotta. So the teacher cut the music right before the note. So I'm sitting there hitting higher than the actual note.
