Unpopular opinion Lolicon does not always equal pedo. Similar to tentacle hentai, you may like seeing an octopus fucking a schoolgirl, but would be disgusted by seeing that in real life. Same thing goes with loli hentai. Because it isnâ€™t real and doesnâ€™t resemble real life all that much, there is a moral disconnect, because real morals donâ€™t apply in a fake world. It works that way for me at least. In the end of the day it has no connection based off reality because it isnâ€™t real. It is only pedo if it is based off a real person that exists in real life.
