For the teens that are able to vote and are going to vote in the presidential election, Please, please make sure that you are 100% going to support and agree with that person. Get as much info about the person and what they are about before you vote just because you don't like the person. This goes for whichever candidate. I'll say again, make sure you truly understand what each person is about before you just throw your vote around. Your vote matters so don't fuck up.
