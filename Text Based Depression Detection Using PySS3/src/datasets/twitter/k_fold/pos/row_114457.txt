any advice on stopping suicidal thoughts? it's one of my new years resolutions to have less thoughts about killing myself. I don't have the balls to actually do it but the thoughts about wanting to die are extremely painful and nothings for sure if one day it would cause me to snap and just end it anyhow. Then again most new years resolutions are never completed... well except for my last one which was to get a learners permit but that's a story for another day
