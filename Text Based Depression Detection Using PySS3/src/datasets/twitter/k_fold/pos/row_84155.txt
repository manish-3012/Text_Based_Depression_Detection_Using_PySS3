I have forging equipment and tools now I just went to St. Louis to go tonthe zoo. Coming back home, we stayed at my mom's town. My step-father not only taught me how to shave, but gave me a propane forge (including fiberglass and the coating), hammers/mallets, a train track rail turned small anvil, a 1 inch thick steel plate for a larger anvil, rebar and rebar scrap, several  sets of tongs, and an apron. I am beyond excited.
