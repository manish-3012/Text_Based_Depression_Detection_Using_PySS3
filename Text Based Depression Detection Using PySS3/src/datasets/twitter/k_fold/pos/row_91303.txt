KISSED MY GF LAST NIGHT! in this post i go through the entire night, but tl;dr at bottom.

i made a post last night about how i was going to do it, it didn't get very far but a few people supported me, and i want to thank those people. so i went to her house to hang out with her, since we don't get to see each other often, and i had to eat dinner with her parents which was uncomfortable to say the least, but afterwards we cuddled on the couch for a while, a few days before this we both told each other we wanted to kiss, so after we cuddled for maybe an hour she took her glasses off and kissed me really quick, i told her i didn't get to even do anything, so she said fine and we kissed again, a bit more romantically and affectionately, it was so nice, i'm very happy. we cuddled for a long time and kissed a few more times, she told me i did good, and that i was a better kisser than her ex (don't get me started on him, i have a post about him as well that tells you how i feel about him). also her dog kept trying to crawl in between us while we cuddled, which was both annoying and cute. i'm really glad i kissed her and i already can't wait to do it again.

tl;dr i kissed her a few times, she said i did well, i'm very happy.
