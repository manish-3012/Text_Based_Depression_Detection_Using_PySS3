I almost got sex trafficked today Basically I was picking my dog up from the groomer. I was waiting in my car looking into the window of the groomer because I could see my pup. This car full of high school girls parked next to me, and one of them got out and put a sticky note on my window, something about her social media. I flipped her off. I got home and told my mom about it and she basically said that my town has a history of high school girls trafficking alone teenage males and I dodged a giant bullet by having my window up and door locked. I am really not sure how I feel about this. Just for comforts sake, have any of you had  similar experiences? I am honestly aware of how fake this sounds, I really am, but it is real. If there is any details you want for me to tell you, please ask. 

Also, extra details, it was about 7:30, an hour ago, very dark, in a mostly vacant parking lot. I was in my old beater.
