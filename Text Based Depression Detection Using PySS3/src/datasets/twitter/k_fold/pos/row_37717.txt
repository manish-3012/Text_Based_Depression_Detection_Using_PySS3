Goodbye innocence One time my friend was over and we both wanted to play roblox (I was 8 at the time). My dad lended me an extra laptop so my friend could play. We both opened up the laptop to find that the only window that was opened was Pornhub, (Again I was 8). We closed the laptop and later my mom had to explain to me. So that was fun.
