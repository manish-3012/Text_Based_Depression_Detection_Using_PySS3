Someone please tell me what my IQ is after what I just did Sometimes when I cant sleep I go lay on our family room couch and watch a movie till I fall asleep. The only issue with that is my parents room is connected to the family room by their door that squeaks when its shut unless our air-conditioner kicks on and it pulls it shut because of the air vents and stuff. Anyway I saw my dads phone on through their door and didn't want to wake either of them or risk them telling me to go to bed cause I have school in the morning. So my big brain kicks in and I turn the thermostat up 3 degrees so it will kick on and pull their door shut like normal, then turn it back up so if tomorrow morning they check it and see it hasn't been changed  and it freaking WORKED.
