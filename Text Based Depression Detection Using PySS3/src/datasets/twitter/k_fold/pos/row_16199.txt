Two students in my school got COVID Yea, so basically, a 17-year-old and a 13-year-old got the virus. Both of them were siblings, and it was said they got it from their parents.  Out of the 1000+ students and teachers in my school, only those who were in close contact (50+?) went for testing. I really hope I don't need to go. I know the two who got it, nice and friendly people. Luckily, I had not seen them for a while, since the older one had IGSCE exams. The school's closed down on Wednesday, reopening on the 29th. I hope, hope, hope that I don't get it, and school is closed for longer
