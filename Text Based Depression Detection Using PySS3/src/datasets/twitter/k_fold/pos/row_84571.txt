Am I the only one that feels like a cunt if I donâ€™t send the last text in a conversation... Like you just spent time talking to me and I just left you there speaking without adding anything (unless youâ€™ve already said goodbye). Iâ€™ve just wasted a few minutes and am just sitting there reading not answering.
