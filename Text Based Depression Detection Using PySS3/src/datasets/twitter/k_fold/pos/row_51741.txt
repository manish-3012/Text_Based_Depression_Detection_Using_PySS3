Iâ€™m sick of being considered an I-Donâ€™t-Carigan. â€œI wanna move up north and be a Canadian or hang down low with the nice Australians. I donâ€™t wanna be another â€˜I-dont-cariga. Whatâ€™re we gonna Franco, Franco Un-American.â€

Not every person in the United States has a confederate flag painted on the hood of their $75,000 truck that gets 13 MPG. Most people here drive eco-friendly cars, that get at least 30 MPG. While weâ€™re on the topic of Mile Per Gallon, thatâ€™s another thing. We are taught the metric system ALONGSIDE the American-standard system. We know what a fucking kilometer is, we also know what Celsius is. Also the obesity rate in the U.S. Is only 42%, compared to 64% in Canada.

 Also it wasnâ€™t our decision to go to war in the Middle East, it was the mind of a deranged president in the 2000s. Oh and before you lash out it me and say â€œwell that means you supported 9/11â€ we didnâ€™t go to war with the country associated with the terrorism group. And also funny enough one of the biggest oil companies weâ€™re â€œprotectingâ€ in the Middle East is **BRITISH** Petroleum. 

Letâ€™s get on the topic of wealthiness! WE ARENâ€™T FUCKING RICH! Iâ€™M SICK OF GETTING CALLED â€œRICHâ€ AND â€œSELFISHâ€ WHEN Iâ€™M TYPING THIS FROM A LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE IN SHITTY SUBURBAN OHIO!

SO YEAH, I DONâ€™T WANNA BE A FUCKING I-DONâ€™T-CARIGAN!
