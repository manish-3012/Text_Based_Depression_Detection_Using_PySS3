Has anyone else mastered the art of being so quiet... That your parents canâ€™t hear you rage when you fall in lava in Minecraft. Cause I have and itâ€™s gotten to the point where I just keep a straight face and donâ€™t make any noise or anything. I donâ€™t show excitement or anger or anything what would I do this is not a joke Iâ€™ve gone from hiding sound to trapped and canâ€™t make any help.
