What is the cheapest way I can eat for a while So, long story short, got into an argument with my parents, and now I've got to find something to eat. Figured the teen chef prodigies among you all may be able to help. I've got access to the kitchen, but to be honest I can't cook very well, so ideally not something too hard. I'm probably not going to need this for ages, so it doesn't have to be super nutritious, just substantial enough. And I've got a supermarket really close so I should have access to most common foods. Any info or advice would be really appreciated, thank you in advance
