I hate my mere existence and just want everything to end... Sorry if this is your general depressed teenager post again for the thousandth time, but I just had enough of everything and had to write it out somewhere...
I hate my friends, I hate my parents, my family and most of all I hate myself with my unlimited stupidity and incompetence. I hate this world for what it is right now and I regret every decision I ever made.

If I could choose I would just want to be hit by a lighting to end myself without a warning because I know Im to much of a pussy to ever finish the job of ending my horrible life.
