I need help holding the dumbest scientific experience ever So there is that theory that dark side of the moon was supposed to be played along side the wizard of Oz itâ€™s probably wrong but fun

So the idea is to branch this out with other films and albums to see if there any coronation between them and to truly find out if something like this exists in the world

So if you wanna jump on the cause let me give you the rules

You make note of the film and album
You turn down the volume of the film and play it along side the album (make a note of the time on the film when you start to play the album you chose)
Then for every coincidence make a note of it and use this pointing system to see if there is a relation
Lyrics match (the film lines and song lyrics are EXACTLY the same) - 3 points
Rhythmic match (actions match to beat if the song) - 3 points
Lyrics match 2 (if the lyrics of the song are similar to the film lines) - 2 points
Vibe (the general emotion of the song matches what is happening on screen) - 1 point 

Once you add up everything divide the final number by the amount of minutes the film is for a general points per minute

Comment: if you actually do this (thanks you) please comment the album the film and the ppm (points per minute) and any occurrences that donâ€™t apply to or are mentioned in the rules

With all the data gathered I will make an spreadsheet documenting what we discover and the film song combo with the highest ppm (will post link in a follow up post)
