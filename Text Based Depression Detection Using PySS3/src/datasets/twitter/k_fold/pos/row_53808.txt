Is this weird? Iâ€™m making a â€œFriend applicationâ€ form to send out to a person I want to be a friend with. I have little friends, and her being of the opposite sex it seems complicated. So instead of walking up to her and asking her to be my friend. I instead listed facts about how I donâ€™t have a crush on her (which is widely suspected) and how I just want friendship. And then I list my morals and hobbies to let her make a decision. I know itâ€™s unconventional but is it weird?
