How do you guys deal with social anxiety? I will be  the most sensitive person you will ever meet. Like, I will feel sad or I will feel like im not enough for my friends when they just excluded me in their group project. Ugh I hate myself. I used to be the most positive. I used to be the joker, the one who's got ur back, the counselor fo ur problems and I hate when others comfort me cos I was supposed to be the one who comforts them. I hate feeling vulnerable.
