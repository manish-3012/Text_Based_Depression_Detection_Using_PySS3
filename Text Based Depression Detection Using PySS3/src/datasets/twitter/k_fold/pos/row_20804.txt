Ok guys, just here me out... letâ€™s all be racist. Everyoneâ€™s gotta be racist Cause think about it. If everyoneâ€™s racist, then nobody is racist because racism has become so normal. Itâ€™s kinda like organic food in France: because every food in France is organic, nothing is labeled as organic. I feel the same way about bullying, polygamy, pedophilia, and cheese.
