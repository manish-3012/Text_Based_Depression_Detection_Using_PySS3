ik everyone hates them rn but the mods are people too, im sure their lives are as hard as everyone elseâ€™s and they take out sm time to mod which canâ€™t be easy and theyâ€™re trying to do their jobs with enough hate alr. yea, some of the bans were harsh but again, theyâ€™re people too and deserve some respect.
