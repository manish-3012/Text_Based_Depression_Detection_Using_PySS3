Uh oh I did a major fucky wucky time to get in the forever box... My dad found me on my phone and I tried hiding it from him because I wanted to have privacy with my phone but he asked for my code and if I didn't give it he'd not buy me or my brother the Xbox one X and my brother would hate me for that so I gave him the code... He saw nothing too bad on Reddit since he doesn't know how to see post/comment history or chats but he then went on discord and he checked all my dms and 2 out of three servers thing is on the 3rd server I said I was bisexual so I just dodged one hellava bullet because I'm not ready at fucking all to tell.
