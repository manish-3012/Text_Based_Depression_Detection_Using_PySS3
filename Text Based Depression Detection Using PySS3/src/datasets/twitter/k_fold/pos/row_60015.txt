I'm starting to think I'm the problem (TW?) You ever just lose your friends to the point where you start thinking you are the problem but then you look back at the situations and realize people just treat you like shit for no reason and that's why you have trust issues but you know there are better people out there but you also kinda doubt that 

I need a hug ;-;
