Dear late October Me, I know itâ€™s hard going to this new school and I know youâ€™re scared and donâ€™t know what to do and feel like youâ€™re completely on your own,l. But just hang in there  for a bit, youâ€™re gonna feel like youâ€™re never gonna find people you can relate to but just wait for a tiny bit longer. Youâ€™re gonna find a group of friends that youâ€™ll spend hours playing monopoly and uno with for days in a row and still manage to be dying from laughter with on the fifth day of playing the same games. Youâ€™re gonna have a group of friends youâ€™ll be video calling even though you literally already spend the whole day with them and making plans to see each other again.

No, all your problems wonâ€™t magically disappear in a couple of months but I can promise you in that period of time it can a still get so much better :)
