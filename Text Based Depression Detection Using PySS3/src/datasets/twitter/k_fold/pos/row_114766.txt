lmao why cant i do anything right (longish rant, but not that angsty i promise i can be funny sometimes) aka Late Night Thoughts with Teeth (tldr at end)

alright woke up at 2am for no reason. no fucking reason other than my tiny brain hates me. so basically, it's like "heyyy teeth. ya know what would be fun ?? how bout we question ourself for an hour lol" and i go ?? and my monkey brain goes "yeah lol lets remember how we fucking suck dude" and i go "oh ok cool. lets do it. this won't be fun but idc"

so like. noticed in my moment of overthinking that i literally can not do shit for shit. that makes no sense but fuck it. 
i mean, everything i do is wrong either way. 
for example. drawing. i do draw? ill probably get angry and end up crying. i don't draw? i'm wasting time, i should be fucking drawing, what am i doing?
anyways that's a minor example. 

tw for this part probably 

anyways noticed, again, what the fuck is the point of being suicidal?? literally, i suck regardless. i do it? i'm making people sad, probably a traumatic moment for people close to me, etc etc. i don't do it? i'm making people sad, probably a traumatic moment for people close to me, etc etc. 
the fuck??

but basically this logic can be applied to anything. i go to school? ill probably get overwhelmed and have a breakdown by the end of the day, not pleasant for anyone. i don't go to school? i stay at home wasting my life and ignoring my work, not pleasant for anyone. i'll get yelled at either way so what's the point?

i feel like an asshole regardless of what i do. if i do nothing, everything, or a mix, i always have to do it Wrong. so what's the point?

this isn't really going anywhere and i could probably make better points if i tried but its now 2:30 am and i'm tired, so ill leave it. 

tldr; woke up at 2 am and started overthinking about how shitty i am bc i have a tiny brain. i try to be funny. it doesn't work. goodnight. yes, my name is teeth, fuck you &lt;3
