Damn Iâ€™m single Everywhere I look I see people being happy with someone they like, possibly even love. Why canâ€™t I feel this feeling. Why canâ€™t I obtain the simple thing that is a relationship which so many others reach so easily. Is there something wrong with me? Is it my face? My body? The way my voice sounds? Or maybe itâ€™s all of these things and more that donâ€™t seem appealing to anyone. Nobody but myself. I see myself as a pretty nice guy who plays music and video games, and keeps his body healthy while also being at least a little funny and maintains good grades. But whenever someone says they are looking for a nice guy who can make them laugh, they never look at me. Iâ€™m always the guys who comforts the girl but never has a chance with them. All I really want is to have someone there to care for, and to care for you. But somehow it feels as though no other girl feels the same way I do. And again, if they do, the feeling is never aimed at nor meant for me. It doesnâ€™t make any sense to me. I donâ€™t see myself as the type of person that is unlike able and in my own eyes I have lots of qualities to my name that would make someone lucky to have me. Maybe I just donâ€™t see the people that do, but nobody feels the same way towards me. Rather they donâ€™t feel anything for me. Yet despite me being the way I am, people I know that act similarly to how I do seem to have no problem with their own relationships even with how much we have in common. So why would it be any more difficult for me? What am I doing wrong. I need answers.
