Just wondering but are your house "chaotic"? Y'know like,does any of your family members are always in rage everyday or how your little sister constantly cries.

Or how your parents are usually in a bad mood.Or how(for some reason)your parents always treat your siblings like shit meanwhile they treat you as if you're the "golden child".Just,the house is never in peace in general


Y'know,something like that.I wonder if there's someone that has the same experience as I do or hell,I'm sure most people have been through worse yet here I am whining about it
