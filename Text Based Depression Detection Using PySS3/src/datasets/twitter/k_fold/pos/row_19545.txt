A little tip for glasses users A little tip:
Iâ€™m a licensed diver and while doing my course I learned quickly that your goggles steam up very quickly. My instructor advised me to spit into them and rub them. It works and us the only way to use goggles. I have since stopped diving but I find that the same trick works while wearing my glasses. Itâ€™s kind of gross but not like anyone notices that u spit on ur glasses. Sure u can wear your glasses on top of your mask but that depends on what way the wind is blowing.
