can someone read my creative writing piece for English? _x000D_I turn the corner and run headfirst into someone. They are cold. I donâ€™t have time to see their face before they bite my arm and run away. â€œWhat the-â€, I say before realising Iâ€™ve dropped the dog leash. I run to catch up with the young, brown retriever I named Gwaine. I look around for the weirdo that left imprints on my arm, but all I see is the rain starting to pour. I hear shouting of something indistinguishable and decide itâ€™s time to get out of here. â€œWhat is with people today?â€, I wonder as I head towards my flat.

The wound on my arm bleeds slightly so I donâ€™t think much of it. I do feel dizzy though, so I decide to take a lie down. But the dog wonâ€™t stop barking, disrupting any sleep I hoped to get. I grab a glass from the kitchen and head into the bathroom to find the paracetamol. My arm starts bleeding more so I decide to clean that as well. I look in the mirror. I look awful. I'm paper white, my short dirty blonde hair is stuck to my forehead and I have dark bags under my blue eyes. I look like a ghost. Another wave of nausea runs over me, so I quickly take the paracetamol and run back to my room.

I canâ€™t sleep. Gwaine wonâ€™t stop barking and I keep hearing rumbles of thunder, so I just sit for a bit. I feel a bit better, so I decide to get up and watch the lightning. I go to stand but I fall back down and smack my head off my bedpost. My visionâ€™s spotty, and my eyes begin to shut. I canâ€™t tell if my headâ€™s bleeding. The last thing I remember is that dog barking.

When I wake, Iâ€™m no longer in my bedroom. I'm sprawled out on the living room floor. My backâ€™s sore from lying funny and my head aches after knocking myself out. The bite on my arm itches like hell. The TV is on. I donâ€™t remember turning it on - I donâ€™t even remember leaving my bedroom. There's a strange woman on the TV though. Her straight blonde hair is shoulder length and perfectly cut, her face completely symmetrical and she doesnâ€™t even blink. I decide she must be CGI because sheâ€™s so perfect. But her voice is more noticeably unnatural. She speaks in a monotone voice and her words are choppy. Not as obvious as Google Translate but still flawed. What sheâ€™s speaking about is even stranger: sheâ€™s saying there is no hope, we are all doomed and we shouldâ€™ve obeyed. Obeyed what? I try change the channel. She's still there. I try again. Sheâ€™s still there. I turn it off and on again. Sheâ€™s still there. Hackers? I wonder where Gwaine is. Heâ€™ll be hungry. I thought heâ€™d be barking his head off by now. I get up off the floor, feeling my head rush. Iâ€™m about to leave the room when I see crumpled sheets of paper with my handwriting on it. I read what they say:

â€œTuesday 26th: My skin itches. It feels like thereâ€™s bugs underneath it. A woman on the TV says the world has ended. I am alone, only Gwaine is here to keep me company, but he wonâ€™t stop barking.
_x000D_
Friday 29th: Something is wrong. My veins are black. My teeth are sharp. I keep forgetting things â€“ like my name! The dog wonâ€™t stop barking. I keep waking up in random places in my flat. I go through periods of gaining consciousness and not remembering anything from before.
_x000D_
Saturday 30th: Itchy. Scratchy. Dog stopped barking, probably cause I ate his face in. Going through fits o-â€_x000D_
This canâ€™t be right. Itâ€™s not been a week. I was only asleep for a day. I check the TV guide to confirm my suspicions, but it doesnâ€™t. It says itâ€™s Monday the 1st. What does this mean? Whereâ€™s my dog?
_x000D_
â€œGWAINE!â€, I shout, desperately hoping for his charming face to appear. He doesnâ€™t. I open the door to the hall when the smell hits me: the smell of rotting flesh. I just know then that itâ€™s my best friend.
_x000D_
I run. Down the hall, through the door, down the stairs and out onto the streets. I ignore the rain drenching my clothes. I donâ€™t stop until I see the mob of seemingly decomposing bodies with ripped and bloody clothing stumble over each other in my direction. Then theyâ€™re all blown to bits, just like that. 
_x000D_
â€œHEY!â€, a girlâ€™s voice shouts at me. She runs over to me, her long dark hair swinging madly in its ponytail. She has a kind but tough face. â€œWhatâ€™re you doing out in the open?â€
_x000D_
â€œWhat?â€
_x000D_
â€œItâ€™s not safe out hereâ€, I stare at her blankly. â€œDo you have any clue whatâ€™s going on?â€
_x000D_
â€œNo? What are those things?â€
_x000D_
â€œI call them mutts, but theyâ€™re practically zombies. Contagious experiments gone wrong. Now theyâ€™ve taken over everyone.â€, She looks at the bite on my arm and hands me a water bottle with a clumpy orange liquid in it. â€œDrink it. It'll stop the mutation temporarily.â€, Thereâ€™s something trustworthy about her so I do. It tastes vile, like orange juice and toothpaste mixed in with crushed ibuprofen. I gag and force it down. â€œAnd here, take this.â€, she hands me a black waterproof jacket, I take it gratefully. I donâ€™t know when I started shivering but itâ€™s uncontrollable now although the rain has stopped to a slow drizzle. â€œWhyâ€™re you out here alone?â€
_x000D_
â€œI... donâ€™t know. I woke up on the floor and there were these notes written by me, but I donâ€™t remember writing them and it says I killed my dog...â€, my voice trails off.
_x000D_
â€œItâ€™s okay. It happens after youâ€™re bitten. It happened to my sister. Iâ€™m Eos by the way.â€, she holds her hand out for me to shake, I take it.
_x000D_
â€œIâ€™m Arthur.â€_x000D_
