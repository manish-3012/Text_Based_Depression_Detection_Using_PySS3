I wish politics is about appealing to the average people rather than appealing the extremists Politics should be focused on improving the average person, not appealing to the loud minorities on both sides. I don't want someone who bows down to corporations, and I don't want someone who bows down to progressive revolutionaries. Trump is a far-right corporate stooge and Biden is a far-left revolutionary stooge. None of them will serve the people and will just cause more chaos. Both the left and right are clowns. Increasing government welfare too much resulted in the death of California. Increasing tax cuts and support of corporations too much resulted in the death of the Rust Belt. If the US continues to ignore the interests of its people, it will go down as a whole.

I miss the old days when everyone is more moderate and sane.
