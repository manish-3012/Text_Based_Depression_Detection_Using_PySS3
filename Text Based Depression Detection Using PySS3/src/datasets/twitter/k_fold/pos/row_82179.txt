The mods recommended we do self-introductions, so here we go. Okay, so, you can call me Aiden, 

Iâ€™m a male between the ages of 13-16 (this is the Internet, forgive me for not wanting to disclose my age)

Single, straight

I occasionally draw, I play video games (Iâ€™m not a gamer! That word comes with far too many negative stereotypes and I only do it as a hobby (granted a hobby that I have 15,000~ collective hours in over the past decade)).

Iâ€™ll go with one of those Q&amp;A style info charts 

Favorite game?
Watch_Dogs (1 or 2, but I prefer the vibes of 1), or this little indie roblox game called *Entry Point* (75 infiltrator for those who know the game)

Jobs?
Aside from professional grade and scale furniture making and carpentry with my father, none

What game do you have most hours in? 
Probably roblox, but since that isnâ€™t recoded, itâ€™ll have to go to another indie game, *Scrap Mechanic*, which Iâ€™ve been playing since 2016 with 1,600~ hours rn

Favorite show?
*Burn Notice* starting Jeffery Donovan and Bruce Campbell (and coby Bell in season 4 and onward) 2007-2013 if I recall correctly (with a close runner up being clone wars, no spoilers in the comments please)

Other fun facts?
The past 9 girls Iâ€™ve asked out have all turned me down, I have an Oculus Rift (But am about to get a Quest 2, I could talk all day about the state of the VR market)

Pleasure meeting you all

Iâ€™ll answer any questions in the comments
