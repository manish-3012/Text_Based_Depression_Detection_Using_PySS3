more fucked up things my teachers did the last post about this blew up, so I'm posting more

1: One of my ex-friends got really mad at me and forced his religion on me just because I said it was fine to be gay. I called him homophobic. He then told the teacher and I was written up and my parents verbally assaulted me at home. It happened again and I had to tell him gay means happy to get him to stop picking with me and my friends

2: Kindergarten manipulation. My teacher would sprout bullshit like "everyone is each other's friend!" When I found out that not everybody was friends my world fell apart. If anyone says "everyone is friends here" or 'we are a family", get out of there immediately. The same teacher forced me to clean milk I didn't spill and punished me more for saying it wasn't mine.
