How to talk to someone you have basically nothing in common with so theres this person who I think I have a crush on but want to know them better and we very rarely talk and don't have any classes together this year, I have them on snapchat but we never talk there either. theres basically no reason I could use as an excuse lol. anyway yeah how do I do that. also might delete later since my friends know my reddit account.
