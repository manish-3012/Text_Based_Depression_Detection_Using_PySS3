Why I want to cut contact with a highschool friend. She stopped messaging me after I refused to help her move some luggage because I really didn't feel like it.

When she feels down I always listen to her, when I feel down and talk to her all I get is either "I have it worse" or "yeah me too" and then I'm the one comforting her.

I also realized that I'm always kind of bored when I'm with her and I'm never excited to meet her, probably because we only meet when she needs to do some boring errands.

I told her about a girl I was crushing on and she called her a dumbass, and she's always insecure about our friendship, usually asking things like "I'm your best friend, right ?" Or "you won't replace me right ?" Or "wow we've been friends for almost x time" or the one I hate the most "Why are you not asking about me ?"

To be honest I don't even know why we stayed friends after highschool was over.
