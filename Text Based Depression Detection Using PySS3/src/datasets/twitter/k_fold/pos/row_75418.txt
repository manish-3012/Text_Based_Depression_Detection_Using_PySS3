Dumb shit that happened at school today... 1) me and my friends have started a Danny DeVito, Troompa Loompa, and weird kid cult. Fun.

2) some tiny child starts mocking me because I broke my foot. I think to myself "oh what fun it is to break... A tiny child's kneecaps!" I have the weaponry. My crutches hurt 

Anyways. That was fun. Have a nice day.
