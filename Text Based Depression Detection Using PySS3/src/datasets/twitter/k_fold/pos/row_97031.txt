The idiots that I live with. So my little sister just got a notification that a trojan virus was detected on her computer. Our mom saw it but didnâ€™t do shit. I donâ€™t know much about computer viruses but Iâ€™m pretty sure a trojan virus is pretty bad. All my shit better not get lost because of their ignorance.
