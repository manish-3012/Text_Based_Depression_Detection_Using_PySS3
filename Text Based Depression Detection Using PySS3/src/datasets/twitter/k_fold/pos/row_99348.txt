I just took a blast to my past on a Kpop forum... I WAS SO FUCKING ANNOYING HOLY HOW DID I HAVE FRIENDS ON THERE JESUS CHRIST . Iâ€™m crying though :( I met some really chill people there including this one girl (though at the time she was an entity to me with no gender, ) and it was a weird hate love relationship (no romantic feelings lol mightâ€™ve just been my hormones)  :( and she was like 21 at the time and I was like 15 and thatâ€™s so surprising considering the maturity difference but omg :( we would joke around and Iâ€™d drag her faves through the ground. Then there was this tumblr page that got made and people called me annoying on there and I got hella depressed because I had no life in real life and that place was my only source of happiness. 

Looking back Iâ€™m not surprised at the amount of haters lmao. Oh itâ€™s just all very nostalgic and I want to cry. I logged in anonymously to see my old posts and inbox, but most of them were deleted and the ones that werenâ€™t, were recent and were not during my peak celebrity phase on there ðŸ¥º Iâ€™m only kind of sad I lost all my friends I made there since I left since Iâ€™m not comfortable being friends with people when Iâ€™m not happy.
