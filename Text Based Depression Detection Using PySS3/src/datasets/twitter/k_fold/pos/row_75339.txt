Communication troubles Okay, I'm writing this on mobile, so there might be typos.

Here's the thing. I've been having trouble with, well, everything. I feel inadequate, and useless all the time. I haven't been sleeping, either, in case that might be important. So I've been cutting myself, and it helps -in an odd way- with the feelings. I've been talking to a close friend, and she says that I might be depressed, and should talk to my parents, but I'm not sure how. If you can help, please do. I think I'm fine, but my friend was insistent. What do I do? Do I tell them? Or do I keep it in?
