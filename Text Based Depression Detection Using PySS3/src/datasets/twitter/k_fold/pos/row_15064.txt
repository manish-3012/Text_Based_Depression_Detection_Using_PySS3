I just reported this comment Hey, just thought I'd let you know that I reported this thread to the police who are on the case of finding out your location and shutting the site down, I spent an hour with the internet's customer service department, and I've also emailed every major and local radio/news/media corporation today and am awaiting response. I'm more than confident that through my contacts and sources I will find your address and then publicly humiliate you and out you for the being the most incredibly mentally disturbed person I have seen in a long time. I hope the choice you made to make this immature post was worth the hassle your about to get. I understand you like the aggressive comments so instead I decided to be practical. I believe you are a very sad, immature person, and thus made a controversial post on the internet to get some attention and thus feel like you have a purpose. I hope you mature, find someone, and realize that your not only upsetting everyone else, but you are actually the one who is lonely and upset and needs to find some peace within their-self, otherwise you will have a very lonely time on earth my friend
