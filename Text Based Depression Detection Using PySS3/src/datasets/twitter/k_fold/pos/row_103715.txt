Anyone else? Why is that every time I share my beliefs, and call my mother out on her racist words, that Iâ€™m the bad guy for â€œdisrespectingâ€ her?  Goddamnit, I love and care for my parents so much, but this causes me so much unnecessary pain.  I want to be an adult so goddamn bad and move out of this hell hole.  Please tell me someone can relate.  I need to know things are going to be okay for me, and my friends who have openly disagreed with her as well.
