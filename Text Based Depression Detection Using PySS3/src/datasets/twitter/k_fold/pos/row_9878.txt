Ugh...I HATE not being a teenager teenager. What do I mean by that? Well. I'm a teenager, but I feel so distant from most people around me at my age, and I thought talking here, I'd find someone like me. AND, I'm doing my best not to do the trope "Not Like The Other Boys," I really am. AND, what I'm about to say, I'm not saying everyone acts like this. 

So! What are some things that differ from other people in age range of me? I hate moooost... Widely liked things. Such as Trashy rap, Tik Tok, E-Boy/E-Girl/Soft-Boy/Soft-Girl bullshâ€”t, Starbucks, GTA, Pewdiepie, Minecraft, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Y'know- Things that are widley liked for my age group! I know that a lot of people share my dislike, but the like to dislike ratio is so large, I just put it.

Can't see the appeal of those things. And going deeper, into my liking and disliking, as a young, nerdy person, hell there's a lot about that I dislike. Things, such as most modern memes, like cheems, or that girls vs boys format. Hell stuff like Minecraft and Pewdiepie as well! I don't despise it, but I dislike it. I can go into detail of why, but I'm not. 

So, the big question. Does... anyone else feel how I feel?
