How do I help a depressed friend? I have friend who has been feeling really depressed this week and I'm trying to help him but he keeps pushing me away.

Maybe I should leave him alone but I'm worried it'll make him feel worse.

I really want him to feel better, I don't want to be someone who ghosts a person who's depressed while I could do something about it.

On Monday I sent him a long text of aggressive positivity and it helped him for the night but the next day he was feeling down again and we have only talked about how I want him to feel better and he just keeps asking why do I care and he doesn't want me to feel worried about him.
