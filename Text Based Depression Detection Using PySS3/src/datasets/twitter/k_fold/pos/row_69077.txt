I need some advise from you guys I'll try to make this short as I can,  so long story short, my brother found himself a wonderful gf and now they are enjoying eachother far away from home.  My brother is 23 yo and i'm 15 yo. So my brother is there and im at home with my parents and they won't leave me alone because IM the reason that my brother is there and IM the reason that kids at my age wont talk to their parents and IM the reason that they will soon be old and die.  So now all of a sudden they want to know what I love to do and what I hate to do.  I need some advise from you guys to help me get them off my back because now no matter what I do or how I do it they will want to know.  They even took my door off because everything in our family shouldn't be a secret.  I really need your advise on how I should get those 2 super annoying CIA agents off my back .

(BTW English isn't my language so sorry if I made any grammer mistakes : )
