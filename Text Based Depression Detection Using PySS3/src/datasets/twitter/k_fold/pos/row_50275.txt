Something fun to think of. Say if sites like YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, and/or Tiktok didn't exist. And where certain people would be. Take for example people like Azzyland, Markiplier, Rosanna Pansino, or hell Carter Sharer. They all studied or graduated with very beneficial degrees that can get you far in life. Compared to the talentless channels like Infinite Lists, Alinity, and even Pokimane. If it weren't for the internet they wouldn't even be known. They'd have dead end jobs like the rest of us.

Again this is one of those hypothetical cases of look at someone/thing, and think what if they weren't where they were.
