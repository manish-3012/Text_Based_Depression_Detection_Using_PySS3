What do you guys think about going back to school? My school is going back next week and we are supposedly doing social distancing (which makes no sense, as EVERYONE is going back, no online classes) and we have to wear masks. Now I donâ€™t mind masks but I cannot wear them for 9 hours a day (bus rides, school, band afterwards). So I wonâ€™t be able to focus. My states cases are still rising. What do you guys think about school this year?
