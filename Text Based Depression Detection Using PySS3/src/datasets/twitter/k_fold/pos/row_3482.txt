Had a fight with a friend today. Hi guys. This is my first time posting here and I need to vent a little. I got in a fight with my friend through Discord in a group, he was acting weird as per usual. Iâ€™ve been his friend for 7 years back from when he transferred to our school, he is a little immature always acting weird and creepy and I was the one keeping him in check. 

I was a little upset that day due to my prior argument with my mom and so when we were talking in the group, and dude was acting creepy towards a girl he barley even know since we just started school. So I guess I lashed out at him saying â€œBro get a fucking life. Cause your life right now is a jokeâ€ and then we just bashed each other back and forth until he said â€œfuck thisâ€ and left the group. 

After that he blocked me on every social media platform, I canâ€™t even contact him. I donâ€™t even have his cell number. Everyone who knows me is telling me itâ€™s not my fault but I feel like it really is my fault. I just keep on protecting him saying good things about him. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m okay or not but it hurts. It really hurts. Dudeâ€™s been my best friend for so long and this was the straw that broke us. Been crying non stop. I need help guys. I donâ€™t wanna lose him.
