Iâ€™m a 14 year old girl and I want to invite three boys over to play Mario kart and smash bros But I have absolutely no idea how to invite them. I donâ€™t know them THAT well, but I know they all play those games. I really want to get to know them but Iâ€™m a bit socially awkward and my friends would definitely ship me with them. Please help!!
