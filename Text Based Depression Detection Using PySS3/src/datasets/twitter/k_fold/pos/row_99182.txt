I think Iâ€™ve found the one Long, tldr at the bottom

So in the beginning of quarantine, I met a long time friend again (he moved cities) then we hung out a lot then he introduced me to his cousins and stuff and theyâ€™re hella cool people, they were really fucking cool then we made a group chat with 5 people, me, K,H,A,G theyâ€™re the main people. We met and theyâ€™re really fucking cool people. Fast forward 5 months. Weâ€™ve really expanded the Group chats inevitable demise. We had good things happen like a meme battle, face reveals (hadnâ€™t know K and H) in real life. That happend, then I got to know K a lot more, liked her but not my style. H tho ducking really cool person and I thought was the one for a while. Then we called about pranking people then her friend said that I had a cute voice. Thatâ€™s the start, we chatted for a while, pretty cool person. Fast forward a week, and we start talking about personal stuff and by now sheâ€™s amazing. Has a great personality, cheery and ducking amazing. Fast forward to now, and we talk about each other and how the opposite person is amazing then I say I love you, apologize because itâ€™s a little weird.

She then says â€œI love you too manâ€ I was on cloud 9 sheâ€™s amazing. We talk then we keep on saying I love you and stuff then we go to bed. Thats all that happened so far but holy shit sheâ€™s amazing. Idk if that was yeah I love you man as a friend thing but holy fuck I donâ€™t care that was awesome

TLDR: I found a hella cool girl, said I love you while I like her and she said I love you back.
