These days I feel quite useless Like recently my life has been really confusing I'm starting to lose me bff of 5 years and I feel like ppl are making accomplishments except me 


I also feel like I'm the ugliest person that's in school in my school at least every girl is really pretty I usually see guys asking them out and all and I feel so left out sometimes cause of how I look and I feel like I really want to have a mental breakdown cause of all this pressure I'm under...
