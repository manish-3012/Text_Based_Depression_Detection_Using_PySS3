I dumped my boyfriend. He was just generally neglecting me to hang out with the boys or play video games (Iâ€™ve been asking to call for the past week). Couldnâ€™t even be fuckinf serious with me. 

He was my best friend but I made a mistake. I canâ€™t even speak to him without getting angry.

Iâ€™m sad and angry and just feeling dumb at the same time.
