Why do feel this urge to grow up? I dont why but I'm just like in panic mode tonight about it. I dont know whether I should save up for a fun thing or get my motorcycle license and a motorcycle. I'm kind of panicking cause what if I make the wrong choice and I never get around to the other thing? I dont know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life.
