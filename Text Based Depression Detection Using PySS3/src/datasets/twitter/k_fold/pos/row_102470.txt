I'm looking to put together a team. A team of very talented people. Or whoever comments on this post. I like storytelling. I have hundreds of ideas. My favorite is animation. Problem: my art skills are horrid. 

I want to release a youtube series, but at my skill level, can't.

So I am looking for animators with the following traits:

- decent art skills.

- trustworthy.

-can access youtube.

 Now, I can't pay you, but you only have to sacrifice some free time. 

I'm in the GMT time zone. I'm posting this late at night. I plan to repost it when I wake up. 

DM me if you are interested. I will pick people and put them together in a group.
