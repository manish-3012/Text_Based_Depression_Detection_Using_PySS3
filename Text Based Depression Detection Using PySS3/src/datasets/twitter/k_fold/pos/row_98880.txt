the fact that basic hygeine could prevent a global pandemic is fucking terrifying  

the reason im bringing this up is of course because of the coronavirus. Back in january/february we were all told to wash our hands and sneeze into our elbows and it could prevent a possible pandemic.

NOW  
The fact that were in a GLOBAL PANDEMIC proove that people dont fucking care about basic hygeine, even if OTHER PEOPLES LIVES DEPENDED ON IT!!!

I swear with all the people not wearing their masks correctly, or simply not wearing it at all we will be having a second wave soon, mark my words...
