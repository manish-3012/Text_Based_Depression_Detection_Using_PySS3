Got in a fight with my brother in the middle of the night I bought for myself some popcorn and if i buy something for my i would share it with friends if they ask but i would never share it with my piece of shit brother that ruined my childhood. But because heâ€™s a dick he said â€˜youâ€™re going to give me at least half of thatâ€™ but because he uses more and more of my stuff 
(like my bike and because he uses it i need to walk through the rain but because he is my momâ€™s favourite he can just do that) 

So i kept saying no until he said he is going to hit me (for context iâ€™m a thin 17 year old and he is 22 so itâ€™s kinda not fair) and so we start fighting 

First it was just holding each other and pushing.
Then he tried tackling me so i tried pushing him back and holding his neck as tight as possible.

Then he trows me on the table and yells that he was going to stop and starts yelling and (something happend in between but i kinda forgot) eventually i react without thinking and just hit him in the face.

I saw him going fucking angry and he hits me harder and harder, grabs me by the neck and tries to kick me with his knee 

Eventually i let go of him but still ready to like  not get hurt if he kicks me with his knee again and he let me go after i made clear that he is an asshole and he should stay away from my shit

Am i at fault here?
Knowing him my mom will already know it when i wake up so i want to be ready to talk back for once.
