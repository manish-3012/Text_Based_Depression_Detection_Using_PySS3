Just need to rant about how screwed I am. Finals are a pain in the ass. Here is what I need to do before midnight in 22 hours (2 am rn). Keep in mind that I need to not fuck up my 4.0 GPA, so I cant really just take the loss on anything. need to:

* Polish up my english outline since we are writing a paper for our final.

* Study for a spanish final

* Study for a AP Physics final

Monday: 

For the english outline for the final, I still need to meet 2 more requirements that involve vocabulary and writing tricks that grab a reader's attention. 

Spanish isn't that big of an issue, except for the listening section where we write down what we hear in a video. I can do basically anything with ease if it's written, but listening is a bit of a struggle. Considering that the teacher is known for using videos recorded in 2003 with a mic that was a repurposed potato, it isn't going to be easy.

AP Physics is the main problem because I really dont know what I'm doing. I'm seen as one of the smart students, but in reality, I manage to bullshit my way through it all by juggling numbers I barely understand. During our final, we are also going to be paired together depending on our grades on the first section. It's gonna look really bad if I dont bullshit through it again and get in the same group as the other smart student. 

Tuesday is also going to be a pain in the ass. I wont really have anything to study for the english final since I'm writing an essay. Precalc/trig is gonna suck since I'm going to have to review everything. 

At least Wednesday is going to be a nice break. I dont have a final in the first final time, so I can sleep in. On top of that, economics is pretty easy.

Due to major procrastination in the class that I dont have a final in, I'm basically numb to stress. In these circumstances, I'm not sure if thats a good or bad thing.
