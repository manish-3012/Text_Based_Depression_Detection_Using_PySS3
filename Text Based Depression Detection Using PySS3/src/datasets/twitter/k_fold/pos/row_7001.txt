Working as a teen Hi! 

So basically, I am currently a sophomore in high school, and worked all last spring and summer while there was no school due to covid. Now that I am back in school this year, I planned on only working during the summer months as I will be doing in person school during the spring. But now, my parents are suggesting i reach out to my boss about working weekends during the spring. 

I DO NOT want to do this, as I have school all day, and my extra curriculars at night (as well as homework), and my only time to relax is weekends. 

What do I do?? Listen to my parents and say goodbye to my free time, or argue with them to only work once my school and activities are out of the way?
