I was making a post about taxable income because i was so confused when i found out something fricking stupid This bit pissed me off was 

Taxable income - Â£2150 = Â£3165 - Â£2150 = Â£1015

Now i wont explain what this mean but i was basically calculating what was left and i was wondering how the frick did 

Taxable income- Â£2150 = Â£3165 when Â£3165 WAS THE TAXABLE INCOME.

But i found out iit was saying that it = that the taxable income - Â£2150 EQUAL Â£3165 - Â£2150, not that it was the actual fricking answer.


This note book confused me ibto thinking i had to subtract the Â£2150 from the taxable income when the answer was shown to be the taxable income.

Here what i frickinng saw

Â£3165 - Â£2150 = Â£3165.

Which i was fricking thinking "WHAT, this must be a fricking typo"

Nah the people who made nnever thought that the people would take that fricking seriously which i did.

Now i dont think i can do my work for the simply reason im mad.
