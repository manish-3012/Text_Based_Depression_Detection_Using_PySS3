I hate how men standards are viewed I was with some classmates and a random girl started talking about her standards, the typical, 6ft athletic guy and the others were like "that's fine, you should fine a man that fits your needs", but then when they asked me and i said that i would like a girl smarter than me they got mad and started saying "you need to lower your standards, you're an asshole for not wanting normal girls, so you hate dumb people?"(they consider me a smart person)  
I really hate this, is like a men couldn't or shouldn't be able to have standards.
