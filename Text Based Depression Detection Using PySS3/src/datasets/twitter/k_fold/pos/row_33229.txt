Embarrassing Moments: Part 3 I remember when I was going to a park with my bio dad, and there was this tree that I was climbing. I was great at climbing it because at that time I felt like a ninja. And you know, most movies with ninjas in them usually have Asian actors in them. So, when I saw this Asian family I was like: 

"WOW, I bet they are really cool ninjas as well!"

So, I jumped off the tree, ran towards them, and bowed in front of them. And I didn't stop until my dad told me to come back.
