Rating retailers by how attractive the patrons are s) Target- Every single time I go to Target I get blown away by how many conventionally, and unconventionally attractive men and women walk the unnaturally bright aisles. From cute to hot, beautiful to handsome, you can find every variety of attractive person here. 

a) Gamestop- Gamestop is a double edged sword. The typical man who frequents gamestop can weigh no less than 200 lbs, and believes that one-per-month showers are not only ok, but also should be encouraged. His hair is either to his knees or as thin as he is fat, and anime girls are more sexually attractive to him than real ones. On the other hand, the typical woman who would frequent such a business can only be described in four very specific yet uncannily accurate words; Big titty goth gf. 

b) Safeway/Vons- Who you may find here is a pretty mixed bag. The entire spectrum of people, both horrid and stunning, may manifest themselves among the seemingly endless varieties of bread. 

c) Trader Joe's- I have nothing against the customers who frequent this shopping center. They're some of the most culinarily talented and wholesome people you can come across in the American suburbs. Now that I've gotten that out of the way I just would like to say that they're not physically attractive, but their personality and sweet nature definitely makes up for that. 

d) Walmart- There's shit in aisle 7, grandma over there just had a stroke and died, the obese man who smells of sardines broke one of the electric scooters cause he's too fuckin fat, there's never been a Walmart I've stepped foot in where I haven't seen all of these happen at once. I would rather fuck yanderedev and bear his children than be the health inspector of one of these damned establishments.
