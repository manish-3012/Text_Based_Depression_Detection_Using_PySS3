I need help &amp;#x200B;

My dad is trying to force my to change my name, at first i refused, because i dont really see any reason  to change my name, it doesn't affect anything about me . Like the people in my school just call me by my english name(im asian). So i just said i don't care.That was until today, he threaten me that if i dont change my name he will put me in a different school, throwing away all the stuff i had ever since i was a child, but the last straw is when he said that he will force me to repeat 8th grade again next year, and thereby ruining my future.And i was really mad but i couldn't show it because my dad would scream at me and beat me . So far you think that this is fake, yeah i wish.He even told me that i always act like a girl so he is gonna change my name.

And that is not even all of it, he told me that i need to go out of the school football club because he didnt want me to become a goal keeper, he also said things like how im lazy to be a goal keeper and i should look to my younger brother who is an attacker. So i decided to tell him back by saying im the only goalkeeper at school and he said its not his problem.

At later dates he started using violence against me like yesterday.Where he kick me, to the ground, it didn not hurt that much be enough for me to feel angry.

I need help please guys this is the only app that he does not know i have.
