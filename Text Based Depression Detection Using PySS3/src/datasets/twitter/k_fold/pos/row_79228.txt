I really need help rn Ok so this is the second time im posting this because the first time it was removed ill try my best to explain the situation.

Few days ago my friend(f13) made a grouchat on ig where i met this guy. At first he seemed like a cool dude we talked and then he asked for thigh pics and i thought he was joking and brushed it off like it was nothing, we didnt talk for the next 3 days and then my friend tells me to block him so i did that. Apperantly this guy was threating my friend that he would share her thigh pics if she didnt send nudes and you might be wondering how he got my friends thigh pics, well he didnt she just sent him a picture of her outfut where you could see her thighs nothing too bad. My friend blocked him and repored his acc and so did i. he was trying to contact me through his second acc but i also blocked that. 

Today my sister walked up to me and said that that this random guy texted her on ig asking if she knew my friend and ofc it was him he was claming that she send him nudes and that is a tottal lie hes soreading this around and idk how many ppl he texted he might do something worse and my friend is really worried so im asking for any kind of help. 

Somone in the previous post recomended that i should expose him so His main one is young_starburst and the secind one is i.created.time report both accs. 

Ps. Sry for the spelling mistakes im rlly worried amd my hands are shaking as im writing this.
