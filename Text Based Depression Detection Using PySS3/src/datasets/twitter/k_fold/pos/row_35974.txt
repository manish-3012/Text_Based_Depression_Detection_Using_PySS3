just me talking about squishy feelings stuff so i was just studying, and listening to music, when kimi no sei (the opening for rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai) played. its radically different from the punk rock that is 95% of my playlist so it stood out. and then i was just hit by this wave of feeling. like the song is just a cute j-pop song that serves as a perfect opening to a show like bunny girl senpai. but its not really just that. maybe something changes in translation but in english the chorus is "its your fault, your fault, your fault, that im so weak and pathetic" that line is just so good. and whenever i hear the song i feel like im in on a joke because the lyrics are actually really self deprecating when the song is so happy. and then i really wanted to tell someone about this, and i ran down the list of my friends, and the only person who i can talk to about feelings and stuff is my crush/best friend (i have posted about my "relationship" with her several times if you care that much. but i cant really tell her about this because my feelings for her are so mixed up in my feelings about this song and the show its from (and the re:zero episode "from zero" but thats unrelated). i feel like the person in this song could so easily be me, but im just strong enough to not become weak and pathetic just because a girl doesnt like me. and this show helped me dislodge my cranium from my rectum and start to at least like myself a little bit. if you only have one takaway from this it should be go watch bunny girl senpai please for the love of god.

anyway it just got me really hard that i didnt really have anyone i could talk to about this and i felt the need to say it somewhere. i know this post probably isnt very readable, and doesnt really have a point, and im sorry for that. and thank you to this community for letting me vent like this. i seriosly love you guys.
