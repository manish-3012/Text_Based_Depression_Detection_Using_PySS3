I just noticed that everyone is attracted to the opposite of me. I don't even know three straight girls, and I don't know any gay guys. Even my own girlfriend is mainly attracted to women. I'm still the 1%, even to her. And one day, 1% isn't going to cut it...

No matter how much I improve myself, I'm still very unlikely to be wanted.

And like- On an intellectual level, I understand that I just have a bad sample size, and statistically this is very unlikely, but it is *really* easy to forget that...

That's all. Just- needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.
