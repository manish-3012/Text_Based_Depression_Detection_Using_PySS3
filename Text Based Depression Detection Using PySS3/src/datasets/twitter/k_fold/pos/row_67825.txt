aight iâ€™m writing the short story but should it be like a trippy memory thing where the guy remembers his family and then they go all burnt and crispy and make him feel bad for killing them all in a fire, or should it be like eh finds a way to accept that it wasnâ€™t his fault

which it entirely was but that doesnâ€™t matter
