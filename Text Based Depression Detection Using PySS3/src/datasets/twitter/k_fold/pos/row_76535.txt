So I was in an aerospace lecture and our professor finished early But left the chat without closing out whatever it was so a bunch of us were still on there didnâ€™t realize it and I somehow accidentally shared my screen with like 30 people, While I watched a video my younger brother So I could edit 

So I could edit it, It was the video from our previous Christmas family paintball war, Of my brother doing narration to the sniper shot my cousin and I had during the entire event and this was a good eight minute long video and I was like stopping it periodically editing it thing And adding close captions on that kind of stuff and An epic musical score And once the sniper footage was done, I cut in another video of a couple of my cousins seizing the flag from our other cousins team and then a bunch of like small like 30 second videos of people drinking playing darts and eating Christmas dinner weâ€™re making this video for our grandparents since we had to cancel the family holidays this year just so grandma can kind of feel like we havenâ€™t forgotten about the family gatherings and that Kind of thing.

But yeah when I was adding the last of the video and checking out this was maybe 25 minutes into doing this I hear some thing through my speakers with the guys in my class just saying,â€ dude, What the hell.â€ And I realized a bunch of my classmates just saw me put merry Christmas grandma as the title of this video sequence and that they saw the entire thing and I had to go into a two or three minute explanation before leaving the chat and feeling extraordinarily embarrassed until I told my brother what happened and he laughed. Our sister still has to check everything over because I can edit videos to a point But my music sinking skills are limited
