My best friends started dating and neither of them have hung out with me since... Itâ€™s so stupid, like theyâ€™re constantly together, always telling me about it and shit. They constantly send me pictures of the both of them hanging out. I work a lot and have school now, and I havenâ€™t been out with a friend since they got together. They arenâ€™t my only friends but theyâ€™re my closest ones. It just really sucks. 

Trying not to feel down about myself or get too caught up in that whole â€œI wish I had a girlfriendâ€ mindset, but damn, I do feel down about myself and I wish I did have a girlfriend...
