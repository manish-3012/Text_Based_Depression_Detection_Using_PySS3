So I woke up to a delivery guy dropping a massive Box on our front steps It's a two foot tall cardboard box full of reese's, steaks, mine and my brother favor craft beers, fresh produce from our aunts garden a plunger and a bag of various  Nuts and bolts,as well as a few large pieces of wood.

 With a hand written note enclosed from our dad, and I quote," we knew you would all forget the  Essentials so we decided to send you some
 So your grandmother you stop worrying. We love you all , the spray in the box is bear mace not bear repellant stray is at a charging bear not at a person.

Love,
Dad

The note was stuck to the largest box of multi size condoms I have ever seen. And placed on top of a stack of gay and girlie mags because and i quote from the note"  for emergencies the wifi in Maine can be shit sometimes."

And this package is not ever suprising to me 
..lol
