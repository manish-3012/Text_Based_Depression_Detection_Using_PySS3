Surprisingly this hasnt happened yet Im surprised that some hacker hasnt unblurred MrBeast's credit card and spent all the money. I saw him pull out his credit card in his latest video where he sells houses for $1 so im guessing he has done it multiple other times. Im not encouraging it! Im just surprised it hasnt happened yet!
