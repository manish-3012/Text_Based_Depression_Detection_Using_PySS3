On Saturday we were cuddling Holding each otherâ€™s hand, telling each other how much we liked each other. And then Sunday night I get a ft telling me weâ€™re done. A bunch of vague reasons why, but it was clear that it was over. And it fucking hurts. We were dating for two months and hung out almost 4 times a week that whole time. Her smile lit up my day and we were so happy. And now sheâ€™s just gone.
