Should I ask her out? Alright so bit of background here, my crush is my friend who Iâ€™ve known for like 2 years. We hang out in school at lunch and break most days. There was one point when we liked each other but I was too scared to ask her out. Then fast forward maybe 8 months later I finally got the nerve to ask her out. But literally the day I was gonna ask I find out she started dating someone. That really fucked me up, I ended up be depressed for months about it, almost killing myself. Her and her boyfriend broke up two months ago, and when I get back to school I find I still have feelings for her. What should I do?

TL:DR, Fell in love with my friend, got depressed cuz of it. Sheâ€™s single now and Iâ€™m wondering what to do.
