Australians answer pls! whatâ€™s ur alcohol recommendations? just something kinda heavy, sweet, and affordable is what iâ€™m looking for (iâ€™ve tried cruisers but theyâ€™ve got barely any alcohol in them + are kinda expensive tbh) 

by the way, this is just for drinking at home, not in public. just curious to try things out :)
