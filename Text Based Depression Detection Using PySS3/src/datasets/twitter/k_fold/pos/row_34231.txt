Anyone else always get confused by the constant parent hatred among kids Like I guess I'm an outlier because I've barely ever had much wrong with my parents. I've never had a major problem in what they want from me or want me to do, the biggest stuff is mostly homework squabbles. I guess I'm a minority. Honestly the most annoyed I ever got over "dumb parent rules" wasn't even with my parents, but with a friend's parents who didn't let me and my friend go to our friend's little campfire party in their backyard because we're boys. 

I dunno. It's just my experience has never alligned with what always seems to be the story and so I never actually got the stories.
