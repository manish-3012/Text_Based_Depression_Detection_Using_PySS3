Traction Motors from Electric Multiple Units and Electric Locomotives sound better than any car or any other vehicle Listen to a ES64U2 (Taurus) Locomotive depart and tell me to my face a Mercedes sounds better.... 

Listen to the New York City Subway Alstom/Bombardier/Siemens Traction Motors.... 

The BR 481 Berlin S-Bahn....

The BR 101....

The Toronto Line 3 Subway Trains....

The 2009 Rolling Stock....

The 1996 Rolling Stock....

The S7....

I could go on and on....

In my opinion, Electric Multiple Units and Electric Locomotives are the absolute Kings when it comes to sound.
