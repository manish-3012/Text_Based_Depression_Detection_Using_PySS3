I have experienced a lot of emotions today. Induced by:

*Broken sleep schedule. (tiredness)

*Biking 100m back and forth. (tiredness)

*Watching anime. (shock, sadness)

*Playing Plants vs Zombies 2. (anger)

*Eating a burger and some carbonara. (content)

Sorry for sharing this. I just thought you'd get interested.
