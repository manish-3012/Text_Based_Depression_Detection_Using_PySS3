my notes app rant or dump from the heart about my first kiss maybe this is embarrassing. i just want to put it here for some reason. say what you will, opinions, idk. in a very bad spot right now feeling very alone. here are my overshared feelings for someone i care for a little too much



i know youâ€™re sorry about all this
because even though it goes unsaid we both know what ur doing to me.

and neither one of us can do anything about it because youâ€™ll always have a little part of me now.
so i guess iâ€™m sorry in a way for putting that burden on you.
i feel like if i would have taken the time to think about the way i am, i never would have gone through with anything and iâ€™m not sure if that would have been a good thing or not.
because with me, thereâ€™s no â€œjust for funâ€ or â€œgetting it over with,â€ iâ€™m always going to fall in love.

i allowed myself to be vulnerable with you. youâ€™ve seen every piece of me and thatâ€™s something iâ€™ll never get back. i know you know that.

and i know that you understand. i know you know that the second you touched me you would have me forever. and i know that maybe a little part of you probably feels bad every time you think of me while youâ€™re with somebody else. i know that you probably donâ€™t think of me every time you hear lana del rey the  same way that i think of you when i hear that one fucking  song. i know your mind probably doesnâ€™t travel to the way i lied there and the way you just held me or the way we laughed when i did something terribly wrong. but i like to think that it does.

i have nothing right now. my friends are gone; my family was never there. and maybe i sought you out to fill up that emptiness. maybe itâ€™s why i rely on you so much. maybe you know that, too.

it doesnâ€™t matter what happens or what i hear, not a minute goes by that iâ€™m not thinking about you, wishing i was with you, wishing i hadnâ€™t held back from you so much, adding to my mental list of everything i want to say and do the next time i see you, if i ever do.

i guess what iâ€™m trying to say is that i hope you mean it every time you tell me you miss me.

because i miss you. i miss your lips and i miss your hands and i miss your hair, i miss your touch and your words and your smile and your laugh. i miss your smell that iâ€™m starting to notice everywhere i go. 

i miss you, despite your lies and your pretending, even if youâ€™re just using me, i miss you, because youâ€™re all i have right now. maybe ur just using me for my body but at least itâ€™s something.

it scares me the control you have over me and my emotions. i know that i can feel all of this right now, but the second i see your name pop up on my screen iâ€™ll be okay again. youâ€™re so lucky. because you have the option of switching it on and off, while iâ€™ll remember every detail forever.
