To the dude who made a post about hugging your mom and suggested to hug your mom, thank you I(F14) hugged my mom in five years for the first time.  It was at night and I came out of my bedroom and laid down on my mom's bed and hugged her from the back. I started crying but thankfully she was sleeping. I just can't believe I cried from hugging her, I feel better now. It scares me she won't be here forever so I'll try to make the best out of it. Thank you to the dude who made a post about hugging your mom, I'm glad I did it. I'll cherish her.
