So My Father Is Making Me Suffer For the entirety of middle school I have been in the same school, and Iâ€™ve made so many good friends, relationships have came and gone but this year I have been emotionally destroyed.
My dad is retiring. He wants to go back to his home town and is forcing the whole family to go there. And I have just finished the 7. grade and entering the 8. grade. Being in the same school for nearly 3 years then being ripped apart from everybody there just because of an old manâ€™s fantasy.
Iâ€™m seeking emotional support but my whole family is telling me to man up and stop being such a baby.
