I kinda hate being horny sometimes Masturbating is nice and all, but goddamn sometimes my mind just get totally obsessed and I do it like 3 times a day. It just gets in the way sometimes. It used to be pretty bad a few years back; Any time I would draw a female character I would just over-sexualize them. I don't know if it's just hormones, but I have been noticing recently that I'm a bit obsessive in general sometimes, so it might just be that. IDK, it's not a huge deal honestly, but I wanted to share.

EDIT: I said that it was worse in the past, but I realize that it's actually worse now. I end up just nutting at my desk without any backup measures. Which means it gets all in my underwear and I have to change, and that means I go through underwear like crazy.
