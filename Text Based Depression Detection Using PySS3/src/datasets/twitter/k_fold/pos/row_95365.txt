Give me arguments to make the step with my crush Fuck it, let's do it with my normal account.

I think there is something between me and her. She is absolutely wonderful, we have lots of tastes and passions in common.

We went out once having lunch in downtown, we sat on the side of a dock to eat burgers, i drew her, we chatted of everything. It was nice, when she left she said she would like to spend some time with me more often, then she checked me and went to her dancing course.

I don't know if we really flirt, but she often compliments me (I think, maybe I'm over interpretating) and she accepts my compliments. And there are all the good old stares and smiles (once again, maybe I'm overthinking)

What keeps me back from telling her is that I have only one group of friends, she is in it and I don't want to make all our future reunions cringy if she refuse. Moreover I'm not even sure she like me as more than a friend since she is nice to everyone.

So explain me what I should do, fellow teenagers
