Okay, guys and gals, this is kind of a weird one. I'm a huge chemistry (specifically molecules) nerd, so I need you to suggest me different space ship designs. I noticed that many molecules can look like space ships with a little bit of imagination. So I set myself the challenge of drawing as many ships until I get bored of it. I have a list with a lot of elements, and they all have a meaning, as in what kind of a part of the ship it is. An example is that the oxygenator can be either O (who would've guessed) or N. Weapons can be a lot, for example P, S, F or also N. Storage I decided is N and I. And the list goes on and on. What I want you do comment are different kinds of ships, I could build, using what I have written in my list. You can either say some Formula and I will try to make it look like a ship, while still following the rules of chemistry, or you say me something like a trading ship, the Skeld from among, some other famous ship. Please, I'm bored.
