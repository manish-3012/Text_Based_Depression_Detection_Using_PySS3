We are under attack!!! Guys reddit is officially under attack by Chinese hackers. Subreddits like r/food, r/space and r/freefolk have been converted into Trump Advertisements with a lot of Chinese. I believe that these hackers will soon come for r/teenagers and even r/memes. U can check out these subreddits yourself and see what has happened to them.
