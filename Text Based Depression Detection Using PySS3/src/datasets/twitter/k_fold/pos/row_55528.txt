Random Thought Monday Take 3: You guys ever find it awkward liking a cry for help post. Disclaimer: I know Iâ€™m saying liked and not u p voted, itâ€™s because my post got removed for saying u p voted due to it being classified as â€˜u p vote manipulationâ€™ what whateverâ€”

Yâ€™all ever been on the internet and you see a post about someone talking about how theyâ€™re in their bag. And you feel weird u p voting it because if you do you feel like youâ€™re applauding their cry for help. But if you donâ€™t you feel like youâ€™re just flat out ignoring it. I dunno, maybe I just overthink this.
Let me know
