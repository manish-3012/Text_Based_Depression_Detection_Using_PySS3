Thanks mom for not helping me with my diet (**TW for eating disorder please donâ€™t read this if youâ€™re recovering/recovered**)

Iâ€™m a 14 year old autistic tween who struggles with unhealthy eating.

And she legitimately acts like I should be able to go on a diet by myself.

SORRY I DONT HAVE A JOB OR A CAR TO GO BUY MY OWN GROCERIES BECAUSE YOU APPARENTLY CANT BUY HEALTHY FOOD THAT DOESNT TASTE DISGUSTING-

Yeah Iâ€™ve given up and now Iâ€™m just going to stop eating ðŸ¥´

I just want a feeling of control, I canâ€™t do this on my own so anything that happens is my momâ€™s fault for not even remotely caring about both my mental and physical health.
