How should I get revenge on my lifelong bullies? Hey guys, starting my sophomore year in high school and escalating to its peak junior year, I was bullied to near suicide. For whatever reason, I was singled out by 5 guys in the same grade and terrorized. They would egg my house every week, eventually throwing a brick through my living room window on Christmas eve. They would verbally harass me in school and throw food at me while I sat alone at lunch. They even made a hate-profile on Instagram verbally abusing just me and followed everyone in my school. No one ever stood up for me and my friends joined them. I was all alone. I transferred schools junior year and things got back to how they were supposed to be, normal. I would occasionally have run-ins with them but things were looking better. Now here I am four years later and a junior in college. They decided to start terrorizing me and my family again. They call my phone non-stop using an untraceable "no caller id" number and call taxis to my house. One of them just invited me to an xbox live party which they are all in, obviously to shit talk me like old times. My biggest regret in life was not lashing out and standing up for myself back in high school and I will not make the same mistake again. What do you guys suggest?
