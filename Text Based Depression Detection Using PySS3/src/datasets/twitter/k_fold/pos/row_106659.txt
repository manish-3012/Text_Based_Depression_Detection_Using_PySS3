I feel so sad over the death of a little baby bird This happened around 10 minutes ago. I was walking my dog when I saw 2 baby sparrows. Those little birdies have fallen out of their nest. One of them was hurt and the other one seemed fine. I grabbed the hurt one in my hands and he started to close his eyes and die. I pet him and told him 'Don't die little bird. Your parents are going to help you.' in a soft voice. He died in my hands and I started to cry. I put him on the ground and then grabbed the other one. I tried to put him back to his nest but to no avail. He started to die too. I didn't know what to do, I was crying and I asked for help but nobody wanted to. So I walked and let that little baby bird to die because I couldn't do anything. If I brought that bird back home it would have been killed by my dog or my 3 year old cousin. I felt so powerless and guilty. 

I'm sorry if I ruined your day but I had to tell someone. I can't bottle up my feelings like I usually do. I'm so sorry. You can say anything to me. I know that in responsible for their deaths. I hope they'll be happy in heaven.
