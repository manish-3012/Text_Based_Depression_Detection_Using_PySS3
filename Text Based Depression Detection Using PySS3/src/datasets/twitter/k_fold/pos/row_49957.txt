So much shit seems so petty and meaningless when youâ€™ve face the real possibility of death I see other kids stressing about exams, about point systems for hw and shit. Or even sillier shit like â€œoh no I messed up the laundryâ€ and I just find it funny.  Those little things used to bother me too. Man do they seem small now
