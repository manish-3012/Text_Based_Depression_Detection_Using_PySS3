Dude idc if iâ€™m by myself or with friends singing a song that had the n word in it (as long as itâ€™s not hard r) iâ€™m gonna sing it if iâ€™m vibin idc Posting you saying that shit in a song on social  media is low iq but no one should care if you just do it by yourself or around close friends. If youâ€™re vibing to a song you should be able to embrace the vibe without thinking about being offensive.
