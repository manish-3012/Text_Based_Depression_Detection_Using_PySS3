I know it sounds dumb it was really cute, I picked some leaves out of my GFs hair Yeah it sounds dumb, but during break today she kicked some leaves at me, so I kicked some at her, long story short she's super short and she got some leaves in her hair.

So I say "hey you got some leaves in your hair" 

And she kinda randomly bats at her head to get them out, so I walked up to her and picked them out and she was looking up at me with a really cute eyes while I got one of the pieces out.

Idk, I found it really cute for some reason, although I'm weird and deprived of physical affection, so.
