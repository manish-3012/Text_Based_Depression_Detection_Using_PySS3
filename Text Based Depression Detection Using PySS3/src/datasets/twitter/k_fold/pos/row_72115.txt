online friend (i miss them) I was playing minecraft today and then the nostalgic music started playing, this reminded me of a friend i used to play with. i kind of miss them, we used to play everyday but later things changed my friend started becoming kind of rude and annoying and also became very bossy like giving me directions on how to play the game and stuff. at first i kind of ignored and then later got very annoyed with it because they kept leaving the game without informing me and other stuff. one day i realized my friend was just having real life problems the whole time so i decided to message them with what was going on and they said that it was kind of personal and didnâ€™t wanna talk about it but i think i know the reason why which i am not gonna say since they donâ€™t want anyone to know about it and also i am not sure if thatâ€™s the actual reason but anyway it was too late, they quit minecraft and so did i for a bit and today i decided to message them again on discord which they havenâ€™t responded to yet and i am fairly sure that they have uninstalled discord since i sent them a message on discord a month ago which they still have not responded too. anyway i miss them very much. enchantedbee if you are reading this which you probably arenâ€™t i miss u lol and also it was fun playing with you. Iâ€™ve learned a thing from this which is appreciate your present instead of missing your past
also please excuse my english lol its not my first language
