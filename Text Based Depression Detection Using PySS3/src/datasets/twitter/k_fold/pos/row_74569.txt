My looks: just average or above? https://imgur.com/a/hfJZJQL 


I am a boy living in Korea and I got complimentd about my looks from time to time so I guess I am not ugly. 
Also I can just see that I am not a 10/10. 
I am curious if the compliments given to me are correct and I am a semi good looking dude (or at least above average)
Or I am just average and those people were wrong. 
Personally I am curious ;)
Plus: It is only about face&amp;plz dont consider me being an asian when replying, everyone is asian in my contury so it is no disadvantage. Plus The pics were just plainly taken, took random pics and just deleted a bad one
