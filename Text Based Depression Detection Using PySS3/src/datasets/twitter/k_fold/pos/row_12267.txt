I feel like I have no hope for future sometimes I live in Turkey atm and Turkey colleges except for the best few, suck ass. Even the best aren't in the top 300 worldwide. And to get into those best ones I have to become a robot and study 6 hours a day for the next 1 Â½ year. 

In Turkey a lot of the best colleges are tuition free. But Turkey as a country also sucks ass and I don't want to live through college here. 

I initially wanted to study abroad but that seems impossible because my family is poor as fuck to pay any tuition. And because turkey isn't in the eu, I have to pay tuition in UK as well as US and Canada. I can only speak English besides my native language so I can't go to anywhere else.

I'm probably failing a lot of my classes because I paid literally no attention to any online class.

I have plans to overcome a lot of these problems but everything fucking sucks and I sometimes lose all my hope. Fuck this.
