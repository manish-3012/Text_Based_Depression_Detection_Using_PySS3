bruh my sister literally never gets in trouble like 45 mins ago she went on a damn rampage and poured water all over the floor + couch, kept turning off the wifi AND threw a shard of glass at me because i was using MY ps4 (which i paid for) and she wanted to play fortnite on it but all my mum did was say â€œare u ok? do u wanna go talk with me?â€ like wtf?? no punishment??

if i do so much as talk with a sarcastic tone to my mum i get all my stuff confiscated regardless if i paid for it or not. doesnâ€™t seem fair to me tbh.
