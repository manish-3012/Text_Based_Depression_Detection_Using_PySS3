I have been uncontrollably sobbing for half an hour now, this is what mental illness really looks like Maybe Iâ€™m just speaking for myself, maybe this is just some desperate plea for understanding or a little bit of grace, but Iâ€™m so tired, so so tired.

Iâ€™m tired of people looking at me and invalidating my struggling because I have a smile on my face. I laugh when people say â€œaha moodâ€ when I talk about my depression jokingly, knowing theyâ€™ve never experienced anything close to what I go through on a daily basis.

I hate feeling like Iâ€™m invalidating other peopleâ€™s pain when I think that, even though it may be true. I know that their â€œyeah my little brother broke my pallets the other day and I felt the sameâ€ will never be the same as my curled in a ball, clutching my heart to remind myself Iâ€™m still alive while gasping for air, sobbing uncontrollably over pain that I constantly tell myself is no big deal. 

If I hurt myself, even if itâ€™s not with the intention to do irreversible damage, I feel like Iâ€™ve failed and that I should be better, I should have just sucked it up when my father would yell at me that â€œeveryone gets sadâ€ and that â€œpeople that are really abused are 100x worse than I amâ€

I hate that people think that Iâ€™m doing it for attention whenever I rarely post something about it, wether it be for karma, snaps or otherwise.

Iâ€™m in so much pain but Iâ€™m still living, that feels like too much and not enough all at once.
