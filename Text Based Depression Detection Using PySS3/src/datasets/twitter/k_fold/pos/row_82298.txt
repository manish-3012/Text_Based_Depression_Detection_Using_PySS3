Do I get help? I don't know if this is really the place to say this or ask this but my depression has been getting worse recently and I want to know, do you guys think I should get help.  Before you guys just all say yes think of it from my point of view.  If you were going through the same thing would you be brave enough to get help?  Please just be honest with me I really don't know what to do at this point and I'm losing hope.
