Advice for all Times are hard right now and I know that so I'm going to bless you all with some great advice: shit happens, so don't focus on the mistake at hand, learn from it. Don't get stuck in the past or think about what you should've done. Think about what you are going to do next. Plan out your next steps. Gotta live with the "it is what it is" mindset
