holy shit I feel great! a while ago someone was really nice to me. that's all they did. and that made me feel great and I actually feel motivated to do stuff! I started learning German again, did my overdue school assignments, and I've had the energy to socialize with my friends! I feel like I've turned my life around for the better. thank you guys for being a great community and helping me through this
