It's been said so many time before but Nice guys always finish last.

Here's the story: I've been in the talking stage with this girl for like a month and I was gonna shoot my shot today but apparently this guy (let's call him Joe) asks her out and she said yes now let me give you some background info on Joe. He's been on probation twice (he's only 14), he's been convicted of stealing people's coolers at a lake, and is an all around dick. And before you say "he's probably more attractive than you" hes literally 4'11, 90 lbs, he has the eyes of a meth dealer and the body shape of a short Justin Bieber who has never been to a gym the biggest thing about him is his ego. Anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk
