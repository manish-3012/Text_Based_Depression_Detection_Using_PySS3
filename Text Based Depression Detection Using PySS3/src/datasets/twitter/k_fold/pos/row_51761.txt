Not being in school for five months used to sound like a dream to me. But know with all this time of partial isolation I feel like Iâ€™ve learned a lot about myself. This is my main issue with being away from school for so long. I have a crush on this girl and just seeing her in the halls or seeing her smile use to help me feel better. I thought about talking to her at some point or something, but know Iâ€™m alone at home. I canâ€™t do any of these things now. I think about her quite a lot and when I do, I just get this sad feeling that Iâ€™m powerless and I wonâ€™t get to know a girl anytime soon.

This applies for friends and just other students too. Just seeing and being around people affected me in a way that I only now realize. I still hung out with a groupe of friends a few times over the summer and that helped a bit but it was tough for the most part. Especially when the pandemic was at itâ€™s peak. I thought getting a job for the summer would help (and it probably wouldâ€™ve) but Iâ€™ve had a really hard time finding one. Letâ€™s say it wasnâ€™t my best summer. 

And the saddest thing is that this year at my school, theyâ€™ll organize the classes in such a way that people in a class will have as least contact as possible with people of another classes (for safety reasons). So basically if sheâ€™s not in my class or none of my friends are in my 30 ish student class, Iâ€™ll stay with this powerless and kind of lonely feeling for a while.

If I had to do it all over again I wouldâ€™ve spent the last three months of school in school instead of online classes. I use to think I wasnâ€™t a people person but now I realize that without others I am not truly myself or my best and happiest self. 

I just wanted to share my feelings in these weird times. However the future does look better as school starts soon and I am probably going to get a job. 

I heard a quote saying â€œHappiness is only real when sharedâ€. I realize that it is very true.
