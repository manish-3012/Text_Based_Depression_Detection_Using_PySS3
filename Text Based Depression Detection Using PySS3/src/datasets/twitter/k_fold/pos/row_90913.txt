When talking in person do people reference memes? I know memes are very popular nowadays but do people reference them when having an in person meeting? I was a teen in the 2000s and we had memes but they were mostly kept to the internet.  The most popular memes in my days were "its over 9000" or "so I herd u liek mudkipz".  I remmeber being in college in 2012 and a professor tried to reference memes in her assignments and it just didn't click with the class.
