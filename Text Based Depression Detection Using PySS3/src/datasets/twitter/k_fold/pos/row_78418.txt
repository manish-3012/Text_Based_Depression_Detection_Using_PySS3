im averaging 3-4 mental breakdowns a week so that's cool Every little thing just sets me off. It's mainly about money. Here's context:

I'm 17. I just applied to all of my colleges. So I'm worried about if I'm actually going to get into college, but now I'm worried about if my major is gonna make me any money. I wanna double major in like political science/international relations and linguistics.

But like what fucking money am I gonna get from that? Like what job opportunities are there?

So if/when I get into college, cool. I get a degree. Cool.

BUT WHAT DO I DO AFTERWARDS? There's just so many expenses. There's healthcare, car insurance, phone bills, rent, 401K.

I just want to make 40k a year. That's all I ask. Then I'll have a stable job and all the time in the world to get a higher salary later in my life.

It's just, I'm majoring in something that I love. I see my dad come home every day from his retail job depressed af. And while he makes a ton of money, I'd rather made little money doing something that I love.

But I still want money. 

I was thinking about cyberpunk 2077. I'm going to get the game, but I only have a 1050 ti, which is fine. But then I was thinking about how expensive graphics cards are. And that what if I can never afford a graphics card? What if I can never afford a hobby or video games? Or what if I can never afford anything?

This is a stupid ass assumption. I'm priviliged. My family makes over 100k a year, and I have parents and grandparents that love and support me dearly. I'm not going to have lots of student loans because of that as well. I'm so so so increidbly lucky.

But I'm just worried. I don't want to not be able to afford anything. I want to earn money. I want to spend it on graphics cards and games and stupid stuff that entertains me.

It's not like this thinking is unique. Everyone (hopefully) my age is scared about the future, scared about if they chose the right major, scared if they'll get a job. Right? am I alone?
