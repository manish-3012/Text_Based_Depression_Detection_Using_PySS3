Ideas for my gfâ€™s minecraft world? A while ago, I started building an iron farm on my girlfriendâ€™s minecraft world that we play together, but since itâ€™s relatively close to our house I want it to not look as ugly as it does now... any suggestions for what I could build around / in front of it to make it look a bit better? 

Thanks :&gt;
