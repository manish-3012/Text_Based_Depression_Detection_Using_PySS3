I'm alone and have nothing to do about it. I feel like it's impossible to find someone who isn't an asshole with an IQ below 60, I am in a state of solitude being forced to ponder eternity and my future. Why? I am only 13, no 13 year old should ever yearn for legitamate love.

Unfortunately, all the girls in my school are stupid bitches who either think they're smart, or are too depressed to not cut themselves, and since my mom lost my phone, there's no way to find someone online except for ps4, which probably won't work out.

I feel like I'm in an abyss with an evergrowing pit in my heart, help me
