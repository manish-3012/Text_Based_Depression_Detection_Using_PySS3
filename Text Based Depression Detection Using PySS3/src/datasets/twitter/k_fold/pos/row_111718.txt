Dont do drugs. Technically I shouldnâ€™t even be saying any of this but my older brother was going on a rant about shrooms a few weeks ago (see my previous post of that). Fast forward to last night when my parents received a call at 1 AM from my brothers girlfriend telling them that he had just called the police and once they had arrived he proceeded to fucking tackle 5 policemen. He ended up in the hospital all night and my parents couldnâ€™t do anything because heâ€™s in Iowa (we live in Chicago). I find it un-fucking-believable that people actually find enjoyment in completely losing control of yourself. Just donâ€™t do drugs people, for both your own health and people who you are close to as well. TL;DR 

And yes he is Ok now but heâ€™s in a ton of trouble with police and parents and school!
