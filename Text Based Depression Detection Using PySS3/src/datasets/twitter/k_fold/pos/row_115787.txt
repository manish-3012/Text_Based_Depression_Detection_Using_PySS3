A bus stops and two Italian men get on, They seat themselves and engage in animated conversation.

The lady sitting behind them ignores their conversation at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears one of the men say the following: â€œEmma come first. Den I come. Den two asses come together. I come once-a-more. Two asses, they come together again. I come again and pee twice. Den I come one lasta time.â€

â€œYou foul-mouthed swine,â€ retorted the lady indignantly. â€œIn this country we donâ€™t talk about our s.x lives in public!â€

â€œHey, coola down lady,â€ said the man. â€œWho talking abouta s.xa? Imma justa tellun my frienda how to spella â€œMississippiâ€!
