My doggo got poisoned and died : ( I woke up this morning expecting to have to clean my dog's poo and pee, but as it turns out I woke up to have to bury her already rotting corpse.

She was poisoned, possibly by a rotting toad.
She didn't eat for 2 days and has been very lethargic the past 2 days.

She kept puking and pooping stinky blood covered rotting masses and of course we were very concerned about her but couldn't take her to the vet because Corona and we don't have a working car anymore

And this morning I woke up to the smell of a rotting flesh,I check under the broken car (their favourite plays to sleep), and I saw her, motionless and she had also shid herself, it was the same rotting smell as her poop and like.

I pick up her body and the usually very energetic pupperino... Is now a foul smelling limp dog ragdoll.

She had been bleeding or possibly even rotting from the inside the whole time.

I feel really sad now, I miss her skipping around the grass and going out with me and my sister on our morning walks.

We still have her 2 sisters (although I'm afraid the other one might soon follow because she had been very lethargic and has lost her appetite quite recently but is also I hope starting to recover)

I burried her in our yard and the last time I've felt this sad was when my Gramma died
