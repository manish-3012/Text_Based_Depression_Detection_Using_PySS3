Group chat Iâ€™m going to start a group chat, but, you must follow the rules

1: no cussing 

2: no inappropriate content or text

3: donâ€™t be annoying, donâ€™t be a jerk, and no being a bum just because they donâ€™t agree with you

4: no political or religious talk

5: be nice, and please respect the people in the group, and the rules
