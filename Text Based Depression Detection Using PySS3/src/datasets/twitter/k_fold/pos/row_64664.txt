A virgin girlfriend So I was making out with my gf (im 15 she's 16) and we have been kissing and making out for 2 weeks, so i started rubbing her down there with her pants on and thing were going fine she was moaning a little and then i was going to put my hand under her pants bit she stopped me. so i just said "ok if u are not ready" and she smiled so i proceeded to rub her over pants till she came and i asked if she was fine after and she said yes but we have been together for a month and I really wanna like go further but she doesn't want that yet. so should i just ask her someday that if she's ready or will she tell me? I really like her so i don't want to ruin this. I dont want to rush because shes not ready but at the same time i reaally wanna do it. what should i do?
