Screw it I can't find one looking for so I'm just going after another goddam book. It's probly going to suck but there is going to be a kraken  That attacks a ship called the H.M.S. Gazoonetight,   Because there should be a book somewhere where that happens. I haven't been able to find one in existence so I'm just going to have to write it myself.
