Religion is for morals and thats it If you look at the basis for most if not all religions they are all about being a good person but in different ways that works for you. Some people dont need it to be a good person. Religion shouldnt be used for law making, shouldnt be pushed on children and you shouldnt try and push false information. Every religion has a rule book essentially saying that you shouldnt cheat, lie, break the law or be rude to people. Though these people genuinely believe that their god created the universe and i cant think of anything else. It confused me how people believe the literal impossible and think yea that seems true but then say the provable isnt. Churches and other places of worship should teach people to be kind and the billions that are religious would be a large majority that would hopefully be kinder.
