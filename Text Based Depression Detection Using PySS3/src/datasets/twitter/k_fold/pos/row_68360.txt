My mom just sent me an antivaxxer article Deadass I opened my phone this morning and I saw a message from her saying "watch this before it's deleted!" And it's a 5 minute long antivaxxer tirade. I looked up the claims in the video and immediately found sources debunking it. I love her but she's been so sucked into these conspiracy theorist wormholes and doesn't factcheck anything for herself so much it makes me anxious
