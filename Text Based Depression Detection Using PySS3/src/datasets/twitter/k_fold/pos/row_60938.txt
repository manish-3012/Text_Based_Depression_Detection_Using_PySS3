I know Iâ€™m like 8 years late but Iâ€™m finally watching another In my defense I was only like 7 and a half when it came out and I had barely learned ways anime was (I still canâ€™t Believe 2012 was 8 years ago)

I just finished episode 3 and now I have to recover, horror is great but I can only take so much at a time, but the fact that all the episodes (at least so far) end on a cliffhanger and I know it makes you want to keep watching and they have to end somewhere and thatâ€™s probably the best place but at the end of every episode I have to make the decision to either watch the next episode and deal with more horror than I can handle at once or not do that a think about it until I watch the next episode cuz suspense
