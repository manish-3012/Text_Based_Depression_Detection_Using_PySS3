Should I get a gaming computer for high school? Alright, I'm going into high school fully online, I occasionally play videogames, have about $1500 saved up from over the years. Right now I'm sitting in front of an Amazon page with a full parts list for just under $900 and I'm not sure whether or not I should buy it. On one hand, it's definitely not necessary and sort of a dream thing for me to have. On the other, I am thinking about starting a YouTube channel and school's online anyways so it's not totally unnecessary (I already have a 2013 laptop which can do all school related activities just fine). Anyways, what do you guys think? Should I order it or not?
