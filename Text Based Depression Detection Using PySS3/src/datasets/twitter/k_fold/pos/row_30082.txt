How to not be confused 1. Be confused (I made a tutorial on this yesterday check it out)
2. Take what or who confused you
3. Take it or they to a person who is never confused
4. Ask them for help
5. If they can't help you, take the other person
6. Ask them to explain in another language
7. If this still doesn't work, show them my other posts on this sub
8. They will be confused and drop the subject
9. Look at something that makes sense
10. Forget what happened
