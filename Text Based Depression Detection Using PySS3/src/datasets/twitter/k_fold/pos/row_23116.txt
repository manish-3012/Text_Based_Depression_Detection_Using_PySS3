Fellow girls, how do you decide what type of underwear to wear in the morning? Like do you just pick any old pair, or does it depend on your mood/ outfit, is it a brief day, a thong day or does the style really not Matter and you'll wear the first ones you pick up. 

Maybe you only own 1 type of underwear so this isn't an issue and I'm just making no sense (I only own thongs myself) Haha :)
