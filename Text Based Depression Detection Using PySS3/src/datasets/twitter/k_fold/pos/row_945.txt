ffs schools making me go back for an hour a day for 2 weeks most people in my grade just graduated but since im doing one of the harder classes theyâ€™re making me and everyone else in those classes come back for an hour a day just to revise for some dumbass exam in a few weeks

maybe i just wont show up what are they gonna do suspend me. iâ€™ve basically already graduated anyways
