I have a crush So I don't even know the guy (not off to a very great start aren't I), but he goes to the same school I do. I've seen him in the hallways sometimes and oooooooh gawd, OOOOOOOH GAWD so my type... He's kinda tall, has long dark hair, usually dresses in black clothes, and it's very strong physically

I want to approach him, but he's in another class. If he was on mine though, I'd have no problem flirting. Also, the little microscopic beast doesn't help either, so here I am, asking for advice on how I could approach him

(I know I shouldn't judge people on looks, but I'm a hormonal teen and I can't really help it)
