Would it be weird to talk to an old friend? We havenâ€™t talked in about two years, and I recently got snap so I wanted to rekindle our friendship. Also, I was really quiet/closed off when we were friends so thatâ€™s why we faded and Iâ€™ve gained more confidence to be social and shit. Would it be weird to message her? She followed me back on her spam page in the past few months and I still like some of her photos from time to time on ig.
