I think this is some solid advice  

* Choose someone if you need no one. A relationship can only be healthy with two whole person, not with two half who are only stay because they are codependent.
* Communication is key. I cant stress this enough. If you are not willing to communicate, because you fear what the other will think, then you are not in a healthy relationship.
* Don't try to change the other person. You are with him/her for his/her own self, not the possibility of he/she becoming someone.
* Evolve. While changing someone is a straight road to hell, evolving is important. The difference this change need to come from you, not from the other, and its targeted towards yourself.
* Set objectives not expectations. Objectives are future points what you can both work yourself toward to. Expectations on the other hand are strangely shaped holes, that you try to fit the other onto, even if he/she isn't shaped like that, therefore he/she wouldn't fit in it.
* Enjoy the present for what it is, instead of worrying of what it will be. Or other words. Enjoy what it is instead of worrying about what it isn't.
* Try to leave your baggage outside. He/she isn't responsible for the wrongdoings of your ex partners.
* Don't fear to say no.
* Don't fear to end a relationship, but never use it as a negotiation tool.
* Be a decent human, because the other person is a human to, not a tool.
