My friends snitched on eachother and got me in trouble... So to understand my problem I need to tell you some context. So my friends A and B and I are often out lighting bonfires and chatting and stuff so one time my friends and someone says "Hey! Why don't we light a fire in A's house's bomb shelter!" Which was a stupid idea but we were all in on it at the time so we just light a pair of a4's and get our little adrenaline kick and leave. And this Friday A and B decided to go out but I couldn't be with them for it because I was @ my grandparents place for the weekend. So they went in to the bomb shelter and light this big fire of paper and stuff and they did the same on Saturday with friend C, this time the fire was even bigger. This is where the problems arose, A's dad had been smelling the smoke all this time and eventually put the pieces together and realized that his son and his friends were burning stuff in his bomb shelter. So he contacts B's parents and mine and both my friends snitch on everyone involved even me the passive bystander that just watched them light up two pieces of paper. So this is where i need your help, my dad is probably going to talk to me about this and give me some sort of punishment, how do I convince him I don't deserve to be for example grounded for 2 months? And how do I do so easily?

TL;DR My friends snitched on me but I didn't do anything significant and I'm gonna get in trouble, HELP!
