stressed and stuck between things i want to do and things i have to do i donâ€™t really know what exact answer i really seek, yet i really want to get this off my chest.

iâ€™m currently stuck in this circle or wanting to do and learn thousand things at once while still having to work on projects for university, going to the gym and enjoying time with my girlfriend.

24 hours feel like just not being enough for me. 
i collected well over 100 books i want to read this year, saved hundreds of tutorials and courses on certain software where i want to improve my skills and these things just add up while i still have to work on projects for university.
and even though i am working on all those things every single day, i currently feel frustrated and stuck. 
especially with my creative work and skill level. even though i try to improve my skills every day i feel like iâ€™m not getting any further.
the number of things i want to learn and get better at just overwhelm and stress the shit out of me. 

i just donâ€™t know how to organise everything and get everything done while still having.. well, a life haha. 
is someone here experiencing the same situation and may have some tips or input? would be extremely thankful!
