Guys i rly need some advice(bullying) So my sisters friend hacked my sister gaming account and took everything from her. We didnâ€™t have proof but since i was a bit sus i hacked her friends account and found that she transfered everything over. So my sis friend doesnt know we hacked her but we know she hacked my sis. (I didnt touch the girls account tho just ssed the proof) This happened like a few months ago. My sister cut off ties with the girl but shes been full on stalking my sister on the internet and literally acted depressed cuz my sis wouldnt talk to her. I was whatever its prob a girl crush just avoid her. But today she starts texting my sis all these terrible stuff about how shes toxic and has nothing to life and how she is worth nothing and all this shit and my sis thinks she being the bigger person by not responding but i so badly wanna say something because her friend is already shit scared of me (cuz of smtn i did to her awhile ago :)) but my sis said she wants to tell the teacher but we all know how dumb the education system is. Help me what do i do. My sis and her friends are 12 and im 17 if that helps.
