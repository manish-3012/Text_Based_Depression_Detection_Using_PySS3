Is It Weird That I Only Have Girl Friends As A Guy? I just want to make a disclaimer that I'm not homosexual but I'm a asexual and a aromantic because I'm aware that when most people see that a guy friend group is mostly filled with women they'll think that guy is gay for whatever reason. But I'm just curious if me having only girl friends is a weird thing because some people can't grasp the idea of a guy that's not gay having only girl friends. The reason why my friend group is mostly filled with women is because of the toxic masculinity, drama and immaturity I experienced with other guys (not saying that all guys are the same) but when I'm with girls I don't really experience that.
