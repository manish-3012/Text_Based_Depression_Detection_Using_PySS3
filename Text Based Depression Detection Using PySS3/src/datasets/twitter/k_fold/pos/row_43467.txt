Hey guys-

Irrational story time:

I am 15 and I'm in severe depression and today my crush rejected me, I really wanted a gf and after that I met a nerdy girl and she was really ugly but I'm emotionally deprived so I asked her out for ice-cream. Then she took off her glasses at the vendor's and went from Shrek to Margot Robbie real quick. and we started dating but after that, I was once on a school bus trip and we crashed into a tree and my penis got chopped off and that's how I got pneumonia and then I was at the hospital where I met a very hot doctor and that's how I realized I was bi-sexual. Now I'm homeless because my parents are too insecure about having a bishrexual son. Now I also have Alzheimer's and live on the streets of New York.

Please support me as I am a douchebag rich kid who actually made it all up but you'll think it's real and give me awards. Thanks alot! Appreciate it!
