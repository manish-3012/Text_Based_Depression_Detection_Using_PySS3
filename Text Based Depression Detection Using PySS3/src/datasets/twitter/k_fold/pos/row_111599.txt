I found out why i didn't cry on my mom's death As the title says,me (17 M ) now,my mom passed away in 2016,at the time she died she was in our home my older sisters  were crying like crazy.but me on the other hand didn't felt any grief or sorrow.it was just plain blank.i didn't questioned or thought about it. everything that came out of me later, whether it was talking to the cousins or showing that i was sad was completely an act,i didn't understand it back then.But recently i was thinking of this theory or philosophy of mine.it was about not actually caring about anything or holding anything dear to yourself so later you don't have any regrets when they are gone and suddenly it came to me.i have been doing this since i was 8, without even recognising it.At the age 8 we had a cat, it was very close to me and i loved it but one day it died in a car accident ,back then i cried like crazy,after that unknowingly i have been following this philosophy of mine,my mind was doing this and I didn't even notice this,i basically didn't showed my parents i loved them or didn't do anything when they tried to make me tell i love them basically refusing i love them and showed i don't give a shit.this was all normal to me and wasn't known to me cause my mind was doing it.i reflected back on all my actions and all the dots connect to it.To this day,i am still following this philosophy and even i don't know to keep following it or not because it feels like a part of me it makes sense and sorta became my personality now.its not like i am jerk or an asshole it's just when it comes to people sharing or show any love or happy moments of their life i just go like "yeah,okay" or "that's cool".

It is very surprising to me that it took almost 5 years after my mom's death to figure this out.something that completely i didn't notice i was doing but my mind was.even though once i come to a point where i totally become alone I won't regret this philosophy because it's something what i choose and I won't back down from it and face it's consequences....
