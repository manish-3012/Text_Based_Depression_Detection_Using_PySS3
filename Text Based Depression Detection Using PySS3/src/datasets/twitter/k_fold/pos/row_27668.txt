ðŸŒŸ THANKS FOR NAMING MY APP, R/TEENAGERS!!! ðŸŒŸ Last week I asked r/teenagers for advice about what to name my social app. Thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/i06jey/help_me_name_my_new_app/

# I went with the name Speakeasy!

Check it out at https://speakeasy.co and let me know what you think. It's an app for meeting people and making friends!

There's a room for r/teenagers people to hang out here: http://speakeasy.co/teenagers
