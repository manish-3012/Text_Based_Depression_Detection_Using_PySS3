does anyone have a hard time accepting that they are an introvert like i want the cool fun life that it seems like extroverts have but i also mentally cannot handle that life.

hell I cant even go to the store for too long without getting seriously exhausted. Its stupid and I hate it and I hate that I generally, dislike people. Which Is weird because I have a generally positive outlook on life, other people, and myself.

I just wish I could accept that part of myself
