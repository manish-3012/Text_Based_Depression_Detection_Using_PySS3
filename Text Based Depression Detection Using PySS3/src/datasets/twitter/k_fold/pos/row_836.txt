Any advice on getting a summer internship? I normally don't post in this subreddit but I felt like you guys could help me out with this. I am a high school junior (16) and I would like to get a summer internship this year. Specifically, something tech/programming related. Any of you guys got any experience with this, or any advice? I've already applied to one place last night, but that's the only one so far. Thanks for any advice you guys are able to offer!
