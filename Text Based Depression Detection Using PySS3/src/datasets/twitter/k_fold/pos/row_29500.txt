weird document hello! if anyone sees this i am kind of in need of some help. i was doing my forensics homework (which was a set of google slides and questions related to hair and fiber analysis, centered around a goofy little mystery to test our understanding) and i found a google drive link pasted on one of the slides, without any other text in the box. i opened it to find a 300+ page pdf of a book from the 1980s titled "Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous" and found the phrasing to be rather unsettling and almost cultish.

is this wildly strange? the website our school uses makes us each our own copy of the slideshow, so it wasn't just me, but i don't have any other friends in the class to ask about it. there was nothing in the presentation related to either sex or love or addiction (aside from a passing reference to smoking) and i sent it to several of my friends who agreed the wording was very odd. is there a better subreddit i can ask about this in? should i email my teacher asking about it, or bring it up with her on monday (my next class) or go above her head about it? it's kind of unsettling me to be very honest with you all!
