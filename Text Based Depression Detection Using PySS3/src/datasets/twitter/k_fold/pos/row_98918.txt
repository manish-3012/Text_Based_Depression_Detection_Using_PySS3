To those who skate what cheap yet good skateboards would you advice for a beginner to get? I just learn how to skate today 2 hours ago and Iâ€™m pretty happy about it. I just kept on trying till I got it. My friend let me borrow his but Iâ€™m looking forward to get my own skateboard. My budget is only a 100.
