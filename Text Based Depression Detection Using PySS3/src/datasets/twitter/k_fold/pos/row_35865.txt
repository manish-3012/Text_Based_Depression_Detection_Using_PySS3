She responds to my texts, just very late at night. I texted the girl I like at around 3PM yesterday, and she responded two hours later. I respond and she replies an hour after that. I ask her a question at around 8PM and she responds at 11. This has been happening for a while now, where I text her in the late afternoon but she responds at 10 or 11. Could this possibly mean anything?
