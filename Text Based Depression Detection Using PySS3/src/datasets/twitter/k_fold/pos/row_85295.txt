I need to vent. Hey. This might be kinda long, so, you might wanna turn away.

 Anyways, I am here tonight, because a friend of mine, just blocked me on Discord and idk if I might ever talk to her again. So basically what happened is we had a fight, and we decided to settle our differences. And we got it right I think. But then she said she needed to say something, and I just said "ok" and she blocked me. Fuck. She's the only person I've got to talk to. What do I do? Did I do something wrong? I literally have no one else. I am in 1 dead server, and I have 3 people in my dms, her being one of them. The other 2 are people I played with. Can anyone at least tell her? If anyone could dm her, that would be great. Ill dm anyone who will talk to her her username
