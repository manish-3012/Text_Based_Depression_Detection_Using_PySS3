Somebody complimented me and it saved my life. Since 2018 I've dealt with depression and on and off mental health. Numerous things have caused it such as family and personal trauma. Recently, the thoughts of suicide just kept running through my mind. I've been stressed these few days and I felt so useless and incapable of doing anything correct. It made me feel even worse because it was about to be a year since I had suicidal thoughts and tried to do it by overdosing on multiple pills. I felt terrible for having these thoughts and I just laid in bed last night crying until I fell asleep. I woke up today and went to the store with my mom to get some food and household items. On the way back we stopped at a coffee shop since my mom wanted an ice coffee. I went inside with her to wait and as we were in a line, a lady with a mermaid tattoo on her shoulder walked up to me and said ***" I just wanted you to know that you and your hair are absolutely beautiful".*** I felt so happy on the inside and thanked her as she left. I was thinking about the compliment the whole ride home and how grateful I was to be complimented. Mental health is a roller coaster and I definitely will be getting more help for it, but her compliment truly saved me from wanting to cause any harm to myself or feel more worthless. I felt like just ending it all, but she gave me a glimpse of happiness and I thank her so much for that. Please give a person a compliment regardless if you are strangers or know each other, it will make them so happy i promise.
