I have issues with how I look to the point that it makes me suffer every day And I'm not like delusional people who are actually cute and think they're ugly, I'm genuinely absolutely hideous, to the point where "beauty is subjective" doesn't apply to me at all. Nobody can possibly think that I'm cute and that's a fact. 

Anyway, I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family for years and even have problems going out of my room to talk to my family because I hate how i look so bad. Which obviously means I don't have friends. And people claim "friends shouldn't care about looks" but then they're fucking skinny and perfect and everyone wants to instantly be their friend. And I was fat since I was a kid because my parents didn't care about my health, and nobody wanted to be my friend because why the fuck would they when they could have a skinny normal friend? It's just how the fucking world works.

And I'm not working on losing weight but I don't think being fat is the whole issue, my face and head shape is fucked and my body is fucked and I'm hopeless for anyone to ever date me. And it makes me want to kill myself because there's no point working to fix something that's impossible really, I don't think even expensive plastic surgery could fix me good enough. I was born to kill myself.
