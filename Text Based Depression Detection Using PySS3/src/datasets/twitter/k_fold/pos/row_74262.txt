Lmao I just remembered thatmy parents used to threaten me that they would send me to a military school when i was &gt;10. Also I remember how in grade one I respected my teachers more than my parents, I actually remember my parents asking grade 1 me "do you act like this at school!?"  "no"  and then they said something like "then treat us like we are your teachers then" and I said something like "but I like my teachers more than you" 

You know something isnâ€™t quite right when a 5-6 year old respects their teachers more then their parents
