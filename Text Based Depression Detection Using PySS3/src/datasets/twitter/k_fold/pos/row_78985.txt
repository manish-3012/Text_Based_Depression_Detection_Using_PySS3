How did/do you guys actually connect/get close to your friends? Iâ€™ve always been terrible around people, typically meeting friends because somebody else I knew met them, and they just joined the friend group.  That means that a lot of the people I meet are only around when some other friends are, we never really do anything alone, and more often than not, if I go out of my way to make a friend rather than wait for somebody else to just be â€œabsorbedâ€ into the friend group, we stop talking within a few months.

I have had maybe 2 friends over the past few years though that Iâ€™ve gotten really close to and was actually comfortable around (which is rare), but I honestly have absolutely no idea how or why.
