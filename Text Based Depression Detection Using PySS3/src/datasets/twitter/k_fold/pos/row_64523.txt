it has officially been 250 days My best steam friend was last online 250 days ago. i met him on unturned and we made this massive base and took over the entire server and that was about a year ago we would log on and play almost every weekend to play unturned but 250 days ago he just disappeared. I often checked to see if he had been online but it was in vain. goodbye my friend.
