Im genuinely afraid that schools in the U.S are reopening... As a student myself, i don't understand why everyone is so hell bent on getting back in school. I understand this pandemic is devastating to some individuals mental health, and people in abusive homes, but why put so many teachers and children at risk just so they can socialize with each other. I personally, am anxious and melancholy when its time for school, and this has been a good refresh for me. I believe reopening would be a bad decision, and seems like teachers and students are being used as pawns for the government trying to see when they can reopen fast enough. On the note of this isolation being traumatic, I think a student's teacher, or relative, DYING because of them going back to school, would be even more traumatic, as I, and others, would probably feel immensely guilty. On the other hand, e learning is not much better, as not everyone has the recources, and/or just doesnt work as well virtually. I know from experience, that it can be stressful, and scary learning from home. I think this is a lose lose situation, but i personally think reopening would not be the smarter option. lmk what u guys think in the comments.
