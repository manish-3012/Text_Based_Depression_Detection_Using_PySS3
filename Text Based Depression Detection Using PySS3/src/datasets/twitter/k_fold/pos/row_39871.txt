Tips to pulling an all-nighter I know yâ€™all like staying up all night. Itâ€™s fun. You get to play video games and stuff. So from a person whoâ€™s had some experience, hereâ€™s some advice. 
1. Never look at the time. If you look at the time and you see itâ€™s later than you normally stay up, your body will get pretty tired. 
2. Always have food or drink to give you energy. Thatâ€™s the nature of food. It gives you energy.  Do NOT drink energy drinks  or caffeine unless itâ€™s the tail-end of your all nighter. They will make you tired after they wear off. Iâ€™d recommend things like water or protein shakes to drink instead. 
3. Have something to distract you from your tiredness. Youâ€™re gonna be tired, but if you distract yourself, you wonâ€™t notice. Watching action movies or playing video games are some things you can do. If youâ€™re studying for a test or doing homework, have music that will keep you awake. 
4. Donâ€™t try too hard. Effort makes you tired. Just chill and act like this is your standard routine. 
And with that are my four tips. Feel free to criticize them or add your own in the comments.
