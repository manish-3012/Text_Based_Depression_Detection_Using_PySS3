Late night thoughts  

As I sit here in prison of reality alone 

I sip the poison thats stands next to my computer screen

Instead of facing my fears of being alone 

The minutes tick by into hours yet feel like mere milliseconds 

When one lets their days tick by as if grains of sands in a hourglass 

Are they truly living ? or is life just a well fabricated lie to help the masses?

The late night thoughts of depressed are just another voiceless scream into the void of loneliness. 

Loneliness is the sentence given to the damned while love is a reward given to the hopeful

But yet again it's always better looking out the bars of your cell into others maybe just maybe nothing matters at the end of the hourglass and we are just voiceless screams
