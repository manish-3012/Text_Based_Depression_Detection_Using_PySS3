Hi i would like to warn you about the Hodge Twins! (P.S. if you hate politics move on) First off the Hodge Twins are a couple of male twins that call themselves comedians on Instagram, they have amassed 1.5 million followers on Instagram, they identify as conservative and out spoken in their bio. The majority of their content is dedicated to poking fun a â€œliberalsâ€ and the BLM movement. 

They were brought to my attention when somebody I follow posted an IG TV video where they talked about leaked footage of gorge Floydâ€™s arrest, they said that Jorge was saying that he couldnâ€™t breath before they had sat on his neck and that he had drugs in his system. Not having heard of some of this so called evidence and only seeing a quick maybe 15 second clip of the so called â€œleaked evidenceâ€ with out any sound. 

I tried reaching out to to the two to try and see some of this so called evidence in the raw format, including the evidence of there bing digs in his system, and with no avail, it has almost been a week with no replyâ€™s to the email. 

I asked them to solidify their arguments that they put up in the video and they havenâ€™t tried to refute them in the least bit. 

WARNING: their content on their Instagram is very triggering if you lean towards the liberal side of politics!! 

If you do see these two steer clear of them or find a way to contact them to see if they would be willing to refute anything that they have said.

One last thing is that they said that the killing that these cops have committed isnâ€™t justified but still tried to justify them, they also blamed the looting and rioting on the BLM movement when people that are on the ground protesting have very clearly stated to no avail that these looting and destruction of property is based on other agendas and not agendas of their own. 

Thank you very much, if I did miss something I will be willing to answer them in the comments
