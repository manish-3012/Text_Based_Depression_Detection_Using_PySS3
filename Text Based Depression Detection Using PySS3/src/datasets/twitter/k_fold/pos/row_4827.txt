My dad surprised me with tickets to Thorpe Park! Every year me and my dad go to a theme park, this year we are going to 3. 

1. Lego land!
2. Thorpe Park (British theme park)
3. Alton towers! We go every year (British theme park)

We havenâ€™t been to Lego land in 3 years and Iâ€™ve never properly been able to go to Thorpe park! (I was too young for roller coasters when we went.)

We go to Lego land and Thorpe park next month! Itâ€™s something me and dad bond over :).
