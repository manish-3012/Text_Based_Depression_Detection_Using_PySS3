I actually started reading a manga Cuz the anime ended on volume 4 and I didnâ€™t think thereâ€™s going to be another season 

I want a second season of citrus, also Iâ€™ve never read manga before and the whole right to left thing through me off at first but itâ€™s fine once you get used to it, although Iâ€™m bad at reading things or at least retaining what I read so I constantly have to reread things or sometimes I forget to do that and have to go back 3 pages or 2 volumes or reread the entire thing because I wasnâ€™t paying attention to anything I was reading although thatâ€™s not as much of a problem with citrus
