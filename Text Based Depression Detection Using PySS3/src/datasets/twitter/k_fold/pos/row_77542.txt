I HAVE A SUGAR MAMA 16 talking to a 36 yr old woman WHO THINKS IM 19 IN COLLEGE ðŸ˜µ Ok so Im trying match with some females on kik. I do we start a conversation you know "how are you" and all that good shit. Then she asks me my age Im 16 but I tell her Im 19. Then she tells me she is 36, then asks me "what are you looking for on here" I tell her "a WAP". She starts telling me "Im cute" and asking me "wanna add" And Im like hell no you're a 36 yr old woman (but that was just In my head) I tell her "Im still In school, Im 19 lady" she asks "you ever heard of a sugar moma?" I tell her "I have heard about that, but lady there are plenty of grown men on this app" after that she tells me "Well I'm down here looking for a sugar baby and ready to take of all bills" at this point I see a potential ðŸ’° bag so Im like "well ok then ðŸ˜" she starts asking me for my cash app and If I have a debit card.. Mind you Im only 16 so I obviously don't..at this point I feel like Im fucked, and Im gonna miss out on a potential bag.. So I tell her "I'll give her my cash app tomorrow" In plans on using my older sisters cash app tomorrow. We agreed on $300 a week. And it's 12:00 am right now so I told her old ass "good night" hopefully this goes well.. Females are stupid.. 

TLDR: I have a stupid sugar mama lol
