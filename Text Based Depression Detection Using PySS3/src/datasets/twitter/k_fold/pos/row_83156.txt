Why are parents like this? Over dinner we started talking about the measures taken by the government to fight COVID and also about school, where I pointed out that it's utterly ridiculous that we are going to write a 4 hour exam every second day (Technically every day since we only go to school every second day as to have smaller groups) and they immediately told me it's all my fault because I didn't do anything during homeschooling. This was an utter lie, I did everything except my Latin work because I couldn't keep up during homeschooling. 

So according to my parents the only reason I will probably flunk most exams (like everyone else will) is because I "did nothing" and not that it is completely unfair to not even tell us what's on the exam and expect us to learn the entire stuff of a semester in a single day?

Why do parents always have to blame you for everything?
