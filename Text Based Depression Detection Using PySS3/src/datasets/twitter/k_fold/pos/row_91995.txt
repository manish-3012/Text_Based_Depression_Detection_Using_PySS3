I just think itâ€™s funny how straight men are constantly talking about how they want a gf so bad Imagine how tired gay men are, imagine how tired we are of it, thereâ€™s like 0.0009% chance weâ€™ll actually find someone irl and barely any of us talk as much about it as straight men do, 

Anyways welcome to Wendyâ€™s what can I get you today
