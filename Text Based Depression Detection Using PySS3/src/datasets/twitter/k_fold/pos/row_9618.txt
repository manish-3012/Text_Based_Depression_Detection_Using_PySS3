I have something weighing on my heart and I have to tell it to someone Hello, I am a 15 year old male,last week my mom went through my computer and discovered my porn folder (I am into interracial black on white porn) I am aware I am sick and I need help, but I got addicted to it 2 years ago and couldn't quit since then, she wouldn't talk to me and behaves really passive agressive, what should I do? please, I just can't do it anymore

(english is not my native language so excuse any grammatical mistakes)
