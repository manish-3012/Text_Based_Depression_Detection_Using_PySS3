I am once again asking for your knowledgeable support Not to long ago I started dating a girl and its obvious to me now that she means the world to me and I'd do anything to make her happy, it seems however that she has a hard time loving herself, I've never really experienced much like this myself. But like I said I'll do anything to see her happy , that includes making her see herself in a better light. It's not like she doesn't like the way she looks , she just can't let herself be less than perfect on tests a or during social interactions I class or with random people, she thinks assumes everyone is like her parents and that they disapprove of her but I just know that's not the case. And she blames herself for everything even when I tell her it's completely out of her hands

Does anyone know how to help her get through this or if you've experienced something like this yourself would be be so kind to share your story with me so that I can learn from it.

I don't care how long it takes to get her to love herself more I'm committed to this girl for life if it was my choice only I  just want to do this for her, nothing makes me as happy as seeing her happy.
