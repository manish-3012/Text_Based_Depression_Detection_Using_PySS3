the worst day Iâ€™ve had in a while This morning I spilled maple syrup all over my desk and key board, which took forever to clean up, and it wasnâ€™t the best way to start my morning. And then, half way through school, I sat up out of my chair, and I got super light headed for some reason. And all I remember is waking up in the floor with a throbbing headache. Iâ€™m pretty sure I passed out. The rest of the day I felt dizzy. After school I went to get lunch on my bike. it was pouring rain. When I got there, I also got a soda, but I forgot to grab it on my way out. I didnâ€™t realize that until after I ate. So when I was almost home, I turned back, rode my bike about two miles, and when I got there, I forgot my receipt, so they refused to give me the drink. I rode home, disappointed. When I got home, I wanted to take a shower, becuase I was freezing cold, and soaking wet. But the shower was being used. I thought I could ride down to this gas station down my street to get a drink, with the two extra dollars I had, I also had to get some milk as well. On my way there, there was a parked car in front of me that I didnâ€™t see, and I didnâ€™t have time to brake, because the street was really slippery. And I crashed head on into the back of the car, spraining my wrist. It took my about two minutes to get my phone out of my pocket to call my mom, becuase I was in so much pain. While I was waiting in the pouring rain, on a curb, the owner of that car asked me if Iâ€™ve done any damage to the car, (I think he saw me crash) I told him I didnâ€™t think so. At least I didnâ€™t see anything. And I was really embarrassed sitting there. My mom finally came and took me home. And now Iâ€™m here. This took me a long time to write because of my bad hand. Thank you if you were able to make it to the end and hear my rant.
