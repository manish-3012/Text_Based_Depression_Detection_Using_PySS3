Iâ€™ve spent 3 hours working on a single project for graphic design and Iâ€™m still not done (advice needed) I hate this class so much. I probably couldâ€™ve gotten in done in under an hour if I wasnâ€™t so detailed with it. I decided to try my best since I missed two of the graphic design zooms in a row. I wanted to get all of my missing assignments done for all of my classes today but if itâ€™s taken me 5 hours to only do two I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s possible, especially since itâ€™s already 1:05 am. Maybe I could just pull an all nighter since I have a half day of school tomorrow and I could just take a nap after. What do you think I should do?
