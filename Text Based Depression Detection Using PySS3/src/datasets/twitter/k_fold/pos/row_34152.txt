Honestly, fuck High School and all that it brings So, context:

I started high school (Iâ€™m from Italy) 2 months ago after leaving middle school with the highest mark (in italy â€œ10 e lodeâ€, kinda like an A++)

At the start of the year we always do entry tests, but the marks you get in those donâ€™t count towards your average. I got pretty high marks on those but, of course, my parents didnâ€™t care much since theyâ€™re used to it.
Then i was called for my first oral test, and got 7.25/10, which is pretty good for high school.
Then another one, this time in Art, and got 6/10, which is, mathematically, barely sufficient. And i answered all the questions correctly, so i was ok with myself since i knew i studied properly; of course, it wasnâ€™t the same for my parents. 

They started saying that iâ€™m not studying proprerly, that itâ€™s not like this that i will progress in life, that they canâ€™t trust me on studying if i get this low marks. Not - A - Single - Good - Word about good marks, but a 30 minutes long lecture for a decent one? And it doesnâ€™t help that my brother (who is in middle school), comes home with 9s and 10s and my parents congratulate him and say that theyâ€™re so proud of him. 

All this doesnâ€™t help to the fact that theyâ€™re convinced that â€œvideogames burn my brainâ€ and that i spend too much time playing them (2-3 hours a day). 

Iâ€™m sorry for the rant, i really needed to chill all this anger with myself and school that was building up. 

Any advice is welcome, if you have it. 

Thanks for reading if you arrived all the way down here.
