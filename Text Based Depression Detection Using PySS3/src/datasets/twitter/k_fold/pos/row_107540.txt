It sucks being the ugliest in the friend group So Iâ€™m not a very good looking guy but ig my personality got me a really cool friend group and We are having a party tomorrow at my buddies and like the hottest girls from our school are gonna be there and all my friends are saying I can pull one of them because sheâ€™s like the least good looking one in the girls friend group and itâ€™s such a back handed compliment. Like Just because of how I look Iâ€™m not gonna get any girls and they are itâ€™s just so aggravating knowing they will live a far better life just because they got better genetics. This is seriously why I do drugs and why I think Iâ€™ll die alone.
