The Story of my First Relationship All the way back in September of last year I developed a crush on a girl weâ€™ll call, Angela. She was a quirky and incredibly talented artist which opposes my mostly nerdy and book smart shelf but nonetheless on my birthday in October I declared my crush on her and she said sheâ€™d give me a try.

Two weeks later I went in my first date to watch Spirited Away in theatre (it was her favorite movie and it was a special event nonetheless) and we held hands and got lunch beforehand. Overall, a really good time.

However I was a junior and she was a senior so as college apps ramped up she used this as an excuse to talk to me less and less. For two months she barely talked to me yet I still had feelings and was too naive to understand she didnâ€™t reciprocate them. I just assumed she was stressed and needed a break. 

But after nearly 2 weeks of not even saying hi to her in the hallways, I asked her what was going on and she admitted she was no longer bisexual but fully lesbian. 

I admit it was foolish of me to not get the hint she wasnâ€™t interested but this still hurt me a lot cause I get attached very easily and I still had a lot of feelings for her. In addition, I get this is not my fault nor my choice but it was still hurtful to know I was maybe a part of making her decision to be lesbian.  

To this day we donâ€™t talk much even though I try and say hi occasionally but she has moved on to college and the rest of her life. I am lucky to now have my first true girlfriend of 5 months and I adore her and at least Angela taught me to always be open about my feelings.
