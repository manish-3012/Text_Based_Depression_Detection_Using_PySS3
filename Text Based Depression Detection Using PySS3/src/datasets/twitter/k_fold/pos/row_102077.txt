Nothing hurts my soul more than being quiet cause I can't add or say anything God it fucking hurts, its so awkward I feel like I should leave cause Im not adding anything and they seem to be fine without acknowledging me. But they're also kinda trying to include me but like only once in awhile which i appreciate but g o d it's still super awkward- just AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH.

Genuinely causes me way too much anxeity more than it should-
