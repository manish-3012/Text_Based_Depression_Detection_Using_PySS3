Im going to do an ATLA marathon with my crush and im feeling great. So in a few hours we will start together with 2 others who are all quite close, and we'll be stuck together for 24 hours which i dont mind. We get along quite well and she doesnt know yet. My other friend does. Im hoping to het to know her better and maybe even make a move. I just wanted to share this because I feel like there's still a chance for me. If you guys want I could give an uldate later.
