Donâ€™t put ur â€œpRoNoUnSâ€ in ur bio I donâ€™t mean any offense to the trans community Iâ€™m talking about those weirdos who put their pronouns in their bio even tho everybody knows theyâ€™re a boy or girl. If youâ€™re gender binary then it makes sense since not everybody can tell(Along with people who havenâ€™t transitioned, people who just look like the opposite sex or people with both genitalia) but unless youâ€™re one of those donâ€™t fucking do it. Iâ€™ve had friends that get pissed off whenever they see this(and yes they r trans), they say itâ€™s stupid how people think of it as a trend and it suffocated them because itâ€™s being used for the wrong purposes. Lesson of the story is, donâ€™t be that weirdo bitch who puts their pronouns in their bio because nobody fucking cares and itâ€™s annoying.
