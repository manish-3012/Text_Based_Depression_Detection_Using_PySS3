My last day as a 15 year old Tomorrow I'm going to turn 16, which I'm excited about but I'm kinda sad to see the last "year" go by so quickly (at least it felt quick). I've been through a lot of good shit and bad shit and did some cool things and some stupid things. For example, I found this sub, which was good, because it occasionally makes me laugh and I was able to stop a cutting problem I had begun. But in all seriousness, I cant wait to see what 16 has to offer to me and see what it has for me. Soon I'll be able to get my drivers license and get a job, or in other words, "adult things". I'm sure it wont be perfect by any means but I'm sure itll be as great if not better then 15. I hope everyone has a great day!
