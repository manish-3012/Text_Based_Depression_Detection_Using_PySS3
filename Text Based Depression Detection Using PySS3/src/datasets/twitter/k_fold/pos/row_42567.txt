I hate how people make fun of each other for their music tastes Like bruh. It is not a competition to see whoâ€™s is the best. It is not that serious that I donâ€™t have a bunch of 70â€™s rock in my playlist, just like how it isnâ€™t an issue that you donâ€™t have a bunch of modern rap in yourâ€™s. It really is okay. People will act like the universe will implode if everyone doesnâ€™t have the same music taste as them. 

Also, the whole making fun of part. I see people just ripping other people to fucking shreds over what music they listen to. WHY? What is the point other than to inflate your massive superiority complex? It really doesnâ€™t make sense imo and it just discourages people from listening to the type of music they wanna listen to. 

So please, next time youâ€™re about bash someone for listening to music you donâ€™t personally like, just stop, and think, because if you do youâ€™re about to be a massive dick.
