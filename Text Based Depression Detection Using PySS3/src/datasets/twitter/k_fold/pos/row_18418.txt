So i asked my crush out and she leads me on then said she was kidding after like 10-15 mins of talking. WTF So yeah i mean the title says it all really, I told my crush I liked her and she said she like me back and I was like "holy shit its actually happening" cause i was mentally preparing myself for rejection but then wow she said yes. We then talked for like 10-15 minutes and when the conversation was about to end she says (exact words) "Ahah i dont actually want to date, i dont even like you I just thought it would be funny". Then goes and screenshots all of the conversation like WTF. I would have been fine with just a no, but hey at least i can stop thinking about her now.

Yeah so just wanted to rant.
