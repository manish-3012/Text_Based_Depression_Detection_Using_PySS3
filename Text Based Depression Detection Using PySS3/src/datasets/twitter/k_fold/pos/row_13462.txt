Self Isolating For those who care, today I went to school, sat through a maths class, then on the bus to the second school site, I was informed that someone in my psychology has COVID.

This means I am now self isolating.

Honestly, a few weeks back I said I wanted to self isolate, because I wanted the full â€˜virus experienceâ€™ to tell my children/grandchildren about, so I could tell them that I knew what happened, but now itâ€™s happening, Iâ€™m scared.

Now, me and my Dad (who isnâ€™t self isolating, heâ€™s just in crutches so canâ€™t work) are going to be stuck together for three weeks, and other than occasionally baking or playing Pokemon, I have no clue what Iâ€™m going to do, well, except occasionally trying to do this thing called â€˜schoolworkâ€™.

Leave suggestions below cause I know Iâ€™m going to be super bored these next few weeks, and I need suggestions!
