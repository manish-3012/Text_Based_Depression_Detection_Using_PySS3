Same names. So I was in that tired/drunk like state and decided to see if I could find a person I talked with at a con a while back. We introduced ourselves and chatted. And we haven't seen eachother since. I for some reason remember their name and face, but when I try to find 'em I get nothing but other accounts with the same name. I know part of it is they have a Hispanic last name, in a largely Hispanic state. So I fucked myself up on that part.

But nonetheless I'll look every now and again. I also found out she attends the "Rival" to my high school. (I have friends that attend that school, just an FYI). 

I (un)fortunately don't have this problem. Unless I look at Iowa and see family I didn't know I had. But where i currently live is bizzare. 

This is the end to my rant. 

TLDR; met someone few years ago, figured why not look em up. Can't find them. I fortunately have the opposite of the problem.
