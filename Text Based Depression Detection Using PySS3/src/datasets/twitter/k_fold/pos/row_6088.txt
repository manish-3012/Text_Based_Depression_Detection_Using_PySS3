I strongly dislike little kids Okay I don't hate kids hate is a strong word but they're sticky gross messy they piss and shit everywhere they're loud they complain They bitch and moan. You're basically just creating a chore tax when you have one. No I don't hate all kids most become normal at around age 7 but those first 6 years *ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww*


So with that being said 


Thank a parent who actually disciplined their kids. Cause that's difficult as shit
