My ACT experience today... I bad at exposition and all, but holy shit bro I'm mad! So, I had to do an ACT today which wasn't terrible, but the classroom that the principal chose for my testing room was RIGHT NEXT TO THE BAND ROOM. MAN it's really effin hard to concentrate on the tests when you hear people playing instruments terribly. I think during the reading test pissed me off the most cause I'm not the best at reading with an incredible amount of background noise. Not to mention by the time I hit the science test segment, my brain was fried. I'm talking deep fried. 

  
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.  


TL:DR - I'm pissed at my principal for ruining my ACT score.
