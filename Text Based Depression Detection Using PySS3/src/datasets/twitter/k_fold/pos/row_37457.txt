I don't care what you believe in, as long as you don't enforce it on others. I have absolutely no problem with religious people, vegans, very opinionated people, etc. But, I do have a problem with people who look down upon people for not having the same opinions/ideology as them. For example, in my home city, there was a major vegan protest where they blocked the main entrance to the city in order to "raise awareness" about their lifestyle. Look, I don't care that you're vegan, just don't force me to be one.
