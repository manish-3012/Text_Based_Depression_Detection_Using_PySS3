Pro tip: don't fuck with flex tape. So like 2-3 years ago I got flex tape as a christmas gift, and I hardly had a use for it. Finally, I discovered a use when one of the leg thingys on my keyboard broke and I couldn't get it back on. Anytime I'd play games with friends, my keyboard would be moving around and the side without the leg would bang against the desk.





So my solution? Flex tape both the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the desk with a little tape roll thing. In the end, I got a new keyboard, and when it came time to take the flex tape off, I couldn't fucking do it. I got the keyboard off fine, but that roll was still there. When I tried just using brute force to take it off my desk, I just ended up lifting my desk a good inch off the ground.





So I chipped away at it with a knife for like a week. Theres still fucking flex tape residue on my desk. I don't think it's ever coming off. I learned my lesson, flex tape is *not* to be fucked with.
