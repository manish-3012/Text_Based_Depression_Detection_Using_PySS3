I still can not swim again So our government just announced some new rules and stuff. All people of my age who play sports outside can sport again, but I play Waterpolo and the swimming pools are not open yet. Only for swimming schools for kids under 12 years old. I'm just gonna waste 5 hours every week of my life (yes I still go outside for P.E. and stuff) but I'm just mad at the government. I kinda have the feeling swimming sports are being forgotten.

It's unfair.

Do whatever you want with this idc. If you have advice please give it in the comments.
