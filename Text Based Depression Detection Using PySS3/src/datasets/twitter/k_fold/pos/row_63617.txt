guess who's up again. our dog woke me up around 4 am... i can never get to sleep, but tonight i did relatively well considering the past few nights have been hell, save for the night before (check previous posts ig). but Im up, and all i can do is think of him. i want to go downstairs and check on him, if only to see his face again. but he's probably asleep, and i'd be in deep shit if i was caught. so here i lay, the bear he got me held tightly in my arms, his cologne still fading on its artificial fur. i wish he was here again, in my bed, whispering sweet nothings into my ear just so i know i'm safe in his arms... i ruined even the chance of that ever happening again. instead, we hug in secret, just before bed. he holds me tightly and we try to ignore what lies behind our eyes as we lose ourselves in each other's gaze. i feel so incomplete.
