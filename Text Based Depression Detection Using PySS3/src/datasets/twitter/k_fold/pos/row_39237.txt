my school strikes again! we just had a zoom lecture about "culture in corona time" or something like that. it was a sweeping generalization of culture and they apparently think theater is the only type of culture. they presented it as if without theater there isn't culture at all. they took an apocalyptic look on the thing. they asked us questions but guess what? we can't unmute ourselves, and they unmuted like 3 people. this is the kind of shit that makes me hate teachers.

sorry if this offends anyone, but i need to vent goddamit.
