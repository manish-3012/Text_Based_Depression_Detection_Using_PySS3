Sometimes I just hate my mum. My room is an outside garage, just so this actually makes sense

Everytime my mum gets home Iâ€™m sitting in my own room playing on my computer, and everytime I go inside she quickly gets out a cigarette and starts smoking. When I come back she doesnt even care, she just continues. It literally says on every single cigarette packet that people have died from smoking, and she doesnt care.

Every day I basically cough my lungs out and my mum just sits there on the phone to her friend Debbie and talks about jack shit and doesnâ€™t care that my lungs are getting destroyed.

Iâ€™m sort of addicted to my computer, but thatâ€™s because its the only form of entertainment here. She smokes because she feels like it, you can just not buy a packet of cigarettes and youâ€™re fine, but for SOME UNKNOWN FUCKING REASON, SHE CANT STOP

EVEN WHEN I BEG HER NOT TO GET A PACKET, SHE STILL DOES.

I just feel like getting the cigarette packet everytime she buys one and throwing it in the bin.

Hereâ€™s a description of my mum:
