I want to rant about to things, if interested... First one, damn I miss winter. Where I am from, it's supposed to be spring, but it feels like summer. Summer is one of my least favourite seasons, it's hot all the time, I am more prone to feel more lazy/tired

Second thing, mom I like my room, because it is cool, quite and I can listen to music without feeling rude, or uncomfortable.

Thank you for your time, have a 69 day/night futher
