Is Facebook that serious? My mother called me crying today about my brother unfriending her. She said that she doesnâ€™t know what she did wrong and that itâ€™s her only way of seeing his life besides calling him. 

My mother only posts politics on Facebook. Democrats this, republicans that, COVID 19!! And frankly I donâ€™t even want to see that. She hasnâ€™t found out yet that I unfriended her, too. My brothers reply to her cries were â€œitâ€™s just Facebookâ€ when she exclaimed â€œitâ€™s not just Facebook, itâ€™s the only way I have to share about you and the rest of our family.â€ She then finished the conversation with â€œfuck you [brother]â€ 

No I can understand why someone would be offended by their son unfriending them on social media, itâ€™s like â€œouch why?â€ But I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that serious. I didnâ€™t even have Facebook up until a year or two ago, only for running ads. Iâ€™ve got every other social media imaginable. 

Personally, I think that if you think other people care about your opinion, youâ€™re crazy. My mother doesnâ€™t get more than 6 likes on a post, and she posts a couple times a day. But having friends on Facebook is important to her I guess. I think she should stop. Delete all social media and take a break for awhile. She is a very heat of the moment kind of person, so she would benefit greatly from a break.
