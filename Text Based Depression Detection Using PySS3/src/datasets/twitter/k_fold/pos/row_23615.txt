Why am I full,but I still want to eat So it started out with me eating pizza rolls and chicken strips at supper time,and I thought I was satisfied,till I wanted one more strip,but I didn't want it. I went to my room and my hunger was calling me so I ate me some chips(takis) that lasted me over a week. I then ate cookies later on and then cucumbers(that's what she said) while writing a book on wattpad and finding concepts for a robotic skeleton. I then eventually got full but I blamed it on the salt. I now want another chicken strip,but I don't know if I should cause I'm still full.
