Parents logic am I right? So I overheard my parents talking about â€œmaybe the stress is getting to himâ€ â€œsomething something online schoolâ€ blah blah fucking blah, and Iâ€™m wondering who theyâ€™re talking about. 
They were talking about my 6 year old, â€œspecialâ€ brother who got in trouble for throwing a goddamn chair at school.
Yet they blow up at me because my homework pile is the size of an airplane, and I canâ€™t get it all turned in on time, yet they choose to think the events of 2020 are having major impacts ON A FUCKING 6 YEAR OLD instead of on me and my older sister.
Iâ€™m breaking into smaller pieces every other day, I struggle to believe if true love even fucking exists anymore, I get yelled at for the dumbest shit possible, my older sister is anti-social as shit, 

I know it looks like I post shit like this every other day, but itâ€™s because I have no other way to vent my personal frustrations better than to strangers on the internet
