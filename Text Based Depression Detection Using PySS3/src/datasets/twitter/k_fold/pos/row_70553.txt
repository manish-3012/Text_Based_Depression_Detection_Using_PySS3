is it ok if a very shy guy to do this? Is it ok for a shy guy to approach only girls that explicitly show interest ( and that, of course, iâ€™m interested in )? I mean, iâ€™ve been suffering with very bad self esteem, and i got to take medicines now, but at least iâ€™m not ugly, maybe iâ€™m plain looking: that means that at least some girls might be interested. 

So, as i wrote, is it right or not? I mean, i canâ€™t understand how come almost all guys approach girls they never saw and that never showed interest for them.

Am i strange? What should i do?
