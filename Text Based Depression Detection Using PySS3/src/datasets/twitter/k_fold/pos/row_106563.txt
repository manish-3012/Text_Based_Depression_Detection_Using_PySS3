Ok you guys wonâ€™t believe what my school just did. Ok for context I go to a Christian school (Iâ€™m not trying to offend anyone, Iâ€™m just saying it for context). My school brought in a speaker yesterday and I just wanted to go over a few points he told us about:

1. Every single one of you in this room is depressed. Odds are you canâ€™t do anything about it.

2. Someoneâ€™s always going to be better, faster, stronger, or smarter than you. You will never be good enough to make it in the world.

3. *someone asks him about boy/girl friendships* Well, thereâ€™s nothing in the Bible that says boys CANT be friends with girls, but I would definitely not advise it. Boys and girls really shouldnâ€™t be friends

He had a lot more but Iâ€™m about to leave and gotta finish typing. If you want me to eleborate on anything let me know in the comments.

Hereâ€™s the thing. HES COMING BACK FOR PART 2 TODAY. (If this blows up Iâ€™ll give a part 2).
