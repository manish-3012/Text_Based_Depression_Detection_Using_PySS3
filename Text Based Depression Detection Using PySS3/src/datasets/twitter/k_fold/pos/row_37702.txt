How I turned my Reddit addiction into something usefulðŸ¦Š  The internet has beaten me more often than I like to admit...  
Yesterday, I visited unproductive sites (Reddit, Facebook, Instagram etc) 78 times! Fuck! Most of those times I wasn't consciously visiting those sites. It just happened..

That's why I made a useful chrome extension for myself that redirects me from distracting websites to useful and interesting websites! No more Reddit for me, but more Indiehackers! No more Instagram, but [Trends.co](http://trends.co/). No more YouTube, but more Producthunt.

You get the picture ðŸ“·

If that sounds something you want to try, you can add it to your chrome browser for free. Any suggestion would be more than welcome!
