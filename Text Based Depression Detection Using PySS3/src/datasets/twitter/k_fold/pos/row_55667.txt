Anyone else get in this weird mood It feels like "I really want to go out and do something today, but everything I want to do includes friends and I don't really want to ask because at this point they probably already have plans anyway. Plus, I'm always the one who sets stuff up but am never invited anywhere so they probably think I'm annoying." or is that just me?
