My mom found my secret candy stash and now Iâ€™m dead. So there was a time a while ago where I couldnâ€™t stop eating anything that contains sugar. Since I didnâ€™t want the wrappers to wind up in our trash bin, I instead hid them in a bag in my room. After this weird time I felt bad for eating so much in secret and stopped. However, today my mom found the bag and she told me she has never been this disappointed in me. Sheâ€™s been avoiding me at all costs, and I can understand because I really am a piece of shit to do this. Iâ€™m just kind of stuck and wanted to vent somewhere, since I was supposed to clean my room, but Iâ€™ve been crying instead, because my relationship with my mom is fucking done now. It will take months to fix this (damn it I was gonna order a plush and new skateboard wheels tonight, guess that wonâ€™t be happening). Now I have way too much on my plate since school just started and itâ€™s busy, I recently go out with friends a lot (and they expect me to), I have to clean my entire room AND I now have a ruined relationship that will get in the way of everything. Great.
