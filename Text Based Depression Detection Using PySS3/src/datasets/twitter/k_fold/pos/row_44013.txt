I feel like crying because christmas makes me sad, but when I try there's no tears Christmas makes me sad because I feel so lonely even though I'm with my family. I feel so fucking depressed.

Even vodka doesn't change anything.

Maybe drugs will.

Why am I lying to myself, they won't.

Still wanna try lol
