My crush tried to kill herself. I don't even know what to say. Just 2 days ago she was completely happy. We were having the best of times together, we even made plans to meet at Niagara Falls in 2 years. And then yesterday I don't get a single text from her and I see on snap that she is in a hospital. I start freaking the fuck out. Over a whole day of me just worrying about her. Then just 2 hours ago her friend texts me and tells me she tried to kill herself. I had no idea how to react. I love this girl, and looking back I saw the signs and I could've done something to stop this. I could have prevented this from happening. Idk when I'll be able to tall to her again. I just needed to get this out there. She means the world to me.
