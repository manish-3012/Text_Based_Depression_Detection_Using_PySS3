Is this normal or am I just weird? So is it normal to have a crush on fictional characters because with ochaco from my hero academia and kasumi from persona 5 royal I feel a kind of live higher than what I have ever felt for any one I have had a crush on is this normal or does this make me even more of a social outcast
