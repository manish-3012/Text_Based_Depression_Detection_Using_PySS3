Can someone please tell me Iâ€™m not crazy (TW SEXUAL ASSULT) If your parents slap you on the ass (not in a discipline way- just literally slapping you on the ass) thatâ€™s sexual assault right?
Cos theyâ€™ve been doing that since I was like 5 till now, and sometimes theyâ€™d make comments about how my ass had grown or how it was big and then slap it. Itâ€™s gotten to the point in recent years where I have anxiety about having my back to my parents especially my dad Cos Iâ€™m worried they might slap it.

I think my dad might have actually tried to molest me once as well, Cos I was lying down on the couch once when I was younger with him Cos we were watching a show and we were under a blanket, and for some reason in the back of my head I thought he was going to touch me, and then a couple minutes later he touched/ squeezed my nipple but he went no further than that- 

holy shit I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ve actually opened up about this to someone. But I just feel really empty realising that I might have been sexually assaulted by my parents so can someone please just tell me their opinion on this
