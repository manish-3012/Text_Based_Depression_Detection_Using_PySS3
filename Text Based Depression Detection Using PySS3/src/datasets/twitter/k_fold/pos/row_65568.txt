I donâ€™t understand people sometimes Why waste your time writing out hate comments? Youâ€™re telling the algorithm you like that content and want to see more of it by doing that. Do people not Think things through? I swear. 

Also, why hate in people because of a hobby. I get SO much hate for being a furry and cosplayer (I also play Gacha life a little bit to get along with my sisters who live far away). Why do people feel the need to bully others. Do not type out something you wouldnâ€™t say in real life.
