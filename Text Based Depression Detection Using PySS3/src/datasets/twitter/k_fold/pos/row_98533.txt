I stood up to my abusive dad Well, today I finally snapped. For the first time I actually told my dad how I felt about him. I detailed how I feel constantly frightened about being around him and that I donâ€™t want to be around him.

I know itâ€™s not much, but, for me, this is a huge moment, for once I actually spoke my mind.

Of course, he didnâ€™t take it well, jumping around different excuses, from accusing me of being mentally disabled due to the medication I take, to being brainwashed into hating him by my mum. 

Regardless of how he reacted, itâ€™s a start for me being more independent and to not be forced to do everything he says.
