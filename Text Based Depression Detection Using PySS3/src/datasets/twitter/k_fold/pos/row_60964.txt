I want to let all my emotions out. I dont know if it's just me, but I just want to blast my favorite song and scream. I just want to let out all my feelings. I'm tired of bottling up all of my emotions everyday. I don't know how to do it without getting in trouble or whatever. I just want to break something. Like punch my wall or something close to that. Any advice or anything?
