i still like him i used to have class with this guy (letâ€™s call him bob) last year. iâ€™m a year younger so he graduated and went to college but iâ€™m still in high school. i always really liked him as a friend and we were pretty close (walking down the hallways together when we bumped into each other, fighting over chairs and eventually just sharing the seat together, doing tiktok dances, lots of banter in general) but i had a crush on his best friend and confessed my feelings to that friend. we went on a couple dates and bob would ask about how itâ€™s going between us pretty frequently. eventually things didnâ€™t work out. later bob went to me for relationship advice because he had a crush on another girl in our class and also ranted to me about how his â€œthingâ€ with a previous girl ended suddenly. i gave him my two cents on going after his crush and he began talk to that girl a lot more during class. i would root him on like his wingwoman, i felt happy for him. it wasnâ€™t until he graduated that i noticed myself missing him more than anyone other senior, i couldnâ€™t stop thinking about him. we donâ€™t talk much anymore except his occasional swipe up on my private story (he always initiates since he doesnâ€™t post on snap so i have nothing to swipe up to) and our conversations are brief and awkward now that i have feelings for him and get nervous whenever we text. itâ€™s already been one year and i kinda feel heartbroken? itâ€™s so bizarre. i always saw him as a close friend and we even helped each other with our relationship situations, but maybe i had feelings for him the whole time and didnâ€™t want to admit it thinking itâ€™d never work out (heâ€™s a very charming guy and pretty popular). i drove down his street the other day as i was dropping something off for my friend who was his neighbor, and i just felt so empty. i wish i could go back in time to relive our moments together because that was possibly the happiest year iâ€™ve had in my life so far.
