Teenagers who have be diagnosed with anxiety I don't know whether what happens to me is anxiety or is just normal for a teenager. I always look up what happens to me and its an anxiety attack. I made a post in r/anxiety and some off the people were telling me I was going through an anxiety attack. 

I don't want to tell anyone in real life because I don't want to seem like those brats who self diagnose themselves and act like the have a mental illness just for attention 

Well the reason I wanted to make this post is to ask how did you know you suffered for anxiety and how does it affect school.
