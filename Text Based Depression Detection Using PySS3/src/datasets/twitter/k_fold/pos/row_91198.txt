I have a massive pimple that i just cannot pop and it bothers me An unreasonable amount And when i say Itâ€™s big I mean itâ€™s _massive_ Compared to the usual ones. I canâ€™t even pop it cuz the layer of skin on top of it is too thick, so now i just have to live with a big Red bump on My chin for a while
