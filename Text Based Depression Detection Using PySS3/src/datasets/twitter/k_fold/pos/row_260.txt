My mom is a shopaholic and I'm so over it. I didn't know what else to call her besides shopaholic, she doesn't go shopping for random things. She buys specific things and her latest kick is Starbucks cups. I absolutely despise it because she'll complain about not having enough money for important things, like my braces or food, but will then go onto facebook and buy a bunch of cups that are around $100-$50. It may be even more than that but that's just what I've seen. I've been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe. She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time. I think she only does it to deal with stress, but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it shouldn't be berating me or my sisters either. This whole thing just reminds me of how much I dislike my mother because of how horrible she is, I would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed I am and stressed out I am that's shes wasting all this money on cups she'll never use. My family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she'll never listen and just pretend to be the victim. I hope this phase ends soon, so I dont have to hear her complain about not having money but then spend about $1,000 on cups.


Long story short, my mom going through phases of buying specific things to release stress while also complaining about having no money.
