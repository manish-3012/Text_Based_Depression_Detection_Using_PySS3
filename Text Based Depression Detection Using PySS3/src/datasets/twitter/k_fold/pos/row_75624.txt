I heard my Dad swear for the first time today So ya, my Dad was making some food today and he spilled something and that made him pretty pissed off. He then went to throw something out and dropped more stuff, this made him say 'Jesus fucking Christ' and then 'Fuck' pretty loudly twice. I know this isn't a big deal and I'm overreacting but I've never heard my Dad say anything worse than damn in the 14+ years I've known him so it was pretty horrible
