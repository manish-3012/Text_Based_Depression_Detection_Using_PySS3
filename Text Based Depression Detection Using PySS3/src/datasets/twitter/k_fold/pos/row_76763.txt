I just got done with SH Revelations Pros:

â€¢A cameo from almost every boss in SH3

â€¢I can see that it's related specifically to SH3

â€¢Cool boss v boss scene


Cons:

â€¢boss v boss was probably put in just to be cool

â€¢V I N C E N T .

â€¢Literally a highschool drama for the first quarter

â€¢The split worm boss... That... Esh...

â€¢An uncomprehendible pace of story

â€¢V I N C E N T . I just want to emphasize how bad he was.


Alright that's all.
