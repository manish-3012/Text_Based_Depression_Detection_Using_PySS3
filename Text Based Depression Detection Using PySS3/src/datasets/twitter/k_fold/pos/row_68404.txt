Just some opinions I have Shower me if downvotes if you want, I don't care.

Thinking black people are inferior is racist, as is thinking white people are, and Asian people as well as any other race.

Men can be raped too not just women.

Just because I don't like a person that happens to be homosexual I am not homophobic.

Just because I don't like the way certain homosexuals shove their homosexuality in my face I am not homophobic.

Callmecarson is not a pedo but he is kind of stupid, if a 17 and 19 year old is a pedophilia then most highschool relationships would go bye-bye.

Thinking women are better than men is equally as sexist as thinking men are better.

I can eat meat if I want, don't show me animals getting slaughtered unless you want me to punch a hole in your laptop.

Fortnite or any other game that is toxic is toxic because of the community and not the game, appreciate the hard work of others.

Cyberpunk had a ton of bugs because people pressured them into releasing it early.

An older woman engaging in sexual stuff with a male minor is still pedophilia.

If a girl hits you then you have every right to hit back but it is still a bad decision since you shouldn't hit people.

If a person punches me and I punch back I am not the villain, the person who started it is the villain.

Yeah that's it thanks for listening to my rant.
