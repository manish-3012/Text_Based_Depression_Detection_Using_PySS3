Dunno what to write here but anyways- I have this friend who is kinda rude and toxic. She comments on my looks a lot, mzkes jokes about suicide and saying that she â€˜prankedâ€˜ her mom by telling her that she was suicidal and was shocked when her mom didnâ€™t want her to be home alone. She also said that â€™because He doesnâ€™t like me, heâ€™s gay right?â€™ Or something along those lines. Sometimes she says I eat too much, or that girls arenâ€™t going to like me (Iâ€™m lesbian) and before had the audacity to say 

â€˜ya know, I wish you were straight so we could talk about guys together, it would be so much fun! Like when we were kids and you were confused. When you came out it kinda killed my childhood with you. No offense or anythingâ€™ 

yes Iâ€™ve known her since we were like, 2, and yes shes toxic. But sheâ€™s also the only friend Iâ€™m talking to, and Iâ€™m kinda losing all my friends slowly. What do I do?
