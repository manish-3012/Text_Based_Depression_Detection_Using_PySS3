I'm embarrassed to be an American I mean seriously how dumb can people be denying a virus that has killed so many people, not wearing a mask because "it violates there rights" and people "peacefully protesting" by throwing fireworks, burning down homes and businesses. I understand that this is a serious issue but protesting like this will  only hurt the real peaceful protests. People also talk about defunding and abolishing police, I mean seriously that will only cause more problems. I also dislike how the presidential election just tear the country apart by who is right and who is wrong and how the other side is the devil. Seriously this country is an absolute mess and I'm embarrassed to be a part of it.
