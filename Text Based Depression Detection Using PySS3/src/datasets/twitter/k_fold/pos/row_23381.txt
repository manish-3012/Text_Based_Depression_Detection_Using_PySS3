Ok now that my friend found out I like her how do I still hide the fact I still like her a lot? Like she figured out a few days ago and there's a whole thing and we never actually talked about it really anyways. But so now she knows (which is probably horribly uncomfortable because this makes me the 3rd guy in our friend group she knows liked her even though I was actually the fist to start). So yeah, I still like her a *lot* and at this point I need some help on how to deal with the fact that while I'm with her at school I can never shake the wonderful fantasy of just giving her a big hug. just, *ahhhhhhhh,* it sounds like bliss. But that will never happen and I know that. So... how do I keep hiding the fact I really like her?
