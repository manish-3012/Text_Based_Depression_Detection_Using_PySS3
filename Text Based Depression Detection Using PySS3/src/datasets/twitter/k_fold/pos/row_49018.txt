Oh no all secondary school children have been given iPads and after recently going back to school I was bored aa you would be so I thought I should get round the blocker they use to ban websites so i did with some simple tricks like doing everything in Portuguese (as the system only recognised English and Gaelic) and other trickeryâ€™s and I had deleted the firewall off my iPad and had unlimited access so as any teenager would I used an emulator which by the way isnâ€™t illegal in Scotland and played PokÃ©mon heart gold I was very careful with leaving footprints but my teacher took my iPad of my desk when I was actually doing work for an example and accidentally clicked on safari to find my recent catalogue of activity as i was planning on going back to it and revealed it to everyone after he mirrored it on the screen naturally I got my iPad took off me BUT Glasgow city council are now threatening me with suspension and fine for exposing there bad software
