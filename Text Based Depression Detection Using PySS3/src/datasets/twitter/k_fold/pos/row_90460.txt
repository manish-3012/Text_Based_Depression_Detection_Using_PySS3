Is there Something is wrong with me? Ok so listen I'm 14 you following? and I prefer older music than modern music old songs like uranium fever  from 1955, ride of the valkyries, butcher Pete and I have great dislike of tiktok and other social medias Twitter being a exception but above all that other shite I remember: this current generation is fricked and I blame tiktok for half of it. Most of it. All of it. Ok I'm done, good day and have a wonderful tomorrow.
