I just sometimes...think about my future like.. 
If I donâ€™t kill myself before turning 18 then Iâ€™ll go move in with my girlfriend to Canada since we both are saving up slowly...but then the problem is what then? I have to get a job because Iâ€™m too dumb for college but any good paying job would require me to have a degree so I start to think about maybe being a stripper but then I realise I have to have pole dancing skills and actually look good so that fucks everything up so maybe a prostitute but my girlfriend says she doesnâ€™t want me to be that so now Iâ€™m thinking what about selling my virginity and then trying to have some sexually related job that just requires me to fuck and not even look good or have any actual skills.......I dunno..Iâ€™m useless...
