Why do anime always get one season then I have to read a book for the rest Another was based on a novel, then a sequel came out and it didnâ€™t get a second season, now I have to read a book, I donâ€™t want to do that, itâ€™s a book, what am I going to do with a book, read it, yeah nice try, 1200 pages would take me like a month to read, I read very slowly, and I was â€œtraumatized by my 1st-3rd grade teachersâ€ thatâ€™s not exactly what he said but my dads words not mine and I agree, Iâ€™ve had generally bad experiences with English and reading books kinda makes me think about that, tldr I hate reading books, plz donâ€™t make me read one to get the complete story
