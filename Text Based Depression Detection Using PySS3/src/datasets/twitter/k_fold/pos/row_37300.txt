Do you think itâ€™s fair to have to eat what your parents cook? Unless youâ€™re buying it yourself. I do, honestly. Most people donâ€™t see it as fair, but imagine cooking for someone abd they donâ€™t eat it because they want to be this or that. Yeah we all arenâ€™t going to agree. 

But listen; say you wanna go vegan. But you donâ€™t include your mother and father and whoever else. Going vegan is out of the question unless youâ€™re making money. You canâ€™t just not eat whatâ€™s cooked for you because you didnâ€™t tell your family that you wanted to be vegan you just woke up and said â€œIâ€™m veganâ€ while you still eat dairy product and all that. Your family gon be like â€œhmmâ€

If you became something that couldnâ€™t eat what used to be regular for you but donâ€™t have money to pay for it yourself or involve the people paying I think you should maybe wait, soon youâ€™ll be able to eat what you wantðŸ˜ŒIâ€™m waiting to eat just chicken nuggies idk ab u guys
