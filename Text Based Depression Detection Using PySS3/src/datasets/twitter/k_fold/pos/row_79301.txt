I'm going to start taking care of me I've been neglecting taking care of myself for a long time now, mostly due to anxiety. But i want to be better, get fit and just feel good in my own body. So i downloaded a workout routine (inspired by Kratos lol) and will start eating healthier. Online school has been stressing me out and i haven't had any motivation to work out, study or anything and generally been a wreck for the last couple months. Wish me luck :)
