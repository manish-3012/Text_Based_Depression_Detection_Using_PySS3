Mim is going to kill me Ive lost my credit card but the last person with it was her when she completely cleaned out my room and I havent seen it since, it was in my wallet and idk if she thought the wallet was empty or not but she might have thrown it. But I know if I ask her sheâ€™ll blame me saying Itâ€™s my responsibility and that she never touched it even though sheâ€™s had to since it was on my bed and nothing was on my bed when I went back in. Ahhhhhhhhhh
