2 paths appear, frens [a poem by RILKE].  Two paths appear. They open to no one.  
But sometimes, as you face them,  
one allows you to proceed.  
Then you think you've lost your way,  
but suddenly there you are in that inner garden,  
left alone again with the carved stone  


and reading it again:  
Baroness Britta Sophieâ€”and once again  
tracing with your finger  
the time-worn number of the year.  
Why does this discovery never grow faint?  


What makes you stop here  
just the way you did before,  
as though you expected something  
in this damp, untrodden place  
shadowed by elms?
