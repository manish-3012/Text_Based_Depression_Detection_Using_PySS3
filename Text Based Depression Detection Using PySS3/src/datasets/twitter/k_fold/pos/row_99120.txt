I'm asking my crush out. I have no idea what I am doing. A little background knowledge, I'm a guy, and I have anxiety and depression. I have had a crush on this girl for about a year. My friend wanted to get me a girl, and apparently she is his ex. He supports me, even though that is awkward. I need advice (Idc what gender you are, I just need help) on how I should do it. My school starts on Wednesday. I will do it then. Please help.
