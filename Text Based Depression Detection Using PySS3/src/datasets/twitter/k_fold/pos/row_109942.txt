Yâ€™all ever date someone then realize theyâ€™re a racist I dated this girl who for lack of a better term belonged to the streets like literally paid dudes at her school for money and I didnâ€™t really care cause everyone has some bodies and their own baggage but this girl literally said he dad was a member of the kkk and saw nothing wrong with that. She then said she wanted me to meet her family and thatâ€™s where I had to dip. Iâ€™m not about to live in get out itâ€™s a great movie but I not bouta die for that shit.
