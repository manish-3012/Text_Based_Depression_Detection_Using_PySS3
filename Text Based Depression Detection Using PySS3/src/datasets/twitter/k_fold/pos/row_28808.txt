I spent the last three days writing bad, miserable poetry about my life instead of doing work Itâ€™s all quite awful because I donâ€™t even read much poetry, just novels and short stories usually, but it was nice to get those emotions out of my system in a condensed form. A shame it took time out of doing work, which I gotta do tomorrow now.  I think I still have more to write however, since at this point Iâ€™m just writing down all my woes in (really bad) verse form (if it even counts), and Iâ€™m already at 25 poems. No you canâ€™t see it, not that I think you would want to, because itâ€™s actually quite embarrassing in hindsight. But I wanted to get this off my chest; I wrote poems, unironically.
