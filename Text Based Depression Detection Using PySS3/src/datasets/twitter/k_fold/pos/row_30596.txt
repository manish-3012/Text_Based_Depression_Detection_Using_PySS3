I just remembered school and how much I hated it Well this is really not much hate and more of extreme annoyance. When I was grade 8 which is like sophmore? I live in South East Asia if that clears things up. Our homeroom and math teacher is this strict female teacher. Sheâ€™s not old or anything. Millennial im pretty sure. 

I just remembered this time when one of our classmates got in trouble for â€œBullyingâ€ It was like very minor bullying. Not enough to make that specific person hate you, but enough that people would think what you did was annoying. So our teacher heard of this and made us ALL stay 30 MINUTES after class. That doesnt seem like alot. But when we went outside most classes were already dismissed and most doors to other classrooms were locked. I think she was trying to encourage us to not misbehave so that we dont share our consequences with the class. It kinda worked? Like people stopped â€œBullyingâ€ for the rest of the school year. But it caused our class to take a different route than what the teacher was thinking.

For the rest of the year. Our class was still rowdy and most people were misbehaving. But whenever someone would commit and offense like bullying or vandalism or disruption of other classes. We would all just agree to act like it never happened and not tell the teacher. We never got on trouble again but that was mainly because everything we did went under radar due to a mutual understanding that if anyone told we would all be in trouble. 

Moral of the story: Children are evolving and punishments arent.

Tldr:
Teacherâ€™s punishment made everyone on the class agree to never tell.
Tldr:
