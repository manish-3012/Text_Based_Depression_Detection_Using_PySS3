Please remember that there is a time and a place This is for anyone who has an interest in dark comedy. So the other day at school I had a diabetic seizure and  could have died, now these 3 dipshits who I thought were â€œfriendsâ€ decided that it would be funny to start laughing as it happened, and when people tried calling them out on it they refused to take responsibility. If you do like dark comedy just remember that THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE.
