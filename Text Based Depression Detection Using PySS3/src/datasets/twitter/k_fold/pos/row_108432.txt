Owwww shit Just found a really old gift my class gave me when i moved when i was 7. I.... basically closed off my memory because of all the shit that happened at that school and the school after. Basically: the gift contained a hidden love letter from my past crush. I have only read now and i'm fucking crying. HOW DID I MISS THIS?! THIS WAS MY DREAM AT THE TIME, I MISSED THAT GIRL SO MUCH! WHY MUST YOU STING ME LIKE THIS PAST?!
