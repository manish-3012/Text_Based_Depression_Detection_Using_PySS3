I didn't take a school picture this year Am I... probably fine?  I'm in 10th grade.  I didn't take mine on the initial day, or on on the make-up day since I was sick both times.  Apparently they gave people ID's when they took their pictures which makes sense I guess?  Should I try to reschedule?  Do you think it's fine if I just don't take one for the school year?  Honestly we're in the midst of a pandemic and I look terrible anyway, I don't really even want them to take a picture of me...
