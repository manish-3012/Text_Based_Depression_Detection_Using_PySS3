Iâ€™m trying to find this animated short for my friend So they described the short as something they saw in between tv shows on Qubo back in the early 2000s, before 2010. Iâ€™m trying to find it, but itâ€™s a little difficult, and you guys seem good at this type of thing.

â€œSo i used to watch Qubo as any kid without cable but during when shows were switching or in between. (intermission?) there's sometimes little shorts or animations, so i remember one where the guy is in the shower he turns off the water and it squeaks he puts on a robe and slippers. He has a cat (the entire animation is yellow and somewhat abstract) anytime this cats meows its written on the screen in a wavy fashion. There's a telephone ringing it goes; briiinnnggg across the screen the same way the cat's meows do. so recap man turns off the shower it squeaks, he puts his slippers and (robe?) on and shuffles down the stairs to answer the ringing telephone his cat coming in and out. He sounded formal or british maybe? but he pics up the phone and goes hello? at the end or end of what i remember.â€
