I came to a realization. Title: straight girls my age (I am female) My friends always say,
â€œIâ€™m going to be single and lonely forever, no guy is gonna like me!â€
â€œCan I find you someone?â€
â€œNo.â€
And also they say,
â€œGuys are so annoying, I hate them.â€

Makes zero sense. If you want a boyfriend, and donâ€™t want a relationship... what??
Stop complaining about being single then jeez XD
