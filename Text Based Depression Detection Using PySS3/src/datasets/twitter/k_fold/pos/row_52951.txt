why do parents have kids, and then expect the oldest to take care of them iâ€™m the oldest kid in my household and Iâ€™m always left to take care of my two younger brothers, especially in the holidays. i donâ€™t get anything from it, yet both their mum and dad get centrelink money for it. 

why have kids when you canâ€™t even take care of them most of the time?? i didnâ€™t ask to raise my brothers. it would always be â€œdonâ€™t yell at them, youâ€™re no the parentâ€ yet I would then be left to take care of them for like 4 days straight
