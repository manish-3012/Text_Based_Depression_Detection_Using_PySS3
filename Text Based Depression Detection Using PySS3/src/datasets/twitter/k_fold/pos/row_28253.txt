Today I have discovered that anger makes me lose my appetite I never feel angry, but today my mom forced me to sign up for another stupid boring honors english class. My dad made me pierogies and I wasn't able to eat many because my appetite just disappeared into thin air. I'm sure my mom would be pleased to hear that though since she wants me to be skinner anyways despite the fact I'm borderline underweight. Kids, don't sign up for any fancy english classes. It is not easy. It is not fun. It is pure boredom and endless essays.
