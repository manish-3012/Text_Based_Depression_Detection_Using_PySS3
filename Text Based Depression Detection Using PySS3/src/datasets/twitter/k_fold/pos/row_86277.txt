My mom called me dumb She whispered â€œgod youâ€™re so dumbâ€ under her breath and all my sisters were like â€œOOOOâ€. I walked out and went to my room. And she came in here and was laughing like â€œwhat did I say?â€ And then she called me sensitive. I am very upset and my heart genuinely hurts because she treats me so different. Iâ€™m not good enough for her.
