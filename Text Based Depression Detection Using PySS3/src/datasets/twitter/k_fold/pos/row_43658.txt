I'm very mad and I need to rant about this horseshit I'm not even sad or depressed anymore, I'm fucking mad. I'm ruining (well, already did) my life on my own wish.    

I've been barely passing my classes for the last two years and I won't be able to get a good enough end result to go to any college after I finish HS, if I finish it at all.    

I hate who my parents become (antivaxx, corona is bullshit kind of attitude).    

My mom is organising an 18th birthday dinner for my family even though I said I don't want to organise anything (because of obvious reasons like pandemic, but none of my parents give two fucks about it, just like most of the family). And probably there's going to be alcohol, the last thing I would like to see on my 18th B-day...    

I don't know how to explain to my family why I didn't meet with them for like two months straight when there were some family gatherings. Besides the corona stuff I don't feel right about inviting any of my family members to the dinner when I refused to go out anywhere for those two fucking months.    

I'm fucking livid, I want to destroy something.
