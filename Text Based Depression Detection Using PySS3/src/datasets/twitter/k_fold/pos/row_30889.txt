Are these signs or am I overthinking things 1. She is open to me about her personal problems. She isnâ€™t open about her problems to anyone else (that Ik of)

2. Awhile back now (3 months ago) I told her about how I was a furry and later she also told me she was one. And she has only told her sister and about it.

3. I showed her this video https://youtu.be/1kJcO8Rud18 and she made a comment that said that 0:15 looks like me. (Long story on that but TL:DR I used to get basically drunk off of being sleep deprived)

4. (This has happened multiple times) I was chilling in a random VC by myself at night. She gets on the VC and yells at me to go to bed then we talk for like 30 minutes.

Hereâ€™s also one of the reason why she might not like me back.

I was playing Minecraft with her one day. And we didnâ€™t talk for like 5 minutes. (We both were doing our own thing) her dad comes into her room and says. â€œYour mom is back from vacation are u on with friends rn?â€ â€œNoâ€ *leaves call*. We havenâ€™t talked about it. But I think itâ€™s because she doesnâ€™t want her family to know about me.
