I guess I got "brozoned"? I asked a girl out a while back. She said taht she was going to think about it, but hasn't messaged me about it since. We met yesterday and she asked me if she could call me bro... I don't know if that means that we are going in the right direction or if she just wanted to maybe try to give me a status that's higher than friend
