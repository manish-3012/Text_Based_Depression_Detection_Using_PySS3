ask me any questions at all, and i will answer you 100% honestly, unless it would break Rule 3. but besides that, i will answer any questions of yours with complete honesty, and if i don't know the answer or if i am unsure of the answer, then i'll try my best

(please note the following: i will probably not be on Reddit for the next few hours, so don't expect me to reply immediately. but you *can* expect me to answer every question here)
