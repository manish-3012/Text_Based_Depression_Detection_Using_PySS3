Why do some people not follow people back? So I know this just sounds stupid but hereâ€™s a n example. Letâ€™s say I know a girl so I send her a follow request on Instagram, she accepts.  But she doesnâ€™t send a request back. Does anyone else find that not exactly rude but just kinda off if you know what I mean? If I know someone and they send me a follow request Iâ€™ll follow them back. Anyone have any reasons why some people donâ€™t follow people they know back?
