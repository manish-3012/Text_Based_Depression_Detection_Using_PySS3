Help me find Face masks Okay so I have a habit of touching my face too much and that isn't good for my skin, and I try to avoid it but I keep doing it.

so I thought it'd be a good idea to wear a face mask (the beauty kind). But I can't find any mask that is meant to be worn for long periods like maybe more that 2 hours. 

It's especially harder now because when i search up face mask the only stuff coming up are like N95 and stuff like that.

Could someone tell me a few links to webpages with diy face masks which you can leave on for a long time.

PS. I don't mean masks that you wear to prevent getting a virus
