Maybe give me some advice if you want? I think my mom had a mental breakdown today. She has bipolar disorder, so she has these moments every now and then, but they end after a day or two tops. Lately though, she's been pissed about everything.

A couple days ago, we saw something on the news about a Mexican who flew into America so they could get the vaccine for Rona. My mom went on this long (and frankly, very rascist) rant about immigrants moving here to steal our American vaccines, even though she laughs at Facebook minion memes that make fun of people who say the same thing, but about jobs instead of vaccines. She's not a racist.

Earlier today, she saw me on my laptop playing a video game and then told me how useless I was. Then, she stormed into my room and told me how messy it was, then she yelled about stuff that probably had nothing to do with me, then stormed into her room and freaking slammed the door as loud as she could. 10 minutes later, she came out like nothing happened.

For the last few days, she's been either moving stuff in the house around in an unusual way or she's been sitting on the couch with an upset face, both are signs that her bipolar disorder is getting worse.

Every time I ask her what's bothering her, she gets offended that I asked.

I love my mom, and she's not at all abusive, but this recent behavior is not good for either of us. The constant pressure to not upset her is making me anxious, and that makes me depressed. For the first time today, I seriously considered how the world as a whole would improve if I wasn't in it.

 I love my mon a lot, she's my only family, and I want to help her, so anyone still reading at this point, maybe you could help me out a little?
