It all happened so suddenly So I've been talking to a group of friends on insta and most of them are furrys and I'm not(wasnt) and one day while talking I suddenly joined in and boom I without realizing it for a while became a furry

It all happend so fast I wasn't even sure what I was talking about till after I realized, I blamed them for it at first but I've embraced it now so yeah that's how I became a furry basically overnight
