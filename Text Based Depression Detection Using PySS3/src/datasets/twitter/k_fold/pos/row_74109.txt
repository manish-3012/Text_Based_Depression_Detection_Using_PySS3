Throwback thursday Like when i was 13 or smething and with my aunt at this used bookstore, i saw a shelf filled with fifty shades of grey books. Now ive heard of the title, bet have absolutely no idea of what it was about. My aunt likes collecting and reading novels so i just told her that fifty shades of grey is good and that she should read it... yea
