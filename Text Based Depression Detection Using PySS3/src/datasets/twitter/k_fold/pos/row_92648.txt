Today has been a good day. Here's why:

* I actually woke up early for once and ate breakfast. (Rare on schooldays for me.
* Despite my school attempting to go back to in-person learning, classes went well.
   * There are groups that switch out, I'm on the 'off' rotation so I'm at home rn.
* I got my homework done early like a good boi. (let's ignore chemistry)
* There was good weather in my area, rare for Northern California.

Imma play some Terraria and then make some Mac'n'cheese later. 

Y'all have a good day, ok?
