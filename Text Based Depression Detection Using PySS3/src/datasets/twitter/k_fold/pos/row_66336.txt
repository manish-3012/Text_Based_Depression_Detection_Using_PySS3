14 year old looking for ways to make money (preferably online) Hello All!

I learned recently that one of my good friends is making thousands of dollars a month from a thing that he does where he sells high-level video game items. I am not skilled or a gamer, but I still am looking for ways to make money. I would get a job, but in my area you have to be 16. If anyone knows what I can do, that would be greatly appreciated.
