I met my bf for the first time after 6 months and ran from himafter hugging him without saying good bye. OMFG Iâ€™M SO EMBARRASSED, I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIEðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ So me and my friend (sheâ€™s also my bf friend) were hanging out for 2 hours, we couldnâ€™t hang longer than that because her and my bf was going to a birthday party. 

So I came with her when meeting my boyfriend, sheâ€™s meeting my bf because he doesnâ€™t know where the birthday party is. 

And when I met him for the first time after not meeting for 6 months, IT WAS AWKWARD ASFðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­We didnâ€™t say hi to each other, didnâ€™t look at each other we were just listening to our friend talkðŸ˜­ 

When they had to go, I said Â«Can i hug you?Â» to my bf, and he didnâ€™t say anything and just looked at me very shy. So I ran to him hug him for 10 seconds, said Â«so cozyÂ» after hugging him. I also hugged my friend right after him, then after i hugged my friend I ran away from them without saying goodbyeðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ IT WAS SO FUCKING AWKWARDðŸ˜­ WHILE I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM THEM I HEARD MY FRIEND LAUGHINGðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

I ran because it was so embarrassingðŸ˜­ Now idk what to doðŸ˜­
