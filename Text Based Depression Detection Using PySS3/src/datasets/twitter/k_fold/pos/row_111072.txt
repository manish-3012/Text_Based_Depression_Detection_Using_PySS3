Update on my porn/masturbation problem #8 (Rest of the updates are [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scout_On_Drugs/comments/ko8e51/ending_my_problem_with_porn_and_masturbation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))

Iâ€™m on the day 0 again. Well, technically itâ€™s closer to day 1.

I failed yesterday while my parents left me home alone. I wanted to give up and accept that I wonâ€™t succeed, but I knew my mind was playing tricks on me.

Today Iâ€™m motivated again. Hopefully Iâ€™ll reach my goal of 90 days one day.

^( If you want to end this problem too, r/nofap is the best place to start.)
