I need some help with possibly fighting.  I have court in November for assault, the guy had a concussion and it caused him to go to the ER. Which is why I was arrested. I am 14 and just entered highschool. Here's the bad part, a girl said to me "talk to me when ku get on iphone" 
   I replied "Talk to me when you get a nose job Stinky"
and her "homegirl" said to me "Your hair looks like shit coming out your head" I said "people who run cross country can't run across your forehead without calling a 30 dollar uber bitch"

Now a popular football player and another guy might want to fight me. I DMed both of those huyst saying "don't touch me for your safety" I was warning them. I'm not worried about what they can do to me as so much what I can do to them, especially since I already have a court case. They said "ight we'll see"

  Homecoming is on Friday and they'll probably be there. Since they don't go to in person school since it's optional and a hybrid schedule. 

What should I do?
