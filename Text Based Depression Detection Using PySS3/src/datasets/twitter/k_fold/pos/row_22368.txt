Chinese Class Cringe Oh God, I'm going to die from **Cringe Syndrome.**

I'm taking Chinese class, and we have a test where we had to talk about a random subject (determined by a dice roll as you can see on the screen) for 2 minutes, *in front of the entire class* on Zoom. It's already bad enough (the topic I had to do was "How should people teach *responsibility education* (I don't even know what the heck that is) so that teenagers can be interested." I absolutely did not know how the heck to answer that and speak for 2 min without a whole bunch of fillers. \*cringe\* Also, it's like a unit test, and so my grade is probably going down by quite a bit.

Wait a sec, is she recording? ***I'm absolutely done.***
