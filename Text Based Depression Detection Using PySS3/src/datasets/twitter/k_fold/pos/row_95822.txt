I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A FUCKING DRIVERS LICENSE!!!! I'm so fucking close to getting a driver's license. Like it's almost within my reach...

I recently paid for my final set of driving lessons so I can polish my driving skills and prepare for the road test. Once I pass the road test, then I'll get my driver's license and then use the money I earned from working to get a car. I just need some more time before I feel fully ready to take the road test. There's so much stuff I can do with my own vehicle. I can:

* Drive myself to school, work, restaurant, movies, etc. without waiting on parents
* Go on beach trips, movie trips, etc. - maybe even with friends (at least once things return to normal)
* Move out

Ohhh boy I can't wait. It's that fucking close I already have most of the skills under my belt. Now I just need to keep pushing forward for the last little bit. If all goes well I expect to get my license (and maybe even a car) within 1-2 months. But the fucking scheduling system is broken so I can't schedule any driving appointments ffs. Hopefully when that's fixed I'll push through the last little bit and finally achieve the one thing that I wanted to do throughout high school.

Ahhhhh it's that fucking close , so fucking within my reach right now...
