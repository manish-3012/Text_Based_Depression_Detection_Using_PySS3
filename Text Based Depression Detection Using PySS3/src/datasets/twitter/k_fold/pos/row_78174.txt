Iâ€™m 90% sure my parents have a hidden camera in my room. Iâ€™m not being paranoid, they know about secret stuff I do in my room and I only do it in my room when Iâ€™m alone. I talk to myself a lot when Iâ€™m by myself and they will randomly bring up in conversations what I was talking about and when I ask them how do they know they donâ€™t say. Iâ€™ve had a feeling theyâ€™ve being spying on me for a while but something happened today which made me very concerned for my privacy. Idk what to do but Iâ€™m pretty pissed with my parents.
