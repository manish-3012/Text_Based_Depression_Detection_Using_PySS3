I feel like Iâ€™m slowly starting to hate the lgbtq even though ironically Iâ€™m bi and I need advice to help me deal with it Just the way the lgbt acts is just embarrassing and theyâ€™re the reason why I canâ€™t put it in my bio without being attacked. They always get offended over the stupidest shit and literally doxx children over harmless dark humor jokes. And Iâ€™m getting sick of them always hating straight people, they strived for equality but now theyâ€™re just trying to make themselves superior. And when I saw this, Iâ€™m NOT trying to generalize them, Iâ€™m just saying a lot of people in the community are legit toxic asf and I hate to see it tear everyone apart. Am I at fault here???
