Shut up stupid dummy idiot moron butt head Listen. There are a lot of social cues I donâ€™t understand, but something that bothers me most is why do you have to say hi to people you know/are familiar with in public? Why canâ€™t we just live our lives in peace with no interaction. Itâ€™s not life or death if I choose not to acknowledge u. Iâ€™m sorry if I donâ€™t want to waste my time with mindless small talk that neither of us really care about. And these are some thoughts I had when my mom said hi to her boss in public because itâ€™s the polite thing to do. But her boss is. A dickhead and I hope she (the boss) stubs her toe on stuff so much that it has to get amputated because of al the damage. Have fun maintaining balance idiot.
