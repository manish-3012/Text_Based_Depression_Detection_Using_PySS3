I want to stop having anxiety and be happier Iâ€™ve been noticing how anxious and nervous I get at school/in public. Iâ€™ll start sweating and it bleeds through my clothes, though Iâ€™m able to hide it. I also feel the urge to puke or cry randomly and I hate this. Iâ€™m gonna start treating myself in a better light, focus on my future, and just keep my head up for as long as I will. 

I love you guys. If anyone wants to chat to just hit me up!
