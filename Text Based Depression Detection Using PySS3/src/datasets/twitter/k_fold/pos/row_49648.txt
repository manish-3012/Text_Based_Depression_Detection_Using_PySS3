If powers were based on your personality traits, what would your power/s be? This question is one that Iâ€™ve been asking nowadays since it in a way, helps me understand what someone is like without asking what they would do if they had *insert superhero name here*â€™s powers. Also, in lots of superhero media, the powers of the characters reflect their personalities like in the 2004 movie â€œThe Incredibles.â€ The Parr family and Frozone all have abilities that reflect who they are. Bob(Mr. Incredible) mainly has Super Strength, Nigh Invulnerability and Danger Sense as heâ€™s the foundation of his family and lots of good dads have great reflexes and Bob is a super dad himself. Helen (Elastigirl) has Elasticity hence her hero name and sheâ€™s a flexible mom. 

Dash has Super Speed since heâ€™s hyperactive so thatâ€™s obvious. Violet has Invisibility and Force Fields since sheâ€™s an insecure introvert but sheâ€™ll grow out of it soon. Jack-Jack has a grab-bag of assorted superpowers(Super Strength, Laser Vision, Dimensional Travel, Telekinesis, Flame Form, Air Pressure Generation, Electricity Generation, etc) since as an infant, he has a vast amount of potential and the clue is in his name. Frozone has Ice Manipulation since heâ€™s cool and collected. I might include more examples in the comments but I think using just â€œThe Incrediblesâ€ is okay... for now.
