Lower your eyelids to die with the sun Iâ€™m slowly drifting to you
The stars and planets are calling me a billion years away from you
Iâ€™m on my way
You taught me the courage of stars before you left 
How light carries on endlessly even after death 
How rare and beautiful it is to even exist 
Iâ€™m on my way
