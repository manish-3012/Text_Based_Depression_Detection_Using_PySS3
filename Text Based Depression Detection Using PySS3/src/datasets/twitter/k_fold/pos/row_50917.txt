How to break the ice of awkwardness between me (16) and my crush (17), when we both know that we kinda like each other? Well, my backstory is kinda awkward.
I really started liking one guy in my class and several weeks ago, I wrote him an anonymous love letter to be delivered by my friend. (The letter wasn't anything that cheesy, though)
I know that guy and sometimes I talk or chat with him, but we're not that really close. Surprisingly, he took quite well to the letter, and certainly was interested, as my friend said later. Unfortunately, before he could send me his reply, we had a week full of term testing and just after that hell has passed, the government has issued a full lockdown on our entire city. 
Then my friend actually told that guy my identity (for which I'm still angry at her, she ows me a box full of chocolates), and two or three days later he chatted me himself. Even though he tried to be sweet and subtly hint at some things, he was still beating around the bush, talking about school and stuff. I began the chat first several times after that, and he does reply me enthusiastically, but we just can't to break the ice of awkwardness between us and get to the main point. What should I do now?
