Are you excited about going to college? are you gonna miss high school? So some of us had to go to school after almost a whole year and few of us were there. the school was empty. after a veryyy long time i saw school that empty. 

High on mixed emotions. 12 years mannnn. this feels unreal. I'm going to college this year. 

I never had great friends in high school (i didnt fit in so i made friends from other schools).
I never fit in, and i hate the kids here, so i thought i am not gonna regret leaving this place for one second. but I've been in this place for a long long time and it made me really emotional. 
First boyfriend, first kiss and all the usual teen stuff. 
It might sound cringe but i feel really sad about leaving this school and not having great friends here. 
i really want to believe that it gets better in college.
