I hate subs like r/politics Such a hivemind, everyone is trying to fit into their group.

I'm not even a Trump supporter I think he's a shit president too but it feels like these people have no actual thought process they just sit in their echo chamber and agree with each other.


They're just like the ppl they hate. A bunch of cops frfr
