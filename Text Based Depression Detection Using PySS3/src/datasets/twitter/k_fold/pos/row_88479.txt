My Twitter just got locked for changing the date to a viable date of birth. I got an account a year ago and faked my age by one year, but just one year off, didn't change the day or month, but once I had my 13 birthday and I was officially 13, (but 14 on twitters data) so I changed it just recently back to where I was 13, and my account was locked, and I don't know where my birth certificate is since my parents keep it safe. Idk if there can be any help with this from another platform of social media, but maybe some information could help (didn't use Twitter much anyways..) and it was possibly from me previously lying to Twitter and now changing it to 13. Just a thought. (And admins if this is abiding any of your rules, take it down, I'm just sort of ranting. So there is no benefit xD)
