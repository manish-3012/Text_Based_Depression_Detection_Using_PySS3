Im so fucking worried that i did something wrong to my friends But I don't remember doing anything bad, I mean, i never ask them for weed, or money, or anything like that. I never talk shit about them. I never argue with them. So wtf?!

My friends used to always say good morning, they used to hug me, they used to invite me and even beg me to come out with them

But suddenly, my closest friend stopped talking to me. The only fucking reason they even acknowledged me is because I offered them alcohol first

And now, my other friends stopped talking to me, too. Theres only 5 people left in my entire fucking school, who I'm not even that close with, (of like 30 people) who acknowledge I exist. Even some of the teachers act like I don't exist

Some of them legit just stare through me. I can't fucking handle this again

I'm so fucking confused at what's going on and idk what to do, I'm gonna ask my old closest friend if I did anything wrong tomorrow, but what's next? 

Idfk but I just wanna cry and maybe die idfk. I really hate this
