I tried to post this on r/unpopularopinions but it was taken down because it was about lgbtq+ and race issues Yet there is a post in hot about how Shrek 2's holding out for a hero scene is better than endgames final battle. This is word for word.

 

Yeah I know that a lot still needs to be done but too many people are taking advantage of it. I was on Instagram earlier and I saw a post comparing the shade of darkness of black characters from the 90's and current days. Almost all of the comments were variations of ' Hollywood producers are looking for a character and anything can get a person a role but because their skin was lighter they got the role'. Things like that ignore the hell out of me.

And what is up with the "first (minority) to ever \_\_\_\_". There are so many variations of this for EVERYTHING. If its all about equality this should not be happening. People should just see w host or winner or anything this happens with.

Recently I feel like the tables are turning and just because a person is white means they are racist and an awful person. I'm not trying to be racist but if you are a straight white male then you shouldn't get or achieve anything because of how you are. You can't have any opinions on an issue because "your ancestors caused it". If your a person that's famous or important that does or says anything remotely racist, homophobic, or sexist your career is dead and every basically shits all over you. But so many of those people who are in a minority are supported and loved even if they raped someone.

People want things to be equal but with all of those going on its impossible.
