Is writing about my feelings bad? I've had a problem with self harm since I was 12 (now 17) and well, when I was 14 I'd try to write poetry about wanting to self harm and these internal debates about whether or not I deserved to live. I kept these poems in a jar until I eventually burned them all.

My last therapy session (2 weeks ago) I told my therapist about it and how I had gotten in trouble for writing about that stuff when my grandmother had found a few of my poems. And like, I was expecting her to be like "what, why would you get in trouble for that" but instead she went on about how I shouldn't have written that stuff and I shouldn't be having the thoughts to begin with (no fucking shit, I'm in therapy for a reason). And that writing like that only made the feelings more true or whatever.

But like, I was told at the time that I should be writing to let the emotions out in a more healthy way bc it's the only coping skill I thought was worth trying. 

Lately self harm... I've been doing it a lot lately; mostly punching myself but a bit of cutting too. I want to stop and I thought I'd try writing again, keeping a journal with me and stuff most of the time. But now I'm just worried that me writing about the same sorta stuff is just being bad again. And I don't even like self harming, at this point it's punishment for when I think I'm being bad and if I write about it it's basically bad so more reason to punish myself? 

I don't know what to do, like is she right? Is writing actually not a good way to deal? I mean she has the degree and stuff, maybe I am just a lost cause.
