I hate online school sometimes Iâ€™m in online school right now instead of in person for obvious reasons and they completely cut off every single way to make any friends at all. I donâ€™t have a major problem with it but this kid in my class just said to this other kid â€œhey can we be friendsâ€ and he couldnâ€™t answer because my stupid teacher closed the chat and saidâ€ you can do taht on your own time after schoolâ€ which sure I admit maybe donâ€™t do taht while weâ€™re doing work in class but... YOU MADE IT SO WE CANT! They made it so we canâ€™t email, we canâ€™t share gamer tags, phone numbers etc, they deleted google docs now because kids were talking through that! They make it almost literally impossible to socialize at all, then they have the audacity to say â€œbe sure to go make friends,talk to people.â€ LIKE WHAT!??!? Sorry I just had to rant because this is so annoying.
