I CAN'T MOVE ON So I have been in love with this girl for the past 4 years and she has rejected me so many times, apart from this stuff we are amazing friends and have these beautiful talks about the universe and life and everything, makes me fall in love with her she's an amazing Person and I just want to be with her, so to distract myself from all this I shut-off my phone for the past couple of days and blocked her off of everywhere but even now all I have are thoughts about her, I'm constantly looking at her pictures on instagram and stalking her twitter, reading our old chats, I don't want to be like this, i dont want to be miserable, i want to be a productive person who's constantly improving himself but right now i just hate myself and that's it, why does it have to be like that ugh
