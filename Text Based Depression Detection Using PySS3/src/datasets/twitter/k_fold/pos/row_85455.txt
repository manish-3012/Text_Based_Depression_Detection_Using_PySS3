I m watching a cooking competition show on Netflix and one of the chefs looks like my Crush When He smiles i smile, when He breaks an egg i want that to be my back, when He says this is too cold i say it s cos ur so fuckin Hott.

when he massages the bread dough i want that to be shoulders but w a happy ending, when He bursts the tomatoes i m sure yk, when He takes the heart if the artichoke i want that to be my heart &lt;3

why did this Man have to lose in my country s cuisine episode :',(  

is this a representation of my future..... forbidden love....
