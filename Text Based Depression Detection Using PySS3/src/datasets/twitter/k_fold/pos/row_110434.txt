Bruh, all these legalities following adulthood and college make adulthood seem overwhelming You think I'm supposed to know how to live by my self or sign myself up to student debt? You haven't even taught me the essentials of filing for taxes and shit. Instead you taught me some algebra 2 which I will never see or use again. And yes, you are right- I am an idiot.
