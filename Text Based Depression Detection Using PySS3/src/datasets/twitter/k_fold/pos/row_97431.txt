I hate being treated like Iâ€™m an adult! Iâ€™m a teenager yes, I should be responsible, yeah but I should still be able to make mistakes and act childish here and there! My parents are treating me like an adult even though Iâ€™m still a kid/growing and developing! Yeah Iâ€™m the oldest but that doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t play around with my younger siblings and make a bit of noise cause weâ€™re having fun! Well that was my rant TL;DR: parents are treating me like Iâ€™m an adult and that being childish is beyond me.
