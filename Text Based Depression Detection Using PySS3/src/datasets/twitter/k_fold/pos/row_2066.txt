I fucking hate big toe nails Not big toe-nails, big-toe nails. They are painful and serve no purpose but to give me more pain. Not even talking about stubbing my toe, lord help me if I fucking do, but why the hell would anything make it so we have big toe nails. I understand fingernails and thumbnails, but big toe nails and toes nails in general should not be a thing
