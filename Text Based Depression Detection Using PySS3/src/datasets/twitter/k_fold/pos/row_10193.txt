It ever just be snowing and you can smell the cold . Picture itâ€™s December 3rd your 11 years old your bundeled in 3 layers is winter gear and a hat when you step outside you can smell it. A light tingle in your nose it feels strange but ... nice. After 2 hours of building snow men snowball fights and sledding you go inside. You curl up on the couch sipping hot chocolate covered in the thick blanket your nose hurts a bit and you drift off to sleep thinking what fun you will have tomorrow.
