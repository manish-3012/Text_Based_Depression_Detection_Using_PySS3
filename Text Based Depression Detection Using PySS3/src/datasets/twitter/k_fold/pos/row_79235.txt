I'm trying to persuade my father to play with me I know that the title may sound misleading but I'm looking for help. 
My father doesn't really support video games (Calling them violent and such) but he still let's me play ( sometimes ) but I really want to try to persuade home to play for once (so that he can stop criticising me when I play and so that we can play together)    
How do I talk him into it when he doesn't even want to try playing for once?
