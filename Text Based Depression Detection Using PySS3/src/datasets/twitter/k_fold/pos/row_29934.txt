So I was not prepared This is kinda tmi. Males, you might wanna sit this one out, you might not understand. 

This is a rant and I just want to write it down so feel free to not read it. Itâ€™s your fault if you do and feel gross. 

So what the fuck? Why is it august 27 and blood is there? Whyyyyyy? Makes no actual sense. Please wait 15 goddamn days. How are you 15 days early? And at my new school. Good thing I wear a sweatshirt every day because I had nothing to put there. I just tied the sweatshirt around my waist. Why would I be prepared 15 days early? Nobody else has their period so they wouldnâ€™t need this? *And* on the day I wasnâ€™t supposed to go home. I was supposed to go to straight to dance and get an award. I did but it was fucked up and everything hurt. 

Sorry if you read that, but I have no friends Iâ€™m comfortable sharing that with.
