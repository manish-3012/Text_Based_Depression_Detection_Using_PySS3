I can't tell if I'm a transphobe or not. Okay so a little preface, I've never met a trans person, I just hear about them, so maybe that's why I feel the ways I feel like I do down here:

I frequent /new here, and there is a good amount of stories about how someone got their first female clothes or how they called out a transphobe and I get weirdly angry by it. Something inside me tells me to reject how they feel. I'm fairly firm on what I believe when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, but something I'm still on the fence about are transgender people. I don't hate trans people, I just get riled up by them for some reason, and I don't want to. I'm all for breaking down gender barriers and being who you are and so forth, but something keeps telling me that I shouldn't.

Idk, I threw that together pretty quick, so if you need some clarification let me know. And I guess what I want from this is what I should do or if I really am one.
