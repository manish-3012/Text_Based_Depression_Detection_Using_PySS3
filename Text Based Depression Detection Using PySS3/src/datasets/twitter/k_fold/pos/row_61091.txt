How to help a friend Sheâ€™s obsessed with what she eats, I managed to bring her daily calorie amount up but sheâ€™s gone back down. She knows itâ€™s wrong because she hides it from her family. She honestly could do with gaining weight not starving herself. I just want to help her feel better about herself so she doesnâ€™t do this anymore. She knows Iâ€™m worried about her but she says sheâ€™s fine. Does anyone know what I could do?
