I don't see the point in living if my plan dosent work out. So my plan is to have a part time job along with investing in a bunch of stuff. The first year I will live like a college student (without partying cause I don't like partys, I'm basically just saying spending money on only essentials) and get a lot of money doing that. I will then use my money to help myself create separate side hustles like YouTube or twitch for example. I really just don't want to work a 9-5 job my whole life. Its not that I'm lazy. I really don't see the point in spending 80% of my life working when I'm not enjoying myself. I don't see a future for myself in any other field because I'm interested in a ron of stuff but not interested enough to make a living out of one of them. Also getting a university/ college diploma in a lot of cases (not all) is just a receipt for a couple years of wasted time. This is my rant. Thats it.
