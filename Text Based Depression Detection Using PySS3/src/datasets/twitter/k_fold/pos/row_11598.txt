I came out as Bisexual to one of my best friends Just like the title says I came out as Bisexual to one of my best friends (and essentially the only person that I talk to right now) yesterday.

He and I started talking maybe 3-4 months ago and talking to him was one of the things that startedmakingme questionmy sexuality.

Anyway that's besides the point, I realized that I was Bi maybe a few days before New Year's eve, And yesterday when we were talking I decided to come out to him. I told him that I had realized that I was Bisexual, and I explained I felt emotionally attracted to both girls and boys but mostly sexually attracted to girls.

He seemed to be a bit surprised but was very accepting. He said that he didn't really mind what sexuality people have, which I'm pretty sure is a good thing. He is probably the only person I'll tell in a while because I only plan on telling people who I actually feel deserve to know, other people will just be left to figure that out by themselves. It was a bit scary but coming out felt good. So now all you Bisexual people can start chanting "One of us! One of us!" in the comments. (Don't, that was a joke lads) Laugh track.

Apologies for the long read, this got longer than I thought it was going to be... but that's just puberty in a nutshell, isn't it.
