Since when was Japan a bad place to live?? In general, Iâ€™ve always wanted to go to Japan and live there (probably since i was 6 years old). It always seemed like a place that i belonged in, and to this day I still feel the urge to just get on a plane and live there till i die of old age... But recently Iâ€™ve been doing research on what itâ€™s like to live in Japan, and apparently, itâ€™s not all that great. Apparently the food is bland, the apartments are absolute shite, and learning Japanese is an utter waste of your life. 

Iâ€™m at a loss for any motivation at this point. I still really want to go, but i feel so discouraged. And in case any of you are wondering, no, Iâ€™m not a weeb (kind of).

Contrary to what a lot of people are saying, i personally really enjoy japanese food, and all i really want in life is to live somewhere out in the rural areas and have a humble job that will comfortably get me through. But i guess not.
