I'm going to get in trouble because my dad bought a shitty camera system So for context my stepdad setup 4 cameras on all 4 corners of the house and he usually uses them to check if I took the dog out, and yesterday I can guarantee I took our dog out at every time I was supposed to but since he bought crappy cameras with even worse motion tracking he doesn't believe that I took her out and now I am probably going to get grounded... What the hell do I do?
