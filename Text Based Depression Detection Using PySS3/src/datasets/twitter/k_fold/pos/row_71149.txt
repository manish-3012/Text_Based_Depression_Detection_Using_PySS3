I finally realized how much of an asshole my dad is My parents are divorced. All my life, I have idolized my dad. To me, he was this super cool guy who took me to Chuck E. Cheese's when I was little and gave me a laptop. Up until recently, I thought he was just awesome. But then, I saw him shout at my little brother for trying to hang out with him and talk to him. That's when I started thinking back, really thinking about how life with him was. He would constantly emotionally abuse me, shouting "Fuck off," at a 7-year old, sending him and his brother to school with cockroaches and moldy food in our lunches, constantly making empty promises. Then my mom showed me her texts with him, and that was when I snapped. He was such a fucking prick, he quit his job so he would have to pay the minimum child support, he called my AMAZING mom a "twat waffle sandwhich," said he "stole his twenties," and is just a manipulative asshole. I inherited some of his not-so-great traits, and I'm working on that, but I'm so glad I finally saw theough the mirage and realized what a prick he truly is, and how amazing my mom and step-dad are.
