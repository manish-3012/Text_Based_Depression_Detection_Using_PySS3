I just watched the best film I've ever seen. I've never watched a movie that left me speechless. But today thats changed, I just finished Gran Torino and even though its only 2 hours, its by far the best movie I have ever seen and probably will ever see.

If you haven't seen it, you need to watch it sometime. Its just absolutely has blown me away.
