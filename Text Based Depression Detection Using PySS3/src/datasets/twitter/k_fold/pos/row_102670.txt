Im just curious about if other people get embarrassed about this? (youtube related) ever since i was little i was also super embarrassed by things i liked or watched. besides youtube, even like little hobbies or games etc. so when it came to youtube i hide that shit to the point where it was just suspicious. idk i was always embarrassed and nervous about getting judged by what i watched. itâ€™s not like i watched anything weird either. it was normally popular youtuber too so itâ€™s not like i was the only one. my friends would jsut causality watch their favorite youtubeâ€™s in front of their family and i would be horrified just thinking about how their family would know i was watching it with them. again itâ€™s not like itâ€™s weird stuff ya know. idk iâ€™m just wondering lol

// im wondering if anyone else gets embarrassed by watching youtubers u like in front of ur friends or family
