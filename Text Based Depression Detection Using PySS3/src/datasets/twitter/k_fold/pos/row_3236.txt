Dont complain school is bad IF * You get less than 5 hours of sleep all the time 
* Dont pay attention in class
* You are disrespectful to the teacher 
* Dont do your work 
* Skip school/ High or drunk during class 

If you are not doing all of these, and are actually trying and still doing bad, than you should speak up and ask questions. Ik its hard, shit is scary but ur education is important. There probably are more than this, its just all i can think of.
