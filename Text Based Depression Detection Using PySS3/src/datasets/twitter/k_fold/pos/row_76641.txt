I am sad to say r/youngcelswithouthate has been banned. Even if we tried to moderate with all we had in hand, our dear subreddit was hammered. I felt like the CCP deleting and locking dexter to sinester after we restricted, but unluckily it seems not to have been enought.

I think this pretty much marks the fall of Reddit Incelism. An once free speech community has been destroyed by cancel culture and corporate political correctness. Unluckily there's not much to do now, i won't asociate with .co psychopats and most remaining communities are small and unactive.

Eitherway, as i very well know my brocels browse this sub every now and then, i, your modcel, have decided to bring the bad news here; It's over.
