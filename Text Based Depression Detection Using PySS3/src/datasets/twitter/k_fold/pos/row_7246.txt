Mom I know grandma's coming over and you need to make something tasty BUT WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU MAKE PICKLED ONIONS. I HAD TO DIG OUT MY ESSENTIAL OILS (I just think they smell nice okay?) AND THEY DON'T EVEN FUCKING WORK. THEY JUST MAKE IT SMELL LIKE YOU'RE PICKLING ONIONS IN VINEGAR WITH FUCKING ORANGE JUICE. GREAT WAY TO RUIN MY SUNDAY

(btw there are 69 characters in the title, nice)
