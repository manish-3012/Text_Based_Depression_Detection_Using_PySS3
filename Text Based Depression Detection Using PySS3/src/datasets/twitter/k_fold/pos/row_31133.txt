A guy in my sixth grade class convinced me that â€œjacking offâ€ was just rubbing your jaw muscles to relieve stress So I was in 6th grade at the time fresh out of elementary school and I still didnâ€™t like hearing swearing at that time. So anyway my dumbass became friends with this guy in band class who was basically the definition of a trying to be edgy and tough kid. He and a few of his other friends thought that it would be funny to convince me that jacking off was rubbing you jaw muscles to relieve stress. He was t lying about all of it though itâ€™s just rubbing in a different place to relieve stress that I found out about a year later. So they would say stuff like my dad jacks off after a long day of work or I love jacking off during school. Completely went over my head about what it really meant.  It wasnâ€™t until my best friend Matthew told me that it wasnâ€™t really just rubbing your face that I previously thought and he didnâ€™t tell me what it really was for my sake. Anyway they kept trying to convince me that rubbing your face was just jacking off until eventually they got bored of that when I would just call them out on them lying.
