Fuck u CoVid Dad lost his job and I'm fuckin livid. Dude's been working under the company for 25 years. Way before even I was born. And today, they just told him they're letting him go. Now I'm fucking worried that my dad won't be able to support my brother's tuition which would make him ask help to my mom who's already struggling to support my tuition! Fucking hell man
... I know that I'm a lucky guy but I don't want it under the expense of others... It's at least a good thing my father finished his house before he got fired. And yeah, my mom and dad are unofficially divorced and are living separately
