it is what it is i kinda wish i had motivation or something. all i do is sleep, eat ice and play 2k. i really wish i could care about my grades. i just dont. but im a senior now. so close to being done so why keep pushing? idk. i don't feel sad or anything, but im not hAppy. but who tf is actually happy though? my grandmother thinks im depressed, but i don't wanna sElF dIagNoSe. i just be vibing lol. apparently living by the phrase "it is what it is" is bAd. but would you rather be ok with whatever happens or be stressed and potentially disappointed worrying about shit? when you live by "it is what it is" you cant be disappointed bruh. because it. is. what. it. is.
