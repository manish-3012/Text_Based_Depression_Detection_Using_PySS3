Went on my first date ever yesterday! It was very nice! Nothing really happened, and it didnt feel that romantic or anything, but it was nice! We went to a pizzeria and talked about our lives and school and stuff, at no point was it ever boring. He admitted that he did he did, in fact, have a crush on me, which was obvious. But he also said that he was lucky and all of his friends were jealous because they also had a crush on me. I never realized that I was this attractive and well liked! Truth is, I would have said yes to any one of them. He walked me home and asked if i wanted to go to his house and watch a movie, but i couldn't because it was getting late and my parents would be worried. I dont exactly know where to go from here, whether to ask him out again or wait for him to ask me out this time, but he is a really great guy and I wouldnt mind going out with him again.
