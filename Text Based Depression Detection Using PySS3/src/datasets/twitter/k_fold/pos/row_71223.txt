Am I being tricked? Sorry for formatting, Iâ€™m on mobile.

Yesterday I was playing some games with some friends when one of them logged off. We were both weirded out but shrugged it off. My friend Oli shot him a message asking why he left without notice, but he got a weird message in return a couple mins later.

â€˜Fricking monson.
Fitness.â€™

We were weirded out so he asked what it meant, but got no response. He wasnâ€™t online for the rest of the night. Oli and I stopped because I wanted to make myself some dinner. When I got back I saw the guy had spammed â€˜monson fitnessâ€™ all over our discord server. I asked Oli if he wanted to chat but I guess he was asleep because he didnâ€™t respond.

At around 8PM I got a text from the friendâ€™s mum. She was asking wether I had seen him recently, and I said no. I mentioned the whole â€˜monson fitnessâ€™ thing and she just stopped responding. This morning I got another message from him asking if I wanted to play. I asked him about â€˜monson fitnessâ€™, no response. He pretended like nothing happened, as did his mum. She never acknowledged he was even missing.

Am I being tricked? Iâ€™m creeped out right now. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: I just jumped on call with this guy and his voice was... off. It was slightly lower and didn't really sound like him. He also didn't get some of our inside jokes. Weird. Will check back in the morning.
