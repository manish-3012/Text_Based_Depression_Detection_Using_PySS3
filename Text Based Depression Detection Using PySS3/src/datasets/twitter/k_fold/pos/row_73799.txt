How do I stop being a pussy? So basically there was this girl I liked. We chatted for a while and I was pretty sure she liked me. I liked her. I knew she liked me, but I still had my doubts and my friend basically told her I liked her and she asked me out. 

Now we're dating, it's been a few weeks but now I'm too nervous to kiss her and stuff. She kisses me (on the cheek) all the time and I just can't seem to do it. It seems like such a small thing, such an easy little thing to do, but no, I just can't do it. I know it will work out, I mean, what would even go wrong? But I'm still too afraid to just do it. Even though it's just a kiss, and in the grand scheme of things it's pretty insignificant.
