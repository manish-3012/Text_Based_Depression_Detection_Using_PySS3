Iâ€™m conscious about my looks Iâ€™m conscious about my looks

I really wanna post a picture of my face on teens meet teens but every time I open said SubReddit I see so many other people whoâ€™re better looking than me. I know people say looks donâ€™t matter, itâ€™s the personality that should be good but I believe people secretly do believe that looks matter. Iâ€™m not shaming them for this tho. Donâ€™t get me wrong. Everyone has their preferences and I respect it but I jus r donâ€™t know what I should do.  I feel really insecure and scared of being rejected just because of the way I look
