THE PERSEVERANCE ROVER LANDS ON MARS IN LESS THAT 30 MINUTES I'm so excited, I'm watching the live broadcast [here](https://youtu.be/gm0b_ijaYMQ)

I promise it's not a coconut mall or a rick roll, it's actually the livestream on youtube. The rover is supposed to land around 3:55 EST. I hope everything goes well ðŸ˜³.
