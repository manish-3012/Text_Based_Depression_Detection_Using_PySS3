alright class letâ€™s go around the room and share a high and a low from today! day 2 ðŸ¥° my high is that i got to talk to one of my friends who i havenâ€™t seen since march! it was only a 5 minute facetime but it was still good to see her

my low is that i had to work a 9 hour lifeguard shift which wasnâ€™t fun. the weather app said it was supposed to storm too but it never did. but i only work 5 hours tomorrow so thatâ€™s better!
