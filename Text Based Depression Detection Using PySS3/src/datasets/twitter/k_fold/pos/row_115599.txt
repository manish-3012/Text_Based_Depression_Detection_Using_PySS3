Why have they failed to make space exploration cool to our generation? Before watching Apple TV's "For All Mankind" I never thought real space exploration could be so exciting. After finishing the first season I checked out movies like "Apollo 13", "First Man", "Hidden Figures", "The Martian", "Salyut 7", etc.

Why have adults and society have done such a poor job of educating and get people excited for space exploration? So much of a bad job that a lot of our generation apparently think "space is fake".
