I dont know if it's just me but... Do you ever just get that glimmer of hope in your life that you'll find that certain someone one day then you do and fuck it up somehow then you feel all of the unused stress and sadness that was gone during the relationship due to you being happy but now you experiencing it all and you feel like nobody else will ever give you a chance so you withdraw socially and almost tear up when people try to talk to you but just say you're fine.
