How many of u guys have parental controls? That shits ridiculous especially with the new ones coming out now days. Literally with the new shit itâ€™s not oh yeah let me change this setting on my phone or computer. No there are new parental controls especially with apple that really canâ€™t be bypassed. And most bypassed from apple are patched a week later if any do come up. 

Yes there are some ways to get around it (lying to ur parents about what a app does, and which has a browser for example) but if ur parents google every app u want to download ur fucked. Plus ofc thereâ€™s an option to set up a password to download every app to. Also they can make it so u have ur own pin (which ofc ur parents will know) then a separate password which only ur parents know for downloading apps and shit. 

Anyway especially the newer shit is insane. A lot of kids have ones that focus on the router but combine that with ones that are specific devices ur fucked. Specific device parental controls if there good ones which usually cost money but parents donâ€™t give a fuck now days they can block all the bypassed u can use to bypass the router based one
