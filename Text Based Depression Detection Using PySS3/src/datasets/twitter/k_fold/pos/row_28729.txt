Regarding people posting lists of suicide hotlines It's a great idea in theory, wanting to help someone, but there are a few fatal flaws with it.

First, just posting a list of every country's number ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/miy9qq/if_youre_feeling_suicidal_please_call/)) without checking over the numbers is a bad idea. The number for Singapore was just the police there, when the Samaritans of Singapore would be a much better fit.

Second, these support lines are usually understaffed, leading to people having to wait (which doesn't help with the "nobody cares about me" part of depression), or not getting a slot at all. For some lines, the staff just read off an obvious script about how it's not nice to die. That isn't helpful at all.

Third, people who don't see their country on there will feel left out. Google is good at finding your local hotline, so it'd best to just [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=suicide) to a Google search that leads straight to that.

And fourth, offering help in DMs can cause some issues. It's best not to do anything more than say a few motivational words and redirect them to a therapist, who can deal with these issues much better. A lot of people have problems that you can't imagine, and if you're not qualified to talk about them, all you can say is something vaugely supportive, or just ghost them, both of which are bad choices.

It also seems like karmawhoring, posting a list from Wikipedia or some other source without bothering to check over the numbers.
