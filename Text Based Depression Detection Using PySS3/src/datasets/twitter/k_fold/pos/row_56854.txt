I. FEEL. NOTHING. I hear people say they feel things on their last year in high school...
I feel nothing but anxiety for what's going to happen
I'm supposed to do exams
HOW AM I GOING TO DO THIS WITHOUT STUDYING 
HECK I DON'T KNOW HOW I WAS NEVER TAUGHT
Sorry getting off topic
I feel nothing but anxiety and stress and I don't know what to do
This is my last year of high school 
Anyone have any tips?
