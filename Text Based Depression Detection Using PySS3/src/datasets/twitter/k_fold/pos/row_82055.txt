weird dream again. yes again.. (no it doesnâ€™t make cinch) Iâ€™m on a bus with few students left along with my siblings. the bus driver is making us concerned for our safety. The bus drives towards the rail road track.

*and you know what he does next?* 

he drives on the rail road track 


*rumbubububububmbumbumbum* 

we hear a train yelling in the distance and my siblings move to the back of the bus

OH MY GOD THERE IS A *T R A I N*

The bus driver head forward to the train (that was headed straight for us!) then the drive rod both slams on the brakes. The train backs up then continues to slam into us like a ram. The bus soon falls onto its side. 


THE EEENNNNDDD!!!!!!!
