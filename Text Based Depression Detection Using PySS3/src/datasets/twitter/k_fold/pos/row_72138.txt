Just wanted to say this Putting people down to bring yourself up and make yourself seen like a better person than you actually are, invalidating their achievements and acts so they'll always feel low, insulting and constantly attacking them verbally and sometimes physically under the word "joke", and wishing harm for people so your talentless worthless self can show a little more, aren't good stuff to do, and yes I'm talking about a specific someone in my life.
