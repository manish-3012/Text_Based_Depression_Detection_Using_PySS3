The REAL reason why people really hate tik tok first of all, Iâ€™d just like to say iâ€™m not one of those instagram bad reddit good people. 

My first reason is pretty obvious. Theyâ€™re dances/trends are really unoriginal. As I said, this ones pretty obvious as you can see the same dance from the same song done by multiple people, these videos get millions of views for what.

Next point. Tiktok is super toxic. If youâ€™ve been on the app for at least a week youâ€™d probably find the â€œaltâ€ side of tiktok. These people think that they have some sort of advantage above straight people because of their sexual orientation. As you might think, this might cause a lot of problems, which it does.

Last point and possibly the most important. Tiktok basically fuels out child porn. Yes I want people to have rights to their own bodyâ€™s and I want people to express themselves but thereâ€™s a point where you cross a line. Thereâ€™s one trend thatâ€™s probably the worst which is the â€œdoggystyle trend.â€ Yeah you heard that right.

Anyways thanks for tuning into my rant I hate everything and everyone bye lolðŸ˜€
