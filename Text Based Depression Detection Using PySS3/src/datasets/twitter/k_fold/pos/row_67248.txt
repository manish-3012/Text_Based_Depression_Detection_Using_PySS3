I just frolicked in the snow for the first time in years Our school is fully online so even though thereâ€™s a foot of snow outside we unfortunately didnâ€™t get a snow day. However, immediately afterwards my brother and I ran outside, completely outfitted in coats and hats and gloves, and just had fun for once. We even built a snowman and put a top hat and scarf on him. We threw snowballs at each other and then just laid down in the snow afterwards and stared up at the sky. It sounds like such a nothing thing but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt more contented.
