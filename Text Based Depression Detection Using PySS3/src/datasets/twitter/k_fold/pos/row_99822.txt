Why do older generations have to relate everything to politics? Last night my dad and brother were watching the Giants Vs. Cowboys game and my mom was there too. Then right after the cowboys quarter back snapped his ankle the conversation some how became politics. I have no idea what happened there was no hinting towards that the conversation before that was related at all and then just Biden Vs. Trump. 

This usually doesnâ€™t happen that often but with the election close it has been happening more frequently.

For example, when the Mulan remake came out I was telling someone I didnâ€™t like it because all the good stuff from the original was removed (like Mushu, the cricket, and the singing). Then I was called sexist because â€œI thought Mulan needed help.â€ After they said this I was really annoyed. Those characters were there for comic relief and the songs were just because it was a Disney movie. But, in the new movie there is none of that and is supposed to be more â€œhistorically accurateâ€ but they have Mulan take down an entire army basically and add witches.

Thatâ€™s really it but I just read it again and it turned from a rant about older generations turning everything to politics to a Mulan rant. So sorry about that.

But still why canâ€™t people just like things to like things not everything has to do with your beliefs. Like my mom stopped doing something she did ever so often because of something Trump did.
