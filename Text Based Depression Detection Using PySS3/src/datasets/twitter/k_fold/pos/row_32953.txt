You know how people want a fight scene choreographed to tainted love? All I want is a fight scene choreographed to Ke$ha die young:
I *gunshot* hear *gunshot* your *gunshot* heart *gunshot* beat *gunshot* to *gunshot* the *gunshot* beat *gunshot* of *gunshot* the *gunshot* drums *gunshot*
Who what a shame *throws 2 sticks of dynamite* that you came here with some *KABOOM* one *KABOOM*
So while your here in my *cocks shotgun* arms!
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young! *jumps up onto table and starts shooting with the shotgun in time with the the tempo*
