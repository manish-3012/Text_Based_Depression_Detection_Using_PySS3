Did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagius the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the jedi would tell you. It's a sith legend. Darth plagius was a dark lord of the sith who was so powerful and so wise he could influence the midichlorians to create...life. He could ever prevent those he cared about from dieing. He became so powerful that eventually the only thing he feared was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep... Ironic he could save others from death but not himself.
