I had to explain to my mom what CBT is Was talking with my mom about depression and shit and she started talking about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. When she was explaining it she would say CBT. I kinda knew people would refer to it as that sometimes but it was still kinda weird. I said not to say that around other people cause they might misinterpret her. She was kinda confused so I said that people might think she was talking about Cock and Ball torture. Fucking awkward man.
