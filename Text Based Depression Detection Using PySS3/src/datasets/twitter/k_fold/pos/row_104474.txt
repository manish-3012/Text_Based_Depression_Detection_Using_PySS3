16 year old girl here. Any other gals wanna talk? Donâ€™t need to talk about anything in particular, Iâ€™m just bored and feel like being social.

Here are some things about me:

â€¢ Iâ€™m 16

â€¢ Iâ€™m bi

â€¢ Iâ€™m technically a Junior in Highschool and a Freshman in College

â€¢ I enjoy photoshopping things

â€¢ I like Minecraft

â€¢ My favorite music genres can only accurately be described as sad indie lesbian music (girl in red, Phoebe Bridgers, etc), Star Wars music, and 100 geks (donâ€™t judge me)

â€¢ Iâ€™m on the autism spectrum
