Iâ€™m illitiate I was in class with some friends and my dyslexic ass couldnâ€™t read what was on the sheet so I wrote in big red pen across the top of the page â€œ IM ILLITERATEâ€ and flashed it to my friends, they ever so kindly let me know I didnâ€™t even write illiterate but instead â€œIM ILLITIATEâ€
