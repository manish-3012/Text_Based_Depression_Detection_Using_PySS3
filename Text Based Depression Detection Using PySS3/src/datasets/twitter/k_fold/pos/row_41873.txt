Random story of a time I got paired in a girls only group. It was 8th grade. We were supposed to write character sketches from a Shakespeare novel â€œMerchant Of Veniceâ€. The character I got was Antonio. But what was worse that I got paired with 3 girls and all of them were great in studies when I wasnâ€™t. Worst, my teacher decided to make me the leader of that group because English was that one subject I was good at. I just sat there awkwardly while they discussed cause I had never talked to them and was a fairly new student. I decided to chip in and hand them over certain parts of the sketch. Next day, they wrote it and handed them over to me only for me to change 90% of the material they wrote. So I got to work, wrote it down in a fair manner, made some photocopies and handed them over. They were probably a bit mad I didnâ€™t keep what they told but hey, Iâ€™m the leader. I was expecting to completely fuck it up but surprisingly the performance went well and I got a 9/10 (very dapper). Needless to say, I have never volunteered for this shit again. That was the absolute last one.
