Do you ever question your friendships? Looking back at my old friendships, the only reason (with most of my friendships, not all) I was friends with someone was because I had no other friends. We didn't have much in common with each other. We almost never hung out after school.

I've been thinking if this is also the case with my current friendships. I have two friends and they are good people and I like them but we don't do anything outside of school. Of course it's covid time now but we don't even really text. Only sometimes.
