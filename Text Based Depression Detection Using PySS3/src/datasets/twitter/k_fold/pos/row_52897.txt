Everyone in r/LoveforAnimesexuals is fricking delusional I swear everyone in that sub is crazy. They constantly simp over their "waifus", and really believe that it's a sexuality. And when a sane person tries to talk some sense into them, they get bombarded with down votes and get called nazis and bigots (which makes no sense, as there is no relation) . I made a post on there that'll probably have the same done to it, but that's fine, cause everyone in that sub needs to read it. But back to my main point, I'm not even joking. Go there, and sort by controversial, and you'll see what I mean. That sub honestly is full of weird and toxic people, and unless you're gonna try and reason with them (which will probably fail) just stay the hell away from there.
