No meaning Hey, I'm russian so mistakes are supposed to be. I'm 13 years old. I have a depression and existential crysis. I don't want to go to school, because there are so many lessons that meaningless to me and most of students. Last time I just waste time, playing videogames. I should learn German, but I can't make me doing it. I should do homework, but I don't understand why I have to do it. I'm introvert and sociophobe. I don't really have friends. I'm trying to lose fat, but every try is meaningless. I love reading(love Hermann Hesse the most) and I read constantly, but sometimes serious books by Dostoevsky or Hesse, or Kamus make me feel that my life is ridiculously stupid. And honestly, It is. I don't wanna do anything, I tried to find a future job, but every job not for me. I don't understand what I should do. I'm weak person, I can't even make doing smth like learning German, doing homework. It's stupid what happening with me, because I think my life is ridiculous, I don't see the meaning of my life
