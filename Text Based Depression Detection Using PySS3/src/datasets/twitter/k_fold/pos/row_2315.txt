Online school's got me feeling down When we had the "no-harm" policy in the last months before my freshman year ended, it was all good. I just stopped doing work and my grades just stayed good. Now that a new year started, it isn't as fun as I imagined. Every time I go into a Zoom call, I just can't resist opening up a game instead of listening. When the homework gets assigned on Classroom, either I forget about it entirely or I just don't feel like I want to do it. My aunt used to check on my grades daily but since 8th grade, she probably thinks that I have a grip on my grades but in reality, my grades are awful and I only have one B and a couple D's and F's. She's been nice to me all this time but if she opened up my grades now, all the trust will be gone. I feel bad because she said that my grades were good last year but that was only because of the "no-harm" policy. Don't get me wrong, not having to wear stylish clothes and having the ability to play games the instant school ends is nice, but this is at the expense of my grades.

Edit: Q1 is ending next week and I'm terrified that the school will email my parents. Seeing email after email of "(Teacher name here) just returned your assignment: 0/20,"is super demoralizing.
