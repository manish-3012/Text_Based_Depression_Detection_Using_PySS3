Not having uniforms makes school so much more interesting My public jr high school had uniforms (like certain pants and certain polos and pullover sweatshirts). Now I'm in high school and we don't have uniforms but like it's fun to look at people's outfits (no not like In a creepy way) like this girl had frog jeans those were cool and this guy had a flannel with nice colors. Idk it makes school more interesting for some reason
