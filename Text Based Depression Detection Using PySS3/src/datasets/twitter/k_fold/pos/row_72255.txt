Nowhere else to post this rant thing. You know how in comment sections of Youtube and Instagram, there are people who do this thing where they type.

It's legitimately the most annoying shit to me. It's more annoying to me than the dozens of people that type first. It's just so biased. Like, Youtube comments have a limit, likes don't. I don't participate in it but it makes no sense. It's so little yet so annoying imo. Thanks for reading this unnecessary 'rant'. I'll take any excuse to call people stupid.
