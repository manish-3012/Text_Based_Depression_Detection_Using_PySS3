I just need to ask u...why is it u keep messaging me? U tell me u miss me and stuff and then u suddenly stop talking for several months even when it seems like u want to keep in touch. Why r u doing this? Is it cause u still like me? What r u hoping to get out of messaging me? I dont mind talking, i like talking to u, I just dont understand what it is ur doing and why
