Gamers Needed, Serious Inquires Only.  Hello, my friend and I our in desperate need of help. We're trying to build a minecraft house, but there's only so much a girl and a gay can do. We're looking for some non-toxic players to help us. We cannot offer much, but we do have companionship, lots of love, and a singular crossbow we can all share. My friend is willing to be your gamer gf depending on how pretty the house is, and how non toxic you are. Please help, the sever is cold and we're minecraft homless. We keep getting killed :(.
