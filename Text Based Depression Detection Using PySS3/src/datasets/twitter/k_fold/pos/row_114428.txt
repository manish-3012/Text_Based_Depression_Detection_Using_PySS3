A note to myself. Happy birthday to me. I wish this year brings joy and meaning to my life. I hope I don't end my life. I hope I get all the best here. I wish i could go abroad to study (to escape my abusive family). I wish I could get a girlfriend (I'm gay). Let this year be the year I achieve my small goals. I will start loving myself. I will never self harm again. Have a great day. &lt;3
