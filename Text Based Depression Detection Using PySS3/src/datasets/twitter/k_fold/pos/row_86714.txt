My current daily schedule 2:30 am - wake up for school 

3:00 am - class starts on zoom 

8:10 am - I have a nap while itâ€™s my â€œLunchâ€ break

9:10 am - last period 

10:30 am - school finishes 

Then I do homework or eat or whatever 

If Iâ€™m good Iâ€™ll sleep at around 5pm but it normally ends up like 10pm
