My friend has started to talk to me less and ig a bit hostile towards me. Help? 
My guy friend and I talk in class and have a lot of banter. Anyway his best friend told me that he thinks my guy friend likes me(Ik pretty immature but whatever). I said I doubt it and we are just friends.

Anyway the next week my guy friend talked to me a lot less, stopped joking with me and seems to avoid me a bit. Idk what to do now or why he is acting like this but Iâ€™m kinda sad about it :/
