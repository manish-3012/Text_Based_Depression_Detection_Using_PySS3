Just kinda alone. i wasnâ€™t sure were to post this but i feel like a lot of teenagers can relate. 

i feel so alone 24/7. i never saw people even before the pandemic, and the one friend iâ€™ve had since kindergarten is super cool now. i know it sounds cliche but itâ€™s true. heâ€™s tall and honestly handsome as hell. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m even hiding it. iâ€™ve been in love with him pretty much since i met him. isnâ€™t that fun? i know i donâ€™t have like a â€œclaimâ€ or something, but itâ€™s the only endgame i see myself with. my entire life itâ€™s always been people telling us weâ€™ll get married when we are older, or that we would be the perfect couple. 

i know i shouldnâ€™t dwell on it. especially because i donâ€™t think he likes me like that. but i still wait for him. ok. now that we got that out of the way, how alone i feel friend wise. as i said before, heâ€™s popular, or cool. but he still hangouts with me and talks to me, but his romantic escapades take priority most of the time. (he is kind of a player) but whenever iâ€™m hanging out with someone, iâ€™m always asked â€œhey! can you invite _____ over? heâ€™s so hot.â€ and stuff like that. every time. people only think of me in terms of him. i literally lost friends because of him. they were toxic so iâ€™m glad, but he was a big part of it. he came over today (we are both in each others bubbles, and have antibodies and negative tests) and my older brother had his friend over too, and they said :â€ omg we should have this guy over every time iâ€™m hereâ€

i know i shouldnâ€™t be pissed off over this, i know itâ€™s irrational, but i canâ€™t help it. i never tell him this, i donâ€™t want him to feel bad.
