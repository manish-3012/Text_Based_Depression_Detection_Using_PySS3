Had a nice dream that I regret I dreamed very deeply and even thought that this could be a lucid dream but I thought this is real.

After  waking up multiple times in a deep state of sleeping I began to dream  so close that I just felt like I was there. (A lucid dream is a state  where you KNOW that you are dreaming and can walk or do what ever you  want and manipulate everything in the dream) But I really thought that  this is the real life and that it really happens.

I  dreamed about the girl I met at a boarding school a year ago. I just  asked her for the number and we chatted a few times. It was days before  we chatted and there she didn't even read my text so I felt a bit bad.

Today  I dreamed about her inviting and doing cool stuff together and after  waking up I really thought... what did just happen and after just  staying awake I just realized that this thing wasn't even real. At first  I thought that this was really cool and etc but slowly during the whole  day I just began to feel more bad. more sad. I just want to have  contact to her again but why when you don't even know what  to talk  about. We have corona everywhere so we can't really DO something. I  opened the chat and saw my message that she didn't read and respond to  yet days ago. I am slowly thinking that she maybe doesn't even like me. I  feel even more shittier than before. Maybe she switched her phone  number? or phone? Even being able to contact her wouldn't change much as  I don't know what to do.

It's crazy how dreams can change you completely in just one night. Yesterday I was neutral and probably happy.
