You ever just have a moment? Right now Iâ€™m sitting in my car at my old jobs parking lot listening to the playlist I made with my ex who I met at the job. Itâ€™s snowing a lot. Iâ€™m not happy or sad but I can feel the old feelings trying to get back in. Neither of us have worked here in years and we lost contact. I think she killed herself. Idk. My place is just down the street. Iâ€™m not making any sense. I should go but I keep hoping something will happen. Itâ€™s not even about my ex. I loved this job but I had to go and now I canâ€™t go back without feeling trapped and unwelcome. Itâ€™s a shell. It used to have so many great people but after I left the staff went from 60+ to less than 20. I miss my old coworkers
