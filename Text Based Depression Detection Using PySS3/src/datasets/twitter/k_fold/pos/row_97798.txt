I don't know what to title this, but the scenario annoys me. So, I usually have a WiFi restriction on my PC which goes out at 9:30P. However, before all this crap happened (which I'll get to shortly.) I was able to bypass this curfew naturally. (A parent would control the WiFi.) However, my brother recently got caught talking to his online friends in a group chat. That was about a week back. After all that was resolved, I now have a controlled timer, most likely used with an automatic timer. Why does all this crap matter? Because I did nothing wrong. I'm really pissed off because of his stupid mistake. So at this point, I want to know how do I bypass an Eero WiFi restriction? Talking it out of the option, because no way am I getting no restrictions. I saw a post on this subreddit that explained bypassing a WiFi restriction. Any help works.

Update: As of now, It's my curfew time, however, my brother is racking up hours for driving. I think I found my chance as a loophole, however, I think that this proves that I was wrong and that the WiFi is still person controlled.
