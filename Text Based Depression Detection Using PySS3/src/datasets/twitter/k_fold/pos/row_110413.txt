English 12 Exam, bullshit or not? Iâ€™ll start this off by saying my feeling towards English as a subject are mixed. I love the idea of a community of writers who share ideas through essays and other forms of written work. But I hate how pretentious it can get. We get it you can quote Shakespeare, but old English is basically a foreign language at this point and we should be taught how to read it before being thrown into the tank of Yoda speak thatâ€™s in a 18th century dialect. But Iâ€™m getting off track here. Iâ€™m here to talk about the English essay that dropped my mark from a 98, in English 11 to an 88 in English 12.

First of all, half of the essay was multiple choice. Of course, multiple choice questions have to have a definitive answer, right? Well, heres an example of one the DEFINITIVE questions,

How would (non-fictional character of first story) feel if he read the second story of this exam.

a) Supportive
b) Grateful
c) Amused
d) disappointed 

Now, this is a non-fictional character. Not a fictional one who has defining characteristics. How am I supposed to know how a real life person would feel about anything? I didnâ€™t realize being an empath is in the school curriculum. Of course there were questions that were definitive, but in English it is generally known that a lot of it is interpretative and the answers to some of these questions can be anyone of the answers, given the time to explain why.

Second, the exam had 800 words worth of either essays or written responses. Now, hereâ€™s where my problem with exams get more substantiated. 800 quality, well thought out words are hardly possible under 2 hours. For me at least. Weâ€™re usually given a week to write an essay the same size during normal class time. But all of a sudden, for some reason, weâ€™re expected to write the same amount of work, at the same quality, for a fraction of the time usually given. 

In spite of this, I think itâ€™s a good idea to put students under time pressure when making a written piece of work. Just not under such grade affecting conditions as an exam. The whole idea that English needs an exam is absurd. English is something that requires time, detail, and thought. An exam is counter-intuitive as it asks for quantity over quality. Thus I believe English 12 exams or bullshit. What do you think?
