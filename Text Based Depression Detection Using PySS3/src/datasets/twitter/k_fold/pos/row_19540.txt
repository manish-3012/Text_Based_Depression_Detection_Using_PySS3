Choose my breakfast! Yesterday morning I had 3 soft boiled eggs on 3 pieces of toast. Then I ate an apple, a hashbrown, one chicken nugget, rice, black beans, avocado, and grilled chicken. So that was approximately 1620 calories. Today I was wondering if I should eat the eggs and toast, peanut butter toast and banana, or a bowl of oatmeal.
