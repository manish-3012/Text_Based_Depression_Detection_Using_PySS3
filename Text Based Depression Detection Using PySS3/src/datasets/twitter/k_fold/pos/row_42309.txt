RELATIONSHIP ADVICE NEEDED There's this girl I met on discord. I like her and am hitting on her. She knows that but told me she needs some time to recover from her last relationship. She even gave me hints not to give up on her. But today she told me that she may delete discord. So is that a hint for me to give up or to take the conversation somewhere else? (Like instagram dms) if so, should I ask her about that? (I don't know If I explained it properly)
