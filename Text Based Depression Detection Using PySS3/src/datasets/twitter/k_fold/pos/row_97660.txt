I didnâ€™t know my camera was on... I logged onto the Goggle Meet but felt like I forgot something. I brushed it away cuz Iâ€™m a pretty forgetful person. I decide to put on a song because I listen to music while I work. Anyway, some time passed and my nose got itchy. I got to pick it and see something bright. Out the corner of eye I see a light...my camera light. Thatâ€™s when it dawned on me, I forgot to turn my camera off.

They saw me wearing my RGB light up headset

They saw me dancing to the dubstep I was playing (Imagine a tall rubber chicken just flailing around, not a pretty sight)

They saw my fucking boxers

If youâ€™ll excuse me, Iâ€™m gonna contemplate ending it all but show up to class Monday like nothing happened
