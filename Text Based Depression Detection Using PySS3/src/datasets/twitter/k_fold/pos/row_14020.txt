So I need some help So theres this girl that I've known her since grade 1 (I'm in 11 right now) in grade 7 we were a "couple". She is in my class and I haven't talked to her for awhile. I like her and I want to get to know her better and see if it will lead to (hopefully) something more. I don't know a way to approach her without making it awkward.
