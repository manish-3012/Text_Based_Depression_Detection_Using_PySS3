I swear to god, if my family doesn't start knocking, I'm going to start locking my door In my family, people don't usually knock and it bothers me a lot. No one knocks when I'm in my room, no one knocks when I'm in the bathroom (which is okay I guess) and privacy isn't very respected in general. My sister has conditioned me to always knock by being pretty pissed when I didn't, but somehow, my parents and her don't care when it comes to knocking on *my* door. It's not like I smoke weed in there (I don't smoke at all, so that is possibly a crappy example.), but I. want. some. privacy.

I was changing a few minutes ago (late evening over here) and my mum just comes wandering in while I was taking off my clothes. And as you might imagine, that wasn't a nice situation. When she came in a few minutes later (*Still without knocking!*), I told her that this was the reason why I'd really appreciate my family knocking on my door first. It may not be uncomfortable to her, but it is an unpleasant situation for me.

"Eh, no, I'm not going to knock, I'll just... (cue many filler words, she didn't finish the sentence), I didn't see anything anyways." If I walked into the girl's locker room and told them "Eh, didn't see anything", *would that keep me out of trouble???*

However, if I start locking my door, the handle is just going to turn (without knocking if I may add), followed by some knocking and a parent outside asking me why I lock my door (it's not like I did drugs in there, father dearest). Should I just start locking my door, should I talk to them about it (I'd prefer not to, their imagination would come up with... uhm... stuff), or something entirely different?

I'm really annoyed by this but I don't want to rectify my actions every day if I did start locking my door.
