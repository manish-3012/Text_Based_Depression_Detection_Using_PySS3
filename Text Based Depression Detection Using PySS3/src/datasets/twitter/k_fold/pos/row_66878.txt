How do your parents tolerate you drinking? My parents seem to be pretty cool about they let me have a few cold ones when the boys are over they just don't want me getting super fucking drunk .


Maybe my parents are like this because first of all we live in the eu where drinking age is lower.
And   they are litturaly textbook boomers every dinner they have one bottle of wine talking about how the stock market is shit despite having millions to blow on stupid watches

I usualy get offered beer at dinner but I almost always denie it because beer taste like shit and I don't want to be an alcholic at 15 but some times a cold beer feels nice but if we are on the topic of alcohol pear cider its the best

Also they don't let me drink anything with a 5% or higher alcohol percentage .
