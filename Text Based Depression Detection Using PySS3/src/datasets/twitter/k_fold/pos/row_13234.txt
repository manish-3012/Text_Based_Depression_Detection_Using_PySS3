I got epilepsy A bit of backstory. I was playing around with my siblings, when my mom called us for dinner. I went rushing downstairs when I blacked out. My brother said I was making a weird face. I woke up and I was in a hospital bed. The doctors diagnosed me with epilepsy and didnâ€™t let me out of the hospital until a few days ago. Itâ€™s a lot and itâ€™s probably going to change my life forever. I know that itâ€™s not as big as cancer, but itâ€™s a life-changer. Thank you.
