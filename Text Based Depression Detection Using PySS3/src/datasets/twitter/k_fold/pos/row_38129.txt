A small update from my previous post. 11/9/2020

So, I posted this on reddit, and someone commented on it that I am way past the point where it is ok to ask for help, but am I? Thatâ€™s one thing that has always bugged me about myself, I never know when to shut up, but I also never know when to ask for help. I might just reason with myself and thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t ask for help about stuff. I often say to myself that my life could be worse, everything could be worse, someone else has it harder than me, they are going through more pain than I will ever endure. But by thinking about that, I think about people that I have never met, never knew existed if they did, and that because they have it worse, means that Iâ€™m fine, just deal with it. But I feel like I need to think more local, but what my parents have taught me, I donâ€™t know if I can, I donâ€™t know if I ever will. I always think about someone who has it worse, my parents drill into me that I am very lucky, and I am, but I donâ€™t know how lucky, I donâ€™t know what everyone elseâ€™s life is like, they tell me that a lot too, they often say that you donâ€™t know what their home life is like, and what they have gone through, and that has stuck with me, but it takes me over when I contemplate telling someone about my pain. If I thought more local, and based when I thought a good time to get help was, off of what I know for sure, what other peoples life have been like this year, I should have gotten at least a little a few months ago. I question my masculinity though sometimes when I think about getting help, my dad doesnâ€™t want me to grow up to be a pussy, I donâ€™t want that either, so by holding everything in, it makes me feel strong, because on the outside, Iâ€™m a 15 year old that weighs about 180 and has a little bit of a belly. So Iâ€™m not very physically appealing, so by holding all that in, I find that Iâ€™m mentally stronger. I like the feeling that Iâ€™m mentally strong. I honestly should have gotten help a long time ago, but as you know, my go to person sucks at responding.
