Hey just want to share my feelings as I have no one else. Me and the girl I love were doing great but she was so confident that she wouldn't love me back but for last one month she started felling for me and she was so distracted we would text continues for almost 10 hours but it was affecting her life and the career she want depend on her studies so we mutually agreed to block eachother. She promised to not forget me but asked me to move on but I'm lil stubborn I'll just keep waiting for her
