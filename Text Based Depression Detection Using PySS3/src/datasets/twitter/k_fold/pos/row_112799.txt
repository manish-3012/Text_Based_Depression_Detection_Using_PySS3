Complex crush moment Well, I downloaded a dating app out of boredom during quarantaine where I got swiped by a cute blonde guy about my height (~180cm). I started a new study this year in a new city and I discovered that the cute guy from the dating app is in my class and gladly he doesn't recognize me as the cute transgirl he swiped earlier this year, but after I realized it's the same guy from earlier this year I started to develop a little crush on him. But now does the more complex part start, I have my comming out as transgirl over about a few weeks to my class and I want to make a presentation about myself and I don't if I should use my formatted girl pictures (I used on the app) or how he would react if he would recognize me. Shall I use those pictures, do you think it will turn out fine between us?
