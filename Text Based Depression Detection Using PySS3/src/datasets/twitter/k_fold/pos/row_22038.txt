My introduction, cause it's text post weekend and I may as well do what the pinned announcement suggests I'm Matt. This is my alt account because my main got too big ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¸ðŸ”¥

I am here to socialize, have fun, maybe meet some new people.

Some of the ways I use my free time at the moment: Playing Metro Exodus; Watching King of the Hill or various youtubers; Doing at-home workout so I can achieve ultimate ape-like mobility
