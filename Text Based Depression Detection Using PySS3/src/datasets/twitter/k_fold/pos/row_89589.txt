I'm fat and I think I'm disgusting but tbh it's still so wrong to shame fat people in general Like it's possible that I have an eating disorder, I got fucked up as a kid because my parents would overfeed me and all I would have available to eat was junk food for basically every meal. So now it's really hard to control overeating. It's really like an addiction where I'll have withdrawals if I'm not constantly eating something.

And I really am trying harder to lose weight than everyone sees. I fell off my diet but now this new year I'm going to be really trying. And I've been spending a lot of money for healthy food and it's really expensive, I'm not just eating cheap mcdonalds every day like people think every fat person does.

And yea, you gotta realize that it's possible if everyone in the world ate the same exact amount, there would still be skinny people and fat people. And my body as well as other people are on the naturally fat side and it's hard to eat less food than average people.
