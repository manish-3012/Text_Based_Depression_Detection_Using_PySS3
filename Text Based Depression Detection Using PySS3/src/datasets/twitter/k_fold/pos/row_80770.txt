Hey.. Ummm I don't know how to say this.. But your lab results cam back and... You're cutie-positive. The doctors are saying that you have contagions all over you. Your smile, voice, eyes and body, they're all extremely contagious... There's no easy way to say this but.... You might be cutie-positive for the rest of life.
