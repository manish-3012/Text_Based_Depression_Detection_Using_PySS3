My parents arenâ€™t letting me go back to school and I legitimately want to die Iâ€™ve been in school for a month with a hybrid schedule- first half of the alphabet there first half of the week, second for the second half. Now theyâ€™re bringing everyone back. They have taken all the necessary precautions possible. The second half of the week has been hell for me since the beginning of school. I canâ€™t stand being in my house; my parents fight constantly, are ultra-religious, and extremely homophobic and transphobic. Iâ€™m both gay and trans. When we had to go all online in March, I went into the worst mental state Iâ€™ve ever been in. I donâ€™t know what to do if I have to do that again, but my momâ€™s been implying that sheâ€™s not letting me go back. All of my friends are going to be there who I havenâ€™t been in school with since March. I canâ€™t do this. Any advice on convincing them?
