What if I donâ€™t grow taller than 6ft tall? Been a long time I havenâ€™t checked my height, last time was when I was 13, being 5â€™7â€ tall. I donâ€™t think I grew much this year, I think about 5â€™8 or 5â€™9, so Iâ€™m feeling kind of scared that I wonâ€™t grow past 6ft tall and I donâ€™t know if the girls not liking people who arenâ€™t over 6ft tall is supposed to be true or not.
