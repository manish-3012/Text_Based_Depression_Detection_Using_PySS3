Holy shit I really dodged a bullet So I'm sitting on the couch next to my mom who's watching Fox news and I pull out my phone to brows reddit, and whattaya know, I open the app and there damn smack in the middle of my screen is some fairly explicit porn I was watching. I close out as fast as I can and look up and luckily my mom didn't notice.  I live in a super religious christian family and if anyone found, especially my mom, I would've been dead.
