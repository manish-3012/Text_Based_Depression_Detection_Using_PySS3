What would you like to change in our school systems? Hey, i am a student from switzerland and i have to make my thesis about a modern school system. 

So what would you like in a modern school? What should stay the same? What does a modern school need? What should students learn? 

Thanks for taking the time, it realy means alot to me. :)
