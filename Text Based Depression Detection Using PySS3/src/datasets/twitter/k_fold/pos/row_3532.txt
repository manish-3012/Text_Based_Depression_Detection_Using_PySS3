Girls donâ€™t like me because Iâ€™m â€œtoo normalâ€ I live in Wyoming so it hurts more since I have to deal with the same ppl every year. 

I donâ€™t have a job, I donâ€™t do sports, I donâ€™t have â€œrich clothesâ€, Iâ€™m not a country boy, and I donâ€™t have curly hair or a fucking mullet (why the fuck do mullets make ppl attractive?)

If you were to imagine a blonde 5â€™5 teen with cargo shorts who doesnâ€™t have that much muscle, thatâ€™s basically me. Iâ€™m too regular for any dumb bitch here and Iâ€™m fucking tired of it. Iâ€™m not even a band kid for fucks sake.
