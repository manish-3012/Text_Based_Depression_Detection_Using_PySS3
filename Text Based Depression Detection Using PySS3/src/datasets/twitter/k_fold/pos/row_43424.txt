i donâ€™t know where to post this but am i the only one who feels like this? i play video games, and i tell people i play video games if they ask. then theyâ€™ll tell me they like the same games as me, and that they want to play with me. i should say yes and be happy to agree, right? but then why am i kinda mad or hesitant to play with them?

iâ€™ve always played games alone. games, to me, is a way to escape everything and be in a fictional world where i can be what i want and do what i want, so its a personal thing to me. and when someone wants to join me, i feel like theyâ€™re invading my personal space. 

i also end up never sharing a lot about the games iâ€™m playing (now that i think about it this applies for shows and pretty much everything i do) because i donâ€™t want them to initiate bonding with me through the game. and when my friends find out something i like, i end up dropping it because itâ€™s like theyâ€™re found a big secret of mine so i should reject it. 

i feel kinda dumb for feeling this way and i just wanna know if iâ€™m the only one.
