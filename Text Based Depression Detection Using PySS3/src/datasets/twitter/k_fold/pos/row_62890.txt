My boyfriend's brother has COVID-19, and we hung out two days ago.       I'm really nervous that I might have it. I'll be quarantining, obviously, but I'm more nervous that I gave it to my brothers or my parents. My parents both have gotten the vaccine, but my mom has a heart problem and most likely wouldn't be able to survive. I couldn't live with myself if she died. I'm just so scared.
