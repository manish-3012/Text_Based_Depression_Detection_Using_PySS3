I feel like younger me was a horrible person lol So around two years ago I was doing a project early in the morning for my science class. I was at school and when I was done, I picked up a few scraps on the floor. The teacher rewarded me with starbursts thinking I was going to pick up the rest of the scraps in her room but, I just left. Leaving the rest of the scraps on the floor and taking the starbursts with me.
