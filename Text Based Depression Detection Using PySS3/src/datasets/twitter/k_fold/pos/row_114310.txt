How do I find someone from school online? **TL;DR:** Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve had this boy on my mind quite a lot lately. Iâ€™ve never met him but Iâ€™ve only seen/heard positive things about him. This is rare because there are few people at my school who I can even tolerate. Iâ€™d really like to get to know him, but, because Iâ€™m doing online school, I donâ€™t know how to find him. Iâ€™d like to get to know him sooner than later. I know what he looks like but donâ€™t know his name. How could I find him to talk to him (preferably online)?

Thereâ€™s a couple people from school who Iâ€™ll see in the hallways or who Iâ€™ll have classes who Iâ€™d really like to get to know. The things is, I have social anxiety and struggle to approach people in real life. Through texting wouldnâ€™t be as hard. Thereâ€™s one person in particular who comes to mind. Recently, Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve been thinking about him more than I do, well, anyone else from school except for my friends.  

I havenâ€™t said a word to him. He probably doesnâ€™t even know I exist. The closest Iâ€™ve ever gotten to him is sitting at the same table at lunch on the first day of school. I didnâ€™t pay too much attention to him then, but now (or at least when I was still in school... thanks coronavirus) he catches my eye in the hallways. I know heâ€™s friends or at least was friends with a close friend of mines sister. Iâ€™ve never had a class with him. I think heâ€™s a year above me (Iâ€™m going to be a sophomoreâ€” heâ€™ll be a junior). Iâ€™d like to talk to him but I donâ€™t know how. I was thinking about asking this close friend but it may sound weird. 

I have the feeling that I really, really want to be friends with him or get to know him, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s more than that. Iâ€™ve never had a crush before and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m starting to crush or not. Iâ€™ve actually worried about it (never having a crush) a lot during these past couple months (thanks quarantine mental health). I think Iâ€™m demisexual (must get to know someone and develop a connection with them before feeling romantic/sexual attraction towards them), but itâ€™s probably too early to tell. Anyways, my heart doesnâ€™t flutter or anything, but I feel a comfort wash over me and I start to daydream a bit. Itâ€™s hard to see myself dating anyone right now, but I can see myself with him more than I can everyone else. 

I mean, Iâ€™ve thought about a future partner and he seems to have a lot of the same qualities. We have (some of) the same views (I know heâ€™s a part of the LGBTQ+ and straight alliance club (which, once again, is rare around here)â€” no heâ€™s not gay), heâ€™s intelligent, heâ€™s a sweetheart, heâ€™s funny, we have similar music taste, he seems to respect women as human beings and not objects (which is rare for my school), and more. Heâ€™s pretty cute too. Honestly heâ€™s shares a lot of the same qualities physically with my future â€œdream partnersâ€, too. The thing is, one of his most attractive qualities will be my downfall. He adores and respects his girlfriend so, so much. He talks about her all the time (I could tell when we sat at lunch together) and in a very respectful way. Normally Iâ€™m annoyed by this but it was so genuine that I couldnâ€™t even get mad. I mean, his girlfriend is pretty cool too. Iâ€™d like to get to know her too as we seem pretty similar but, if Iâ€™d have to get to know one, Iâ€™d like to know him.

I think Iâ€™d be okay with just staying friends because he just seems like a fun guy to be around and someone Iâ€™d like in my life. Anyways, sorry, I know you didnâ€™t ask for my life story, but maybe someoneâ€™s dealing with something similar...?
