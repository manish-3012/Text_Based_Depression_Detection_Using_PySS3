My dad was like â€œyou have headaches because of that phoneâ€ And i was (in my head) like: dad, first of all, what can i do otherwise? Stare at the wall? I have no friends to hang out with and no girlfriend to go to... i am lonely and a phone is the only thing that keeps me from being bored... 

Second, u really think that damm phone is the reason? I mean its so fucking stressful in school and im dealing with a lot of social axienty and bad mental health... school is so energy taking for me and when i need to go to swim practice before school 4 times in a week im fucking tired (and 3 practices in the evenings)

Third, ive been diagnosed with migrane and on a average day i take 4 pain killers to keep me from being sick...
