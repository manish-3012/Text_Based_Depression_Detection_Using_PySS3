A girl asked me for pictures When I told her no, she got upset and called me gross before blocking me. She tried to make it look like I initiated the convo, but I made sure to take screenshots before she hit â€œunsendâ€ on her messages. 

Sending those texts out felt good. It felt weird having to prove my innocence but whatever, she brought it on herself. Revenge is underrated. Societyâ€™s absolutely merciless with this kind of stuff when youâ€™re being accused. A friend of mine was falsely accused of you-know-what and our entire senior class turned on him. When the truth came out and it became known that the accuser consented to the act, no one really cared. Protect yourselves, people, especially if youâ€™re a guy. Itâ€™s not a pretty world
