I hate myself I fucking hate myself. I hate my image, hate what I ask and what I like, hate how others look and feel about me. I feel like everyone shouts ignore me and never speak to me, cause then at least I wonâ€™t get guilt tripped for not doing something. I hate how I feel when I see something terrible in game. I hate how I have a dislike for horror but everyone else does.
