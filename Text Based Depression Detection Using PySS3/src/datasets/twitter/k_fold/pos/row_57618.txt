Johnny Depp supporters are just as bad as Amber Heard supporters. You all took Amber's side when this drama first started, then once the phone call was leaked you swapped sides because you don't want to be wrong.

Im not even surprised, the entire internet did this exact thing with ProJared and James Charles in 2018/2019.

The reason Depp was fired from Warner Bros is because everyone was attacking him until the call leaked, downvote me to hell but you know I'm right.
