One of my best friends mightâ€™ve just logged off for the last time Fact about me I have abandonment issues so I ainâ€™t taking this all to well.

Iâ€™m the only one she hasnâ€™t blocked which is good but Iâ€™m scared.  I knew she had a small case of depression but I think itâ€™s gotten worse.  I need someone to talk to.
