my opinion on meme stealing (i saw a post on r/memes where someones meme got stolen. i would have told them this straight up but i didnt want to get yelled at by the entire sub)

meme stealing isnt bad

memes are meant to be stolen. thats how they get spread around. although its nice to give credit nobody really cares where you got the meme from 

i know some people will say "Memes are like art! why would you want people to steal art?" theyre both right and wrong

memes are something we make, yes. but if you want credit then just put a watermark somewhere on it like artists usually do

also, memes are just edited pictures. ive seen people just turn on subtitles for a movie, screenshot a scene, then put a "HasHTaG ReLAtaBLe" caption on it. art takes time. it can take hours, or even days to finish something
