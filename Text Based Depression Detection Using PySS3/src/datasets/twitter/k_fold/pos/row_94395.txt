What should I do? Hi guys my name is Logan, Iâ€™m 13 male, and have been having a rough time lately, by lately I mean for 3 years. My parents have started to fight a lot on July 2nd 2017 and itâ€™s been going on for so long, my mom doesnâ€™t like my dad, and just yells at him a ton, she isnâ€™t okay at all clearly, because she gets mad over small things, or nothing at all. The reason for this is because my mom was on heavy drugs for 20 years recovering from 5 surgeries. I donâ€™t remember much but it was hard for her, she recently got off and has been acting mean, and crazy, she said some awful things lately, and I donâ€™t know what to do, what should I do, please help.
