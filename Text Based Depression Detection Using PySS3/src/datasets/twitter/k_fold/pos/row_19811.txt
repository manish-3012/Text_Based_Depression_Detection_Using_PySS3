When my dog died, and my dad blamed it on me Now, I love dogs. I have always enjoyed there company, rather they like it or not. We used to have 4 dogs at once. The first dog was named Charlie. He was a very small dog, he had lots of anxiety, and he absolutely HATED interaction with other dogs. He was eventually given away to an older couple, and I am extremely happy knowing that he probably has a better life now.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, years later we get 2 more dogs, they are German Shepard pit bull mixes. One was named Donut, she was the girl of the group, she was basically a full on German Shepard with her looks, and the other is Flash, the big gentle giant of the group, he is way more chill than donut, so I used to always sit down and play Skyrim with him laying down by me. A few months after they where adopted, we got another dog on August 13th. He was a puppy, probably a full bred pit bull, but to this day, he doesn't have the size of a pit bull. Why is that? Well he was sitting outside of the school we go to, starving, and almost guaranteed he was going to die if he didn't get to safety within a few hours. He was adopted, and thus he became the cool guy he is today.

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the story. It was May of last year, and my dad was really keen on making Flash and Donut outside dogs. It was extremely hot that year. I made sure to play with the dogs everyday, and spend time with them. They where outside 24/7. I would sometimes spill a gallon of water over them so they would stay cool, also it would make the flies stop attacking them for a little while. They really appreciated it.

&amp;#x200B;

May comes. My sister feeds Donut, and she gives her water, she drinks so much, she even throws up. My sister told me about that, I look up why that is. I assumed the worst, and I begged, and even got grounded because I yelled at my dad, trying to get her back inside. Ultimately, that same day, she died.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few days, and my dad begins to act up. He says that she died due to spider bites. Now, at face value, that may be believable, but when you begin to think about it, it made no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\-She displayed literally 0 signs of a spider bite-She was perfectly normal up until that morning, when it got extremely hot-Her fur is so thick, that a spider would have a hard time biting her more than anyone else

&amp;#x200B;

A few days pass, my dad forces me into an argument for literally nothing as he usually does. I just agree with all of the bullshit that comes out of his mouth, because the alternative is worse. Then he says something that really set me off:

&amp;#x200B;

"Maybe if you had cut the grass, no spider would have been able to kill Donut"

&amp;#x200B;

This made me very close to actually wanting to break him. The lawn mower had no gas, I couldnt even cut the lawn, and to add on, she's outside, tied to a large tree 24/7. Cut grass would not have reduced the chance of a spider biting her, even if it did. His lack of care was the reason she died, but he wanted to blame me, somebody who is still very sensitive to her, as it was a few days past.

&amp;#x200B;

These days, the remaining dogs, Flash and Rocky just sit inside of the cage all day, because he will not allow us to take them out, and let them play upstairs. I dont have much input on the situation, but I do the best that I can, by when they are assigned to go outside and pee, and keep them out there and play with them for a long time. To this day, the dogs still like me more than anyone else in the family. I miss the days where me and Flash could just chill, and probably fall asleep together, as I play skyrim, and pet him.
