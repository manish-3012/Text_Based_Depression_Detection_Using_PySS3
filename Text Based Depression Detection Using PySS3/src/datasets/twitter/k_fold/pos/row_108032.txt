What do you think I should do? So there's this girl that liked me 2 years ago. I like her now again and I think she likes me too but in the same time my friend likes her and many people say that she likes him. I lost too many opportunities so I think I should just tell her and see her reaction. Anyway, do you think I should try to get close to her slowly, with the risk of she dating my friend or should I just confess?
