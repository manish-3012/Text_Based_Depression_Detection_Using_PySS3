I'm convinced my school wants to kill me. I barely passed AP  last year and now they decide to put me in another AP course along with Pre Calc Honors, out of everything else. (I took Algebra 1 last year but normally i would move on to Geometry or Trigonometry like a regular student but they decided for me to skip 2 math courses) The fuck is this bullshit???
