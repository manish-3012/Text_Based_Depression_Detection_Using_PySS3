AFTER SEVEN YEARS I FINALLY DID IT I killed the Ender Dragon in solo survival for the first time. It's taken about 6 years to build up enough courage to start playing survival, and I finally beat the dragon with no cheats or anything and I'm super proud. I feel like a piece of my childhood has been completed holy crap.
