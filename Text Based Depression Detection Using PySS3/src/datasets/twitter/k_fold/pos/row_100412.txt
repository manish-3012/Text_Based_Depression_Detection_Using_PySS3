I may have just broken an xp farm for 3 others. Oops  sharing this because I thought it was funny and you guys might enjoy it

This has just happened and Iâ€™m curious if other people have had similar experiences.

Iâ€™m on a minecraft SMP with friends and me and 3 others had our own little area until it got partially destroyed so we moved a long while away. There only thing left that functioned was our zombie xp farm which uses a spawner.We usually go on trips back just to get xp from it and itâ€™s been fine.

This leads to today where I was afking to get some in. I leave the afk room to a creeper which then blows up and leaves me on low health. This was not the worst bit as I notice that the creeper blew up the wall that hides the spawner and zombie start pouring out of it. 
I frantically blocked it up the ark room and dug out.

It has not been repaired because it is on hard mode and I am in iron armour and my sword is broke. Me, being the wimp I am, ran up to the surface and logged out.

Here I am stood above a zombie apocalypse underground and we now have no xp farm.

Oops
