My face is burning I guess I'm allergic to make-up because my face gets really red and swollen when I apply it. Today I had to take senior portraits so my mom made me put on some make-up, and my face looks so puffy and now it's BURNING. It sucks because I think make-up looks nice but I think make-up hates my skin :(

Anyway, I'm going to go wash it off now.
