Can someone explain why some things are triggers? Like I swear I can't join any relatable server on discord without weird triggers. Like I have weird one's like fire and the word kitten (due to trauma) but when you see things like:

* character ships
* character names
* emojis
* drinking (I do mean drinking water)
* people's names

and so on- like I get there are uncommon triggers, but things that make you uncomfortable are not triggers. Like someone is not going to change their name just because you don't like it. I don't get it, do people not know what triggers are?
