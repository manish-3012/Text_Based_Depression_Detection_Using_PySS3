I couldnâ€™t use a throwaway because of karma requirements but honestly I just need help First things first. Iâ€™m 13, moved to Texas not long ago. Know barely anybody here apart from school. Anyways, my parents fight a lot. That would be my mom and her husband. It just really stresses me out. They get mad at each other a lot and Iâ€™m tired of pretending like everything is ok. There fighting as Iâ€™m writing this post. And it seems that every time they go out they come back and something is wrong. I mean, in the past, my moms husband has beat her and gotten the cops called on him. And as it turns out when he gets drunk he gets aggressive. And honestly, it scares me to think that it could happen again. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and it stresses me out. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my mom but that does nothing. Honestly what should I do. I want to turn to the school counselor but I donâ€™t know if I should even be involved. I have no one to turn to. Idk anymore.
