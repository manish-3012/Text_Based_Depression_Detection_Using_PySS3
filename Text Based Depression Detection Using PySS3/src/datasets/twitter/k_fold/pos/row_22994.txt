School has me so stressed I almost put collage instead of college. 
I have literally sat here and made either straight Aâ€™s or Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s for my entire K-12 career but for what? Because my parents wanted me to and were always up my ass about school? 

Iâ€™m literally dumb as a fÃ¼cking rock but I stay up past midnight to get my work done and I basically memorize everything for tests and assessments but after that I donâ€™t understand or remember anything. 

Now, here I am about to graduate high school and I donâ€™t even think I want to go to college. I donâ€™t want to put myself through that stress again just to get a degree to satisfy my parents. I want to do something else, I want to do more with my life.
