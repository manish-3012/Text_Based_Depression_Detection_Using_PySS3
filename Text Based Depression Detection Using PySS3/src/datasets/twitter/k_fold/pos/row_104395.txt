Thank you I wanted to say thank you to everyone here in new, thank you for the encouragement and help for the past 3 years. I finally did it, I finally met a girl I love, who loves me back. I've been lurking with my various accounts for a long time, and I think I've only actually posted on one, but I've spent a lot of time reading through every tip, all of the advice, everything. I just want to say thank you, for the record. I've still got a few years here, and I hope in that time everyone here prospers and blooms. Anyways, just a thank you to you all. I hope 2021 goes well for everyone here :)
