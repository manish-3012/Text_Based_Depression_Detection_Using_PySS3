Here is a line of texts I and my crush just sent to each other. I blocked her number after this, Iâ€™m so done with trying to date people. Context: We had texted this morning, weâ€™ve been BEST friends for a year and a half now, rumors had started in my friend group that she had said she liked me. Then this happened.

Her: (name), I like you.

Me: I like you too!

Her: Ew, why would you say that. 

Her: Sorry, but youâ€™re just not my type, I really donâ€™t like you. 

(PROCEEDS TO DELETE THE FIRST TEXT) 

(PROCEEDS TO TEXT OUR GC THE PICTURE OF MY TEXT AS WELL AS THE PRIOR ONE) 

Her, to GC: (name) just send me this text guys, he had asked me to hang out with him today, I think he might rape me. 

GC proceeds to kick me out, about 15 minutes later they figured out she was lying simply because I said â€œyou too!â€ I had been texting someone in the GC privately that whole time. My fucking god this is the third time Iâ€™ve tried to date someone the first one was using me as bait for someone else and the second one just moved to Montreal without telling anyone one day. 

I hate this
