Well this is stupid My dad forces me and my little sisters to stay downstairs and I canâ€™t disagree with my dad because he would get angry and start yelling like â€œits for your own goodâ€ or â€œstaying in your rooms is not good for you futureâ€ so I just peace and quiet and a bed. God I wish my dad respected me and allows me to stay in my room however I want. I lost all trust in my dad because he makes stupid decisions and get angry at things that happened in the past
