My favorite part about moving out is not having to hear my Mom eat food anymore Yeah I have a very strong aversion to chewing noises. I have nothing against my mom, but she eats like a dog, smacks her lips, and gets offended any time anyone points it out. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s the end of the world but itâ€™s terrible. Also the food she eats fucking stinks, raw onions and stuff

If any of yâ€™all notice you chew with your mouth open next time you eat, do humanity a favor and correct yourself
