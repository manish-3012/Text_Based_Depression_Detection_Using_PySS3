I'm so lonely I can't even get a real friend in a dream I had a dream last night that I met this group of people irl and fell in love with one of them, the next morning in the dream I learn that I got scammed out of my account (probably a sign I'm too soft) in whatever game I was playing in the dream and the people I met weren't even real but actually other people posing as my friends. Then I guess my dream decides it wants me to become their friends as well and so I do but then my dream ends and I'm still as alone as ever
