I propose an idea to the mods: create an "adult visitor" tag Let's be real. We all know that this sub isn't absolutely exclusive to teenagers, and we all love when adults come talk to us and give us advice in this sub. That's why I'm proposing to create the adult visitor tag, because even though this subreddit was created by teenagers for teenagers, sometimes the adults just wanna say hi to us
