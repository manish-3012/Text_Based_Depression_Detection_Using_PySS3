How do you guys pay attention in school? I've never really been able to pay attention in class but  I had finally kinda started listening and taking notes and actually studying for the first time in my life but then covid happened and now, with online school, it's soooo much easier to get distracted!!
I just can't pay attention anymore.

Sometimes I feel like paying attention but I hadn't listened in the previous classes so I'm really lost and then give up and go do other stuff.
And then when we have tests and assignments I'm completely clueless and get terrible grades.
How tf do people pay attention?!?!
