this isnâ€™t r/askreddit, but would you guys like to comment below an underrated artist and a song you like from them? doesnâ€™t matter what kind of genre. even if this artist made it to the radio once or twice, iâ€™ll still count it as an underrated. dont worry dude you wont be judged for listening to that song, as long as it makes you feel something, itâ€™s your stuff. :)
