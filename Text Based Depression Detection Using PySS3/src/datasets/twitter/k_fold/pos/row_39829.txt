Rescinding Job Applications Hey guys, I'm a sophomore and been looking for jobs.

I've had a few jobs before but those were from already being in the scene and during the summer. I've come up with a few ideas for applying to places, i.e Starbucks. I still have thinking to do especially with my school workload, but what's the procedure on submitting applications when I'm not 100% invested yet.

If I get accepted, I'd likely take the job, but if I submit an application and later change my mind even if they accept it before I start the job is it fine to back out?
