My Girlfriend is in the hospital, letâ€™s cheer her up! My girlfriend was recently hospitalized for a kidney infection and sheâ€™s having a pretty rough time.  Because of COVID-19 restrictions nobodyâ€™s allowed to visit her and I really want to cheer her up. Sheâ€™s in a lot of pain and sheâ€™s really exhausted and it breaks my heart seeing her like that.  I think she would really appreciate some positive messages from you amazing people.  Thank you so much.
