men's mental health is taken as a fucking joke. **tl;dr:** i'm not a karmawhore and i don't want your pity, but i want this post to blow up like hell so people can be made aware of how mens mental health is being disregarded and activists only talk about it to get clout, and not because they care about it. 

i saw one of those activist accounts on Instagram make a post about "removing the stigma surronding mens mental health". that same account, three posts earlier, flamed men for having built social constructs that were detrimental to the achievenmt of true equality between women and men, called for the removal of a bunch of legislation, and topped it off with the good ol' "we don't need men anymore if we wanted to reproduce" (the thing about using bone marrow).

i'll tell you something about social constructs. if a girl cries in public, everyone jumps on her to hug her. if a man were to cry in public, people would awkwardly avoid him and pretend he's not there. the reaction to a girl displaying weakness is pity and wanting to give comfort. the reaction to a man displaying weakness is glancing around and hoping he gets over it quick so the awkwardness in the air can clear. true equality cannot be achieved for either side until we treat other equally, and this will never fucking happen until its okay for someone like me to cry and ask for a fucking hug and feel warmth and care and not worry about whether things will be okay or not. 

those instagram accounts? they don't care, man. they only post shit like that to get likes and growth in their page. they don't care about **all** the issues they post about. and to me, any issue that is posted about but not cared about in reality is just something being insulted. 

thanks for the read.
