Quick rant about food I kinda wish I didn't tell my mom my weight, now she's worried about me, and she's making me gain a certain amount of weight in 2 weeks or she won't let me lift weights which is something that makes me happy. It's not like I'm trying to lose weight, I just am having trouble gaining it and she's like making me eat a bunch of food which makes me feel bad and not want to try and gain it
