My Best birthday gift So its my birthday today and the first thing I got was this amazing text

â€œAlrighty, I forgot where I left off last time so Iâ€™m just gonna keep rolling. 

Happy birthday! (Again) I love you so much. Youâ€™re one of the best things that has come into my life, and I am so grateful for you everyday. When I normally write peopleâ€™s happy birthday thingies, itâ€™s very much along the lines of that. But youâ€™re that and so much more. Just seeing your face gives me enough feeling of happiness to go on for eternity. Hearing your laugh is music to my ears. Everyday I wake up and my first thought is you. I see you in my dreams almost every night. Granted, youâ€™re kind of an asshole to me in my dreams, it still makes them the best dreams I have. I want to be with you all the time, and itâ€™s a little scary not gonna lie. But I think thatâ€™s ok. You support me all the time, and itâ€™s the best feeling in the world. I thought I knew what love was, I was right, but this is a whole new level. I donâ€™t think these butterflies in my stomach will ever go away, and Iâ€™m ok with that. Youâ€™re the one person who makes me feel even slightly good about myself. Every time you compliment me, I canâ€™t help but smile. Even though I donâ€™t agree with them, but sometimes they stick a little longer, and give me just the right amount of confidence to not feel awful all the time. I know Iâ€™m not perfect, but you make me want to be the best self I can be. I try now because of you. And thatâ€™s the greatest gift of all time. I love you more than anything, and Iâ€™m eternally grateful for you for the rest of my life. Happy birthday babe. â€œ
