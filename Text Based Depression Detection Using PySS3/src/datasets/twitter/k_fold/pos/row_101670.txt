My mom is blaming me for her divorce but still expects me to do everything for her. My parents are getting a divorce and my mom keeps blaming me for everything, even things that didn't happen, and at the same time she expects me to do things for her which I don't know how to do, such as filling up the car's gas tank (I am underage and never had driving classes) ordering gas, reading her emails etc. I'm already stressed about everything but she just keeps making me feel even worse with the blaming and screaming. I want to go live with my dad but he's currently in a hotel and I'm terrified of talking with my mom about living with my dad.
