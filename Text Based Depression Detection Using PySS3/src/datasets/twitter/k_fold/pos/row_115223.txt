i'm late :| hey! i meant to post this earlier and this probably isn't gonna get a lot of recognition but today i saw a few people who didn't have anywhere to go for thanksgiving and i think it's such a shame that things like that can happen. but anyways i hope everyone had a great thanksgiving and enjoyed their time with family :)
