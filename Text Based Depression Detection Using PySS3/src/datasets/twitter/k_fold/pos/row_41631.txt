My quarantine project Sup guys?
So I have a question: would you join a discord server to meet new people without leaving your home during quarantine?

Both my parents tested positive, so I canâ€™t leave my house for about 2 weeks, and I need something to spend my time with. Then I came up with meeting new people because Iâ€™ve hardly seen anyone since the whole corona thing started. So I want to make a discord server for playing games, hanging out or whatever you wanna do. But it feels kinda pointless to set up a whole server for just me. So I kinda want some assurance that at least somebody will join.

Yeah I think thats all I wanted to say, so let me know.

See ya!
