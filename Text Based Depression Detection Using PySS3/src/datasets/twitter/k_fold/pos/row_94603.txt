I have no motivation for life. I don't care about applying for college. I don't care about  getting my driver's license. I don't care about finding a girlfriend (I never will anyways). I don't care about having a family one day (I won't be able to anyways). I don't care about my current failing grades. I just do not care about anything.

Hopefully this misery ends soon.
