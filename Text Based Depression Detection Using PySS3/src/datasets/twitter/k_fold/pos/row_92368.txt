My girlfriends mom wont let her see me, and it sucks. Its kinda draining me. It was easier not having a girlfriend, but now i have one and cant see her in person when she lives in my city. Iâ€™ve seen her once in the last 5 months. Itâ€™s kinda fucking me up a bit and now im at a new school while shes doing online school, so not like we go to the same school. It sucks and its draining me.
