I wanna ask my mom if itâ€™s okay for me to have a boyfriend. How do I ask her without sounding suspicious? I have a boyfriend and Iâ€™ve been keeping him a secret but I want to ask my mom if she thinks itâ€™s okay for me to have a boyfriend at this age. I donâ€™t want her to suspect anything so how do I ask her?
