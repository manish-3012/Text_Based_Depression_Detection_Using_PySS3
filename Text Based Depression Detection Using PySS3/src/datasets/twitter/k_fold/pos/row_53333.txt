I have given up hope on getting a gf or bf and just want to give up on life. I really want someone to hold me tight and cuddle me but I have social anxiety and so I'm scared of doing things like starting convos and do anything really with other people. I don't even know anyone I could have a chance with. I'm screwed. 

Idk what to do i just wanna give up and cry. Except I can't get myself to cry from anything but pain and so I have all this emotion to let out and i just want to give up and waste away. Idk why I'm even posting but I am.
