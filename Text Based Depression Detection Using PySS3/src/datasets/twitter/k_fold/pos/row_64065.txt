Day 4 of walking away from a toxic friendship: Genuine happiness Today, I woke up feeling genuinely happy and healthy. For the first time in weeks, maybe even months. I'd been so reliant on her for happiness for so long that I never really took the time just to enjoy the little things or to relax. She wanted it that way, she wanted me to rely on her for happiness because she knew then I wouldn't walk away because I would be too scared of losing that happiness. 

Had she taken the time to know me, truly know me, she would've realized that she was wrong. She would've seen that I'm not afraid of losing happiness, that I don't let my emotions control my life. She would've seen that I'm nobody's obedient little dog like she thought I was.
