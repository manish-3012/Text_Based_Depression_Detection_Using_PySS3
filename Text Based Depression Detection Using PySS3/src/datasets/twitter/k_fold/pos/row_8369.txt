I need to vent. My dad has no respect for my privacy, and I hate it. My dad has no respect for my privacy, and looks through my phone whenever he feels like it. I HATE THIS. He started doing this after I was hanging out with some of his friends and his kids, and the kids kept begging for my phone, and I kept saying no. I texted something along the lines of "they're so fucking annoying" to one of the older kids, and the kids got mad I was being secretive, so my dad just decided to look through my phone that night, and flipped out the next day. So now, I have to delete the texts that are slightly NSFW. And he STILL looks through my phone, even though this incident happened a year ago. I posted about this on r/AmItheAsshole but got banned for posting from the point of view from my parents. I just needed to vent.
