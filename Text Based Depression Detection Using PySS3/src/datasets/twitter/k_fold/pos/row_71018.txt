I think I'm on love I've been struggling with Depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since I remember even as a little kid it sounds crazy but it's true. My dad died when I was 3 and My mom is an asshole bitch who would beat me mercilessly and I still get flashbacks and trauma to this day like she'd give me bruises that would stay for months. Last October I tried to hang myself and all I needed to do was kick down the stepladder but I never went through with it cus I'm a pussy ass bitch

I've been lonely and friendess for most of my life but recently I met this absolutely fucking amazing girl and whenever I'm with her it's like all that stuff goes away and the other day we were walking around together and she grabbed my hand and began holding it and it made me feel all fuzzy and warm inside and I realized I've literally been deprived of human contact for so long and it felt so good and she said I made her feel protected and safe and that was the best thing anyone has ever said to me and I literally wanted to cry. today she moved in with her moms for a week cus her parents are divorced and school is still close and I won't see her for a whole nother week and I miss her so bad fuuuuck. She keeps telling me she misses me and she wants to cuddle and fall asleep in my arms and tbh I do too.

On Monday she's hanging out at a friend's house and I'm invited and we're prolly just gonna get high and chill out for a bit so I'm planning on asking her to be my girlfriend that day. We've both acknowledged that there's obvious chemistry between us but idk my dumbass was scared of getting into a relationship and getting my heart broken because I've never had any good experiences with girls in the past so I said let's just be friends for now but fuck it you miss 100% of the shots you don't take so imma just go for it.
