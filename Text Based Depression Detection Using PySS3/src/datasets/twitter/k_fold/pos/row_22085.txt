I miss england I moved to spain almost a year ago, i love it here but i do really miss england.

I miss being able to talk to people.

I miss the atmosphere.

I miss being able to find a mcdonalds or a subway or really any fast food place wherever i go.

I miss all of the brand shops that i could recognize.

I dont really miss the unusually high chance of getting stabbed but i guess thats just a part of the experience.

Thats really all this post is about, see ya.
