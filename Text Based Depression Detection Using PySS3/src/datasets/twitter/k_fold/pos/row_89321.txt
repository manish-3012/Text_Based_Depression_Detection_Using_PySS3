A whole bunch of people have a video of me vortexing a beer at a party. At the start of the year at a party, I vortexed a beer whilst a whole bunch of people were putting shit on their Snapchat stories. So for a few months, I didn't really think anything of it. However, now I'm kinda regretting it. Apparently, an absolute SHIT ton of people screen recorded it. If this is released publicly, am I going to get in trouble (legal, or with the school)? Will it decrease my chance of getting a job in the future? I just realized this and I'm SUPER anxious as I feel like it'll reflect badly on me, as I'm on my way to getting dux.
