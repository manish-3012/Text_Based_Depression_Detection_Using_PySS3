Hey everyone, just wanted to get some stuff of my chest. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. Hey everyone, sorry if this is the wrong place for this but I just wanted to chat I guess.

Over the last few months, I've kept feeling sadder and sadder, I struggle sleeping, I can't eat without feeling guilty and it just feels like nothing makes me happy any more.  I think I might have depression but I don't think I'm qualified to make that decision.

I feel like I'm not allowed to feel sad because I come from a very middle-class background and I feel like there are a lot of people that have much less than me and are fine living their day to day lives.

I always feel like I'm useless and the only thing I'm good at is making everyone around me sad. I also feel like everyone is judging me constantly.

That's all the relevant information I can think of for now. I'll add more to this post if I can think of anything. Feel free to give advice or ask question in the comments (I'll respond if I feel comfortable answering it). 


Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope you have a nice day.
