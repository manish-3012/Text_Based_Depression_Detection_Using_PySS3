How long should you wait to get in a relationship with your crush after a breakup? A friend of mine's crush became single a few months ago. They (my friend and her crush) both like each other, but she thinks his break up was too recent to get with him, because she doesn't want to be a rebound or something like that. How long would you guys say is a good amount of time to wait? For a bit of background information, the guy was with his ex for about two years I think.

Edit: Seems to be bit of confusion. My friend isn't the ex. I'm sorry that I wrote this weirdly but I really don't know how to write. I'll try to write it more clearly. I'm going to give these people fake names this time. My friend will now be Jane, her crush will be Jake, and his ex is Jennifer.

It has been a few months since Jake and Jennifer broke up. Jane and Jake both like each other, but Jake was in the relationship with his ex for over 2 years. Jennifer broke up with him pretty suddenly, and he's still sad about it. How much longer should Jane wait to make sure that Jake had enough time to be ok and recover?
