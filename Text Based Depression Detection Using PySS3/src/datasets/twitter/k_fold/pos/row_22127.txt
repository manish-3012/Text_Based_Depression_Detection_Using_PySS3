So, how fucked am I? The other day I was biking along a trail when I had an accident and while I was checking over my bike and myself to see if everything was still attached properly, I realized my bike chain got fucked up. An old guy stopped to help me try to fix it for about 10-15 minutes but was unsuccessful. While he did this we were definitely not 6 feet apart (helmets bumped each other a couple times). Today is 3 days later and Iâ€™m feeling a lot of fatigue and my head feels sort of weird. Should I be worried?

Ik this isnâ€™t the best sub for medical advice but idk where tf else to post...
