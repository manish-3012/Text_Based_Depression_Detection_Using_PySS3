I think I should appreciate life a bit more now.. Today I had one of my closest encounters with death, didn't feel this much adrenaline in a while, guess I needed that to feel alive anyway

Today's morning we were packing up to move to another city. When we finished packing the truck with furniture my dad remembered the satellite dish, so I went up to the roof (we live in a 5 storey building) to remove it. After removing all the screws I started pulling it, it had some rust on it so it was stuck. I pulled it with all I got untill it finally popped out.

I got knocked back pretty far, and when I turned around I realized that I was standing 5cm away from the edge of the roof. That's when I started breathing heavily and losing balance, but fortunately enough I latched onto another dish (our neighbour's) and got myself back as far away from the edge as I possibly could. I thought I fucked up the poor guy's channels or something (the dish moved a bit) so I told him and begged him not to mention it in front of my parents, thankfully he understood.

The moral of the story is don't be a dumbass like me, plan your moves before doing anything. And you know what? Appreciate life more, it can end at any moment.. now I know that for sure.
