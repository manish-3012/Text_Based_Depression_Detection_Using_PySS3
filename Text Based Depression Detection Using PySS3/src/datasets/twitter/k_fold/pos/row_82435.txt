Wanted ask yâ€™all something. So I have a friend. Heâ€™s trans, f to m. And heâ€™s telling me storyâ€™s of how his dick gets hard. How he fucks with it and how he got someone pregnant in 8th grade. I call bs, itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t respect his right of being trans but because correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but a trans man canâ€™t get a women pregnant, and that you need special things to get the penis hard. And I kinda feel like an ass for not being him. Itâ€™s just hard to believe. Iâ€™ll continue to play along so they feel comfortable about it but I wanted rant a little and ask yâ€™all if youâ€™ve experienced this or if what they are saying is even possible.
