let me rant about something in regards to self harm as someone who has struggled with mental health and self harm before, i can say if someone wants to cut, they'll cut or hurt themselves in some way. It doesn't matter what you tell them so why not give them advice so they don't have to worry about hiding scars or getting an infection?

you guys are honestly hilarious because "hey, don't cut stop pls oh no" doesn't help anyone or fix the problem. this fantasy soft mindset doesn't help anyone and it needs to stop. Actually help them so they don't lose a limb or get embarrassed for what they're dealing with instead of trying to be nice and shaming people for giving them advice that will actually benefit them. Everyone knows self harm isn't okay so cut the shit.
