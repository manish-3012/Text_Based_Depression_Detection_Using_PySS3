As much as I love living ina small country.... ...It is *impossible* to find anything here. From material things to clubs to resources. I have a very specific issue: going to an international school, I want to participate in academic competitions because they can get me into university. However, they all assume that the school will prepare you and guide you. Well sike! they don't even respond to my emails. I have to do everything on my own and I cannot find any place on the internet that will offer advice or resources I could use to prepare. The competition is high but the scale is small :(
