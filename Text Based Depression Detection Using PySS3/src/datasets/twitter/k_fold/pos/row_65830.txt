What is the best fruit cup? And should they be eaten with or without the spoon? Personally I like mandarins alot, and I dont eat without the spoon. Just tip it back and let it flow in.  Though this is subject to change if I learn of a grape fruit cup. 

There is but one rule for this discussion. No vegetables.
