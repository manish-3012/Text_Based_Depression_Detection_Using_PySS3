I just don't know what to do anymore My crush just asked my friend out(a reallly good friend) and it just really hurts even tho she rejected him because I'd feel bad

The thing is, he knows I like him. So, he's basically choosing someone over me :( 

Also, he apologized cause he knows how I feel rn but I jus left him on read..I can't deal with his shit
