Do not fuck girls This is probably gonna get downvoted into oblivion, but I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k6mpvt/fuck_girls/) on the front page this afternoon. My opinion on this topic pretty much be summed up as "no."

Let's take this point-for-point, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Girls always say guys never open up - and when we do, they fucking tell their friends, and they all laugh. Every single girl Iâ€™ve talked to, I eventually open up a bit, and the moment I open up, they tell their friends and they all laugh.*

If they do this... they suck. That's all. This isn't a female thing, it's an asshole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Itâ€™s even fucking worse when Iâ€™m just trying to be friends with a girl - they think I have a crush on them, because Iâ€™m trying to get to know them better.*

If every girl you try to become friends with thinks you're interested, you're probably doing something to make them think you're interested. Most teenage girls, at least in my experience, are actually super happy to make more guy friends, and often value those relationships more than those with their female friends. Which is really sad, but that's another topic entirely, so I'll try not to get too sidetracked.

&gt;*Than they tell their friends, and they fucking laugh. HOW THE FUCK they gonna laugh, but when sheâ€™s messaging me sheâ€™s actually interested in what I have to say. HOW THE FUCK is she gonna send me pictures of herself, wave n smile, and even add me to her private story - and after all that, fucking laugh.*

I'm sorry. That does sound like it sucks. But again, it's really more of an asshole thing. And to a certain extent, boys do that too, maybe even worse - you'll be super sweet and funny on your own, but become warm toilet seats of the highest order around your friends.

You're just hanging out with the wrong girls.

And honestly, if you assume every girl you meet is an insensitive dirt bag, that may be part of the issue.
