When a girl kicks a boy in the balls hard for no GOOD reason, why should he not give her a hard punch in the fucking face for it once he can stand again? And how is this not sexual violence and humiliation? When girls do this outside of self defense, it is CLEARLY intended as that, and to violate and humiliate him AS a male, and for some sick satisfaction in doing it as a girl.
