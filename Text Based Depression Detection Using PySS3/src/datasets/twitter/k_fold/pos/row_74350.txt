Isnâ€™t guys wearing skirts already normalized? Like, no one is gonna rip off your skirt if you wore one. Sure, theyâ€™d make fun of you but getting made fun of for wearing something different *IS* normal. People would make fun of you for wearing the wrong colored khakis. If youâ€™re that insecure about wearing a skirt that you canâ€™t take criticism, then just donâ€™t wear a skirt or even complain about it not being normalized.
