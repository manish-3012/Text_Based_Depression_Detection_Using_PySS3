The silent treatment is petty and immature So, me and my girlfriend got into a fight over the stupidest of things. She said that I had "broken her trust ". Now I know that it hurt her and yes I apologized and asked for a second chance to prove my apology true. But now she's saying she can't ever trust me again and that we're just good as done. It wasn't cheating for anyone asking, it was a screen shot of a chat. I didn't send the screen shot to anyone I had just kept it for myself. I had made a mistake i recognize that.....but she won't. I'm going through some serious shit in life rn so I haven't been thinking clearly lately, and she knows that. She even told me a few days before this fight that "everyone makes mistakes " and now that I made a mistake, I must be exempt from that cause apparently I'm expected to be perfect and can't make simple mistakes. Its as if the countless hours on phone calls and ft and love texts ment NOTHING to her. Its bullshit. I immediately apologized and was respectful and even told her that I wanted to rebuild her trust, but now im some sort of monster that doesn't deserve a second chance. Its as if she lied every time she said she loved me. Now she's ignoring my texts and is dry and won't let us work it out and get over it. What makes it worse is that we're long distance. 

I thought this girl was sweet and kind and had a big heart, but now im starting to doubt that. If you really love someone, that love will make up for anything that they do, you'll find a way to forgive them and fix things. That's how relationships last. 

I just don't know what to do, im scared of losing her, and I dont want to fuck up anything. Any advice?
