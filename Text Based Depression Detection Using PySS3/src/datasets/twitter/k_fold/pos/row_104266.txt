I don't know how to talk to depressed people anymore I used to be able to cheer them up and let them smile and forget for a little and now I just can't. Everyone seems so down and I don't seem to be saying the right things anymore. 

I'm worried about my friends and I don't want to hurt them. 

I fucking suck at being there for people.
