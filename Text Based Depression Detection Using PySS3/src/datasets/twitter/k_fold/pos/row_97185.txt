Day 12 of posting quotes because I have nothing else to do I guess. "I was raised in squalor, and I've seen a lot of lowlifes. My nose knows the difference between good and bad. And this guy stinks worse than a pile of puke! I've never met a man as wicked as him! Your upbringing made you a villain, you say? It didn't!! ... You've been evil since your birth!" - Robert E.O. Speedwagon from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
