MY GARDEN IS GROWING AND MAKING ME HAPPY In March my mom and I decided to make a garden in our yard with basic stuff like beans, corn, melons and tomatoes. 

First we had to dig plots in our yard. It was really hard because our soil is full of rocks which my back hurt a lot.

After filling them with usable soil we planted the seeds and it felt like such an accomplishment because it took two weeks to get to this point.

AND FINALLY EVERYTHING IS FULLY GROWN. I know it doesn't sound like much just to have some plants growing, but it really helped me by giving me something to do. 

I fully recommend growing plants if you have the ability to.
