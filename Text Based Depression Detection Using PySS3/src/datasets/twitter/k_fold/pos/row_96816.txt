Help me lose weight Iâ€™m 5â€™ 4â€, 14 years old, 219 pounds. And can barely do one pull-up in a row. For every little speech bubble, Iâ€™ll do 5 pull-ups. Exactly 24 hours after this post, Iâ€™ll do 5 times the number of pull-ups that there are little speech bubbles, by 2021. Wish me luck. No red trees. Just speech bubbles.
