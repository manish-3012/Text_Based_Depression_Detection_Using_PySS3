â€œLate is lateâ€ My teacher has a â€œlate is lateâ€ attitude and hates grading late work. Unfortunately I am a lazy procrastinating piece of shit and my big project was due 8 minutes ago. I decided not to rush it and turn it in tomorrow and at least pretend I didnâ€™t know when it was due. Iâ€™m getting a bad grade now either way but at least I can tell myself and my parents that I got a bad grade on a good report. 

Wish me luck.
