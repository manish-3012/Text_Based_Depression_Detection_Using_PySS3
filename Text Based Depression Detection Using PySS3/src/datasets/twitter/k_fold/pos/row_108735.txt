So Boom My girl went to the local department store, saw a jumbo teddy bear, sent me a pic saying OMG I love it. This makes me kind of HAVE to buy it for Christmas, and thatâ€™s fine. The problem is, I feel like thatâ€™s not enough. What should I get? And is food a good idea, (She saw a commercial about some cookie box and she â€˜wantsâ€™ it)?we been together for a bit over 2 months. Any advice on what I should grab? Something not too expensive
