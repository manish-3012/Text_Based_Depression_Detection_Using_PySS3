About the black people can be racist thing on this sub  Everybody knows, this itâ€™s not a hot take. And when half the comments are people circle-jerking  about how white people are the real oppressed race it makes me pissed. Everybody outside Twitter knows that everybody can be racist.

Yâ€™all donâ€™t have to deal with half the shit my parents deal with while working in the south.

You didnâ€™t get your ass sat down at 9 and  told exactly how to act when pulled over so you donâ€™t get shot.

your mom doesnâ€™t make you promise to never wear a hoody outside at night.

Everybody knows that all people can be racist, so maybe if we stopped treating it like such a â€œcontroversial â€œ hot take it would be more accepted
