Girls please I need your advice... Please donâ€™t laugh, Iâ€™m already embarrassed enough I canâ€™t do this but can you encourage me to put a tampon in? Maybe some advice on how to do it easy without feeling it go in. Every time I try I get really scared and tear up. Iâ€™m unsure why I do this and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s normal. Again, please refrain from laughing! Also, if youâ€™re wondering why Iâ€™m asking a bunch of strangers about this itâ€™s because I never really had a mother to teach me about this stuff, so this is my only choice. Thanks!
