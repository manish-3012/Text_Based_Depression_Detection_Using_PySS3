Tommorow I turn 20 Tomorrow I turn 20 and I am going to stop participating in r/teenagers. I am still going to be in here I'm just not going to comment or post. 

I just want to say that I am so thankful that in the last 1 1/2 years on Reddit that you all have truly made it special for me. I have been able to laugh with you, I have cried along with you who have lost someone close and there isn't another sub like it. I have never felt so close to others when I was going through a difficult time or when others needed help. I'm currently in my sophomore year of college and I'm struggling so in these past few days every post has been helping me. 

You guys and gals truly mean the world to me and I really don't want to stop participating and interacting with you all. Although I never really posted here just reading your stories would brighten up my day more than anything else.

I'm making this as a farewell so I can talk with all of you one last time before I go. I love you all and I hope that life is good to you all because it will only get more difficult as we go on but it is important now that you all have each other. 

Thank you allâ¤ï¸
