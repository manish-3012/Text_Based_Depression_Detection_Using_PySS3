OK I have kind of a serious question do they not give yiu mail metal cutlery For lunch at public schools or something? Cause I saw a story about someone getting expelled for bringing a butter knife to school today and you know at my prep school literally they gave us metal silverware to eat with it was no big deal of someone brought a butter knife or a knife to cut a birthday cake or something to school as long as the parent or you gave it to the teacher 1st thing if you brought a cake or something for your birthday nobody ever got in trouble for having metal cutlery at least not where I went to school.

Is that not the same at like public high schools because I went to a prep school I think is that like one of the major differences I didn't realize
