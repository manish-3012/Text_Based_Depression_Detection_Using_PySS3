So fucking done with myself Iâ€™ve done some horrible stuff and I do mean truly horrible stuff which is why I donâ€™t want to explain it and recently itâ€™s been weighing on me so much I canâ€™t even sleep anymore. I always try to be a good person these days but I just feel like Iâ€™m lying to myself at this point considering what a scumbag I am and itâ€™s driving me insane. I deserve to die in all honesty and knowing that yet carrying on with day to day life like a normal person just feels so wrong. Lord knows why Iâ€™m posting this here but I donâ€™t even know what I doing anymore, just want to end it all and do everybody a favour.
