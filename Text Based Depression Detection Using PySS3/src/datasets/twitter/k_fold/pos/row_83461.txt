Am I the only one that doesn't trust himself? I am 14m and I feel depressed on an daily basis, I tend to blame myself for everything that even slightly goes wrong and I usually cry about it overnight. But I almost never talk to anyone about it because I don't want want to bother them or upset them. I never want to speak with anyone about it because of the sole reason it could bother/upset them. I am a caring type that doesn't have many skills beside i an good at talking an making other people happy. But lately my depression had been getting worse due to the lack of moment I can see my friends (because of lock down/soft lock down) and stress but also randomly feel like I am acting it out and even tho I never talk with anyone about it I randomly feel like I am exaggerating and doing it for atention. Is this normal? Is it weird that I don't trust my own feelings?
