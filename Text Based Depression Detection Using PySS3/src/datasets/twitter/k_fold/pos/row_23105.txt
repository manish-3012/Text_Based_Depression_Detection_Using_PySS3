OMFG MY KITTEN FINALLY LAID IN MY MY LAP!! Well, shes a stray. Today, she sat on my lap and curled up and relaxed. And it was SOO cute!! She opened her mouth and put it on my knee and I could feel her teeth. Maybe that was a love bite. Everytime she moved I thought she was gonna get off, but she just sat down in a different position. She also tried to climb on me and tried to chew on the buttons on my shirt. Overall, she was SUPER cute! I'm super happy! The girls who always annoyed her by carrying and forcing her onto their laps were amazed!! Just wanted to share my success story :)
