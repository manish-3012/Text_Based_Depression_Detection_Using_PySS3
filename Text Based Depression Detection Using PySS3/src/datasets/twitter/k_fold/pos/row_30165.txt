Why was Prince Phillip a prince and not the king being the queen's husband? This post is made with 100% respect for him, his family and most of all, to the English Queen. I'm just a little idiot who doesn't anything about foreing politics at all. Google doesn't tell me anything relevant for it, that's why I'm asking here, so please don't comment about that
