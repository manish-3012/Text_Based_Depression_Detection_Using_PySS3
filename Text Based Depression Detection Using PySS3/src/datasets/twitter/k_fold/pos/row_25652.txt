Thoughts on the DeWalt 18V Xr Compact Brushless Combi Drill 1 x 5.0AH Li-ion Battery DCD796P1-GB? DeWalt 18V XR Brushless Combi Drill with 1 x 5.0Ah Li-Ion Battery, Multi-Voltage Charger and TSTAK compatible kit box. High Performance DeWalt 2nd Generation Brushless motor gives extremely high torque performance for a compact combi drill at 70Nm and being Brushless gives unbeatable runtimes. High beats per minute 0-9350 up to 34,000 makes drilling into masonry and brick work very easy and quick.
Two speed all metal transmission for increased runtime and longer tool life
Ultra compact, lightweight design allows use in confined spaces
Intelligent trigger design allows for total control of application. 
This drill can be purchased on several tool websites such as powertoolworld.co.uk and retails for about Â£150-200, however I cannot find any reliable reviews on such product and want to make sure Iâ€™m getting my moneyâ€™s worth. 
Thanks for all the help.
