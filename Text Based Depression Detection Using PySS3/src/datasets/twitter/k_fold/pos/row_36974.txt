SOO tomorrow im getting some piercings and i needa know some things So im gonna get like 2 lobe piercings and i also wanna get an industrial piercing but im not 100% sure about that because i love gaming alright, and i generally have my headphones on for many hours. I wont put them on till the piercings heal but how long would that be? Especially for the industrial one. One person said it still hurts putting headphones on for too long even years after having it done and i wouldnâ€™t want that to happen to me so if thereâ€™s anyone here that has piercings could u please tell me about your experience with it? C: or could i just take the earrings out before putting headphones on and before going to sleep but keeping them on during the day like would that work? 

Sorry if i sound stupid i just dont wanna make a decision ill regret
