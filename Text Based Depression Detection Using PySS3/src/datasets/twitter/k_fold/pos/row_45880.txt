I did it. Reddit, I did it. I got a girlfriend. Iâ€™ve known her for a year so far, and one time she finally said to me in a flirty type tone,â€are you gonna ask me to be your girlfriend?â€ And I was silent and dumbfounded. So, then I asked, â€œdo you wanna be my girlfriend?â€ And I think thatâ€™s the happiest yes I have ever heard someone say. Sheâ€™s great.
