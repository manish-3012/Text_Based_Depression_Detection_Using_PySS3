Creepy/Scam PMs after introducing or showing face? Usually I try not to spam post, but I have a concern. I did the intro post weekend and received a lot of scam pms for fake jobs/sus websites. Which reminded me of another issue. The reason I censor bar my face is to protect my identity (which I turned into a joke). I did a selfie in August-ish and got creepy PMs (forgot the usernames). I was wondering if anyone else is having similar issues.
