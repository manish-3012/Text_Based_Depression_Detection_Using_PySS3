Parents driving me crazy during college stuff So I wanna apply out of state and go out of state for a few reasons involving the state I wanna go to is best for the career and I want to kind of start over, but parents are being so goddamn annoying like all you do is stay in your room all the time your not ready and you need us around as support itâ€™s not a good idea to go to another state and guess what ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I WANNA LEAVE IS TO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOU. Just driving me crazy, Anyone else facing this shit? Thanks.
