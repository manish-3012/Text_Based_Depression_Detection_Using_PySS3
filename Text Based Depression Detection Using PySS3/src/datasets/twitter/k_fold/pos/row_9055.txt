what the hell is going on in my sister's middle school so my sister is in middle school and shit is getting weird. everyone on the basketball team she's on is getting super nit-picky at each other about politics. there is a kid that is always yelling "trump 2020, we need a recount!" and another kid ran through the halls with a Biden flag screaming to "burn the gays". kids were crying in the halls from this bitch and a teacher was laughing his ass off. I should teach her how to throw a good punch for when she gets back on Monday
