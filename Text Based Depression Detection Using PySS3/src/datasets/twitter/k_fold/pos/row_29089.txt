Stupid kid thinks its funny to shove snow down someones jacked So I was talking to my friend to day. Lets say his name was josh. Me and josh are talking until this kid named Gavin (No one likes him in our school) tries to put me in a head lock while shoving ice down my jacket. My friend Josh tries to pull him away, but I managed to let go and throw a hard ice block at Gavin back (keep in mind he did this from behind, so I couldn't see who he was). He starts crying and goes to the front doors. 5\~ minutes later he comes back with a thick stick, and two girls to (back him up). So since my other friends (Lets call them Aj and Tye) already saw what happened before threw me a shovel (yes I know its weird) so that he wouldn't hit me. Then my friend josh grabs the stick from Gavin and tries to tell Gavin to stop. Gavin then punches josh, and then josh fight back in defence. People are trying to separate Gavin fro josh, so I lightly tap Gavins back with the shovel, and he immediately swing around. Then we all yell at him, and he starts crying and saying he's gonna tell on us.

So that was basically the highlight of my day
