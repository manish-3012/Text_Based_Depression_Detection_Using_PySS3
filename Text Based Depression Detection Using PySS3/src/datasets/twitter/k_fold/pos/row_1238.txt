My brother just became a teenager and heâ€™s being an asshole to everyone I think he thinks that becoming a teenager automatically makes you distant from the family and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if he tries crack soon. Thatâ€™s kinda baseless but he is taking the teen stereotypes to heart. Iâ€™m in tenth grade but every time I talk to him he just gives me the cold shoulder. Like before his birthday he was completely fine. How do I get him to stop being a dick

Ik this really doesnâ€™t fit this subreddit anymore, cus itâ€™s not about someoneâ€™s fucking dead rick but I figured someone here has dealt with this before.
