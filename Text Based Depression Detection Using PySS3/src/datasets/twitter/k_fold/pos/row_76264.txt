Ayo can I just ramble about my favorite mission and ost in super mario galaxy real quick okay thanks OKAY SO DRIP DROP GALAXY IS THE BEST GALAXY IDC

The mission was rather interesting and kinda disturbed me as a small kid because the penguins were literally starving because of the eels n stuff and I just felt really bad for them which really made me determined to kick the eels asses

The music that plays there is incredible too and I love it its so relaxing im vibing to it rn
