So, I might turn into the Joker if I'm not careful This'll probably be lost in new, but I wanna share a story. I woke up today with a dry throat and parched lips. I should have drunk some water as soon as I rose from the bed, cause as I yawned, I felt a part of my lip split in two. I thought it was nothing until I started brushing my teeth and saw blood. And now I'm scared because I think that if I'm not careful, the entire left side might split and I'll turn into some sort of half joker.
