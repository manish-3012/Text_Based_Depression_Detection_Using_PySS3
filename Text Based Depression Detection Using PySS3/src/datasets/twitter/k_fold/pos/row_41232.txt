A fucking magpie attacked me during my Football game So I'm a goalkeeper, and I was just in my goal waiting for the ball to come my way, and this magpie came over and decided to chill on the cross bar, a couple minutes later it fucking swooped me for no reason (I had nothing shiny on), it went in the air and flapped it's wings like it was gonna do it again, so I was literally running away from this fucking magpie. It eventually stopped but a few minutes later it decided to swoop mr again but I did a sick mlg duck under it and dodged it. So anyways that happened.

This happened on the weekend but I could only be fucked now. Also I live in New Zealand.
