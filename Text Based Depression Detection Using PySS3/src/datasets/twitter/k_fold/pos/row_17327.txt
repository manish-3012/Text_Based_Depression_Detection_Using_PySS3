I'm just sad with my dad My dad was telling me to go and give my sister some almonds, as we were eating almonds, but she was in a different room, so I got up, but I also said she doesn't even eat almonds, and he gave me a laanat(means that he is saying goddamn you) and told me I was a dog, I mean, WHY, my dad doesn't give a shit about my mental health, he just says I'm a boy and I gotta be strong AND only cry when someone dies, like, really man?
