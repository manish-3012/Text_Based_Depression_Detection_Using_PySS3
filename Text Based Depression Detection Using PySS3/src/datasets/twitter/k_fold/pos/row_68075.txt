How do I convince my friend to not smoke weed or do edibles? I'm a freshman and she's an 8th grader. I've known her for a few months and I've tried to help her with a ton of problems she has, like self harm and mental health. She's a pretty hard person to convince and it's hard to help her, but I still try. She's 13, and so far she's gotten high off spray paint, cough syrup, drank some liquor, and she has a vaping addiction (she doesn't have a vape though luckily, but she wants one). Yesterday she told me she was going to a friend's house to vape, along with taking edibles or smoking weed. I've tried to convince her to somehow avoid getting into weed at the very least, but when I asked her about it today she didn't seem like I was gonna convince her. Any advice? Please lol, she's has a ton of issues and it's really hard to help her, but I think she's made a tiny bit of progress.
