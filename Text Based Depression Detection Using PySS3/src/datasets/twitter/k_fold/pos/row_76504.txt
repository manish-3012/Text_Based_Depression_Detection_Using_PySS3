YO GUYS I GOT A DATE TO HOMECOMING Iâ€™N SO HAPPY So our homecoming event got moved because of covid and I asked this girl to be my date and she said yes! Iâ€™m so happy! Anyone  who is thinking of asking someone out, do it. Even if they say no, you will regret it if you donâ€™t. So the least you can do for yourself is take that risk!
