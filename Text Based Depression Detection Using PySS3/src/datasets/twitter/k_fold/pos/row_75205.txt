I am declaring war on mosquitoes Its 63 outside and my right leg has been bitten 14 times. I am not kidding either we have the technology to end them as a genus so why are they still alive. All they do is spread diseases and cause itching they have no point and nothing would miss them they have no purpose. I will kill as many as possible
