My previous post OK, so I am not intending to be racist, I just want to shed some light on what he has done in the past. I never said this justifies the cops actions, but I have heard people in public being like "he's a completely innocent man, the bills haven't even been proven counterfeit" but he has done this, and many more in the past, I'm not intending to be racist, I never thought people would react like that, so I'm sorry
