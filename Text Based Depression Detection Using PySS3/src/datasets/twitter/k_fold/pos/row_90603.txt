I [17m] had a couple of unusually close/touchy nights with a friend [16f], and I donâ€™t know what to do now. 
Iâ€™m from Ohio, friend is from Washington, we know each other through our parents who met in high school. Needless to say, we don't see each other a whole lot since we're so far away, but we go on vacation once or twice a year with our families. I've known her my whole life but I became friends with her a couple of years ago and we now text or talk every day. We have been in a mutual friend zone about as strongly as can be and although we are very good friends there has never been anything even close to going beyond that. Also, she is bi, and from what I can tell leans towards liking other girls more than guys.   


We were on a vacation in Montana, a pretty typical outdoorsy 5 day vacation for us. I'll call my friend E. The first three days were typical -- fun but not much to talk about. But for the last two nights we stayed in a hotel that gave us extra rooms because our reservation or something was messed up due to COVID. Anyways, I got my own room and E and her sister, L \[14\], got their own room. Since my room had two beds (well, sort of, a queen bed and a pullout couch that was basically a single bed), they wanted to have a sleepover type thing. This isn't unusual on its own, we're comfortable with each other and whatnot. 

The first night we all played various games and watched some TV for probably about an hour before L fell asleep, and because E and I weren't tired we went to sit on the couch bed. We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.

The next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on...

It's been over 3 weeks since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because "it was comfortable." I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say "ew." Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights. 

TL;DR: Spent a couple of nights with close friend where she was unusually touchy and close, but there's been no mention about it since, idk why she did what she did or what I should do now.
