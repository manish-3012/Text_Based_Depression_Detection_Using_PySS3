I need therapy, but how should I ask? So background, I've been feeling depressed and yk, for a while now, and I want to ask my mother for therapy, however I want to avoid talking to her about any reasoning, such as being depressed and having a history of harmful actions/thoughts... etc. What is a simple way to ask a supportive parent about getting a therapist?
