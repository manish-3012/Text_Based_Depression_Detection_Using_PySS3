Idk where else to post this but I have this irrational fear that tomorrow, I'm just gonna die, for no reason. I feel like I'll just drop dead out of nowhere. No previous sign, like some undetected illness gonna just fuckin kill me out of nowhere. For the past couple months I've had this feeling I'd just die in January for no reason.

And I'm paranoid as shit. I'm always looking over my shoulder, triple checking locks, and every time I feel out of the ordinary my kind goes, "Guess it's time." I fucking hate this
