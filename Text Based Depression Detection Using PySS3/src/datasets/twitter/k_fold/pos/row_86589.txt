Wanna read something I will probably regret? So i did something dumb that I might regret.... i made this book on wattpad which is practically a diary. 

and I live a very boring life but i might be mildly entertaining if you enjoy reading whatever goes through my head at the time in which i write it. (given i don't really know if anyone will like it)

so if you do want to read it just dm me.
