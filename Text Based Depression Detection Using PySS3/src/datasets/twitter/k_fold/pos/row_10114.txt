Anyone else stopped fighting after middle school? Like literally my 7th grade year was the last time I fought and it wasnâ€™t even my fight it was a friendâ€™s, I personally love fighting but shockingly (to me) itâ€™s now pointless unless necessary (like you touch me type stuff.) now Iâ€™m a Junior and the whole concept of fighting is pointless to me.
