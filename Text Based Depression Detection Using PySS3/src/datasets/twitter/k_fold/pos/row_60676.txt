Genuine question mainly for black/African-American and people of color Question:If a non-black person uses the n word in a non offensive or racist context,such as rapping to a song or if actors had to say it for the script, does it offend you and do you assume that they are racist?

My pov:Ive watched alot of tik toks/videos that entail racial jokes, and ive seen several comments saying:â€im (person of color) and i found this funnyâ€.Or something between the lines of
â€œwe found it funny, the white girls are the ones that are offendedâ€.

It seems to me that most of the time, the people that are least offended are the people of color.

In my opinion, we should stop taking everything too seriously. Including the â€œsuper straightâ€ thing that is going on. Lets have a laugh and stop beingâ„ï¸


My bad if im generalizing alot, but feel free to let me know your pov
