I JUST DID MY HOMEWORK WHOOOOOOOO ITS 2AM BECAUSE I FUCKED AROUND ALL DAY AND THE ASSIGNMENT WAS DUE AT MIDNIGHT BUT I DID IT BECAUSE I HAVE PLANS THIS WEEKEND AND MY MOM SAID SHE WAS PROUD OF ME. I do have a book and test to take for english but that's the only class I'm behind in and I'm so proud of myself that I've almost made it through the first week of the new grading period without like 12 outstanding assignments.
