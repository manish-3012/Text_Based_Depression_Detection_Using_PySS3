Message to all yâ€™all with confidence issues So Iâ€™m a freshman. I get told casually tonight by a girl I had become decent friends with that she had a crush on me in 8th grade, and that there were two other people that did in middle school. Now this doesnâ€™t fucking add up for a multitude of reasons to me but my message to all yâ€™all guys and gals out there is that yes, the person you think is cute probably thinks you are too, and there is probably like one person crushing on you. Take it as a given and then youâ€™ll see the signs better. Donâ€™t be an asshole though. Just have more confidence!!
