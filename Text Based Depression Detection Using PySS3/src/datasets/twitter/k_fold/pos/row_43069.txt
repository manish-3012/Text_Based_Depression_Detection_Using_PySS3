so is public transportation not shitty everywhere? cuz in FAX (fresno area xpress) sucks major asshole in a city that really needs it, and pretty much everything else in california except BART (bay areas rapid transit) also sucks ass

seriously FAX donâ€™t even cover all of fresno, it really is horrible, and the clovis roundup is even worse
