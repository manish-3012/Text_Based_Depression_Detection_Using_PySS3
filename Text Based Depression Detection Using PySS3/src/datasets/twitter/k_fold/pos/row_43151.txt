For the first time in my life, I'm challenged, and I'm loving it. Let me start out with saying that I'm intelligent. I'm not trying to brag, that's just important to this whole story. My entire life, I've been able to slide by on about 20-30% of effort. I have a good short-term memory, so I can just skim a test for two minutes and retain the information needed to get at least an 80. I've never had to study for a single test throughout highschool, and the first test I ever had to study for was in college. But truth be told, this has made me extremely... lazy. Up until I could afford to be lazy.

I recently had to drop out of college due to monetary issues, and mental health issues preventing me from being able to pass a specific required class. I tried getting a job but my mental health tanked much harder after a couple of months of that, and I had to quit. So I've decided to study coding and programming so that I can get a better job and be prepared when I finally get my head right.

This... this is wonderful. It's actually *challenging*. I actually have to apply myself to understand it(I'm completely computer illiterate and I'm learning everything for the first time). It's giving my mind a run for its money, and that's a pleasure I've never had before. I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like that One Punch Man episode where he at last finds an opponent that he can't defeat in one punch. Hahaha! I can't afford to be lazy anymore, and I'm loving it!
