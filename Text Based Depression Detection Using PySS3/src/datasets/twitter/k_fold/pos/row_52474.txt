I just snorted tea tree oil Not what it sounds like

Was in the shower, the tea tree face wash is fucking great, but fucking intense. I wonder who got the idea tea tree oil and face equates to good? So was using the face wash, and i inhaled through my nose at the wrong moment, and up went a stream of that potent frio flamas shit, took the A train up my left nasal passage. Burned like fucking hell holy shit and its 20 minutes later my eyes and nose have a new nasty vomit flavor feeling and it hurts like shit ugh

Sticking my pinkie the length of a Ticonderoga up my smeller and exhaling hard did absolutely nothing, nor did snorting shower water and honking like a goose a few seconds later do anything. Please help. It burns

Not exaggerating anything at all

Pray for me
