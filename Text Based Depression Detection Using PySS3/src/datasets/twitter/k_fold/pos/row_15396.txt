Sore balls outta nowhere Not sure if this is the right place to say but here I go:

Fellas, if your testicles ever swell and/or feel like you've been kicked or hit there despite having no prior contact with them, please see a doctor immediately. On Friday night I(17M) was close to losing a testicle due to mild testicular torsion, thankfully my incredible girlfriend convinced me to tell my dad (if she hadn't have convinced me i probably wouldn't have gone) about it and got me to the doctors, then to the hospital. 1 hour later and both my testicles are safe! 

Don't be embarrassed to say like I was, otherwise you'll risk infertility and absolute fucking agony.

Don't be afraid to say about this stuff to people.



Thanks for reading chiefsðŸ‘ðŸ™
