so I got my PS3 back after a couple years and I replayed both Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and I can say with certainty New Vegas is the best in the franchise I think New Vegas is by far, the best installement in the series for many reasons. (minor spoilers) first off, it doesnt waste any time with introductions, you are a mailman who was shot in the head by some asshole wearing a chessboard for a suit that stole your special coin as well, but you lived and you launch a vendatta, but it quickly becomes more complex as you progress the game. The story is far better than any other fallout game and it only gets better with the complex choice system there is. In Fallout 3 theres only two factions, but in NV theres prolly around 8. Secondly, the gameplay is far better than in 3. Listen Todd Howard, if I wanna turn someones head into flesh confetti, i wanna do it looking donw my gun dammit, and just zooming in slightly. Another reason I like NV better is because the enviroment is a lot more lively and dangerous. In DC, its pretty damn dead with a lot of poop brown and puke green, but the Mojave, has a big ass canyon and forest to explore. And even the empty desert can be a trial with a surprise encounter with a deathclaw if youre not careful. And NV was the first Fallout game to introduce multiple types of enemies, theres at least swven deathclaws in the game, and the Legendary Bloatfly (no joke) is the one enemy that will bone you 98% of the time. The quests, (despite the fact there are so many, they are very hard to find if youre not looking) are very well developed and will effect the conclusion one way or another. I think the only thing that I can criticize is the fact that there is no aftergame  and that the quests are so much harder to find unlike in skyrim persay. If theres anybody here who hasnt played Fallout NV, I highly recommend it. Its incredibly immersive with interesting characters, fun ,yet punishing gameplay early on and high replay value.
