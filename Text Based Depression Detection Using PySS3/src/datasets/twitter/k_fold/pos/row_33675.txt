I think I have a problem I don't know if this is a bad thing, but, I have a tendency to downplay and unhype everything I do, and I can't take any form of compliment, I just ignore them. I literately managed to downplay the fact I was graduating, and in the moment I guess I felt good and happy, but afterwards I felt nothing. People will come up to me and say that I'm good at guitar and music, or call me cool and stuff, my friends do that say that to me too, and just sit there and be like, why? I can't take a compliment no matter how nice it is. Compliments sometimes make me feel almost bad. I could literately play in front of a large crowd, and afterwards I would be like, ok. Is this bad??
