School makes me want to kill in Video Games........... I'm so Tired and Stressed right now due to difficulty in learning, requirements, etc.  


Plus P.E is making me a Video Project again.  


I'm so Tired and Stressed that to De-stress myself and relax, I Massacred an Entire Minecraft Village.  
I killed Everyone and Everything in Sight. Including Villagers, Cows, Cats, Dogs, etc.  


I also did a Killing Spree in GTA V.   


and Did Genocide in Stellaris. I basically Killed \~10 Billion Aliens plus I blew an Entire Planet up.  


  
It was Fun.
