I'm afraid to tell her, but I need to let off steam I don't know if I can say I love you but I'm sure I have feelings for you. I'm afraid to tell you this directly because I don't want to ruin one of the best friendships I've ever had 
I love your smile, your company, your personality... This sounds very basic but I honestly don't know what to say and I'm not sure about my feelings
I'm sorry for being weak.
