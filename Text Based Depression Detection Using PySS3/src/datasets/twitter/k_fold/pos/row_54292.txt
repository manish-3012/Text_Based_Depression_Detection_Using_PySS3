This will get lost in new but, should I apologize to my ex-girlfriend about the reasons for our falling out to smooth relations or is it better to just forget the whole thing happened and go on? Pretty much the title, I was wondering If I should just get it off my chest a couple months after or if I should just leave her be. I was contemplating and just thought I'd ask reddit.
