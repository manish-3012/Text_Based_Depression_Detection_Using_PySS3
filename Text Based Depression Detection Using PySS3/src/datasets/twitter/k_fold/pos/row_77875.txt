Do u guys ever feel like sometimes ur just afraid to be ur own person kinda and ur just afraid ur doing everything wrong?? Sometimes I feel like I have to see what other people are doing all the time just so I know Iâ€™m not doing the â€œwrong thingâ€ I guess everyone does this but I think it shouldnâ€™t be like that about everything u know. I just wanna be more confident in my decisions and I feel like if I havenâ€™t seen someone else do it before then it COULD be wrong which is sorta scary to me u know

Idk if any of this made sense Iâ€™m tired
