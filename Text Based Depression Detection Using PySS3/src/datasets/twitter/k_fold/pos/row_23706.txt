OLD GAMES ARE AWESOME Alright so I was born in 2005 and I grew up by with ps2 as my only console, and played games most of the game in pc. I grew playing god of war, batman Arkham games, gta, dead space, watch dogs. And 4 years ago I bought PS4 and played awesome games like uncharted 4, god of war, horizon, assassin creed, read dead redemption, spiderman PS4 last of us etc. As I never grew up playing platforming games or nithendo games I always underestimated mario, legend of Zelda,I didn't got why botw got game of year 2017. But during this pandemic after watching dunkey's ocarina of time review, I thought I will give it a try I downloaded emulator and played it and I was blown away by it, it instantly became one of my favourite games ever, I played super Mario 64, loz twilight princess, skyward sword, which all were awesome. I even played gba Pokemon fire red, it's just amazing. Now I want to play super Mario odessy loz botw, but I can't get switch now. Anyway the point is am assuming most you are teens too and probably of my age so if you never had chance play these old gems please try them they are awesome. Also suggest me some of your fav retro games
