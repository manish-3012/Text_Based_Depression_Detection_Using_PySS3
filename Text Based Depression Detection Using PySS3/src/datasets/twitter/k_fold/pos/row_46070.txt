How do yall forget? Like it says in the title.

How do yall forget that we are almost adults. That we will have to spend the next 60 or so years doing one thing over and over day in and day out, having to worry about taxes, groceries, laundry, looking good and everything our parents do? 

This isn't a reminder but an actual question. I'm trying to sleep but I can't help but think about the future and how much it terrifies me every time I try and close my eyes. I want to believe that i will be this happy as long as I'm alive, but all i can see is 

Graduate highschool, join army, go to college, graduate college, die

Or

Die.

I cant find any other alternatives and frankly? I'm scared as fuck.

Anyone got any advice on how to forget even for a night the terrifying prospect of growing up?
