Have you ever loved someone so much that it hurts when they leave 

I have made many friends in school but in lockdown i came to know how many of them are real, turns out just 2. I love them both but one of them is my best friend who knows my deepest secrets. We both got selected in different universities and it just hurts that i wont be able to see their face everyday and i will not be hugged everyday.
