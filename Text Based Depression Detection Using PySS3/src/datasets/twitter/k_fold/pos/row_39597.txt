An interesting idea i just made up on the fly. so I was just doing my thing and then this just hit my head, has anyone tried to set up only fans and set the cover image of a foot  ( not you ). but then here's the lesson in trickery, instead of putting images of yourself without clothes you just put pictures of rocks and other random items that mean nothing at all, maybe you could con some people into coughing up some money. maybe you will get a good payday.

I just want to know if anyone else has had this idea, and wants to terraform it into something else.
