I'm loosing my fucking mind, and I dont know why I'm hearing shit, when I'm alone, like people crying, and children screaming, which I've never heard before, cause we live adjacent to a highway, so we only hear cars. I cant get any sleep, so sometimes I can barely see anything except static, and when I'm at school, I seem to always second guess everything I say, and go down the worst path possible, assuming that's what will happen, even if what I said was innocuous. Am I going fucking paranoid? Not to mention, I feel emotionally disconnected, barely giving a shit about anything, even my friends feelings, to the point where someone told me that I said something fucked up, and I didnt even realise it was until I was told so, not to mention, I'm a logical guy, but also quick to anger so this paranoia is driving me off the fucking wall
