My brain has yee'd it's last haw I was working on an assignment and iterating to estimate the roots of this one equation. Stuff like bisection, secant, nothing hard, but it takes a looong time to complete by hand.

At the end of it, i was feeling nice (this was 30 min later) but then I realized I copied the wrong equation so I estimated the wrong roots

The deadline is in 4 minutes so I'm just gonna go die now, ok bye
