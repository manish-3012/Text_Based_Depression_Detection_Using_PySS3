I need help choosing a class!!!! I am already planning to take AP US history, Chem, Calc BC, and Computer Science. I have to choose one other class but all the electives at my school are trash. So, are there any AP classes that I could take but would not be too difficult since I'm already taking some pretty difficult classes. At the moment I am considering two classes, AP Psych and Spanish Lang. I am fluent in Spanish and I heard that AP Psych isn't hard but I am not really that interested in taking those classes so I would appreciate it if you guys could give me some advice on what to do. I donâ€™t really care if it is a useful class or if it will give me college credits, I just need it to be easy.
