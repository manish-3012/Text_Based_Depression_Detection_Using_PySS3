Some things I wanted to get off my chest A. I am an idiot (believe me)

B. I have a massive crush on my best friend and I have for 4 years and I have no clue what to do, we're both boys btw so uhhh it's sorta hard but I hope he doesnt read this knowing he does sometimes check my reddit

C. I havent felt good since 2018 and whenever I talk about it, I end up feeling bad because my dumbass head thinks people don't want to hear about it, and I'm guessing they dont.

D. I am astonishly good liar which is a blessing and a curse, a blessing cause white lies always work but a curse because whenever I'm cocky or I do something dumb, people believe me and owning up is super hard.

Welp, can I get some advice on B cause I sorta really need it rn
