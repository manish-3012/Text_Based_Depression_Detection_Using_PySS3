i hate columbus, but i still want a free day because i hate school in general Do i seriously need to go to have my intelligence insulted heavily just because hes racist??? I get it, i don't like the guy. But i am so fucking annoyed that they would just force me to go do the same fucking thing i do almost every monday, just because its celebration of a colonizer. Just claim it as a fuckin planning day then, and dont celebrate columbus day. No body would fucking care. This is such bullshit. I work hard everyday just to be betrayed like this????? I try my best, and avoid being bombarded by boomers for this??? All because some racist motherfucker has his own holiday??????????? I get it. I really do. We as a society are progressive, but its so fucking annoying when you hype me up for a 3 day weekend of avoiding you assholes running around and making my mental health deteriorate, and then you proceed to get rid of it. Thats literally the ONLY FUCKING HOLIDAY YOU GOT RID OF FOR THE MONTH!!!!!!!! WHY!!!!!?????? you people are not only sociopathic in nature, but complete sadists to children hoping to escape from the restrictions of the education system in america. I only wanted a day. Just a day, a single day would have been enough. Nope, nada. Nothing. I have to deal with you making me scared to even talk to my parents about my grades because i need to keep a high reputation in order to sustain a healthy relationship with them. You have no respect fro the labor i put into school almost everyday. I shuffle my feet into that cafeteria every single fucking time, dreading having to deal with you people. Fuck you, School. Fuck you.
