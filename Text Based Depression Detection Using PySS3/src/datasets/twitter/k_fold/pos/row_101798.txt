Realism is what I strive for I tend to be a â€œrealisticâ€ person overall, or at least I try to. When Iâ€™m in a crappy mood, I may be pessimistic. Or when Iâ€™m in a good mood, then I may be optimistic. But in general, I am just realistic or at least I try to. That may include some â€œpessimisticâ€ thinking but that â€œpessimisticâ€ thinking is reality, or at least I think it is. You can say the same for â€œoptimisticâ€ thinking. Itâ€™s reality, or at least I think it is. And the reason I want to be â€œrealisticâ€ is because I think â€œrealisticallyâ€ and I end up in the right direction. Sure optimism will make you feel happy and motivate you, but I feel like it will also end up in a bad path thinking ur in a good path but sure as long as youâ€™re happy. And with pessimism you feel like you need to keep pushing yourself which can be good to improve a lot. But with realism, you get both in a way. You push when reality is youâ€™re not â€œthereâ€ but when you are â€œthereâ€ you congratulate yourself for it or whatever. I wanna think â€œrealisticallyâ€ because I wanna be truthful and get the right deserving amount of criticism and congrats and thatâ€™ll push me in the right direction in life.
