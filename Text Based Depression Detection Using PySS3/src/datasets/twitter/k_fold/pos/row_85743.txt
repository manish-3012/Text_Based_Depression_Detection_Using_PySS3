Life ending insult **You grotesque wildebeest, You do not know your ass from a hole in the ground, Iâ€™ve seen pandas more ferocious than you, You are like rapunzel but instead of letting your hair down, you let people down. Your mom is so slow it took her 9 months to make a joke (you), A glass of water has more calories than you have brain cells, your skin is so oily it is amazing it hasnâ€™t been invaded by America yet. Does your ass ever get jealous of the shit that comes out of your mouth? Iâ€™d shove a foot up your ass if it wasnâ€™t already occupied by your head. I would punch you in the face but I wouldnâ€™t want to make you look better.If I got a penny for every one of your thoughts I would get change. Iâ€™m not offended about what you said, Iâ€™m just glad you are stringing words into sentences now. If Idiots could fly you would be a fighter jet. You look like something I would draw with my left hand, wildebeest. Did your parents ever ask you to run away from home? You are the reason the Gene pool needs a lifeguard. You can never witness a true smile on someoneâ€™s face because it only happens after you leave. You should carry a plant around with you to replace the oxygen you waste. You called me gay, such an honor to have reconigniton from an expert in the field. If laughter is the best medicine your face must be curing the world. You must have been born on a highway because that's where most of the accidents happen.Â  Do you still love nature, after what it did to you? You are like a plunger, always bringing up old shit. Mark Zuckerber looks more human than you. There are roughly 171, 476 words in the english language, none describe how much I want to hit you with a chair.**
