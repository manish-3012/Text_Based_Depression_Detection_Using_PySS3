Quick rant about school So I'm stupid and didn't do my best last year so i have to redo the year. Which is in itself not a bad thing but for some reason i have do redo art class (sorry bad england) too which fucking sucks. We have to do the worst and cringiest things ever.

For example I have to make a rap video (can't sing at all and social anxiety so yea rip) which fucking sucks because it's so fucking cringy aaaa why the fuck do i have to do it again i already did it last year and i had a high enough grade for it (but for some reason didn't let me skip it this years, fuck them they always screw everyone). And if that wasn't bad enough i am seperated from my friends (pure hell btw) and i have to do it witch a bunch of randoms i literally do not know...

Fuck my life

Rant over.
