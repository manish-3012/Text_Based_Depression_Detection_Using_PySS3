Today was one of the greatest days of my life so far. So this year overall sucks. We can agree on that. Me personally I started having a rough year. In January I managed to tear my ACL and meniscus, then COVID hit so even when I could walk again I couldnâ€™t do anything because of the lockdown. My drivers test got postponed and I couldnâ€™t get out of a deep emotional rut for a while. 
Around June however things were looking up. I had completed PT at this point and was able to go lifting again, I took my drivers test, passed and got a job the next day. I bought the truck I have now and have been working on it and making it a great vehicle, Iâ€™m doing decently in school and have made a lot of friends through work. (I was always an introvert and with my job Iâ€™m meeting people that I enjoy hanging with) this eventually led to me being invited to my first Halloween party in close to 10 years and just overall being a happier person.
My dad asked me if I wanted to meet for dinner after work, I said yes and met him at a restaurant near where I work. (Just so yâ€™all know there are no family issues we just donâ€™t see eachother a lot because of work schedules.) after a bit of talking he says how proud he is of me and all the accomplishments Iâ€™ve made this year thus far, and how proud of a dad he is. 

Iâ€™m so happy right now and Iâ€™m so happy my life is taking suck a wonderful turn around! 
I just wanted to say this. To anyone who read through the whole thing I thank you. If you are going through rough times you WILL find a way out!
Much love everyone
