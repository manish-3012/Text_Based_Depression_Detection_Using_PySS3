My mom said Iâ€™m hideous. This is a bit of a vent, I suppose. 

Some background information: my favorite color is green, so I tend to get my hair dyed green every time I get a haircut. 

Today I went to get a haircut. My mom scheduled the appointment to get my hair cut and dyed again, since my roots had grown out. I got my hair dyed, and itâ€™s neon green. Like, mountain dew bottle green. And I love it! I really, really like the color and the cut and I think itâ€™s really nice! 

But when my mom seen it the first thing she said was, â€œthatâ€™s so hideous. You look hideous.â€

I honestly donâ€™t know what to do. It hurt so bad. And then she rubbed it in, saying, â€œyou look horrible. You shouldâ€™ve just stuck some grass in your hair. I shouldnâ€™t have wasted my money on your shitty hair.â€

She usually degrades me for my hair, but not this much. I really just want to grab some dye and dye it back now, but I really, honestly love it. 

I hate it here.
