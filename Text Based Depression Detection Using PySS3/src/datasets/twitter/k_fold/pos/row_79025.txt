Arrogance is sometimes a virtue I do not know how I wouldâ€™ve graduated at 19 under a heavy course load of mathematics if I was not arrogant. 

My only motivation was to be better than my peers. Fantasies of power and academic dominance kept me going through tired nights of studying. But, since I started grad school, those fantasies have been flickering away, along with my motivation to complete problem sets. I blame it on the online learning environment, because it has been difficult to transition from my dorm-self to student-self. But I canâ€™t quite shake it. 


Typically, I am quite resistant to stress, but that has been creeping up on me through the procrastinated assignments. I think I am even depressed sometimes. 


I am afraid of losing arrogance just as I am afraid of falling in love because I feel like either of those two things would destroy me.

For the first time, I do not know what to do with my life...
