I can't fucking take it anymore (Trigger warning) School wants to make me fucking kill myself, I have so many fantasies of wanting to grab a knife and cut myself. I have so many missing assignments because the teachers give us mountains of work.  The only thing that makes me happy is my dog, videogames, and masturbating, but videogames and masturbating make me feel good for about 10 seconds and then I want to die again. But apparently, it gets worse in life, as my mom said. I never get any breaks even on the weekends.  If life gets harder I will fucking kill myself
