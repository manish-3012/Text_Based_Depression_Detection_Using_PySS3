Hot Take: Redditorsâ„¢ are the worst. I'm not talking about the Redditor who just comes here for the memes but the Circlejerk Redditor.

The users who are always like, "EmoJi BAd" "InStaGrAM BaD" "TiK TOK bAd" "ELoN MuSk aND KeAnu ReEVES WhoLesOme 100" etc. these guys are the reasons I hate using this site, the gatekeepers who will instantly downvote anything if they don't agree with the hivemind. They are so obnoxious. They are the reason Redditors are always the butt of a joke.
