i just remembered that time i got adopted by an extroverted girl... back in like... 6th grade I think, some new girl started in class, she immediatly after like a week started staying close to me and shit and i thought it was coincidence...

that is until she started saying "good morning little brother" every darned morning... not only that but she also looked over my shoulder every recess asking me "what are you doing little brother?"

so she pretty much went into full on protective mode for me... soo uhhh that was the moment i realised i had been adopted by her.

sooo now 3 years later im trying  to reconnect with her to see what shes up to since shes the first ever person to have initiated a conversation with me.
