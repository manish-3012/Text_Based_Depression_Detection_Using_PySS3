Problem with Science I just realized half of science is actually mistake of previous scientists and their misconceptions still being taught to us.
Like we are taught that atoms of same elements are alike but that was a misconception of scientists before they found isotopes.
Then some guy said that current flows from higher potential to lower potential, which is even more serious of a lie as it is never told clearly to students. They are told like electrons flow from (-) to (+) but for convention we treat as if current flows from (+) to (-). But if you think about it current is flow of charges and charges are clearly flowing in the opposite way.
Then Newtons Gravitational law, it was wrong or maybe incomplete whichever you say.

Bio is an exception tho, 

But then there's a more dangerous thing, the names. Like how high were you to name things like that? Couldn't you just name them in English? Why Latin, just why?
Gain of electron is called Reduction! Seriously? 
And many more examples which I cant remember atm.
And Bio names, what were you guys naming? A monster ? 
Sternum, What is this? 
Phalanges, sounds like a dangerous monster but worry not it's just your finger bones.
Medulla Oblongata!! Just tell me the guy who named it. I want to choke him to death with weed if he likes weed so much.
