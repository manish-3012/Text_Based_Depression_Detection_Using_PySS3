Everyoneâ€™s growing upðŸ¥º So I was just sitting around for a minute and realized that me and all my friends are growing up, Iâ€™ve been friends with them for years and weâ€™re al growing up and growing apart from each other lately. Weâ€™ve barly talked anymore and I just miss my friends, weâ€™ve all grown apart from eachother but I donâ€™t want to say goodbye to them cause I still see them as my best friends
