I'm FINALLY gonna shave Two days ago I asked my mom to get me a razor and shaving foam because my beard(If you can call it that) is getting ANNOYING. She said yes, and got me a razor and Shaving foam this evening. I'm FINALLY gonna get a shave tomorrow morning, Goodbye stupid looking mustache and annoying beard, I bid you adieu.
