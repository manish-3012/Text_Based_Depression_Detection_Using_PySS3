I live with idiots My brother just informed us that his girlfriends dad has Covid, and they found out a few days ago. He then asked if it was ok for her to come over. My mom said no and he started throwing a bitch fit talking about how itâ€™s not even that serious. (My Family is mostly republican) There are 4 people who are high risk and my dad is saying unless one of shows symptoms then we are getting tested, so he wants to wait until itâ€™s too late to get tested, and they are telling me not to tell my job about it saying I barely came in contact with her, she was in our house last night spreading her germs. My job is incredibly strict about contact and shit and I donâ€™t feel comfortable not telling them and Iâ€™m just so fucking done with the stupidness. This disease kills people.
