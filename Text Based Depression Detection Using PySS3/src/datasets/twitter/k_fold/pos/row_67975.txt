the Burger King 9:30 pm i drive to Burger King

Its up at the station, I want my onion rings and it whop whops and it pops pops and it goes and he tries

And he fries, the onion 

He manifests from a nothing now he a rules Burger King If then he a thinks of something It disappears from his dreams

Creates the world as he sees fit Destroys what he wants by eating What he consumes turns to shit In just a moment its breathing

Fourth dimensional matter creates shadows of the same Three dimensional patterns that we are viewing on this plane

x or y or a z now think of adding in the fourth
Drink the icee and follow my lead imma da force

I'm going to Lick you like an icee Im going fill you with my frosting fucker cost me nothing give it to me bear I know that you are hiding something

He converts the light to matter

Killing all in just an hour

When he done hes had his fun He drinks his icee border with power

No-one here in all the world The universe devoid of sour Drinking up his last resort He starts again creation now or

Fourth dimensional matter creates shadows of the same Three dimensional patterns that we are viewing on this
plane

x or y or a z now think of adding in the fourth Drink the icee and follow my lead imma da force
