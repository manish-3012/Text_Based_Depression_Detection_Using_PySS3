Couldn't Aang from Avatar just have kids? (spoiler) I just finished watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I was thinking. the series ends with Aang and Katara making out as a grand and great finale. But, if Aang and Katara had children, and Aang had the dominant airbending gene, more airbenders or air nomads would be born. He alone could repopulate the whole of his peoples.
