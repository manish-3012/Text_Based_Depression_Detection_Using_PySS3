Not try to flex but last year... I got a friend that is a girl last year. The teacher made us partners last year for lots of assignments. Now she is comfortable touching me. My school had a dance thing with partners and she was it. I had to touch her back but I wasn't comfortable doing it. A teacher noticed and made me do it. If I was a anime boy at that moment I would've had a nose bleed. When my hand was on her back I felt her shirt but I also felt her bra strap. Then we had to hold hands but I think she liked it because she told me my hands are soo soft and warm. She laughed about the strap thing. As a person that gets anxiety by talking to people this was a big step for me. I got no more friends since then but it was a big step.
