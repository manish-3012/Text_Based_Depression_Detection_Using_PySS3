Idk what to do It is early hours of Monday rn, ate normally on Saturday, but had literally nothing to eat on Sunday. I'm trying to recover from anorexia but the temptation to browse thinspo and really low calorie recipes on Tumblr or look at my fat future post-recovery bod on Body visualiser is so overpowering. I'm starving right now but my meal plan says i never eat at night, only eat meals in the day. I'm in a war between the dietician, and myself. I don't give a shit about my health i only care about my weight, what do I do?

I'm a 14-year-old trans boy (approaching 15), 167 cm, and roughly 49 kilos but I need to be 54.
