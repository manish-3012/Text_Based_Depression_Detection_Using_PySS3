I have no idea what I want Its my 18th birthday in a week and im not sure what I even want &gt;~&lt; I originally planned to save up 4000$ for half of the cost of a car I wanted so I could get the 2nd half on my birthday but then the virus came on and about and that planned failed so now I dont know what I want and I DONT want video games or gaming stuff because im starting to get a bit sick of video games.


I really just wanna improve my art but im pretty sure money canâ€™t buy that :/

Im not sure if im gonna be able to do my art career that I wanted to do anymore tbh ;-;

I feel like im just scared of turning 18
