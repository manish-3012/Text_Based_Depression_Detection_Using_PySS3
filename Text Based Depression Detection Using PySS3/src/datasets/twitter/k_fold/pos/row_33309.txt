People need to stop telling males to "man up". They're human too. Its ridiculous that someone's emotions and depression can get ignored under the excuse of their genders. And then you're oh so shocked when they end up killing himself.

 "I never though he would kill himself..he was a happy person.." No, you just never listened to his depressed thoughts and ignored them. Fuck people who tell males to man up just because they're experiencing some kind of negative emotion. It can seriously affect on kids. 
 

Guys and girls, all of your feelings are equally valid. Dont forget that.
