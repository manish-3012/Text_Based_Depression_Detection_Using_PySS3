People who wear shoes in the house, are disgusting. Like its just gross. I'm sorry there's no argument you could say that would not convince me otherwise. Most of my British friends and co-workers wear shoes in the house... Youâ€™ll spread mud and snow all over your house in the winter. Plus a countless amount of bacteria. Especially now with everything going on why risk that? Also, if youâ€™re immunocompromised or have allergy issues, is like the worst thing you can do.

I'm Turkish and I always cringe when I see this. Like if I EVER walked inside my house with my shoe on... GAME OVER!
