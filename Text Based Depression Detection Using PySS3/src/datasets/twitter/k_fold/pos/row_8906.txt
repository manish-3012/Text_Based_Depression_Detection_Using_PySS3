Bullying in online school... Looking for any advice as to how to continue being a bully in online school. Iâ€™ve always stuck to traditional forms of bullying (physical violence etc) but as my school has moved online Iâ€™ve struggled to adapt to the change. I tried threatening people in my breakout rooms but it just doesnâ€™t have the same effect, they can block me or mute me or even just close they damn eyes. Iâ€™m trying to go for a mean jock from â€˜13 reasons whyâ€™ type vibe but any other suggestions of how I should act going forward are very appreciated!
