is this normal parenting? iâ€™m f17 and my parents still take my phone at a certain time and gives me a bed time at 12 when i donâ€™t feel like i have to sleep at 12. I feel like teen clocks work later than that and my school starts at 10 in the morning so i donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary. they also donâ€™t let me take naps. but this is way better than a while ago.

throughout middle school and high school, my mom would allow one hour of phone time and would threaten to take away my phone for months and make me break up with my boyfriend if i ever got a B. (I ended up getting straight As throughout hs out of fear and now i have crippling anxiety). They do let me out of the house often enough before so i give them credit for that and theyâ€™re very open to my friends coming over and stuff 

but iâ€™m extremely tired of 1) not having my own room bc my 13 year old sister canâ€™t sleep by herself 2) not getting to sleep when I want to 3) just in general having their pressure hanging over my head 

am i wrong for this? they donâ€™t listen to my communication at all so iâ€™m just going off on a tangent to make me feel better
