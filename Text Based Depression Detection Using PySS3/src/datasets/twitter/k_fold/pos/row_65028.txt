Boys, beware of soap So I washing my ding-a-ling about a week ago and obviously people usually use soap or body wash of whatever you wish to call it, and it done that thing where it ever so slightly goes up your Jap's eye and irritates it a bit. It done that so I washed it off as normal but when I got out the shower it was still irritated.

I ignored it for a while till I went for a piss and it looked a bit like a small bubble bath and I thought something's not right here because it done it everytime I went for a piss but just got less bubbly as, I assume, the soap was being washed out.

I consulted my doctor and he said the bubbly bit is probably normal depending on how deep the soap went. He then went on to advise me to be careful when washing as some perfumed or harsh soaps can actually irritate and slightly damage the skin on the helmet. Just thought I'd tell my story so the boys of this Subreddit can protect their Nice Cocks.
