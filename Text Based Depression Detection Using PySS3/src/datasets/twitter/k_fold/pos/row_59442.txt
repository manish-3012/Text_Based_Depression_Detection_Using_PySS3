Anybody got any song/album recommendations? Iâ€™m open to most genres (though Iâ€™m not a fan of country and Iâ€™m kinda iffy on rap though some rap I do think is good) if you need an idea of what kind of music I like Iâ€™ll have a list here

â€¢Bad as me-Tom Waits
â€¢The Valley of the Pagans-Gorillaz
â€¢Death on two legs-Queen
â€¢Figaro-MF DOOM
â€¢Body terror song-AJJ
â€¢My time- bo en
â€¢Saint Bernard-Lincoln 
â€¢Christmas Kids-roar
