Question I think I might have a mental disorder but Iâ€™m not comfortable enough to talk about it with anyone so why not shout into the void. Since I was around 12 Iâ€™ve had really bad anxiety I canâ€™t read social situations for shit I have no confidence and I have a nervous tick. Does anyone know what this could line up with?
