I'm so fucking ugly it's just sad at this point You'll probably say stuff like "noone is ugly" but we all know that's bullshit, everything and everyone has been giving me signs I'm fucking ugly and although i noticed, i never really accepted it just so I can feel a bit better about myself, but fr it's so fucking obvious I'm a average heightened teenager with acne and scars from childhood all over my face, shit hair and a face expression that says "punch me", the only compliments I ever get are either from my mom saying that I have nice facial characteristics, people complimenting my eyes (idfk why, they look horrible) or just people saying that I have a nice body. When I look in the mirror or on the Instagram/snapchat camera, I go "maybe I'm not that ugly after all" then I take a fucking selfie, the image reverses and I just look at my real self and my sadness begins again, I'm ashamed to look people in the eyes, I'm afraid that I'll fucking scare them away, I can hold eye contact for about a second and then BAM I look away again. I know I'm just a stupid teenager focusing too much or their looks when school is so much more important, but even in school I can't not think about that, I look at all those beautiful people who have clear skin and loveable faces and it just makes me wanna keep my mask on forever. 

I would do anything to look like like one of those good looking boys in my school. Anything


I sound pathetic I know

And thank you if you read the whole thing, I really appreciate it
