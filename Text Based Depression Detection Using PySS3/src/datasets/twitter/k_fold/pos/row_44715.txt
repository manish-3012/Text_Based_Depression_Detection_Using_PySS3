Guys help i need a topic for a speech I need a topic for a speech because my school is forcing everyone to participate in an event called "FLS2RJ" . Idk what it stands for but its an event where everyone has to compete with other classes. 

I got speech because i can speak english (im indonesian). I've been thinking of a topic for days but idk it's so hard to find it. I dont want to talk about shitty politics cuz i don't like it and my teacher said to talk about what you like. Idk what i like so maybe I'll get some ideas asking the internet. Pls help
