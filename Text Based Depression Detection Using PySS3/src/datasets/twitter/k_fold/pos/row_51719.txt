[Self Promotion] Are you tired of getting banned from political subreddits for having a different opinion than say, the mods? Then come over to r/FreedomOfPosting! Itâ€™s a freedom of speech subreddit that actually manages to pull the freedom of speech part off.

Discussions can vary from simple things like home decorating all the way to things like politics.

You can share your opinion on something and you wonâ€™t get banned for it!

**YOU CAN EVEN HAVE A BLATANTLY RACIST OPINION IN THE COMMENTS OF A POST AND YOU WONâ€™T BE BANNED BY THE SUBREDDIT MODERATORS.**

But that doesnâ€™t mean you wonâ€™t get mass downvoted or banned by Reddit mods.

Or have a terrible reputation with everyone on Reddit.

Thatâ€™s democracy bitch.

But uh... if you do get banned for your opinions, whatever they may be, tell me.
