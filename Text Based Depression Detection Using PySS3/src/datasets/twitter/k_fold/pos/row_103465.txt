Iâ€™m finally ending my life tonight. Everything is black, everything is empty. I feel nothing but emptiness. They did me so dirty itâ€™s fucked, that was the final straw for me. The body aches from the withdrawals are unbearable, I canâ€™t take it anymore. Everything got to me. I wish I couldâ€™ve done things differently.
