How do I find myself again Hi, I'm 18, graduated earlier this year, and Ive noticed that Its like I lost who I truly am, I haven't been acting myself and I recently hurt (not physically) my best friend and its over dumb stuff and I don't know why, and I just need to figure out how to sort through my woes and not act poorly towards my good friends over stupid stuff. Any advice as I'm currently having a mental breakdown in my friends garage
