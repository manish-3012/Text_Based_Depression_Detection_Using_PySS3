Every song is somebodyâ€™s favorite song Just think of the shittiest song youve ever heard, give it some thought, now take a moment to thing that, someone may absolutely fucking adore that song, it fucking blew my mind to think about it, especially with songs like LIVING LEGEND by Scarlxrd being a thing or just screamo rap, mumble rap, basically rap that is overwhelmed by bass boosting, shitty lyrics that you can barely understand, and then their fans. This is ultimately a complaint about my music choice being criticized by my family, when they literally sit through the bullshit my brother plays, including but not limited tooooooooo

Rap about drugs, murder, rape and other crimes
God awful country songs
The same 5 â€œoldiesâ€
Whatever the fuck chill step is

And my parents just eat that shit up, but the moment i play some anime shit they say â€œHow about we listen to some real musicâ€ and turn down the music in MY car, like bud i am driving, the radio is mine, it didnâ€™t automatically connect to your phone did it, thats what i thought 

Okay enough of that

How you guys been, also i might have covid lets goooo big dubskis for 2021
