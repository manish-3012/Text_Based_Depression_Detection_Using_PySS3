Ok, how do you get a girlfriend in this situation? You're studying in a school that is only boys, and you have no girl neighbour that you like, how the fuck do you guys even find your girlfriend like this, I know no girl irl or even on social media, I'm craving love but bruh i have not seen a single girl (my age) since 5th grade! Help me, fuck! 
Is there anyone in the same situation like me and have a girlfriend, if yes! how?
