My mom is being sexist and racist So I started growing my hair in quarantine and got hella appreciation fr the curls I got. Then my mum urges me to cut them because they are "too girly" and that "the curls make me look like a (N-word)". She said that the hair will cause pimples on my forehead, but wherever I check, it refers to oily and greasy hair, not long hair causing pimples. I wash my hair 3 times a week so I see no strength in her arguments. She grabs my hair every day and says, "I will cut this in your sleep." What to do? Don't suggest "stand up to her" "tell her" "find your arguments". I already do this.
