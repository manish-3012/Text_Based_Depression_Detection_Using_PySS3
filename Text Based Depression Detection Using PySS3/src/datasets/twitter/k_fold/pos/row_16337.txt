Life advice For all of you out there that think you can't do anything right.   
I know some of you try to be the best, but fail.   
Once this happens it's a sign that can't do good.  
For them who feel I'm talking to them I've got an advice:  
If you can't do good, better do bad well.  
Do you you're good at.  
If you can't do good, then be good at being bad, do bad well.
