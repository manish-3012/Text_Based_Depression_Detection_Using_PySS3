periods fucking suck :// not trying to ~gross~ anyone out but I am currently up at 3am because of the unbearable pain of cramps! this is genuinely the worst pain I have ever felt and I have experienced a fair amount of pain. I'm not asking for pity but just want everyone to have some sympathy for the women/people who have periods in their life bc I forgot how awful this is.
