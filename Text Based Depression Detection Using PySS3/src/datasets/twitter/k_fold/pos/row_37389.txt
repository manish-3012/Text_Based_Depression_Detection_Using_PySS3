I feel nice I sent a message to friend bc they had hinted towards things being a bit rough. I just assured them that im there if they need to talk or anything and they responded by saying 

"Yeah everything's fine here just a bit rocky. Im happy to know that you're there. Half the time I think your all jokes" 

Now I feel important and nice. 

Everyone is important and nice. Even you, yes you, your amazing and make a difference. Never forget it.
