Ranting about how stressed i am instead of doing my work Fuck this shit man. sorry that was harsh but honestly iâ€™m done. i just donâ€™t understand what the point of all if this schoolwork is. i have no motivation because iâ€™m not working towards anything tangible, itâ€™s just more schoolwork. iâ€™ve always gotten As and this will most likely be the first semester that i donâ€™t and i canâ€™t even decide if this all As stuff was my goal or my parents, and this virtual stuff just makes math and chemistry harder. also wtf i didnâ€™t have to take chemistry so why did I. Itâ€™s gonna end up being bs in ap world, chemistry and algebra. if i donâ€™t pull something absolutely ridiculous out off my ass in the next 2 weeks which doesnâ€™t seem impossible but iâ€™m questioning whether itâ€™s worth the stress. idk mabye iâ€™m just being dramatic as iâ€™m writing it out it doesnâ€™t seem that bad but then i actually get into and i just want to give up.
