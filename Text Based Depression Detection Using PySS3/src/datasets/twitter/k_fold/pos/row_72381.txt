I donâ€™t Iâ€™ve ever had a day in my life where I had felt so satisfied with as such well-executed plan So for context, Iâ€™m in my 6th period class and we are taking notes, and I guess I was writing these notes in the wrong place, and we had to turn them in. So I asked my teacher if the place I added the notes were okay, but she said that I couldnâ€™t do that, and it was due to the end of the period, which was at that moment, so I had to think of a plan. I decided to (intentionally) leave my lunchbox in the room, so that I had an excuse to go back to the classroom in my 7th period class (I have 7 classes, I donâ€™t know how it is with other people). Comes 7th period, I redo the notes and put them in the correct place, and I ask my teacher if I can go grab my lunchbox that I â€œaccidentallyâ€ left in my previous class, and he allows me to do that. I smuggle my paper with me as I move to get up from my chair, and I start to realize how am I going to turn this paper with notes on it, as my lunchbox was at the back of the (6th period) classroom, and the turn-in bin was around the front. But I had not other choice, so I had to work with it. I make it to the classroom, having a mental breakdown inside my head about how screwed I am, and I open the door and my teacher just says, â€œright next **to the bin.**â€ I have never felt so relieved when I heard that. I then grab the lunchbox and try to hide the fact that I was trying to turn in the assignment, and it just all completely felt like I was making a drug deal with someone! And I just walk out of the room, feeling so much satisfaction that I actually thought up of this plan to turn in an assignment that I had wrote on incorrectly. I mean, it was such an awesome feeling for me, I donâ€™t know if you guys wouldâ€™ve liked the story, but Iâ€™m still telling it!
