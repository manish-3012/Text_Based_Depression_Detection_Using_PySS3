I'm here to post something controversial and go to bed. cyberbullying doesn't exist cause you can turn off your device and then you can't see or receive it. your not depressed, you just a loser who wants attention, but says they don't cause you don't want it to be obvious that your faking it. your not a communist your in a phase. bulling isn't bad your just soft. words don't hurt your just weak. that's all. and I agree with what I say. now I gotta sleep and I have a migraine. see you in the morning.
