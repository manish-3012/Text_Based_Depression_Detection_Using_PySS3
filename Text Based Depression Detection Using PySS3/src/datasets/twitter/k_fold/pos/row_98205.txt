Daily rant because I canâ€™t find nothing to rhyme with and therefore canâ€™t make it into a song Iâ€™m numb inside, 
I donâ€™t feel nothing , 
it feels like if I was a robot or something
Like with no point in life , at least that I can comprehend



I am always self blaming ,
Like why donâ€™t I have friends?,because I never try
Why donâ€™t I try, because I have fear, why donâ€™t you get rid of your fear
Because fear is a cage ,well the keys are outside

This may contradict what I just said, but I feel like everything is out of my hands
Like if I couldnâ€™t do nothing, I blame myself For not doing the possible part ,then I blame god 
For not doing the imposible part 

To fill in with the last paragraph I feel like I am lost , I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life
So letâ€™s say , I want to be a singer (wich I do btw) then I am blaming myself for not doing enough maths
Or French in school, like that has nothing  to do with it ,I could just be rapping, making beats 24 /7 and still feel 
Like I am not doing enough,for not doing some pointless thing

Now transitioning into the school thing
Everyone says the only way for me to be successful is by education
Everyone tells me that being a singer or a rapper is unrealistic
That I wonâ€™t ever make a living with it  because I a, not good enough,
(Btw everyone is the voices in my head because I donâ€™t have anyone irl ,
Well actually the teachers tell me that too) 
But I think we have a different vision of success 
They see success as having money ,fame,prestige,
Even my closest â€œfriendâ€ thinks this way as if success 
Was having a big house,
But I see success as helping people and making myself happy
I think Iâ€™ll be more successful rapping earning 200 bucks a month
That on an office earning six figures a month .
What is yâ€™allâ€™s vision of success?

Also all the stress of school
For the last 3 weeks , Iâ€™ve had 10 exams , and next week I have 3 more
Most of yâ€™all will prob think this is insultingly low 
But for me , itâ€™s a lot , talking into account each subject tells us â€œ1 hour of study a day 
Thatâ€™s all you need â€œ  well 1x10 is 10 hours a day , 10 hours a day plus 7 hours of school is 17 hours
I take 2 hours of eating , 19 hours , 5 hours of sleep in total . And I havenâ€™t taken into account ,going to school
Or extra activities ,or even showering ,or HOMEWORK,wich in total would put us at -3 hours of sleep
Fair to say, i donâ€™t study daily , just the night before, 

So thatâ€™s been all for today , now Iâ€™m gonna keep wondering what has happened to me while I cry in my bedroom
Hugging my pillow, then blame myself for not studying,for a future I am being a pressured on







For me the biggest part of
