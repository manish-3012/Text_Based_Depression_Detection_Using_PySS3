I Feel Lonely Whenever someone talks to me its either a one sided conversation or they just stop responding, nobody ever goes of their way to talk to me it makes me feel like im being annoying, im always in my room feeling sorry for myself, sometimes i stop to see if they give a fuck, they dont, they go months without talking to me if i dont start first, im just rambling at this point im just tired of myself and others
