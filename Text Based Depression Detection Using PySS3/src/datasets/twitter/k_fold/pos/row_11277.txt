My emotional state is wacko Hey guys, recently I have been fantasizing about horrible things happening to myself (eg, situations where I died, killed myself, or my parents died) I'm really scared of myself and I don't want to open up as I know my parents won't understand, everything I've ever done in my life I've always bottled up, please help.

Edit: I forgot to add but I also have a lot of lustful thoughts and that I have a very weird step mum
