Public School Stories So public school is a strange place and I figured Iâ€™d tell you some stories.

The first is this one kid that whenever we had a sub would tuck himself in his sweater and waddle around on the classroom floor and under the desks grunting at people.

Next is when the art teacher asked what we did for christmas break and one kid said he killed spider man.

Next was the time we got a school shooting threat and the kid got arrested in front of his whole class.

Next is the time a bunch of kids gathered around a sewer drain and pulled it out of the ground then repeatedly said ninja turtles and pizza over and over again.

Next is the time some kid pushed another kid to school in a shopping cart and they locked it up at the bike rack. 

Oh letâ€™s not forget when the â€œdo you know the waeâ€ meme was popular some kid drew a bunch of [ugandan knuckles drawings](https://imgur.com/gallery/1FZlRlW) and put them all over the school 

There is a lot more stories, iâ€™ll post more later
