After 2 years of working, I finally made my schoolâ€™s top choir! I (16M) have just been selected to be in our schoolâ€™s top choir and I am so stoked!!

For context, I live in a small town where being in choir isnâ€™t weird/considered â€˜gay.â€™ (No offense intended, just the dynamic in some rural small-towns) We have 4 choirs in our school: Mixed Choir (full of freshman, no audition required), Womenâ€™s Choir (audition required, girls only), Honor Choir (audition required, more competitive for girls)
And last but definitely not least, we have a choir called Madrigals (or Mads), where an audition and a callback are required to make it.

In Mads there are 7 positions available in each section (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass) but usually 3-4 spots are taken by returning upperclassmen (they are guaranteed their spot for the next year). So making it into the choir is VERY competitive for each section.

Anyway, after working my way through mixed and honor choirs I made it going into this next (my Junior) year. I worked hard for it and after some VERY nerve-wracking auditions and callbacks I made it! 

Just wanted to celebrate a little bit. Hereâ€™s to a great start to the school year!
