Accidentally misspelled â€œmÃ©tierâ€ I accidentally misspelled it as â€œmÃ©tisâ€, donâ€™t make that mistake it translates to half-breed, so the sentence â€œun mÃ©tierâ€ â€œa businessâ€ turns into â€œun mÃ©tisâ€ â€œa half-breedâ€, thatâ€™s bad enough but when you get into sentences like â€œI own a businessâ€ it could get pretty bad, so donâ€™t do that, especially in Canada cuz it refers to â€œa person of mixed indigenous and Euro-American ancestryâ€
