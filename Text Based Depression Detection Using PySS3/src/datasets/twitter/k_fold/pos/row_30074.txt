I've not had a good start to 2021... But we can't let that define us. At the end of last year, I had one thing on my mind: surely it can't get any worse. Fuck me I was wrong. To lay it all out, on the 1st of Jan, my Grandma fell down the stairs (things were looking dire but she is recoving now, thank you NHS.) One of my in laws got cancer, I haven't seen my friends since last November, my anxiety is ramping up again after I thought I'd beaten it, two of my family have lost their jobs, we've had to sell our stuff to make ends meet, we might not be able to afford a new house despite finalising the sale on my childhood home we built up and poured so much into over 14 years, I've been sick from the vaccine for what feels like forever and my dog, who's been by my side for 8 years and grown up with me has been diagnosed with heart disease, for which we're unsure we can afford the meds for. Sure, he's on the older side but we thought we'd get another 4 years out of him at least. That one hit me hard.

Im keeping on but I don't know how much I got left in me, whatever it is though, its enough. 

This isn't a pity post, it's here to show you that no matter how shit things can get:

 one: believe it or not and be ready for it, they can get worse. 

Two: you just gotta keep on, help those around you because they're going through it too. No matter what. Just keep on. If you're not doing it for them, do it for me. 

One way or another, we'll get out of this and when we do, we'll be stronger. ðŸ‘Š ðŸ’ª Much stronger.
