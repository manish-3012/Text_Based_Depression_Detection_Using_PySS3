How smoking weed ruined my life Last year I smoked weed for the first time. It was on a school trip. We went to see a film. I smoked with a couple of my friends before going in a tram to get there.

The time it took us to get there was only around 15 minutes but it felt like hours. I was extremely nervous the whole time. I was scared. Looking back I think I experienced a panic attack.

I thought I was watching myself from behind me in third person. I felt detached from my body.

So we go see the film and everything turns out fine.

But that feeling of being detached from my body never left me. For months my life felt like a movie. The world just didn't feel real. Open spaces outside felt extremely overwhelming. I thought I was going insane. I felt psychotic.

This has gotten a little better over time. I still feel that way. It just isn't as extreme as before. And I still do feel extreme depersonalization/derealization from time to time.

This feeling and some other things in my life have made me suicidal.

So don't smoke weed. It isn't worth it.
