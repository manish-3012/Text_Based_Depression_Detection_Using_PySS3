To all art teens Don't you hate it when you have just no inspiration to draw, or you know what to draw but then just don't do it? Yeah, its bad. Because of the lockdown and summer vacation, i have more time to draw stuff, but i just don't do it for some reason. Can someone help me over this so called 'art-block' please, i am going nuts while being bored.
