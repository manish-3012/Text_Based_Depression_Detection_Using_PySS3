guys my crush voluntarily sat next to me today, like we were told to move around and she chose meeeee :)))) LESSS GOOOOOOO 

pls tell me weâ€™re not just friends, it was the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me this year without doubt, she came over to me and sat next to me on the same chair as me, thatâ€™s gotta be flirtatious right? surely it is, i really hope it is
