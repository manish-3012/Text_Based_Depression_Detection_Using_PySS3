Idk I just feel like shit I donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. I donâ€™t enjoy talking to my friends like I used to. I donâ€™t have the energy to workout or make resin or bake. I donâ€™t feel happy talking to my best friend anymore. I donâ€™t have the energy to do school. I donâ€™t even have the motivation to get out of bed some days. I cry out of nowhere. I skip meals. I even gave up a shopping and lunch day with my dad because I didnâ€™t feel like going out. 

I just feel like no one gives a shit about me. Or it feels like Iâ€™m being used. The more I think about it, the more I stress about it. My mom keeps asking me whatâ€™s wrong, and I keep saying Iâ€™m fine. But Iâ€™m not fine. I need help and donâ€™t know where to get it. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone the way I am. It feels like I canâ€™t talk to anyone about this because Iâ€™m supposed to be fine. Iâ€™m almost 4 years clean, I have great grades, Iâ€™m going to graduate and start college soon, Iâ€™m supposed to be fine right? I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.
