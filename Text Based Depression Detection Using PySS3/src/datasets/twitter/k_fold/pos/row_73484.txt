Growing up is weird For my whole life Iâ€™ve been the youngest in my family, not the youngest in my grade, but I was born in 2004 while half of the grade was 2003. I was used to being the little kid born in 2004

But now as a junior in high school, I met someone who was born in 2010, and I had a revelation that people were born after 2004. Like wtf? Iâ€™m not the center of the world? Shocking

Idk itâ€™s just weird that kids are born in the 2010s. Iâ€™ve always been aware of kids younger than me, itâ€™s just knowing their birth year is weird...
