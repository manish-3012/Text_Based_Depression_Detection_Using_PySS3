Here's a facts about myself Fact 1: As far I can remember I have had 18 crushes in total so far, and there are some cases where I have crushed on the same person before

Fact 2: I have crushed on 10 different people

Fact 3: I've been in a relationship once, but I think twice my memory isn't that well. But I don't really count those two, due it was in middle school

And just a reminder most common crushes last between two weeks( I think) and 4 months
