I am NOT one of those people who can stay up all night and still be okay the next day not matter how much I convince myself I am I literally feel like the quality of my thoughts go down when I only have like 3 hours of sleep. When I sleep at 3 or something I feel like I have to make up for it by waking up at 12. Then itâ€™s all okay somehow because I still got the right amount of sleep in.
