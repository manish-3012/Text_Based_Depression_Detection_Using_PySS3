Study, Anime, and Gaming Discord Hi, i've created my first discord server and was looking for people to try it out and see if it's set up correctly. Anyone down to critique my server? I also need more friends T-T.

Intended as a **study/fun** server for high school and college students who want to have study groups and reward that work with anime discussions, games, etc. 

(I'm personally looking for upper high school or college-aged friends)

 ð—ªð—µð—®ð˜ I ð—¼ð—³ð—³ð—²ð—¿:

\- It's well organized  
\- study groups  
\- memes  
\- Weekly random questions  
\- aesthetics?  
\- Seasonal Anime discussions  
\- Valorant (all irons welcomed)  
\- Among us  
\- Voice channels for various games  
\- Vibe to music channels  
\- Slightly Naruto Themed
