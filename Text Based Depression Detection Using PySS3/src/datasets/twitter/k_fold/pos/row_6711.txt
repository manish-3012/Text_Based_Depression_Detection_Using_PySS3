Who is wrong? Yesterday night my parents decided to say that I use my phone too much everyday. They said that because I â€œused my phone too muchâ€ yesterday. So hereâ€™s how much I used my phone.

Today I woke up at 3:00pm because the night before we had a party that lasted until 4:00am and I went to sleep at 5:00am. When I woke up, I got in new chlothes, used my phone to watch YouTube for at most 20 minutes, because there wasnâ€™t anything else to do, and we left to go to this restaurant. 

On the way to the restaurant I used my phone, but only to listen to music, which was no different than what they were doing on the carâ€™s radio.

At the restaurant, I did not use my phone at all.

On the way home from the restaurant, I used my phone to listen to music again which as I said before, is no different from what they were doing.

Finally, we get home. I pump up my air bed and relax while they lie on their bed. They watch a 4 hour movie about Jesus and Moses and bible stuff, while I watch YouTube videos on my phone about policing and law stuff (because Iâ€™m into that and I want to learn from it and I have learned from it.) for that amount of time. When it was time to sleep, they told me that my eyes were red from watching the phone for too much, even though I usually get itchy eyes from my allergies. Then they tell me that spending too much time on screens is bad for your health and that tomorrow I wonâ€™t be able to use my phone at all (Iâ€™m writing this in the bathroom).

I think this is bullshit because they sat staring at a screen for 4 hours just like I did, and I barely did anything today that is different from what they usually do/ have done. Who is wrong? Give me truthful answers, it wonâ€™t hurt my feelings.
