Bad Breath I'm genuinely baffled my my older brother's bad breath. Someone tell him to eat some walnuts. 

So my(14f) brother(16m) always throws tantrums when he's angry, and he gets angry we're just joking around with him often. Yesterday he took a nap for 6 hours from 2:30pm to 8:30pm and my sister, dad, and I were joking with him, and he got way too frustrated and angered in the moment.

Anyway, I, being the direct, youngest child that I am, commented on him storming out. He, in turn gets super close to my face to the point our noses are touching, and starts tearing into me. I didn't really care, but his breath was really, really bad. Probably because he had joke woken up, but still. Like, why does his breath always stink? And why do I know his breath always stinks? Idk.

I thought about backing away but i had to assert dominance and instead I just thought of headbutting him Tanjiro style. I didn't, I just waited until he finished and then said another thing because he was being a twat, and then he brought up every issue he'd ever had with me, so I walked away before we got into a proper fight. 

I realize this a really stupid story of a small interaction I had with my brother, but I seriously don't know why his breath always smells bad. Whenever I smell it (which isn't often lol, usually it's just like when he's showing me a video on his phone and we're close together or smt) it's always rancid. He also has to brush after every meal because teeth stuff, so why does it's smell so bad? I asked him once and he said it was the dried spit in his invisiliners, but like, wash them??? Please??? For your sake?? You kiss your girlfriend with that mouth, bro.

I'm not really asking for advice or anything, i just wanted somewhere to talk about this with that probably won't backfire in my face. 


Tl;Dr my brother angrily got into my face and I just couldn't fathom his stinky breath
