Iâ€™m not sure why but it doesnâ€™t feel right labeling myself as an introvert Like yeah Iâ€™m alone all the time but you also have to take in to account that I donâ€™t get drained from talking to people which is something Iâ€™ve heard that happens to introverts. Maybe Iâ€™m not super extroverted because Iâ€™m not really social or anything. No one fucking likes me and I over think everything I say. Anyways I donâ€™t know why I feel the need to even worry about this shit. Itâ€™s just that almost everyone on here says theyâ€™re introverted and maybe I somehow am too because Iâ€™m on here too??
