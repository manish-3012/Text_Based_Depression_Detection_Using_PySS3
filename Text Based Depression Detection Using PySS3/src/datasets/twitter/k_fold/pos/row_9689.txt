My girlfriend doesnâ€™t seem to care about me at all. What do I do? My girlfriend never makes any attempt to text me or make time to hangout with me. 

In the 5 months weâ€™ve been together we have hung out TWICE. Sheâ€™s apparently busy working all the time and doing school. But youâ€™re supposed to make time for your SO in a relationship.

Iâ€™m absolutely crazy about her. Being a demisexual, Iâ€™ve fell in love with her over our friendship and now that I finally asked her out itâ€™s like weâ€™ve hung out less!

I canâ€™t stand not seeing, talking, or having physical contact. Iâ€™m not sure she actually feels the same and just said yes so I wouldnâ€™t be affected. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve asked so many times if sheâ€™s free and then she just tells me that sheâ€™ll let me know when sheâ€™s free. She posts on her Instagram of her hanging out with our mutual friends. So obviously she isnâ€™t telling me. 

I donâ€™t know if I should talk to her about it or just tell her weâ€™re done. I really like her but maybe she isnâ€™t the person I thought she was. My likeness for her slowly fading but every time I see her I canâ€™t help but remember how much I really want to be with her.

Itâ€™s like we went from best friends to boyfriend/girlfriend to nothing.

Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do or say?
