I broke my streak Oh my god i cant with my mom, everything that happens to her is my fault, i was self harm clean for two months awhile back and shit went downhill fast, i cant stop cutting, i started drinking every chance I got, i just don't know what to do with life at this point....So i started to try to go sober again, i was good for a week then broke it when my razor decided it was time  again, i tried professional help but nothing works for me, why does anyone have to go through this.
