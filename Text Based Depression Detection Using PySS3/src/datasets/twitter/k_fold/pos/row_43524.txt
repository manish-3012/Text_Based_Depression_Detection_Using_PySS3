6 years old owning a phone Sorry in advance for my possible grammar and spelling mistakes, I am not a native speaker (French).

One of my cousin is 6 years old and own a phone since last year. She has snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and worst of all... tik tok
She spends her whole day watching some weird toys reviews, taking selfies and filming herself dancing with her older cousin (12).

She has 40go of data, and unlimited calls and messages. It might not sound like a lot for you, but where I live (in Martinique, a French island in the Caribbean) it is more than 50 euros (nearly 60 dollars).

I DONâ€™T GET IT

I had to wait until I was 12/13 to get one. I know some of you got theirs a lot later, but thatâ€™s not the point. 
The thing is that she doesnâ€™t play outside, or even with the toys she watches reviews of. 
She even has someone to play with her. Before she got her phone, her brother who is 13 would play 24/7 at any game she wants

Her parents failed their first child education. The only reason why he is a wholesome person I because heâ€™s parents would be tired of him and just sent him to his grandparents.
They are doing the same but worst by replacing the love and education of grandparents with a phone.
I donâ€™t understand how they think this is a good idea to treat a phone as a babysitter
