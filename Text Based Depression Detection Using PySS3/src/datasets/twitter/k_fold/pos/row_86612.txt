Are you Edward Cullen? Cause I wanna pin you to the ground with a stake through the chest and tell all the things that are wrong with him because VAMPIRES DON'T FUCKING SPARKLE, THEY NEED PERMISSION TO ENTER YOUR HOMES AND IF YOU THROW RICE OR MARBLES OR SHIT ON THE GROUND THEY HAVE TO PICK IT UP AND COUNT IT! BETCH'A DIDN'T KNOW THAT ONE, HUH STEPHANIE MEYERS! ALSO WHY THE FUCK DO YOU GO TO HIGHSCHOOL WHEN YOU COULD BE SPENDING YOUR IMMORTAL LIFE TRYING TO CURE CANCER OR SOMETHING? IS IT TO WATCH GIRLS? WHY ARE YOU A MASSIVE CREEP AND WHY IS BELLA INTO IT? WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THESE CHARACTERS?!


















It's better then Fifty Shades of Grey at least.
