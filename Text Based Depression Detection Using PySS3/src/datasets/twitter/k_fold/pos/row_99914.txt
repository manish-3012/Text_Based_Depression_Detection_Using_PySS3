wish me luck lads me and my best friend are going to be learning Tolkien Elvish throughout 2021 because why not. I've got a sidarin dictionary and I'm in the process of searching up how to pronounce the syllables in the elvish language. if there are any people who know elvish your help is welcome. wish me luck lads
