Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 76: Johnny Cash Cash was a great singer of the 1950's and 60's and write many classics such ad "Ring of Fire." However, the name of that song has a little dark irony to it.

In the mid 1960's, Cash was on a fishing trip with his nephew. We know for sure that Johnny got cold so he lit a fire. Soon after, 500 acres were burned to ash and 49 if the park's 53 California Condors were dead, nearly driven to extinction by this.

In court, Cash pleaded that his truck exhaust has broken and caused the fire, but he was still found guilty and charged $82,000.

Must have been one hell of a ring of fire.
