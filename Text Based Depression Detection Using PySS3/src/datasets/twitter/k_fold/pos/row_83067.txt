Why should I even live anymore All people do is make fun of me and bully me. Everyday. In person and social media. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m ugly. I wish I could get plastic surgery. Iâ€™m sorry my nose is so huge. I canâ€™t afford a nose job. :( I canâ€™t live with myself anymore, I canâ€™t look in the mirror anymore. The bullies win, Iâ€™m done
