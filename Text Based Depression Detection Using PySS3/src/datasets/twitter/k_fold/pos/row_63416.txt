I just read my first fanfiction I feel like I'm at the point of no return now. I will forever be changed. Slowly spiraling into insanity, until the inevitable end shall consume me. One day I fear the dark side shall seduce me with it's fur suits and and body pillows and yiffing and ship wars. 

I'm on sordid path that shall darken my soul and corrupt my virtue.
