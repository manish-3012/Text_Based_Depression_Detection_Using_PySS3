I did an experiment with the Placebo effect As I was going up to my bedroom, my sister took my pillow (I have two pillows) because hers was â€œuncomfortableâ€. Now, that pillow that she took is extremely comfortable and she felt a lot happier with it she said. 

I took the pillow back and she started to get very grumpy. She threw her pillows on the floor and started mumbling some stuff that I couldnâ€™t hear. She became extremely upset over the pillow.

Because she is young, I thought it would be interesting to do an experiment on her because she doesnâ€™t think a lot. She just does stuff. I changed the pillow covers so she had my cover and I had hers.

I then gave it back. She seemed delighted and started blabbering about how comfortable it was and how the other pillow hurt her neck whereas this one was perfect. She thought that it was the same pillow that she took from me whereas in reality, it was the pillow she was complaining about.

She is happily snoring and I have no intention of ever telling her about it.

It is very interesting how the brain works.
