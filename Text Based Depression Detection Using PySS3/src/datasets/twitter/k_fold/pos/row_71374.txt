I'm just going to rant about how perfect my friend is for a minute. I really fucking love him He is so sweet. I feel so safe and vulnerable with him. I'm the happiest I've been in a really fucking long time. He doesn't make me feel bad about my self harm, he doesn't make me promise him I'll stop (I try my best not to do it anymore, and I like to take thing one day at a time. I don't want to make a promise if I'm not sure I'll be able to keep it.)  

He always makes sure that we are both comfortable while we are sexting. I love how even at our most awkward moments, he still manages to make me feel cared for. He is so great at sexting, he always says the most romantic things. 

He lives so far away, I can't fucking stand it. I want to be with him every second of the day. I want to kiss him and hug him and tell him how much I love him. I want to do cute little romantic things with him. I want him to play with my hair and I want to hold his hand. I want him to be mine.
