If youâ€™re feeling stressed/down ur not alone. This week has been nothing difficult and really stressful. 
Iâ€™ve had issues at my work regarding scheduling and miss communication so I got my ass chewed about not showing up on Tuesday when I was never told I was working Tuesday. 
I have no idea how to do the work in 3/4 of my classes so my assignments Iâ€™m turning in p much are just guess work. 
I just feel like Iâ€™m not doing adequate enough in my own life, and  it doesnâ€™t feel great. 
This is not all of what has been on my mind, instead these are two things that keep dwelling over me. 
Probably seems like Iâ€™m just nagging, but man, I needed to vocalize this somewhere.
