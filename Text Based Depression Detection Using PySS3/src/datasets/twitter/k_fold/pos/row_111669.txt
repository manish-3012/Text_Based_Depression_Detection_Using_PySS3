This or that? Soooo...... how should I put this, Iâ€™ve started to get a liking of this girl in my school and I think that she does but Iâ€™m getting the same vibes as from the three other girls that broke my heart and made me get trust issues. Weâ€™ve been hanging and have known each other for a long time but Iâ€™m afraid that she will break my heart or play with my feelings as the rest and that makes me feel so bad cause I really like her. I canâ€™t decide what I should do, should I say the truth and maybe get a no or should end our friendship cause It pains me to be friend with someone I like a lot! So Iâ€™m asking for advice on this cause maybe you people know better? So what should I do?
