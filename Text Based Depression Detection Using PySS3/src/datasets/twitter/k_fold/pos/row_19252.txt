Suggesting yâ€™all a song everyday until I run out of ideas, day 3 Was supposed to be yesterday but Iâ€™ll just double post today I guess. So: todayâ€™s song is [Pink Moon](https://open.spotify.com/track/16qzGrIMWoxerw2gnW0zuv?si=c9e439loQXmjInypohbgeg) by Nick Drake. Itâ€™s very simple yet so complex. And it always makes me tear up a bit.
