A room in your house you never seen before You walk through a door and suddenly all the surroundings bring on vague memories. You are certain you seen this room when you were a tot. Old toys you lost, Drawlings and objects that seem immediately familiar. Your old childhood pet comes running up to you and looking into its eyes you can help but burst into tears. "How could i have abandoned you, forgotten about you, lost all those years with you". But you suddenly find yourself regrounded by the sight of a cramped opening. Squeezing through it you find it gets larger and larger and you find yourself tripping and falling. But you are caught by a tubular slide which you fall right back down to a new room. 

Rusty, dimly lit, and old. Is this even your house anymore. You see two rusty beams stretching over a pit of muddy water. In the distance you see the siloutte of a man through the window of a small cubicle. You walk across the rusted beam to get a closer look but he spots you. You feel intense vibrations around you while adrenaline rushes through your body. The door swings open and a the silhouette chases after you. You try desperately to run across the beams but you are frozen in fear. Unable to scream, Unable to run and Your heart pounds out of your chest, your face cold as ice.
