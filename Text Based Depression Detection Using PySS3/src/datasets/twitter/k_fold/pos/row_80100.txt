Randonautica exploring So i just downloaded this weird exploring app called randonautica cuz i've seen some really interesting videos about it on tiktok and youtube.

You probably know those tiktok videos under the tag randonautica and how it sends you into weird places in the middle of nowhere and you get to see creepy shit or something like that

I wanna try this out with a friend of mine cuz it looks like stupid fun. We're probably gonna find nothing cuz most of the randonautica videos are fake and staged like 90% of the videos on the net

aaaand idk what else to do during this weird quarantine phase my country has (i do not live in the us) and yeah lol

hope i find something moderately interesting
