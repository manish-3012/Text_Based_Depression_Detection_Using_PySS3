I cant believe im only 3 years away from being a _fully matured_ and legalized adult I mean im only 15. I still feel like a kid. I literally feel nothing like an adult. It all feels the same as if i was a kid. I cant believe im _this_ close from being expected to buy my own cheese sticks and afford my own rent. Im not really at all. Im scared. Please help. I havent even got my first gf yet. Where tf do i start adulthood.
