I think I am loosing my best friend So I'm gonna start from the begging. During quarantine I felt super lonely like probably everybody else and I had this boy that I was talking to almost every day. You know something casual I didn't want anything romantic from it. And we became really close, u know he was my guy best friend. 

In the country where I live quarantine ended around June and we were able to go out and stuff. But I didn't have any friends but him at the time, that I can go out with, he offered me to hang out with his friends but I didn't want because they were really toxic. And after like 1, 2 months he and his other friend started going out with people that I knew(now keep in mind that im very introverted and can't connect to people that much). So in the end of summer I started hanging out with them. His friends were very nice. We had a great time, we became close. And most importantly I was feeling good around them. 

And then little by little he started acting really bad. I mean he is rude disrespectful of the things that I have done for him. He doesn't  ask me to hangout anymore. He lies when I ask him will u go out today. He changed. And I don't know why. When I go out whit him and now I can say our friends(because I became close with them too)I feel unwanted. And also I forgot that when he is not in town or is busy they always call me to hangout. I think its really him that has something against me. 

I don't know I feel lost, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. Which seems a little dramatic. I know if someone is acting like this u better leave them but if I stop being friends whit him I loose everybody else.

I know this is not a really big deal but I wanted to write it down. Now I feel way better! If somebody has something to say please say it it would mean a lot. &lt;3
