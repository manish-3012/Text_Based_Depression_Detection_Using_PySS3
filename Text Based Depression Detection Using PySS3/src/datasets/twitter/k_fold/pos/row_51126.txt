To all those teenagers that complains about having a small pp So I see a lot of people complaining about having small pp's,so that makes me quite mad,Im not trying to flex or anything but I do have quite a large one and it's a disadvantage,it's impossible to control it and it actually hurts a lot while I'm literally wearing anything and get hard,a few months ago I shattered my pant's button for an example so don't feel sad for having a small pp I have a large one but I really hate it,I mean my girlfriend does kind of complain about it because yknow 'it hurts' and stuff..
