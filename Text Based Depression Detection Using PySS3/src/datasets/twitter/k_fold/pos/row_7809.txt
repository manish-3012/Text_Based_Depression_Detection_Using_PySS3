How do you all say "twenty"? I was listening to the song "Part of your world" from The Little Mermaid and it struck me that in the song she says "Twenty", with an "e" sound. Twenny. It's mainly to make it rhyme but it did strike me that I almost never hear an e in that word, and certainly not the t. It's always "twunny".
