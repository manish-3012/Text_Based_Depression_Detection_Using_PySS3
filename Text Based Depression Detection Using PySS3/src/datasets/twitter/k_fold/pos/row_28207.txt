Yâ€™all need to pay attention in history class Yeah, America was founded by slave owners bc literally everyone owner slaves back then. Even then, there were still people who were against slavery, ever heard of the Missouri Compromise? If you somehow havenâ€™t, it was a feud between the northern and southern states about whether Missouri should be admitted to the union as a slave state or a free state and because of this, slavery was banned in the remaining territory bought in the Louisiana purchase, above a certain geographical line. Stop complaining about history, itâ€™s history, we canâ€™t change it, all we can do is study it and learn from the mistakes of those who came before us
