During the month of September, I listened to 1,000 songs that were posted to Reddit by independent musicians. Whenever I ran into one that blew me away, I added it to this playlist! I'd love to share it here with anyone interested. Hey guys, I am back with another spotlight! As usual, I found a few hidden gems that I would love to share with anyone interested. I have them separated by platform. Each platform has artists that are unique to it, but it also has some of the same ones. I hope you guys enjoy the music, and thanks for giving these musicians a chance!
