Barney from HIMYM is a man with great taste. Look at S4 Ep23.

He drives a Mercedes SL-Class according to the speedometer of that time and windshield. Also hood scoops are the same aswell.

From this and his apartment we can pretty much say that he has an amazing taste.

Why did I do this? Because I am bored.
