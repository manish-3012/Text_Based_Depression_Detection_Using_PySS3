I have four college apps due in less than two weeks and I wish I'd just stop existing I've been feeling shit for years now, I'm finally in therapy, but I think it's too late. I only started a few days ago. And I can't fucking do my essays and shit it's just so fucking hard I want to do them I want to do them so fucking badly but instead I lay in bed doing fuckall and every time I tell myself that I'm gonna start I just fucking can't I haven't handed in homework assignments I'm failing tests and I can't even do this one fucking simple thing why can't I do it what's fucking wrong with me

I just want to go to sleep and not have to wake up and deal with everything my life isn't even all that bad right now I'll admit it's not wonderful but it's sure as hell been worse why can't I do anything now when it counts when I fucking need to
