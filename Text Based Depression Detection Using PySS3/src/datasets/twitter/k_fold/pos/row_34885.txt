Weird start for today Mysterious woke up around 4:30 am (usually wake up around 11:00 am) for no reason. About 5 min later an earthquake decides to scare me to my core. With many little after shocks following. But itâ€™s all okay because I means I was awake in time to watch the perseverance launch. Weird morning so far.
