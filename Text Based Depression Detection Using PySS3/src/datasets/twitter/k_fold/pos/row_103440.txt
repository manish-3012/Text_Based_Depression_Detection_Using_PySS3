What should I expect on my permit test? (I live in California) Iâ€™m a California resident who will be taking their permit test next Monday.

Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the lockdown here and there and have been attentive to the road signs while my parents drive. Iâ€™d like to say I have a mildly good understanding of everything but have yet to finish the little AAA booklet my dad gave me to look over.  

What should I expect? Any suggestions as to what I should study and how to prepare?
