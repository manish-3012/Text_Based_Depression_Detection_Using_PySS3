My friends think I'm a pedo furry Ok so a couple of days ago I decided to download Nekopara. I decided to share it with my friends because why wouldn't you want to share Hentai with the boys. So they start of immediately by calling me a furry because cat girls. Then they find out that Chocola and Vanilla are 9 months old. I try to explain that in this world it isn't weird and that this isn't even real anyway. They still think I'm weird for spending $43 on "underage" cat girl Eroge. 

Now this is where I explain why this isn't weird. First of all, how the hell am I a furry. A furry is  an enthusiast for animal characters with human characteristics, in particular a person who dresses up in costume as such a character or uses one as an avatar online. I just like cat girls. Secondly there are two reasons I am not a pedo. The first one is that I'm still technically underage and I also did the maths and found out that, (using the info on the wiki and in game), that they are in fact legal. Really early on you find a cat girl help running a food stand and find out she is about 13-14 in cat years and 6-7 human months old. Using this we can estimate that in this world every human month is about 2 cat years. If you take that into account with Chocola and Vanilla that would make them 18 cat years making them legal. Thanks to listening to my Ted Talk justifying a Niche Fetish.
