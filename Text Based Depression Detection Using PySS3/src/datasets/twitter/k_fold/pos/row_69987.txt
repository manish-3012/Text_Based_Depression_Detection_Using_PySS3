I have a boyfriend! We went out on a date (covid guidelines followed it was a walk in a park.)
And he asked me out. Although I wanted to ask him out im so happy. I want to thank u/YandereKoala
u/SuperiorCommunist92 for motivating me. Even tho I didn't get to ask him out I told him I had plans to. I also want to thank u/cruud123 even though you told me to not ask him out. 
I think you guys are lovely.
