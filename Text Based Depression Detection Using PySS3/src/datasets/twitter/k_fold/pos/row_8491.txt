Male Privilege again... I made a post about male privilege earlier, but I didnâ€™t quite explain what it is.

Male privilege is being able to walk the streets without the fear of harassment. Itâ€™s being able to walk past a group of fellow men without fear of verbal or physical harassment. Male privilege is feeling safer than women. Overall male privilege is the lack of fear in public, doing things in public without fear. Without the fear of being raped, cat called by a creepy guy on a corner. 

I experience male privilege, and Iâ€™ve only just learnt what it is through my sister. Her telling me how she has to be extra cautious in public. She basically canâ€™t walk alone at night without the inevitable fear of being raped. 

Iâ€™m looking to better myself, to make a statement for men to understand. Donâ€™t be a fuckwit to women on the streets, imagine going about your daily business. A stranger does something than an instant chill of vulnerability and weakness comes over you. Thatâ€™s what my sister described male privilege as not being worried by the small things. But for men they may be small but for others they are huge.

Be better boys, for the people you love. Your mother, sister, girlfriend or friends. 

Cut the snarky remarks, try to be less intimidating.

Be better thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m asking.
