I woke up at the same time as my boyfriend just now!! (LDR) I originally woke up from a nightmare but i checked my phone for the time and i saw a text from a minute before i woke up and im like... no freaking way! I opened his text and i started telling him its like he summoned me and it was so cool! Like i was so confused too because my phone was on silent and he was shocked too! (Idk if this matters but it was 7am where i lived and 6am where he lived. We texted for a lil bit but we agreed to go back to sleep and get some more rest. However before i do sleep i really wanted to share this because it made me so happy and i wonder if this happened to any other ldr couples! Anyways im going to get a bit more sleep. :3
