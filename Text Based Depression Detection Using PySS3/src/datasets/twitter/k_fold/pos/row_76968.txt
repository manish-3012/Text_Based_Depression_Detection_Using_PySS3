I thought about drinking for the first time in 6 months. I started drinking when I was about 13, I was living in another country and lot of other stuff was happening at the time as well and drinking kinda just helped me push through the stress, I got through all of that shit and moved to New Jersey when I was 15, and while all the stress was gone, I didn't stop drinking whenever I had the chance to, which with there being a seemingly never ending supply of alcohol due to my Mother's drinking habits, no one ever noticed anything missing, no one approached me or mentioned anything, I started dating my current Girlfriend a year later and I was doing good in school, had a lot of friends, but nothing seemed to satisfy me more than drinking, I felt empty without having a beer or some wine, time passed and I had barely graduated from High School and was feeling very pumped to celebrate, that night I drank way too much, I cried, got angry at myself for reasons I won't explain, felt like a failure, punched a hole in my closet door that's still there, then passed out, and never mentioned to anyone, until now, the morning after I quit cold turkey and needless to say, it sucked a lot, but after I started feeling better I started working out, I started taking playing music more seriously, started looking for a job, and things were looking up, cut to last night, where I was in my room, thinking about how far I've come, and how much better things would get soon, and I just felt like drinking to celebrate, and while nothing came out of it, I'm still very angry at myself for thinking about it, after all this time and effort I've put in to get my shit together I still thought about it, and it's just really getting to me to the point that I feel the need to just let it all out, so yeah, that was it, thanks for reading I guess, stay safe.
