As someone with Aspergers, â€˜when the autistic kidâ€™ memes can really sting I understand that jokes are jokes and I donâ€™t think certain things should be off limits for humor but a lot of these memes are just at the expense of people with autism and laughing t rather than with them. They only further add to the stigma of autism and make it harder to be open about my diagnosis when a lot of people I know who donâ€™t know about my diagnosis view autism as some thing that makes you a non-thinking savage and feed that view. Maybe Iâ€™m just too sensitive and should shut up whinging but when I see that sort of attitude around autism, it can really sting.
