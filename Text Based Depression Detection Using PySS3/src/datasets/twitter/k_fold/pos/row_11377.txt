I just sent my crush a Fitbit friend request then blocked her Oh fuck. I was bored and looking at stuff on the Fitbit app. I looked at friends and I accidentally pressed add friend. I then blocked her because that was the only way I could find to cancel. Sheâ€™s gonna see the notification and think Iâ€™m so Weird. Then sheâ€™s gonna see that I blocked her and think Iâ€™m even weirder.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
