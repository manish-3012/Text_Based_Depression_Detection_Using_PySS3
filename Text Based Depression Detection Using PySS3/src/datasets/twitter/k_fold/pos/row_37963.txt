r/PETA shadowbanned me I want to make something explicitly clear: I am in no way against PETA's message and ideology. I find fault in how they conduct themselves.

With that out of the way...

About a month ago, I posted a question on the subreddit. I wanted to know why PETA supports vegan diets for cats and dogs even though doing so, could lead to death. It may seem hard to believe, given PETA's reputation, however, I truly wanted to get answers and spark discussion.

Instead, I get shadowbanned. I only realised this now, because I forgot about the post.

You can even go on hot in r/peta; you won't see my post even amongst the post from 25-29 days ago.

This is pretty suspicious conduct on the mods' part, and honestly, I made need to rethink my view on the group.

There are some good people, who believe in good things that are part of PETA, however, a few bad apples spoil the bunch.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to ask any questions.
