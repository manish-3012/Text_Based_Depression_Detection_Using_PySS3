I'm the only person in school wearing a mask My school isn't big. But this isn't an excuse to not wear a mask. My classmates think that "Flu Is MoRe DaNGERouS" and "YoU nEeD to ChaNGe ThE MasK evErY TwO HoUrS foR It tO aCtUalLy woRK". Oh, and still we can't wear hoodies because it's "disrespectful" but we don't have to wear a mask.
