You know that feeling when you used to have big feelings for a girl who at the time was dating a guy who youâ€™re currently best friends with while at the same time you were best friends with the girl and their relationship ended in a toxic end and you ended up dropping the girl and months later missed her and questioned if you still had feelings for her while your best friend still is hung over her and the breakup and itâ€™s kinda weird cause he knew you liked her and doesnâ€™t know that you actually liked her still when they were dating but itâ€™s not THAT bad because you lost the feelings and never acted on them but now you just kinda feel weird around him because of it but you also miss having the girl as a friend but it canâ€™t happen because sheâ€™s youâ€™re best friends ex and she kinda used you in a way and also that when you were friends with her you got so close with her that people started spreading rumors and thinking that you two were doing something in the background which was amplified by the fact that the entire school knew that you had big feelings for her before plus the fact that youâ€™re scared you might catch feelings again in a fucked up situation.
