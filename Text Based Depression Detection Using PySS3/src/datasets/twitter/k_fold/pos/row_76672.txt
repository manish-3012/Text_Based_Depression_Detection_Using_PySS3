I have question Is it only me but even tho every one say it's good to tell your emotions I'm just scared? Just scared that someone say man up/ you are just a child you don't know f*** about life, then they will joke with friends and friends with their friends ect. I mean I have good parents but I just can't something in me say no it's stupid you will regret that
