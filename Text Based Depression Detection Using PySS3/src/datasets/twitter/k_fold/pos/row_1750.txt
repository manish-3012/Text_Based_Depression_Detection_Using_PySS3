Just realised i lost my dream girl Today, in a group chat, i realised that my dream girl has a relationship with my friend. I was her friend for 4 years now, and i couldn't ask her out, i was too scared of the consequences.
Well, now it's a lost dream.
So advice for all of you:
If you know that's she's the one - go for it. Don't think about the consequences. You will be more dissapointed if you never ask her out.
