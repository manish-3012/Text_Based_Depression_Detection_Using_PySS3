Competitive CS:GO can be cancer sometimes I was desperately trying to get out of silver one, some dude kept yelling at me about being trash, even though he was bottom fragging, and I was number two on the leader board. So, itâ€™s 15-14, match point, MOTHERFUCKER BOUGHT AN AUTO, THE ENTIRE ENEMY TEAM HAD RIFLES. I just said â€œBruh, donâ€™t lose this.â€ And he goes â€œIM GonNA loSe JUsT BecAUse yoU SAiD tHAtâ€ AND RUSHES AT THE ENEMY TEAMS BOTTOM FRAGGER WITH A FUCKING KNIFE, GETS DICKED, AND FUCKING LAUGHS ABOUT IT. Like how can someone be that much of a fucking tumor. THEN HE UNIRONICALLY ASKED ME TO TRADE HIM MY CASES FOR LITERALLY NOTHING IN RETURN. HOW THE ACTUAL FUCK DO THESE PEOPLE EXIST.
