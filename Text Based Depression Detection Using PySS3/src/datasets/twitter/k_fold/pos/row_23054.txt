My teacher is asking us the impossible So, my Music teacher gave us a performance task (35% of grades) by telling us to sing Franz Schubert's ErlkÃ¶nig. 

Here's the catch: we sing it in English. The textbook already has lyrics, but it couldn't even match up to the beats of the song, making it harder to do. Even if we manage to somehow sing it, is it really worth a 35%? The final output would be sounding so shitty.

Sorry if I sounded like a whiny bitch in this one, just wanted to vent about non-important stuff.
