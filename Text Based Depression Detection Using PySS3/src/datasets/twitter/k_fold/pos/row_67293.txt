So my friend and I have started a subreddit that would be a place for teenagers to meet. I know it isn't much, but we do need a way to spread the word. Here is the subreddit: r/teenfriendships. 


We do plan on starting a discord too, but there is no point doing so if there is no one to be in it, so if you feel like making some new friends then you could join our subreddit.


Thanks to y'all
