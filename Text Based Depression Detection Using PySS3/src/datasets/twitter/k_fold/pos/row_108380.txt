I donâ€™t understand how fear mongering has such a massive effect on people Just because a political ad tells you â€œBiden is trying to destroy Godâ€ and â€œTrump wants to kill minoritiesâ€ doesnâ€™t mean they actually are. I mean, so many politicians are saying Trump is trying to destroy America, but even though it obviously isnâ€™t true, SO many people have bitten into it.
