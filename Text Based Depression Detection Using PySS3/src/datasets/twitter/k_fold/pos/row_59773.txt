I feel like I can't trust my best friend's parents anymore. Earlier today, I was on a call with my best friend. During the call, I got upset, and he was trying to help me calm down. He said he was gping out later, then his parents came in, I barely heard them talking.

I couldn't calm down. I got more and more upset that I let out a scream at the top of my lungs. He then said he was grounded and immediately hung up.

His parents really don't care when I'm upset. It's just "their way or the highway." Whenever he tries to help me and then his parents want him to do something else, he tries to help me as much as he can but then he ends up getting grounded. It's important that you're nice to your friend's families, but also that they do the same back... and I feel like that's not the case.

He gets grounded often when he's just trying to be my best friend and help me. The fact that his parents are constantly taking that away is really breaking my heart.

To sum things up, his parents have really been breaking my heart lately, and, in my perspective, my trust with them as well.
