The worst day of my life Hey guys, an hour ago I heard that my gf (in lika month we would have 1 year anniversary) has another bf (for 3 Months now). And damn I'm just dead, seriously dead. I mean I could write now how fucked up I'm right now but u can imagine it. So any advise how I can go to school tomorrow and not staying in bed for a month crying?
