Iâ€™m feeling a bit lonely right now and want some help but donâ€™t know what I want help with. So today was a school day for but Iâ€™m sick so I stayed home. I havenâ€™t had a lot of human contact today and needing to vent.

Iâ€™m only 16 and I feel like Iâ€™m wasting my life, Iâ€™m really really talented and grew up in a really good home. I have a few friends a boyfriend and Iâ€™m taking law and business classes. I have access to a lot of money and a lot of people that can easily help me in life.
Because of all this I feel that I should be doing more with my life right now like ruining a business or charity and I know I can. All I do is get my homework done and look at YouTube. 
I have tried giving myself a project or job to do but i just give up and tell myself that I didnâ€™t need to do it in the first place.
I donâ€™t want to waste my life and I always feel alone when Iâ€™m not with my boyfriend or mother, they have their own lives though so I canâ€™t spend all my time with them. 
When it comes to my other friends their nice people but I have a lot of trouble holding a conversation with them. Iâ€™m autistic and that manly affects my communication and so does my dyslexia. So talking with them alway end up awkward.
I donâ€™t know what to do or feel right now but if you have advice that would be great.
Thank you if bothered to read this and sorry if my English was bad, iâ€™m dyslexic.
