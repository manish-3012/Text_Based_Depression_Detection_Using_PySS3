One day,

2: &gt;!vigorously arousing!&lt; &gt;!menacingly challenging!&lt; &gt;! beating !&lt; &gt;!romantically fondling!&lt; &gt;!pissing off!&lt;

3: &gt;!a fat drunk nonce!&lt; &gt;! my kids (at chess)!&lt; &gt;! the local yelling crackhead!&lt; &gt;!Joe Biden's leg hairs!&lt;&gt;!Gilbert, the trade-in guy from GameStop with a neckbeard!&lt;

when suddenly

4: &gt;!edp445!&lt; &gt;!the kind stranger!&lt; &gt;!Charli d'amelio with her fakeass smile!&lt; &gt;!this weird "glow boob" guy!&lt;&gt;!@ realDonaldTrump!&lt;

9: &gt;!to where the sun don't shine!&lt; &gt;!all the way to Algeria, wherever the hell that is!&lt; &gt;!until it became a mere stain on the carpet!&lt; &gt;!all the way back to musical.ly!&lt; &gt;!so far they won't even have to wear a mask!&lt;
