any advice? About to being rejected by my crush :3 so I started french classes and for some reason the teacher make us turn on the camera, think that is like meh at the begging but now chill
well the fact that is one girl that is soooo pretty, idk nothing about she, maybe kill puppies idk, but she is sooo pretty
so I don't found a way to talk to she
and it's kinda weird, i'm good with this kind of things I'm very frontal but I guess this time i'm like beetween the sword and the wall

BUT I have a plan: just someday write a message like "hey I think you are so pretty, hope you having a good day :3"

problem A: I'm in a superintensive course so is like speedrunning french and all the proyects are by one and so much homework and no time

problem B: i never talked to she

problem C: (lol ironically a happy face) she looks or so tired or so done or so angry all the time, looks like she is mean or she needs a hug, I'm in the way to see which one
