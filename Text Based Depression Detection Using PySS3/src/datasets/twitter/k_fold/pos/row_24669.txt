How do I start enjoying life again? So yeah, Iâ€™m not really enjoying my day to day life. Itâ€™s not like I feel miserable, but I amnâ€™t feeling so hot. I think it might be partially due to the fact that Iâ€™m not working on any new projects right now, but also because Iâ€™m in virtual classes, &amp; I also have two on campus classes. It all feels like an annoying chore going back &amp; forth, &amp; I donâ€™t know how long I can take it. Any tips? Thanks!
