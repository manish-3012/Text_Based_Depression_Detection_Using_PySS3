Thanks, I have trust issues now A few weeks ago this group of girls came up to me when I was going to the store. The asked me if I want to be friends with them and hang out. Me, who's beraly ever had female or any friends, said yes. We talked for a bit, they gave me their ig and even made a short story with me. I thought it was legit and they just wanted to be nice and maybe really become friends with me.

Later that day I contacted them again and asked them if they want to go out somewhere. 
They laughed at me and told me they just wanted Instagram followers and a guy they can post on their stories. They didn't understand why I was pissed off and told me I should be grateful because they followed me back on ig.
Now I feel like every person that tries to befriend me is just playing me for cloud or something.
