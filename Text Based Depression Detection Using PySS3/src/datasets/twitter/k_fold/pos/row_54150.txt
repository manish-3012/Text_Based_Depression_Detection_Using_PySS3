Anyone got some Hobbys I could try So I'm pretty boring, the only thing I've been doing over the last few years is playing video games and meeting friends, but I also wasn't able to see my friends since a year now. So I'm looking for some new Hobbys. In case youre wondering what stuff is near me, then stop. There's nothing. Only things are trees and a small lake. I'd still appreciate any  recommendation I get, because I've got to go to school again and am feeling realy down and  not realy interested in anything rn. Still thanks for some advise
