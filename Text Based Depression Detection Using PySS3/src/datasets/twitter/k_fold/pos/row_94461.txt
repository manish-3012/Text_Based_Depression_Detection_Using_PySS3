so i just found out for 100% that im bi tldr at the bottom cuz its pretty long but still pls read it ðŸ‘‰ðŸ»ðŸ‘ˆðŸ»

heyy so yeah lol

so im 16 rn but ive been sus for a long time lol i mean like you know how some ppl go wild and say ew and shit when they had to hold someones hand from the same sex or basically anything like that as little kids 

but like i was never rly against the thought of it if i think abt it. like sometimes i would catch myself looking at some boys in a strange way. so yeah ive always kinda thought that i may be bi

so anyways theres this guy who i met like 2 months ago who ive been "acting gay with" (yknow this if youre a guy even straight guys do this lol with their friends) but like with him it was on another level ig lmao

so yeah i was at this house party with some friends just having fun and that. also we played a bit of "never have i ever" where they found out that ive fantasised abt the same sex lol (problem is that i honestly dont remember if this guy im talking abt drank too lol. maybe he was a scared idek)  

anyways we went to bed quite early (like 3am) cuz we had to catch the bus back home at 12:00 so yeah. so anyways we slept in the same room where there was this smaller french bed and like when we were both heading towards it i jokingly said "ima be the little spoon" lmao. and bruh HE FUCKING CUDDLED WITH ME FROM THE BACK AND PUT HIS ARM AROUND ME LIKE WTF I HAVE NEVER KISSED ANYONE, DID ANYTHING SEXUAL, NEVER EVEN CUDDLED LET ALONE RIGHT BEFORE SLEEPING, AND MY FIRST EVER EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT WAS WITH A GUY LMAO. 

like bruh i didnt expect this at all but i mean im not complaining lol. and i mean like our bodies were pretty close together soooo ðŸ˜³

sad thing tho after a while he put his arm away which is sad but ig it was mainly cuz its uncomfortable for the big spoon after a while (?) (can someone fact check that pls?)

so yeah and when we woke up he was saying shit like oh the night was pretty cool and shit lol

and on the way back home we sat next to eachother and he told me he listens to this band that makes lots of music abt being gay/bi. like bruh my face went ðŸ˜® in my mind lol

also hes got a gf

**tldr**: met this boy 2 months ago, lost my cuddling virginity to him (i was the little spoon) a couple days ago and it was pretty cool, and i also found out that he listens to this gay band

also i forgot to mention im not entirely sure hes bi yet but yeah im working on that. i just dont wanna seem too creepy or something lol

now that im officially part of the gang, tell me your secret inside phrases that make it easier to detect bi ppl ðŸ˜ˆ lmao
