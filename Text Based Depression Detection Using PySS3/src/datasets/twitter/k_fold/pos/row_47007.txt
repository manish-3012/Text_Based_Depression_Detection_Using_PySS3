Please give me honest advice Yesterday my Dad (who doesn't know English) asked me to translate him a bank note stating that his account was in the negative. After an hour of us talking I saw my dad look the most distressed I've ever seen before. I just really want to know what I can do to help my dad (if I can) and if this is a big deal or not
