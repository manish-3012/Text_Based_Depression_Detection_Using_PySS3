Doubting Myself Met a girl near the end of the summer, we both liked each other and ended up kissing. We promised to stay in touch and met up with each other again, at this point we were still interested in each other and continued to talk, discussing when we should next meet. At some point, she became very distant. She would rarely message me first and her replies were often short and blunt, frequently ending our conversations. Iâ€™m wondering if I did anything wrong and unsure as to whether or not she liked me in the first place. I am confused and need some advice on how to proceed.
