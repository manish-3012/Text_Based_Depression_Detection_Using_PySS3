Iâ€™m going to be lat to my first class at a new school... (I just transferred to a new school) My computer is being super slow and it wonâ€™t load anything and itâ€™s been trying for 20 minutes now to open chrome. Idk how it got so slow but my class starts in five minutes and if it doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m going to be sad.
