After months upon months of me and my sisters begging for another cat (we already have one thatâ€™s 6) and after one failed attempt and our neighbors just dropping one on us we finally have a new baby! Heâ€™s around a year old and the absolute sweetest things. he loves to hear me sing the Jekyll and Hyde musical and he plays with my sister all the time. Heâ€™s just the cutest and I love him so much.
Heâ€™s black with yellow eyes so we named him Fury :D
