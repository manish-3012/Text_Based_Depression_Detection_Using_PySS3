I just moved, I have zero friends, Iâ€™m lonely and sad pls help Iâ€™m a junior and Iâ€™m on my third high school. My first I didnâ€™t like, it was too big and I felt like a cog in a wheel but I did have a couple friends. My second school I loved. It was amazing, the teachers were amazing, the people were amazing, the learning was...hit or miss but it was all part of a great experience. Anyway now Iâ€™m 2,000 miles away from all of my friends whom I donâ€™t talk to much anymore. I really canâ€™t make friends on a fucking zoom class where everyone is muted with their camera off except that one kid with a flip phone and helicopter parents. I just canâ€™t wait for high school to be over and for Covid to be over. 

Somebody just tell me how I can make friends with all of this, I keep seeing groups of other kids hanging out while meanwhile my only friend is my mom and it makes me sad. Honestly so many teenagers are judgemental and terrifying. Iâ€™m also at this point dreading returning to in person schooling after having not been social since March. Iâ€™ve lost all of my confidence and plus itâ€™s a huge school that I would probably disappear in. The other kids all have know each other for years. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m worrying about that part yet since who knows when we will be able to go back to school. 

Also I guess I donâ€™t have â€œzero friendsâ€, I have one really close friend who I still text every day but there is just something missing about never being able to see somebody in person. So, anybody in slc, Utah wanna be my new friend?
