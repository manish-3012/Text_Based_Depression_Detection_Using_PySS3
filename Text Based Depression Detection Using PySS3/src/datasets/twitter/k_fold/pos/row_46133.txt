Has anyone else tried cigarettes but not gotten addicted to them? I tried it once when I was going through a depressive phase, I used to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes so I wouldnâ€™t feel hungry. Anyway one day I was like nah das cringe and stopped and I havenâ€™t thought about them once. I do t get how people like my dad are so addicted to it lol.
