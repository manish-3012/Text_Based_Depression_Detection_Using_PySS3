Why do I still have to go to bed early during holidays Iâ€™m on mid term break from school right now which means I get a week off but I still have to go to bed at 11 which is complete bullshit. Iâ€™m usually playing online with my friends and Iâ€™m always the first one to go off because I still have a bloody bed time at 16 years of age. Iâ€™ve tried reasoning with my parents but they donâ€™t give a shit. I really needed to rant about this because it annoys me so much. Am I just being a dumbass teenager or is this situation a bit ridiculous?
