The girl Iâ€™m with might move to Cali So Iâ€™ve been with this girl for a week and I Like being With her and Iâ€™m pretty sure she likes being with me. Iâ€™m kinda confused on what we are cause she said she isnâ€™t looking for a relationship but we are acting and doing stuff like we are. Anyway she told me she wants to live in Cali for a year. Idk how to feel cause I like her a lot but I donâ€™t know how I should bring it up. Should tell her how I fell and I should even ask the question of what are we?
