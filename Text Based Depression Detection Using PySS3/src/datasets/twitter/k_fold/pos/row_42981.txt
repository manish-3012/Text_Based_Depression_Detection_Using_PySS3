I feel really lonely sometimes I have really much friends at school and sport, but yet I feel lonely. I just feel like I'm no ones favorite. That feels so lonely. Much of my friends are having sleepovers or going on vacation together now that it's autumn break and I'm on a vacation with my parents. I just wanna have fun with a (few) best friend(s) like other friends do. I'm just so jealous, but I don't know how to deal with that.
