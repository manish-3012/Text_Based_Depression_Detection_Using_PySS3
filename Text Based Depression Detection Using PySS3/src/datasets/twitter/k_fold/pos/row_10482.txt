A post from a 20 year old about mental health and high school Hey everyone, I frequented here a while back but now Iâ€™m â€œoldâ€ I guess.

I just wanted to say you hear so much BS about high school as a teen, youâ€™ll be told itâ€™s the best time of your life and theyâ€™ll say they wish they could go back to when it was carefree and easy again. No consequences, new love, friends, etc.

Itâ€™s all bullshit. All of it. High school can suck, bad. Iâ€™ll forever look back at high school terribly. Depression, fake friends, bad family life, and more. The good news though? Itâ€™s over pretty fast!

I actually dropped out and got my GED in my late Junior year because my mental health and school was so terrible I couldnâ€™t take it so I know what Iâ€™m talking about. I felt hopeless and without any drive for a future, high school completely killed the kid who wanted to be an astrophysicist and read books every day. 

But now? Iâ€™m a 20 year old full-time artist and gamedev (I work on Minecraft content rn), I have a good girlfriend and two pets, and I feel better than ever. Is it perfect? Hell no, but life isnâ€™t. I still struggle, I still have anxiety disorder, I have money issues...but HS is over!

Please, realize it does get better and it sure as hell isnâ€™t the best your life will be despite what youâ€™re told. HS sucks, but adult life sucks WAY less. Please keep strong. Stay safe everyone!

PS: and for the love of god realize that trade jobs (carpenter, roofer, plumber, etc.) are 100% viable careers, donâ€™t require college, and can pay extremely well!
