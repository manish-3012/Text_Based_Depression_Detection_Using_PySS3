What should I do? Before I start, I want to note that this post is NOT for karma, if u didnâ€™t know. I am just purely looking for advice.
Ight so during the pandemic, my parents had to work from home and letâ€™s say, home is just like hell, and ironically, I looked forward to going back to school the next day.
But today our teacher called me â€˜Marioâ€™ and how everyone is calling me Mario. Also, thanks to democracy by my fellow classmates, I had to be an â€˜Environmental Prefectâ€™ (taking out trash, doing all sorts of errands etc) and now school is hell too. 
So, in a nutshell, Iâ€™m in hell 24/7.
Any advice to make me feel better except playing video games as a bliss?
