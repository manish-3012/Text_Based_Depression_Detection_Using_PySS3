I finally apologized to the person I bullied for 2 years. 3 months ago, I had the realization that I was straight up being an asshole to the people around me. One of them I still had contact with, so I asked them if we could talk (hoping that once I apologized, they would spread the message to others). I sent them a text through our school's messaging system, and I checked in for a while, with no response. I checked once a month, and randomly decided to check in once again, only to see that they responded yesterday (school recently re-opened, so I think that's why they saw the text). I just sent them my apology and I feel relieved knowing that I've shown the other person that I do truly regret what I said and did during the time period that I've known them.
