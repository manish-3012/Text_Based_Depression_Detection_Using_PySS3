I feel bad I bought my GF present for Christmas but I have to give it to her earlier, tomorrow precisely and she today showed me a picture what she is giving me, at the last time she bought more things and now it looks like I'm giving her almost nothing and she gives me lots of stuff. I feel like it should be other way around but I can't really spend much money because I'm still in school so I don't really have lots of money
