My little sister is sad from staying home all the time All her friends moved for college and she stayed home because her classes are online. Doesnâ€™t have any close friends in our hometown at the moment. Doesnâ€™t work, or have a car (puts off learning how to drive). She just plays video games at home by herself, bakes, and plays instruments. She has hobbies, sheâ€™s just lonely. She lives with me and our parents and sheâ€™s fine but she just craves to hang out with friends.

Idk what to do in this situation because we offer to take her out places but she just wants to be with her friends.

Sheâ€™s been really sad over this lately and itâ€™s hurting us that we canâ€™t immediately help her. 

Iâ€™m 24 btw and sheâ€™s 18, sheâ€™s another generation of kids so I came here for advice.

Thanks in advance.
