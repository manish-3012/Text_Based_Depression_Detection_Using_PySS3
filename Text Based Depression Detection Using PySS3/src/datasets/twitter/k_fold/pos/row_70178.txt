I saw people share their tiktok stories, so here is mine. First of all, the girl in this story was nice to me, well the times we actually talked. 

Also I had a crush on her...
(Later got over her)

So quarantaine had been going for almost a month now and I didn't hear a lot from her, like most of the times. Out of nowhere she send me a picture on snap of her and her older sister: can't spell quarantaine without, U R A Q T.
I most certainly knew I wasn't the only one who got it, cause her sister was in the picture. I just send a question mark and go on with what I was doing. A little bit later she sends another snap saying, you need to answer. Well I thought to be a little bit funny and send her: the alphabet has 21 letters, ow I forgot U R A Q T, you'll get the D later.
Again no answer and than I see she screenshots it. Later that day I get a tiktok video of her sending that message and other guys responding on it. Ofcourse she told me she was going to put it private, but still. Why use me? 

Also 2 months later she made a private story on snapchqt where she posted tiktok videos, I only saw one and I think she tried to do the simba thing? I asked her to get me out of the private story, first she was confused but later she did.
