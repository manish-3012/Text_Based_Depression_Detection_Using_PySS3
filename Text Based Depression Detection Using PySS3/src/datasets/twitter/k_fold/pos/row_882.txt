I feel bad for females in todays society These females got these thirsty ass guys and simps all over them. The thing that sucks is it makes them think all guys are going to be like that, when in fact there's people like me who just want a friend. It seems like whenever I get in contact with a girl she thinks im tryna get some or something when in reality i just wanna talk anime and video games  


Edit: Im not trying to be quirky or anything like that, and I seriously dont understand why me saying female is such a big thing
