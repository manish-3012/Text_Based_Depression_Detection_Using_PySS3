I think I've learnt how to develop and control multiple personalities somehow. Slowly over time I learned how to develop and control multiple personalities during year one of this two week lockdown. I dont know how or when, but I did develop several different personalities and then learned to control them afterwards. Probably because of me having to interact with people with one, then be totally introverted for another. Has anyone else learnt this power, or is it just me?
