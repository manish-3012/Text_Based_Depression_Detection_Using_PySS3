To Garlic Bread Boy I just made the recipe you posted in the comments of a recent post (replying to all the comments or something) and it was great, thankyou! :) It was amazing, probably the best garlic bread I've made and I'm definitely keeping it in mind. I used about 1tbsp butter, 1tsp garlic puree and 0.5tsp of parsley (I was only making it for myself). I used cheddar instead of parm, don't crucify me pls. Anyway, thanks a lot, you made my day better ðŸ’šðŸ–¤

P.s. I tried DMing you but neither chat or message worked, hope you see this.
