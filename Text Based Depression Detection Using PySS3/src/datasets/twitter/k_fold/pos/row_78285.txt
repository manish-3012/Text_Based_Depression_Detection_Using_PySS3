Bruh Iâ€™m so tired of being treated like a child at 18 years old by my parents â€œMaybe when youâ€™re a little older you can read pride and prejudice.â€

That sent me over the fucking edge. That may not seem like a big deal but itâ€™s just this constant treatment that makes me feel like Iâ€™ve been a kid forever. In their eyes thereâ€™s no difference between me at 10 and 18 except now I can drive which I canâ€™t really do either bc theyâ€™re scared. Anyways my mom also says dumb shit like hopefully you grow up to find a rich person (of my race.) Ugh itâ€™s so stupid
