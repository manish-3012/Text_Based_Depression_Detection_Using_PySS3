I THINK I JUST SAVED SOMEONE FROM SUICIDE I was on a discord server, and someone just comes out and we start having a conversation. And then he started talking about how college was really hard for him and how he was thinking about ending it all. At that moment I was frozen with fear. I was like "what do I do" and at first I said, "You shouldn't think about ending your own life just because of college, there are so many more things in life worth living for."                                                                                                                                                                               After that, he mumbled on a bit and said "how did you get through college". Me, being a 14-year-old, obviously, said that I finished it by being patient and trying to gain happiness through the little things in life. I said that the things society puts you through can be rough but it'll all be over in a breeze.              The dude went offline for a minute and I was like "fuck."                                                                                                       After a few minutes, he came back and said that he had reconsidered and was gonna give life a second shot and that talking with me was a relief for him.                                                                                            I feel like a fucking hero.
