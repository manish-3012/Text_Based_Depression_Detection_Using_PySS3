I had an interesting dream last night it was very realistic and accurate to the real world, and as a bonus it was a lucid dream as well. and I didn't even realize it was a dream until I looked in a mirror- 
and I was a girl??? 

ngl I was kinda thicc doe

and yes if your asking, the first thing I did (since it was a lucid dream and I could actually control things to some extent) was grab a pair of thigh highs and a hoodie, and admired myself in the mirror until I woke up.


man I do love sleeping
