BLM protests are kinda too much and too bad Like, i get it that racism is bad and all, but why make it a government matter when there are something debates and courts and all...I mean itâ€™s a bad thing that black people get discriminated by society and by cops, but itâ€™s not the cops fault that they canâ€™t help but be wary of them if most of the crimes committed in the nation are by black people...blm protesters are vandalizing streets, attacking restaurants and ruining some innocent peoples business all for that they can just be equal??? I mean this is fucked up
