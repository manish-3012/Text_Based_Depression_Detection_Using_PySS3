They'll Ship You With Anybody Nowadays So there was this kid in sixth grade. He had one class with me, and we were at the same bus stop. For this post, I'm calling him D. So D would always call me names, criticize me over anything, whether it's my appearance or how I act, called me the N word, and spread rumors about me that could've gotten me in serious trouble. He asked me out as a joke, and did what a typical bully would do.

I hated him and was scared of him at the same time,

Now, fast forward to seventh grade. I have no classes with D, and I sigh with relief at that. It's the first week of seventh grade, and I go to math class. This one kid tells me, "Did you know that "D" likes you?" 

I say "I think he's made it clear he doesn't like me." 

"That was last year." the kid says.

Yes. It was last year, but he hasn't changed and I haven't seen any evidence that he's redeemed himself.

Welp, it's both funny and concerning at the same time that people seem to think that him making me cry on the bus was an attempt at romance.
