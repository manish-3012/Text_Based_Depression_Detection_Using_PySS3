What are the meaning of my sentimental dreams? I always had dreams of visiting my old home, visiting the old apartment I lived in back in 2005. The neighborhood we moved to in 2006. I have dreams where even the hometown strikes so many memories back. Objects, old DVD sets and old television sets. Dreams I'm with long lost pets. Dreams I'm a little kid again and dreams I'm in my old classrooms with friends I haven't met in forever. And I always wake up feeling like crying and it takes 20 minutes to come to terms my dream was only a dream.

I also sometimes have dreams where my entire dreams are documentaries of people's lives usually involving death 

Most notable titles of my dreams include:

Students falling out of trees and dying (1991)

Life of ayn rand (1991)

Documentary of the town of lansdale (2005)

The guy from zoo lander starting a musical career and dies featuring the frogs (2009)
