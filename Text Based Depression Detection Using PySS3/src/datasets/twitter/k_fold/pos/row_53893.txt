People on Reddit vs People Irl ok explain me this:
why are girls on the internet super chill and understanding and then irl (not the same people) they get mad at you for minor things.
And why are boy (sometimes) creeps or dicks on the internet to girls but not irl?

If this has taught me anything it is that I'm never talking to people irl again!
