I am a teenager who hopes for trump to win. I think trump is a better candidate than biden, and i think trumps America would be better than bidens America. Do i care if trump loses? No I don't, it diesnt matter to me. I wont be effected. The reason i post this is because i see alot of people posting about how much worse America will be with Trump, but truly it shoukd not matter. I see oeople getting downvoted to oblivion because the share one of their right wing opinions. It shouldnt matter who has what opinion. Everyone needs to just get alongn politics aside. I have biden supporting friends and I don't care, they are entitled to their opinion. What matters is that they're good people. I like them. And those same leftist friends like me even though i support trump.
