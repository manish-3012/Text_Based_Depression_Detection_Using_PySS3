Recent Painful "Graduation" from the Subreddit  

Hey, guys... I'm Lillie. I've been lurking here for a few years, since I was about 15 or so. I have always been the shy type, so I... never interacted ): I'm very awkward, and bullying in school never really helped me learn how to socially interact... A year ago, I... guess the term could be graduated(?) from here after I turned 20. I know that anybody of any age is allowed to interact and talk, but... well, I'll just shut up about this, and get to the main point of the post.

Trigger Warnings: Being trans, suicide, severe depression... 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background first... I promise it will make sense afterwards.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I am transgender. Meaning, I am a girl. I have known this my entire life. I kept it secret as best I could, and apparently, I managed to do so flawlessly. Nobody ever expected it when I came out in October of 2015. I was met with a ton of criticism, but I also had a very few teens my age that accepted me. And to them, I will always be grateful.

I would always sit on the side throughout my life, and watch girls do things with other girls, while I was consistently paired with boys. And not good boys at that. From as early as memories are able to be recalled, I knew that I was truly a girl on the inside. I never knew how to tell anybody. How could I when I would constantly have family members indirectly talk about how disgusting I was? Some even talking about how they would kill people like me. All I was able to do was hide.

But eventually, I was unable to hide the fact that I was a female any longer. However, it was too late. I never got to experience a girl's childhood. I would go to school every day with a plan on how I would befriend the other girls in my class. I never succeeded ):

Now... to the actual point of the post... I am so... for a lack of better words... suicidal. It extends to yet another thing that I have hidden about myself, and what the main point of my post is. I only know of one person who is aware of it, and that is my mother. One day, at the age of nine years old, I came to the realization that I would not always be a kid. That I was one day going to turn eighteen, and I was currently halfway to that mark. I began to hyperventilate, and I started screaming in a panic attack. It was one of my largest fears. My mother ran into my room, and began to hold me as I was almost flailing in a state of pure confusion and fear. I have always been one to hide what is wrong with me, but in that moment, I simply told her. I told her how I was so incredibly fearful of growing up. How I detested the very idea. She told me, and I quote, "you don't ever have to, baby. you can stay as my world forever." I felt slight relief in that moment. However, I knew that regardless of her words, I would still eventually technically grow up.

Years would go on, and I would have other kids talk about how they dreamed of growing older. I would simply listen in nothing less than confusion. "Why would anybody want to be a dumb adult?" The thought petrified me. More time passed, and I began to grow more fearful of the ever approaching eighteenth birthday that I couldn't possibly delay. I didn't just have to go through a male puberty, no, I had to also go through the stages of growing up. That is to say, what was expected of me. But in the end, I would always secretly resist. I could tell that my mother had forgotten all about that night where I told her about my fear and dread of growing up. It was more than apparent that she only said those things because she knew I eventually would stop caring and fearing to grow up, not because she actually felt that she was okay with me staying as a child. I eventually promised myself that if I ever reached my eighteenth birthday, then I would... ): Well, the day surely arrived, and while I tried, it was futile against my other fear of death. Apparently, there are so many people who believe that all suicidal people do not fear death. Well, I can assure all of them that they are sorrily mistaken. Just because I want to die, is no indication that I do not fear the death itself. Regardless, the day did arrive, and while I smiled through the day, there was no present or celebration that could make my heart smile. It was my fear of growing up that had made me loath each and every one of my birthdays. Needless to say, this one was the worst of all. I was practically dead the second the clock struck midnight on the date of February 7th, 2017. No more childhood to spend as a girl or have others accept me as a girl. No more childhood period. It was over. The End. All I could do was cry the entire night.

"Look, at you, finally an adult!"

"No more games, you are in the big world now."

"My baby is finally all grown up."

I hated hearing those comments so much, that simply typing them out just now was enough to give me flashbacks to those days. I am unable to sleep, unable to think, unable to process, and unable to live... I... I refuse to be an adult. I won't do it. I can never be made to do it. To be an adult is to sign my own death certificate. I have been found to even have the mind of a child by all of my psychologists. Apparently people are shocked by that due to how properly I prefer to speak online. I have what can be considered as permanent Age Regression. Where my mind stopped developing early on.

I recently came out about all of this on Twitter to quite a few people. I was met with so much hatred, that even my coming out as trans looked like a wonderful time. I was blocked, I was slandered, I was told to never attempt contact with them again, and I was told of how much of a freak that I was. People were accusing me of being a predator because I wanted to remain my mental age. Just because I want to be my mental age, doesn't mean I'm willing to date somebody my mental age. But apparently, people are too stupid to understand. I almost began cutting myself for the very first time. I waited my entire life to come out about wanting to remain a kid, and this was my response... This was how I was being treated. I can't say that I expected differently, but it can not change the heartbreak. A week or so later, I had a therapy call. She told me that I had to find a new psychologist because they only saw kids or people in school. For the very first time in the four years I have seen her, she heard me wail in sadness. For the first time, I didn't care about holding back my tears. She was the only therapist I ever loved. The only therapist that ever understood me. And she was telling me that I had to go. I apparently have another call with her today. But it feels so pointless. If I can't have her, then I will see nobody else. I am in so much pain right now. I am being treated differently by everybody around me because I am an "adult." I am sorry, but no, I am not. If I can not remain young, then go ahead and end me. I have no other reason to live. I can't even be a girl. The only thing I see happening as a result of making this post, is all of you giving me the same treatment that I just received on Twitter, but hey, I might as well try to gain approval... I have left so much information out, and that is probably for the better. I am tired of the nightmares of growing up and losing my hair. I am tired of all of this pain. I am tired... of being treated as a male, an adult, and a pervert as an extension. I have the same mind that I did at the physical age of 12-15. The only difference, is the amount of depression, self hatred and fear that has accumulated within my soul as a result of being seen as older, and as a male. I am being treated as an adult more and more every single day.

I just want other people like you all (my mental age) to accept me as who I am... I have severe PTSD from early childhood trauma, and this brings back painful memories to talk about...

I have cried so much while writing this, that I have to be severely dehydrated. But... I just don't care about hiding anymore. Thank you for reading... and I love you all...
