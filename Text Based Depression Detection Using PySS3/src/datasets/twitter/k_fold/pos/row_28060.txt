Somewhere in the northern boreal forest of Maine there is a very large Newfoundland currently sitting under a dining Room table gorging himself on a stolen slab of bacon Hes a very happy dog but is refusing to share with his brother captain fluffybutt...  Another giant dog this time and Alaskan malamute who is overly fluffy and whining expectantly at me and I'm like what the hell am I supposed to do he stole it but I am going to get some cheese to give the other dog simply because I don't have any more bacon in the house
