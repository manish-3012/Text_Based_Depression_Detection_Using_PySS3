i'm moving to study in a university warning sad stuff 
i'm gonna move to study 3d animation, it's a 5 hour drive from where i live now but my family is being incredibly supportive.
yesterday while we were going to get a document from my old school and my mother started crying like i've never heard her cry.
it was an awfully sad moment and i'm still reaply shaken up, i've never known how much i mattered to my mother until now, and i didnt know we were gonna miss eachother this much.

i'm terrified, i dont know what to do. i feel like it was a pretty ugly goodbye even tho i'm not gonna move now, but now i dont want to leave her alone.
