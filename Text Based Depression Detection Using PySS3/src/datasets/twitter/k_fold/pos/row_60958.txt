I swear my dad and I are on the same brainwave Last night, during dinner, as we were talking, I began a sentence with "is it just me, or..." my dad instantly retorted "yeah" and I instantly answered "okay." Everyone else was confused because it all happened so fluently. And this isn't the only time this has happened. My dad is a pretty goofy guy, and does those things a lot, but I always seem to catch on instantly and continue the joke, and I always think that's really great.
