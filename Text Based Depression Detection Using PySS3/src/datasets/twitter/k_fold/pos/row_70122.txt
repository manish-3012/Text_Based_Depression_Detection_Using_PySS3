Fever dreams are the worst thing to exist bruh I remember having a fever dream where I was in my room, and I heard static getting louder, and louder, then a really fucking ball rolls around, and my megalophobic ass starts to panic thinking I was fr gonna die. Iâ€™ve had another one where my room was melting, and everything was  spinning, and like I would start to stress out a lot then probably throw up if I even ate anything, then actually get some rest, and wake up safe.
