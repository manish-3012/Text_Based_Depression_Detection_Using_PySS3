I really love how teacher are like : "this was a hard and confusing year thanks to corona". Then they give us SHITLOAD of homework. I get it. They kinda had to. But THEN they give us homework. On our fucking holidays! I'm mad. And the fact that i saw it one minute after i was supposed to send it to her doesn't help
