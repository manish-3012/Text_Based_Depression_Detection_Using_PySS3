Giving up what I like because I suck and donâ€™t like it anymore I started playing drums almost 2 years ago and I loved it. Now, Iâ€™m angry every time I play the drums because I often do mistakes. I feel like I suck. I really would like to join a band but I always tell myself that I would get fired quickly because I suck. Iâ€™ve also been playing guitar for more than 1 year and I still enjoy it. So, yeah I just should stop the  drums and play only the guitar now but, again, Iâ€™m getting angry because it means that I should stop playing the drums because I suck. Thatâ€™s something that I really liked and I wanted to be good but now I know thatâ€™s not possible. 
Also, I really wish that one day I will be in a successful band and make a living from it, like a rockstar, and it kills me to know that it will probably never happen. 
Iâ€™m always angry or sad, never happy. Maybe itâ€™s because of puberty who knows ? Anyway, I just wanted to share it. Maybe you have some advice for me.
