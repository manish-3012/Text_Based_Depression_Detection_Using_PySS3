I feel really angry  Well, I got coronavirus from my mother (a nurse) and I asked good friends what was happening while I was in quarantine, they told me almost everyone insults me or say something like: I hope he dies. I don't know what to do, because I only told that I have corona to a friend, and now a important newspaper from my region knows that someone of my highschool (there's only one that is me) has corona, I don't know how to feel. I just wish that my classmates were danger population and I had corona with them
