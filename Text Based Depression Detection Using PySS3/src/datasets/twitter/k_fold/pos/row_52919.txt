Prob gonna be crucified for this. Okay... hear me out. We need menâ€™s rights activists. 

Okay before you call me misogynistic and a sexist listen to me. I am not saying that men donâ€™t have rights. This is in no way an attack on feminism or women. Feminism is a good thing that we need or at least real feminism is. But menâ€™s rights is also something I would like to see become more mainstream. Things like child custody, payments in divorce and, false rape accusations all largely favor women. I think with feminist and menâ€™s rights advocates working together we can make everyone equals.
