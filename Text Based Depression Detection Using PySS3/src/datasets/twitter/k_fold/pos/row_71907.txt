You keep reminding me how single I am :D I was scrolling through the hot posts of this sub, and every other post said "I asked my crush out, she/he said yes". I'm obviously very happy for all of you, but also so jealous :D Give me 50% of your confidence and social skills so I can have a chance some day...
