So, i don't have any friends irl, all my friends are online, and while i love them, I'd love to get to know some people who live near me and i could possibly meet up with as well. I live near Destin FL Hey guys! I'm 14, almost 15, they/them, and I'm super deprived of affection. I really wanna be able to have friends irl so if anyone lives in the area of Destin/Fort Walton Beach or near there, I'd love to talk to you. If anyone outside of the area is looking for an online friend, feel free to message me too!
