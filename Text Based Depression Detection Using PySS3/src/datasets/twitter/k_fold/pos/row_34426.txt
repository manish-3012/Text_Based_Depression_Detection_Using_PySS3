Things to never do at a funeral- * Yell out 'YOLO'
* Tell old people "you're next"
* Take a picture with the coffin and tag it on socials (that one meme template was enough for the rest of our lives)
* Wear a rainbow tux and then claim that u put the "fun" in the "funeral" (they dont need it at that point and u will draw "necessary attention")
* Whisper "I see dead people" (they will take u as a virgin sacrifice if they are part of a cult and ur a virgin)

Im pretty sure that these tips will help u in the near future because we are capable of such things!!
