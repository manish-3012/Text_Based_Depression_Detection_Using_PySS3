Whatâ€™s it like having an older sister? iâ€™m curious to know if ,those that have one, you get along with her and are close. iâ€™m only asking cause (this is kinda sad) i was supposed to have an older sister but she died before i was born. iâ€™m a boy btw so i donâ€™t know if sister/brother dynamic is any different than sister/sister.
