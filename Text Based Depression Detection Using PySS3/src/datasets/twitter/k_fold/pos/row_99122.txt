A story of presents or just sharing good emotions from today with you :) So... We have like "men day" tomorrow in my country so me and my classmates (girls) made a presents for our calssmates boys

We decided to make a t-shirts with a personalized drawings for every of them ( there are only 6 boys in our class). So... It's a start of a long story of how we created this t-shirts

To make in shorter:

At first, me and two of my classmates spent all Friday evening (and also night) to draw that pictures. At the same time my friend went to a shop to buy t-shirts. Than, on Saturday it took us about 3 hours to find a place to print these pictures onto fabric

And today we finally gave these gifts to our boys. And like, their reaction was sooo cute. They were really happy and... I don't know... I just felt myself really happy too cause my work wasn't useless and they sincerely appreciated what we've done

Maybe for someone it will be funny to read about this little happy thing that happened to me today

Have a good day âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
