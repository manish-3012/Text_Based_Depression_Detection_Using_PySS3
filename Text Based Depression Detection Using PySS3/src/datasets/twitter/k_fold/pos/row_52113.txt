Man dolphins are evil. They fucking kill porpoises just because. They don't even eat them. They just kill em for the fun of it.

And it's not the adults. It's the babies. They'll beat them up and toss em around and bite them. And if they don't die just yet, they'll hold them underwater to they can't breathe. It's like having your hand and legs tied, and both your nose and mouth are underwater. You can't do shit and you'll just drown to death. 

Reason why they do it is actually very fucked up. If the calf doesn't exist anymore, the mother raising the calf is available..... so they take advantage of it.....mother fucker thats messed up.

Also, they love getting high. But of out what? Pufferfish. They toss them around like balloons or balls. Which kills em in the process.


Sorry if I made your day way worse, but what i stated is unfortunately true......
