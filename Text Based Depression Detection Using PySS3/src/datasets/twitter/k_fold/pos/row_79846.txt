Idk anymore Iâ€™m writing this as I cry for the first time in almost a year because Iâ€™ve been holding in too much shit, high school has been fucking rough. Tonight I thought about an old friend who moved away and how I did so much for her and I feel like I get literally nothing in return, I havenâ€™t talked to anyone about this. But I feel like Iâ€™m constantly getting used for emotional support then get pushed away. I never made a big deal about it but tonight it really hit hard, Iâ€™ve had 3 friends that have done this to me. One of them almost killed herself, and I was the only one to go and check on her, the only fucking friend. And what I get is completely nothing, I have a big mental breakdown awhile after and text her so she can help me with it and all she says is just donâ€™t try to think about or donâ€™t cry. Iâ€™m tired of helping someone and then they just push me away. It hurts too much. Another friend was one I was really close with and she was super comfortable with me and weâ€™d have a lot of talks, but she started to act weird and talk about this guy and I already knew who it was because she was really easy to read, anyways she tells me about a month later about him and how theyâ€™ve been dating for a little bit and I already knew he was just using her for her body but she didnâ€™t fucking listen to me, after awhile I found out he pretty much abused her emotionally and physically. A couple months ago we finally talked and she apologized to me about it and weâ€™ve been pretty much friends but it was nothing like it was before, we donâ€™t even talk like we used to. And I just feel like if people would listen to me, bad shit wouldnâ€™t happen. Another girl who I was friends with has been pushing me away recently, and I helped her so much, with break ups, with parents, etc. and she just blocked me on Snapchat because of her boyfriend. All I fucking want is someone to understand how I feel, and not push me away all the time, it hurts too much. Even though I have friends, i feel lonely and it hurts too much, I just wished they would actually stay and help me with my problems how I helped them. I donâ€™t know, I just wanna get some advice from people like you guys because I know you guys can help.
