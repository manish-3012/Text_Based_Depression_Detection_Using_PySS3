Feeling pretty good right now. Stark contrast to my usual. Sending you all the positive vibes I possibly can. Broke free from my anxiety a bit today, so Iâ€™ve been riding that high.

Iâ€™ve made a few friends these past 6 months. Theyâ€™re all truly wonderful people, Iâ€™m beyond lucky to have them in my life.

Iâ€™ve got a roof over my head, access to water, food, etc.

Iâ€™m leaning back on my bed in a hoodie &amp; sweats that I pulled out of the dryer a while ago, feeling comfortable as hell.

Got some LoFi filling the room totally enhancing this good vibe

My head isnâ€™t clouded with depression or anxiety. Any worry or doubt is whisked away by the soft sound of this music.

For the first night in a very long time, I feel okay. I hope you do too. And if not, please, I invite you to join me in stopping for a bit to enjoy some LoFi with me, [here.](https://youtu.be/li9CFMag7_A)

Iâ€™ll hang out for a bit longer to talk to anyone who feels like commenting, but if nobody does, thatâ€™s perfectly fine. Just know that whatever it is youâ€™re going through, youâ€™re not alone. There is hope.

And if you were looking for a sign not to give up: This is it, right here. You can do the thing. I believe in you &amp; Iâ€™m so proud of you for making it to this moment.

I genuinely hope all of you lovely peoplesâ€™ nights/mornings go well, that you can find a way to beat your demons. Probably going to doze off soon, but I just wanted to share this small victory with all of you.

Love ya â™¡
