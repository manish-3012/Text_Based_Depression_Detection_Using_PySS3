Asking for advice about alcohol I don't know if posting about alcohol is permitted on this sub. if you are drinking with friends: what is your favourite drink to get drunk of?, What's the most disgusting drink you've ever tasted?, Are you regretting that you started drinking?. Thank you all and merry Christmas.
