So, my parrot lost a diamond. I have a pet parrot, he's a sun conure. His name is Solar. 

He was napping under my shirt, so when he woke up I was cuddling him and I forgot that I left my DIAMOND EARRING (it was a gift, and expensive) on the table. I went to get him water and when I came back ONE OF THEM WAS GONE. 

IM GONNA CRY I CANT FINT IT
