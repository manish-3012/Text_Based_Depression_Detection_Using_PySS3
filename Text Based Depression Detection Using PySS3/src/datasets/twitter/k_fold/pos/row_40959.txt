What's up people how's your day going on? I hope your's fine because mine is terrible. Just saw where my money went on missing. Apperantly my narcissistic brother bought walnut with my remaining money and if i question him about the act he just did (Buying something that nobody's gonna eat with my only money left). He's gonan attack me. And i can't tell my dad because he also said he's going to kill us both if we have a fight. And here i'M with no money left. Probably gonna be hungry. WE don't even have eggs lmao i'm going to lose my mind.
