Stop being so horny please Look bro, Iâ€™m 19 (male) and barely use reddit at this point, but some of yâ€™all are ridiculously horny, and there is no need to share that every time a female appears. 

If a girl puts a picture of herself in a post or even mentions she is a female in some cases, she is going to get spammed with how attractive she is in comments, DMs, etc. If you do that:

A) It isnâ€™t going to work, sheâ€™s not going to have sex with you because you do this.

B) Most of the time, itâ€™s just flat out rude. Just because a girl posts a picture of herself doesnâ€™t mean that she wants you to talk about her like that. She is trying to make a joke, not be the object of your public sexual fantasy.

C) You are actively making the platform less inclusive.
