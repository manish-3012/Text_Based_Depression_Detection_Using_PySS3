Is it wrong for me to say that I started an org with two people when technically I didn't? When they started it, and I went to the first protest and volunteered ahead of time to be the 1st speaker and after that joined them full-time/formed our club w them.  I did host protests (I was the hostess) and am an official member of the org so is it fine for me to think of it as smthn I started since I'm such a big part of the org now or is that wrong of me?
