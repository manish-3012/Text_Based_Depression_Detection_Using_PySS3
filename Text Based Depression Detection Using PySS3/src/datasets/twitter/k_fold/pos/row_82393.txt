Having a crush is so fucking wierd Idk about you guys but like it is the weirdest shit to me. Like I try to start up a conversation, and the minute it gets quiet, my mind is like "lol you fucked that up, buddy"
Like when ever I'm around them, I am physically aware of the fact that my hoodie has a microscopic stain on it.
Like I know I shouldn't even worry about it, and that just makes me pissed with myself.
