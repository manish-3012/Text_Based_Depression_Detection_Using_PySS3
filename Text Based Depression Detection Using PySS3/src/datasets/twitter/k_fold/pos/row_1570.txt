My friend confessed to me My friend has been sending me texts about him having a crush on me on discord, and deletes them right after...I get the notifications; Iâ€™ve seen these notifications multiple times and Iâ€™ve decided to put my foot down and finally confront him about this. 

The first time he did it, I got really startled, and when I checked discord, the message was gone. So I thought it would be okay to ignore it. Then he kept doing it over a span of a few weeks....and finally, I just confronted him because I just couldnâ€™t take it anymore, I felt nervous, sad, and confused.

I feel so bad right now, because he was a close friend of mine from middle school...and to tell the truth, I did know that he liked me for a long time now, I just never thought I would have to deal with it this way...and as bad as I feel, I unfortunately canâ€™t return the feelings back to him.

To top it all off, I think he has anxiety/depression. Iâ€™ve had several deep conversations with him, trying to help him feel better because heâ€™s my friend. He has told me that people have thought of him as annoying, and he is often insecure about himself. He also feels that people donâ€™t like him, and he doesnâ€™t have many friends. And I just donâ€™t know what to do to lessen the blow of this situation on because I donâ€™t want to hurt him. 

What do I do? Iâ€™m really nervous. He has not responded yet. I think heâ€™s seen the messages, but hasnâ€™t said anything. 

I donâ€™t want to lose my friend this way. I want to be stern about him sending and deleting these messages, but at the same time, I donâ€™t want him to feel as bad knowing I only see him as a good friend. Thank you so much for reading this rant. You have no idea how much advice for this is appreciated. 

Also did I do anything wrong on my part? Please let me know, so I can better myself.
