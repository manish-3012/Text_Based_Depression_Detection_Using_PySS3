I honestly don't know what to do. My best friend and I don't talk anymore. Idk why, out of the blue she suddenly doesn't want to hang out with me anymore. She avoids me, when I try and make conversation she just gives one word answers and reactionary sounds, and I'm the only one she does this too. She literally would rather talk to strangers than me, that's not a joke. I feel horrible cause she means everything to me, and now it feels like she's done with me. I didn't even do anything wrong, I didn't say anything to upset her. Idk why she's like this to me and only me specifically, but it hurts a lot.
