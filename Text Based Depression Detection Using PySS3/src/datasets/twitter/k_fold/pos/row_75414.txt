I want to look slimmer via diet and exercise (good on the lungs), any tips? So, I recently went to the doctor and found out I weigh 202 american pounds
I need some tips on how to do it without telling anyone my intentions
I'm mostly doing this so I can stop wearing hoodies all the time and feel comfortable swimming in public
