I passed my GED! I'm so happy rn!   
A while ago I was all depressed about high school, dreading that I would have to go through 3 more years of it. I started 10th grade online, instead of brick and mortar because of social anxiety. That did not fix anything, really. I hate online school, and my grades were dropping drastically and my depression over school did not improve. So, with the help of my parents, I dropped out of 10th grade, and we decided to go for the GED to get it over with.   
I took the entry test (a test to see what type of class you need, Fast Track being the quickest route as you don't need as much teaching) and I qualified for Fast Track!   
GED was like what I dreamed school could be like: There was a single, small classroom, with only around 5 other students. And the class only lasted up to 2-and-a-half hours, four days a week, for 6 weeks.   
Still, I had anxiety, like at normal high school. But it was much better because of the small number of people and very limited socializing. I have no idea why high school has to be so stressful, and difficult. I highly recommend getting a GED, if you don't like school, like me.    
I am so glad to have school finally behind me and ready for whatever comes next!ðŸ˜ƒ
