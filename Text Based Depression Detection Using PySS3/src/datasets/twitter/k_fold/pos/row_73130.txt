Are as just not going to talk about how YouTube is now just asking to see our ID? Like... why? If i want to watch a video, i will, what's the issue? They have a YouTube KIDS section, if i want to watch some random gore thing or something "not appropriate" I'm not going to show a company that already knows me better than myself my fucking passport or ID, sooner or later ima start getting ads about my bloodtype and my ancestors ffs
