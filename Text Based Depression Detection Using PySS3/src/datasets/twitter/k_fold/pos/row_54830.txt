Imma rant about the whole #freeforrnite thing Its fucking stupid. They are acting like apple is the big bad evil corporation because  epic broke their terms of service and got taken off. Apple is a terrible  company  for a million other reasons  but I'm on apple's side with this one. Epic is in the wrong and knew what they were doing. They made a fucking cinematic  before they even fucking did it because they knew this was gonna happen. How are they gonna break the rules then act like apple is evil for removing the app.
