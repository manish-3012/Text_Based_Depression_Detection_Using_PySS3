Iâ€™m trying again, a silver award is up for grabs: Give me an interesting fact/detail about the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, the best one gets silver or if theyâ€™re all shit like last time no one gets it. i will wait 10 minutes before looking

edit: going to do something will check in like 15-20 mins instead
