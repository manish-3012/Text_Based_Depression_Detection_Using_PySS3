I'm living like a NEET right now and I fucking love it. I sit at home all day and do whatever I want. My parents came home and brought some Burger King. Just had a delicious Burger with some Fries and Chilli cheese nuggets while chugging Mountain Dew at that.

It's insane. This is all I want. I'm almost in heaven. This is why I LOVE the lockdown. It's amazing!
