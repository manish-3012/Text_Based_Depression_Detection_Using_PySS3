I'm exhausted af. Everything's been so bland. This whole vibe of not feeling upto anything is not a new one to me, I thought I had grown out of it but nope. 

I sure have enough reasons in my life to be exhausted about and not being able to do stuff about it just keep holding me down. I can't make memes no more. I can't help random redditors with their mental issues at 3 AM no more. I can't make creative instagram stories no more.I'm drained and feeling pathetic.

My parents, as good as there intentions are, are maddeningly strict and everything when it comes to Education. They have me enrolled in this additional coaching stuff. I joined late for that AND school, so everything's basically out of track, I'm miles behind portions and has no clue or energy to do whatever about it.

My parents are abusive, but like they have this righteous mentality about it. They are the sweetest, but hitting your children ain't never the way to go. They don't hit me no more since I'm older but my mom still does it with my brother and I just can't. Like, sometimes I even find myself acting like that to my brother and I hate to think I have become even the slightest of the very thing that made me wake up from nightmares as a kid.

Then there's friends. For what little amount of em I ever had or have, they are just not the way to go. I mean, if they were I wouldn't be here on reddit writing up an essay on how stranded I feel. 

These thoughts, these very words I'm typing down are the ones I probably told myself on my self-talk routines. I have no clue myself as to what I'm trying to achieve by posting this. Sweet words and thoughts of hope I use to help those random redditors I mentioned before are unable to do any good to me really. And thinking about it, I wonder if I ever helped them either.

 Idk man. Everything's fucked up. I can only stop writing this, get back to the online class happening now and hope for a better time ahead.

Good luck to me and anyone who be struggling.
