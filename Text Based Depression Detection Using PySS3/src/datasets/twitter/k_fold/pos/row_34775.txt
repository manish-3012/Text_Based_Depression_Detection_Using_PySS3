My Mum just apologized to me for yelling, without turning it into a lecture about how I make her angry?! Is this the real life? I'm just confused. She yells a lot because she has paranoid personality disorder and thinks the world is out to get her.
Yesterday she yelled for 2 hours straight.

Today we where just chatting and she went "I feel like I yell at you too much. You don't deserve it. I shouldn't do that" and I was like ? Woooaahhhhhh.

So people do change. Never got that from her, this is amazing!
