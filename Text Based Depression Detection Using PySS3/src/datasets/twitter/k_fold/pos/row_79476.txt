there is a difference between thinking something should be illegal and thinking it's a bad thing Okay, this might be a little bit political but I mean this as a general thing that can apply to anyone, regardless of their political views. I'm just using my own as examples because... I am using my own as examples.

I'm kind of sick of being called an authoritarian communist when I say you should call people by the pronouns they like. First of all, I'm not really a communist and anyway, what the fuck does communism have to do with that? But also-- did I ever say I want it to be ILLEGAL to purposely misgender someone? No. I think it's a dick move and if you do it you're probably a dick, but I support freedom of speech ~~(and freedom of bash your knees in if you abuse that freedom of speech)~~ and I don't totally agree with hate speech being a crime although I'm not the most educated on that so I'll shut up.

This may seem like a very specific rant it's just annoying to me that people immediately think I want to take away their right to speak just because I have morals. lmao.
