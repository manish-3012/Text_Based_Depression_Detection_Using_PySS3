What are your thoughts on people who consider themselves non-binary? I'm probably gonna get a lot of hate but I feel that its sort of become a mental illness for those that really think they weren't born as a male or female. We are Gen-Z and I feel like we've become the laughing stock of every other generation because of stupid things like this.
