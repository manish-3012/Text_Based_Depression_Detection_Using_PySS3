Tales From My ZOOM Class. (first post here please be nice) Tales from my zoom class 

1.First up, we were in geography and the teacher spent 10 mins explaining what we would be doing. â€œWHAT ARE WE DOINGâ€ A kid whose voice we didnâ€™t recognize said. He kept asking and the teacher kept trying to figure out who it was. The kid starts swearing and saying, â€œwhat the fuckâ€ and the teacher eventually gives up. All the students realize that this kidâ€™s dad had been asking the kid what the work was and this parent ended up being lectured by the teacher thinking the parent was a student. 

2.Second, studying Romeo and Juliet and the teacher says â€œthe fire motif represents, passion, anger, and drive. What else is passionate, driven and easily angered.â€ Kid puts his had up. â€œWomenâ€. Our teacher is a second wave neo feminist so you can probably infer how that went down. 

3.A parent walked in and asked her son â€œdo you want a hot chocolateâ€ The whole class says yes please including the teacher. 

4.Teacher starts swearing because the electrician in his house woke up his daughter 

5.math teacher recommended and am called rumblr where you can find people in your area who â€œwanna fightâ€ and openly endorsed a kid threatening to â€œrollâ€ another kid.
