Okay, i have a little confession to make I have used the n-word like yesterday and today when nobody was with me. I usually talk by myself, so that's the instance where i used the word. I don't even know myself why. Although the word is racist, i had no racist intentions. Maybe why i used the word is because i felt good about the freedom of not being told what to say and what not to? Honestly im confused with myself.
