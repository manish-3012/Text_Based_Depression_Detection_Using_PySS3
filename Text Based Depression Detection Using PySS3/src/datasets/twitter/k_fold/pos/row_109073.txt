Just turned 17, emotional farewell to this piece of crap phone This year has been the greatest year of my life. I had my first girlfriend (we split up because of covid restrictions and a lack of interest in not being able to see each other), I started college 4 weeks ago and I feel wanted on the world!

I didn't know what to expect when turning 17 besides being terrified of having my first driving lesson tonight. There wasn't anything I really wanted, I have an old phone that is perfect for me and does everything I want, I have an og xbox one that is a little slow but still works fine. The only thing I can think of that I really want is a new football (the evil creature in my profile picture ruined my other)

But I just woke up and my mom (works full time so I can't see her until later) has left me a brand new phone next to me! I'm yet to open it because I wanted to make 1 last post with my old phone just to commemorate how much I've been through with this phone. I have 2 cracks from when I have had panic attacks and thrown it which I never replaced because they remind me of how I've improved. They have many pictures of my beautiful animals and times around the world. All in all I don't know how to feel! Excited with a brand new phone or a little sad I have to let this one go!
