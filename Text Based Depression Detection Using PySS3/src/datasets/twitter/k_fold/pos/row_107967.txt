I'm an absolute fucking idiot So around a year ago, I did this thing where I completely spaced out, listened to a bunch of really ambient vaporwave tracks, and just wrote down what came to mind.




I ended up writing this like 3 paragraph story about falling asleep. That sounds really silly, but I genuinely felt like it was some of my best writing. Well, I had it in a notes folder on my phone dedicated to youtube video ideas, and I deleted that entire folder a while ago and have no way to get that story back.




Moral is: I'm a complete fucking idiot, I don't think I'll be able to recapture the emotion I had in that original piece and I don't want to do a subpar job replicating it, so I'm just leaving it as it is.
