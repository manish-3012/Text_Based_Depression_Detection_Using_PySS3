Advice needed I am in need of assistance. There is this girl in one of my zoom classes that I think I am starting to like. We snap and chat regularly but Iâ€™ve known her for like 60 days or something like that and itâ€™s over zoom so idk if I should say anything until Iâ€™m back in school. I am planning on waiting but idk how long I should wait for bc we arenâ€™t going back until a vaccine and that could be a year. What should I do?
