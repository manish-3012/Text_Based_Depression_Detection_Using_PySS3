A thank you to my ex I know you use Reddit, and I doubt youâ€™ll see this but I had to get this off my chest. 
I hated myself while we dated. I hated the things I said, I hated how often I went against my moral values for you, and I hated how I changed my entire personality for you and your happiness. It still wasnâ€™t enough, though. You still decided to write cruel comments about me, you still decided to hurt me indirectly, you still decided to tell me that you wished I had killed myself instead of living.

Well guess what? Iâ€™m still very much alive. You guilted me into self harming, you still give me frequent panic attacks, youâ€™re the reason I have to bring anxiety medication to my job, where I have to see you. You made everything infinitely worse for me during that time, and I hated myself for everything. I knew everything wasnâ€™t right and I stayed because I needed you. 

Despite all of that, I still have to thank you. I harbor a lot of resentment against you, but in the end you did help me realize a ton of things:
1. My happiness should not be destroyed for someone elseâ€™s. 
2. Itâ€™s okay to be myself, and to not change myself into who you are.
3. Itâ€™s okay to be depressed. Itâ€™s okay to have anxiety and feel like crap, itâ€™s okay to be sad.
4. Iâ€™m not worthless, and I deserve someone who doesnâ€™t treat me like I am such.
5. Having disagreements does not mean that the other person shouts at you until you cry.

I have to thank you because you introduced me to my current boyfriend, who I am soon celebrating 4 months with. He is my angel, my sunshine. I care for him and he cares for me. I am only sixteen, and I feel like Iâ€™ve found someone I genuinely want to be with for the rest of my life. He is an amazing person; he listens to me when Iâ€™m sad (which to be frank isnâ€™t nearly as often as it was when you were around), he listens to what I want and respects my boundaries instead of pushing me until I say yes. You accidentally introduced me to the most amazing person in my life, all because you just wanted to show me this random meme. 

I could hate you, but I donâ€™t. The only thing I feel towards you is fear, and anxiety. You scare me, and I feel so afraid you will hurt me again. Iâ€™m not going to deny that I hurt you too through my sadness. However, you took it a step further by telling me, a person who has attempted suicide twice, that you wished I had killed myself. I feel shaky and nervous around you, and I trip over my words. You might not notice it at work because I try to make myself smile for the other girls there.

Thank you for teaching me that I have self worth and deserve better than a guy who treats me like I am an expendable item.
