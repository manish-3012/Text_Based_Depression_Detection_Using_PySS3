Some boys are probably ugly to most people and considered a 4/10 but I literally think their quirkyness is so cute and they're so perfect and 10/10 to me Like Idk how to explain it further, I personally think they're perfectly cute but realize they're not most people's type. I'm just different and there's no supermodel that I would be happy with.
