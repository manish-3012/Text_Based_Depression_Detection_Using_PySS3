tw self h-rm when i was together with my ex he told me that he didn't like my cuts and scars and that it made him uncomfortable if he saw them when we cuddled etc. and i didn't know what to do. it made me very self concious and i always tried my best to hide them. i broke up with him a few days ago due to an incident but i still think about what i should have done and what i should do in the future. any advice?
