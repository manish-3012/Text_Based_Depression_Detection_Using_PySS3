Was it justified to make my friendâ€™s ex girlfriend cry? She cheated on him with the same guy that abused our friend. This was about 4 months ago and theyâ€™ve been dating since.

They tried making fun of him and just started tearing him down so I told her to â€œquit tucking talking. Youâ€™re the one who flinches every time [piece of shit she cheated with] raises his hand above his waist unless your eyes are too swollen shut to see him do it.â€

Her new boyfriend tried coming at me so I told him that he was â€œa pussy whoâ€™s only dating her for her marina trench of a cunt, and to finally be able to win fightsâ€ (Iâ€™m referring to the time I kicked his ass for hitting my friend he used to dateâ€
