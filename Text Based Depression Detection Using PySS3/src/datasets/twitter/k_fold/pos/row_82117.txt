How do I ask out a girl ? Iâ€™ve only ever asked out 2 girls and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m really doing it right in all honesty, Iâ€™ve tried asking them out in person and over text but neither felt quite right ..

I have a crush on one of my classmates, and I want to ask her out, whatâ€™s the best way ?

Yes I know I may get rejected but thatâ€™s part of life, I just want to make sure I get it right and ask her out properly.
