Okay so I'm scrolling through new and... Theres this mf who's past the age range of "teenager" complaining about how the sub is just "a bunch of cringe teenagers trying to be funny"... like ye man, what do you expect on a subreddit for things that teenagers might enjoy or be interested in? like coming here saying you "banged chicks" just makes u sound like a dumbass, no one talks like that anymore except for people trying to be cool who just look cringe as fuck.

Then another person in the replies, a 27 year old guy going on about how much "cooler" they are because they "go to the skate park" and "sell weed to teenagers", like how is this guy both claiming all teens do is stay in while also saying he sells weed to them? u do home deliveries lmao? Nah my man u acting like ur cool because "back in the day" u sat on the park with ur mates "sometimes getting alcohol", calm down big man, u need to learn, we have entered the age where everyones either stoners, gamers, a gang of gays or a mix between the 3. Also why r u 27 and ur recent activity on reddit has primarily been on a teenagers subreddit? If u r like this, just there in ur 20s going through a teenagers subreddit just to start off, just shut urself up before u talk cos no one wants to hear it.

okay rant over.
