I topped my school and I feel like such a loser I'm 18 and I feel like I wasted my highschool years by studying, gaming on my pc and randomly surfing the web. I don't even remember much of my high school years and I made little to no friends in these past years. I still can't talk to girls and I have increasingly low self esteem.

I got really good marks and got the best college in my city and I am now feeling like a piece of shit looking back at all the time that I have wasted. Can anyone advise me on how to deal with this?

Thanks
