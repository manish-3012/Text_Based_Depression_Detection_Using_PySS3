Have any of you ever thought about running away? Back when I lived with my step-mom I honestly almost did. I made a plan and everything. I was going to sneak out the back door and use the small amount of money I had to get to my Mom's house. I didn't end up doing it but sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had done it. Thankfully, unless something goes horribly wrong, I won't ever want to seriously run away again.
