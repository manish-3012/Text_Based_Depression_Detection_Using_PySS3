Somehow I got diagnosed with depression even though Iâ€™m probably one of the least sad people I know Iâ€™m not exactly happy but Iâ€™m not sad either, I just kinda exist and make dumb jokes n shit to keep myself entertained. Iâ€™d say my biggest symptom is chronic boredom. Still itâ€™s weird that I got diagnosed as depressed though.
