I met someone amazing but I need your help! I met someone online playing a game and we really hit it off. Iâ€™m really glad to be friends with them and we talk everyday. Even though we met two weeks ago we have become pretty close. We live in different states and connect a lot through culture. We both wanna call each other but idk why Iâ€™m still hesitant. Why do I still feel hesitant? Should I call them? I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on/what to do. Thx yâ€™all ðŸ˜Š
