what is racism? Why is calling a asian smarter than others accepted? So if i call a asian smarter because he is simply asian, isnâ€™t that racism but â€˜positiveâ€™?
Can racism be positive? And is calling a asian person smarten racist to the other races?
When someone calls a white person better than for example black people, thats considered racism. But when someone calls a black person better than a white person its socially accepted.

So many questions...
