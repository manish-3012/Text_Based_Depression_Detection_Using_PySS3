Okay, Iâ€™m kinda upset about this. I was playing Among Us and I wanted to be cyan.

So I asked the cyan person if I could be cyan, and *the host of the game fricking banned him so I could be cyan.*

I left the game because I felt as if the host of the game went too far by banning someone innocent for my benefit.
