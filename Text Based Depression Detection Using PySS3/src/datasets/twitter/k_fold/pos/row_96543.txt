i just wanted to say thanks to everyone who supports LGBTQ+. I live in Ukraine, basically a country of homophobes (Atleast it's a bit better than in Russia). Reading comments on pride parades videos is just so heartbreaking. Stuff like "They should all d*e, they're animals" etc. I feel like every gay person is scared of living in Ukraine/Russia. Again, thank you â¤ï¸
