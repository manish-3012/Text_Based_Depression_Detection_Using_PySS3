I hate my school, family, and friends. Donâ€™t you just love it when your sister is taking medication for her temper, your dad has bipolar and your mom is disabled and all your teachers say that my anxiety is selfish. Iâ€™ve been telling my mom that I havenâ€™t wanted to off myself in over a year but tbh I though about it last week. Nobody seems to care about my situation and nobody understands the toll this online school system is having in my brain. Sorry for ranting, just needed to get that out. Goodbye!!!
