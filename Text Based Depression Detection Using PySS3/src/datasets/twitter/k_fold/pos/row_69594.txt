How the hell do I be more outgoing? When I'm with people I know well, I'm friendly, funny, and outgoing in general. But when first meeting people I am pretty quiet and reserved, and this has led to some pretty negative effects. E.g. people pass me over for someone dumb or unqualified, or don't me the opportunity to speak as much as they do for others. I hate being the "quiet one of the group." As I'm transitioning to the professional world, I **NEED** to present myself better, especially since I'll be interacting with more and more people of diverse backgrounds. 

What are some tangible ways I can improve myself in this aspect? Also, if this belongs in a more suitable sub *please* indicate so in the comments. Thanks!!
