ITS CHIPOTLE DAY OKOK HEAR ME OUT

So the only reason Iâ€™m super hyped abt this is bc chipotle is the best thing thatâ€™s happened since sliced bread.

However,

My parents are advertised to chipotle bc of the things about their chicken and what not.


BUT!!!!!!

my brother is part of the student body at his school, and his school is holding a fundraiser, and itâ€™s at chipotle.


MEANING I GET CHIPOTLE TODAY, ITS FUCKING CHIPOTLE DAY


GOD DAMN Yâ€™ALL DONT KNOW HOW LONG ITS BEEN SINCE IVE HAD CHIPOTLE 



also big F for the people here whoâ€™ve never eaten at chipotle, or donâ€™t have one near them, Iâ€™ll say a prayer in your names

Itâ€™s basically a Mexican chain thatâ€™s rlly big, and their food is really good :)

How do yâ€™all take your chipotles??
