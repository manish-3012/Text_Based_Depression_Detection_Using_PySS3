Today we had a Maths lesson without a teacher A student in my school got you-know-what so they closed the school for a few days. Therefore we had a Maths lesson via Skype today. Well the teacher was a bit late, but then we started the lesson. However, the line echoed horribly. We figured out that it is because someone on their phone who has the lesson on speakers. However, we didnt know who it was. So even though we wanted the lesson to continue (as we like the teacher), we couldnt do anything about it. She didnt think that way apparently, and eventually got fed up and left. We got a bit scared, as this is not an everyday occasion, to say the least, and decided to fix the problem. After a few minutes of muting people in name order and then trying to speak, we found the person to mute to avoid the echo. Afterwards we texted the teacher that we have managed to find the cause of the echo and that we can continue the lesson. However she was not available anymore. However, we wanted to give her the chance to come back. So we stuck around, the whole class of 17, teacherless, just talking and crackong jokes, for 30 minutes until the lesson was supposed to end. She didnt come back in the end but when we told her what happened she was ok with it and apologised for getting mad.

There is no Moral of this story, I just wanted to share cuz why not.
