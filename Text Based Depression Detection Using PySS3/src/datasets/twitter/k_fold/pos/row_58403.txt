Would yâ€™all watch this movie? Pt 9 Ok, so i call it â€œThe Vaquero And The Slavesâ€ (working on the title), Itâ€™s a historical western film.

Ok so before before I tell you the premise, youâ€™ve gotta know a bit of US &amp; Mexican History. Mexico abolish slavery in 1829, around 40 years before the US did. This was a reason that Texas seceded from Mexico, &amp; eventually joined the US. The US attempt to have Mexico sign a contract to return slaves to the US who jumped down south, but Mexico refused. Many Mexicans aided slaves in the Underground Railroad, helping them down south for freedom.

Ok, so now for the story. We follow Antonio Moreno, a Tejano Vaquero (thatâ€™s Spanish for cowboy) in 1860 with dual citizenship between Texas &amp; Mexico. Heâ€™s also a vigilante (so like Zorro), &amp; recently took down the corrupt mayor of a small Texas town. The slaves of the mayor escape, &amp; all run for safety. Two slaves, Zora &amp; Billy, brother &amp; sister, find Antonio, &amp; he decides to help them through the dangerous world of Texas &amp; into the freedom of Mexico. Antonio becomes a good friend of Billy, &amp; he develops a crush on Zora.

I feel like this part of the Underground Railroad isnâ€™t talked about as much, so itâ€™d be kinda cool to have a film set around it. And Quentin Tarantino once said that â€œWesterns echoed the political era they were made inâ€. This kinda echoes our current political climate in the US. Corrupt politicians, Mexican immigrants being awesome, &amp;  black people being under attack by the US. Would yâ€™all watch it?
