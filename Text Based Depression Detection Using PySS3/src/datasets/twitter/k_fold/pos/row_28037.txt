Iâ€™m preoccupied with worries that my friends will blacklist me I hate when people say â€œIf your friends are bad, ditch them and get better friends.â€ First, itâ€™s really hard to get friends. Second, bad friends are often better than no friends. 

Theyâ€™re the type of people that think that if they canâ€™t convert someone to their beliefs, then they have no choice but to never speak to them again. 

I strongly believe in what I believe and I know itâ€™s not going anywhere. I donâ€™t need my friends to believe in the same things that I do, I just want to hang out.

If they find out what I believe then theyâ€™ll blacklist me. But if I keep pretending that I believe in everything they do then Iâ€™m not being myself. I feel horrible for making up lies just to hide myself. 

I keep thinking that maybe this phase will end for them. I knew them before and they werenâ€™t like this.
