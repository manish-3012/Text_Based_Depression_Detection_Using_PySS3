I repeated a joke twice Normally when Iâ€™m in a group of friends Iâ€™ll say a joke and then nobody reacts so Iâ€™ll say it again but louder and they keep ignoring it and itâ€™s like I know they heard me but like did they hear me the first time, bet theyâ€™re cringing on the inside just like me and then my soul just dies

But today someone made a joke of my brother reading minds and I said â€œthat boy can hardly read a coloring book how tf is he gonna read off someoneâ€™s brain cells?â€ and nobody said anything but then I said it again and they laughed and now Iâ€™m just proud of myself and my dumb joke because that doesnâ€™t usually happen, thanks for reading
