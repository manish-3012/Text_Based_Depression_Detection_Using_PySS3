I got offered to go to Harvard. Iâ€™m stressed as I plan my life out at 15. Hi, my name is Sebastian Lozano. Iâ€™m a 15 year old DJ and learning music producer. Iâ€™m good at debate, strong public speaker, and Iâ€™m a 3.8 GPA sophomore. 

On October 15, I got offered the opportunity of a lifetime. I got offered a scholarship that would give me a full ride of a 4 year degree at my choice of colleges that are ranked top 17 in the nation. I will fill out the application properly and hope that I get selected for the scholarship. 

Iâ€™m a hard worker in school, so I donâ€™t have any issues doing school work at all. However, if I get accepted, I have to plan out my life. Iâ€™m really good at reasoning quickly and forming my opinion using statistics and verified data provided. 

Iâ€™ve always been told that Iâ€™d be a good lawyer. Iâ€™ve always wanted to be a lawyer. Thus, I have decided that I will go to college to get a 4 year political science degree. Then, I will go to law school using another scholarship. After getting my JD from law school, I will take the bar exam. Itâ€™s a lot, but I know I can work and study hard to pass everything I am faced with. After officially becoming a lawyer, I will join a big law firm and work with seasoned lawyers to learn and gain experience in the field. I will work as a lawyer until I reach 40.

 I will use my plan I have created to run for the Presidency of The United States. This plan is lengthy so I wonâ€™t include it here. Im also trying to find a time to serve in the military. I may join the USMC before or after college. Thatâ€™s where I need your help. When should I join the USMC? I really want to serve. Iâ€™ve always wanted to. Now that Iâ€™m reaching the age of enlistment, I really want to join. 

So basically, my life will be become a lawyer, serving my country, and becoming president. It sounds simple when I say that, but I understand itâ€™ll be a long and strenuous road to doing what I need. What do you suggest I do? Thank you for reading!
