I fucking hate my internet So average internet speed in my country is around 75Mbps, I personally have fucking 10 Mbps on a good day and usually it's around 5Mbps. I can't even do anything about it because there is only one internet provider in a fucking shithole I live in. I always wanted to have fun making gameplays on YT or something or at least have internet decent enough to play online but fuck me I guess
