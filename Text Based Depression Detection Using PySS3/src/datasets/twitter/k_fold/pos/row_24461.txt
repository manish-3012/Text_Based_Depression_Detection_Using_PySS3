If anyone needs someone to talk to, my dms are always open If anyone is going through something, no matter how small, my dms are always open and I promise that there will be no judgements from me.

I see too many teenagers going through difficult times and looking down themselves, and sometimes they just need another teenager to talk to. So if anyone wants to, just dm me and we can talk and there will be no judgements from me on what you're feeling :).
