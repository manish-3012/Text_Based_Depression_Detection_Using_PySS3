My crush just said she isn't looking for a relationship... Ok so currently I'm in quarantine because my brother got corona. This means a whole lot of time and a whole lot of boredom.

So I thought fuck it why not text my crush, to my surprise she answered quite fast and we started chatting a bit. Chatting turned to flirting and before I knew it we were flirting for nearly 2 hours straight. I thought she must like me back right? I mean nobody first for 2 hours with someone random. Right?? Well nope. I made a move and she didn't reply for a while.

15 minutes later I hear from a friend she isn't interested in a relationship right now. Like bruh. Why did she flirt with me for 2 hours straight then. Also why didn't she just tell me straight to my face? I just needed to vent I guess. Goodnight folks
