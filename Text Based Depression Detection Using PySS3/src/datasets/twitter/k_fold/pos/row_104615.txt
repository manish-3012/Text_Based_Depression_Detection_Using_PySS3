I have a problem So like many kids my age, I got caught up in vaping. I tried it at a party and eventually started buying it myself. At first I told myself I only did it to help with anxiety issues, but itâ€™s evolved to where I have to go to the bathroom every hour to hit, and even though it makes me nauseous and a bit sick I still do it. I want to quit it bcs itâ€™s not good and itâ€™s making me really sick when I do it, but I canâ€™t put it down. Any advice?
