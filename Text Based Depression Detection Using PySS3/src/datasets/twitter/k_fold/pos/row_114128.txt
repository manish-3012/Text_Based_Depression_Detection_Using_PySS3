Iâ€™m sick of people calling my boyfriend a neck beard because of how he looks! Iâ€™m sick of people calling my boyfriend a neckbeard because heâ€™s overweight, has a bit of scruff and wears glasses. I love him and heâ€™s the sweetest, most thoughtful guy Iâ€™ve met. But people canâ€™t seem to stop saying he looks like a neckbeard, and itâ€™s annoying. 

I love him and in no way is he a neck beard. Heâ€™s just a cuddly marshmallow. :(
