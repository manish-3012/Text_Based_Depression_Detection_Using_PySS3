There's no such thing as a save space anymore.... People tend to find places like chatrooms, groups, communities etc just to rant about their personal lives and find people to relate and be comfortable around with, such as a save space...but of course "if there's a light, darkness follows it" 


I joined an art community once, left that shit because it was toxic asf, I never really understood the difference between criticism and bad judgement [or someone just making fun of me]  [I was 14 back then] and when I soon realized that, I felt stupid and betrayed. 


Now I bet this poor girl felt kinda the same way, the one who got banned, I bet she thought this subreddit was also some what of a save space and tried to expose that "person" not for her to be ridiculed and banned. 


 I feel like she won't be coming back even if the ban has been uplifted.
