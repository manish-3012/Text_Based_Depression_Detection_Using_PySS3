No one talks about what September is really for Everyone's been talking about "No Simp September," and I get that its just a thing some kid probably made up and now everyone's caught onto it, but why isn't anyone talking about how September is for National Suicide Awareness Month? 

I just wanna appreciate all the people that have made it this far, and are still going. I'm proud of you guys. I know I wouldn't have been here right now if not for a few people and i'm glad i'm still here. Even if its hard to get up sometimes, and you can't do anything at all, just waking up takes a lotta work sometimes, and i'm proud of you, for getting up today. 

I can't guarantee it'll get better. To be honest, it might get worse. But good things happen after a lot of bad things, and so I hope things look up for all of you. Please take care of yourselves. :3
