Best matrix move experience ever So i don't use reddit very often, but i had to tell this story. I just got home and was very tired. So my dad was like: Aleksa there is matrix on TV you can watch it if you wont. So I did my parents went to sleep and i stayed to watch a movie. And at one point my friend text me messege:
Sve je san(It's all just a dream).
I was very confused while watching a movie itself (I'm not very smart and its easy to confuse me). Sonwhen i saw that message i was mood of what the fuck. So i asked her to prove it.
At that point TV gose out of signal, for couple second's.
I started to look and was not sure what.
She sends a voice message that said something i could not understand at the beginning and after that thats how you know it's a dream(later i realised it's some joke like cuz i love you or some shit idk).
What the fuck. I was genuinely confused and scared for a second, how is that coincidence possible real shit right there.
It did not help the fact that my had hurt like fuck for smoking like 10 cigarettes in maybe half an hour.
Entire thing was a mind fuck on a new level.
Still it is probably the best matrix move experience ever.
