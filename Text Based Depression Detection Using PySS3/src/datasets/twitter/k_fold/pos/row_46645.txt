A Quick rant  So My friends became very toxic lately, It started like 6 months ago, when started reporting, insulting, enemy players and calling them hackers, Just because they killed him, at first I tried to ignore that, but, he started being even more toxic, and my other friend also started being like that, when we are playing with random people, one of them insults, and calls people noob, because they did something wrong, and votes to kick them, which usually Ends up with huge argument, and this can really destroy a good match, The other Just makes annoying sounds to the mic, but also insults others, today, I tried to tell them, that It's bad, but they ignored it, and also, we are also not the Best players, we all have the lowest ranks, and we play with people with the lowest ranks, so they mÄ…kÄ™ mistakes, but they laugh it off, I'm so Dissapointed in them, what do you think?

Sorry if this is long, but I don't have anyone to talk to
