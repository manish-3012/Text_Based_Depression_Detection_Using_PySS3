I downloaded TikTok and now I regret it I downloaded it a little while ago just to see what it was like, I I ironically thought it was good.....until about 5 minutes ago.

I looked in my â€œFor you pageâ€ and I saw a video of a girl getting a tattoo on her ðŸ± and she then preceded to have an orgasm on the guy that was tattooing her, and the the guy tattooing her slipped and fell over, I have never been so fucking grossed out in my entire fucking life. And the fact someone would post that to tik tok is bad, but the fact that it HASNT BEEN TAKEN DOWN IS WORSE. 

I fucking hate tik tok, and the people who post on it.
