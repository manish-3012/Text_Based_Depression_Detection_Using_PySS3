Full update to previous post I know I said I would do this a while go but I got pre occupied. It didnâ€™t work out the way I wanted. I spent the night with her and we cuddled but thatâ€™s about it. I spent the last week trying to figure out if she liked me or not because she seemed like she did and my friends seemed to think she did too and I asked her out last night and she told me she â€œwasnâ€™t ready for a relationshipâ€. So I guess Iâ€™m gonna try to move to Canada :/ I donâ€™t have any reason to be here.
