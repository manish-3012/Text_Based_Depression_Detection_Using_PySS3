Why do parents pull lectures out of no where Like I could be talking to my dad showing him a meme I found funny and then he pulls out and hour long lecture about how The people that made the meme are stupid and I shouldnâ€™t share it because someone might take it the wrong way and attack me or something and how the people who made it wonâ€™t get hurt because they made it from the comfort of their parents basement and Iâ€™m just standing there thinking dad just tell me you donâ€™t want me sharing stuff I donâ€™t need a lecture every time I show you something
