Really struggling rn...  Has anyone else been seeing all these memes about â€œamong usâ€ and the â€œimposterâ€ like everywhere?? I understand itâ€™s a game and Iâ€™ve even watched some of my fav streamers play it but like whatâ€™s so funny? Iâ€™ve been â€œtrolledâ€ if you will, on multiple occasions by being baited into these stupid imposter and among us jokes. I just need some help understanding.
