round metal pointy things make me squeamish i also have a completely separate phobia of medical needles thatâ€™s completely unrelated to this 

basically any metal object where any cross section down the length of it is a circle, and ends in a point sharp enough to pierce skin with relatively little force. and umbrellas that end in a point, omfg those are like actually worse than anything else 

thereâ€™s 2 reasons for this. the first is i imagine it being driven into my neck. the second (this only really applies to thumbtacks, and sewing needles) is that &gt;!i imagine it going up my urethra!&lt;

i havent found a way to stop myself from thinking about that the moment i see one
