If it happens again I'm going to actually stand up for myself... On two different days now, this girl I've been interested in for 7 years has sent me nudes. She's denying it and saying that she doesn't send pics like that (yeah...ok) so she doesn't know how it happened. I don't really believe her, I gave her the benefit of the doubt after the first time but any trust I had in her word shattered after the second. She claims someone hacked her account to send them and that they weren't even pics of her. Don't get what she gains out of fucking with me like that though.

Either way, she's going home now from Florida where she was staying with some family members. She said it was probably one of her cousins who did it. Well now, she can't use that as an excuse cause she'll be home in a few hours. If it happens again, I'm gonna be legitimately pissed and call her out on the bullshit.
