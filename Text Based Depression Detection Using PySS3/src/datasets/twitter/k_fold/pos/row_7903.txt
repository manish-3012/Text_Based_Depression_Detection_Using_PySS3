Got the special chair So I'm going to school on person, as some quick context. I I just walked into the class right after lunch and to find that instead of  one of the uncomfortable ass plastic standard school chairs, There's like this big, super comfy swivel chair with a super comfy cushions at my desk. I thought it was a mistake at first, "how could it not" I said to myself because it hasn't been like this before, and one of my classmates have them.  But sense I I'm kinda easy going and/or non confrontational, I followed the expression "don't look a gift hoarse in the mouth" and sat in it, fully expecting the teacher to come boot me out of the seat and replace it with a normal chair, but it never happened. All I can think right now is WHY CANT IT BE LIKE THIS EVERY DAY because this thing is killer! The cushions are more comfortable than my fucking pillow, it has a spring thing so it lightly bounces a bit instead of going strait up and down, and it has fucking armrest. Both my legs and my ass have fallen asleep on this once in a blue moon mirical and ngl I think I'm gonna struggle to get out of the chair and too my next class.
