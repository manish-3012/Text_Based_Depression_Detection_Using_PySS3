I hate Indian uncles when they do this Recently my parents bought me a new phone. Cost about 15000 rupees(200 dollars). This morning I was surfing reddit,  YouTube etc. Then my uncle comes and asks "oh you bought a new phone. How much does it cost?" Then I said 15000. Then he was like "omg why does this cost this much? Who bought this for you? It's too costly." Like seriously why tf do you care. Also this is the same guy who bought 60k rupees(800 dollar) laptop for his kid.
