get flexed on by my inferior genetics, lads and females. What I mean:

what I've inherited from my mom's side: migraines, shortness, bad memory, intelligence, and like 12-14/20 vision. nice

from my dad's side, high blood pressure (144/85) which is a comorbidity which does mean I don't have to go to school so uh... win win... the urge to be on time for stuff, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember now.

try to flex on me with even more inferior genetics, bet you cannot.
