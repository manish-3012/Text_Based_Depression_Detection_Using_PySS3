my bestfriend "depressed" because the girl he was with broke up with him anyway exactly as the title as so ive been trying to cheer him because that what you do in the process of trying to make him feel better he has taken advantage of my kindness to insult me

first day i was like okay hes hurt and frustrated

second day i was like WTF

but today this dude just blocked for no reason just because i wanted to hang out at the skating rink or watch anime and gas up.

he was like "im going to unblock you tommorow"

this dude is clearly trying to screw me pulling a whole squidward( when he was homeless and spongebob took care of him )

so obviously im mad because im only in town for 2 weeks so im wondering what should i do?

i got a couple plans like:

flirt with his ex girlfriend

ignore him for 2 days

who would you do teens?
