Got into an argument with my pastor yesterday I wouldnâ€™t really consider myself religious anymore, but I was raised Christian and my parents still want me to go to church with them. Anyway, my pastor was saying stuff about how being gay is a choice, women should submit to men, women are incapable of being in positions of power or being â€œcreativeâ€, trans people were infringing upon his freedom etc. he even said that bibles were banned in public schools which is literally not even true. so I talked to him after the sermon and we got into an argument. I donâ€™t hate religious people and Iâ€™m not an edgy atheist or something but I really canâ€™t stand people like him. He doesnâ€™t even feel the need to explain anything he says and heâ€™ll just say the dumbest shit. Anyway I just wanted to vent
