Fuck drawing me and all my homies hate anatomy Fuck drawing or sketching, literal rocket-fucking science with the amount of bullshit I have to put up with in my hands.

Iâ€™ll literally have a clear image of a pose I want to draw and it ends up looking like a overcooked potato wedge because I still donâ€™t know how to draw anatomy yet. 

And too top it all off I have to keeping doing this everyday for like 5 hours for 3-4+ years if I want to see major improvement.
