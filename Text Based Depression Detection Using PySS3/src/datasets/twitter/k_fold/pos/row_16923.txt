Day 8 of Posting Sabaton lyrics until I'm dating someone The eight of September it starts  
The rage of the Reich  
A barrage of mortars and guns  
Stand past, the bunkers will hold  
The captain has pledged his life  
I'll face my fate here  
The sound of artillery strike  
So fierce  
The thunder of guns
