I just wanted to say I'm clean and I'm proud. My lifes been pretty shitty so far, from being a victim of a pedo to abusive families and shit. So I started taking some drugs and smoking, but hey!

I'm a YEAR clean of smoking!

And I'm a week off of the drugs! 

Yeah, so it was hard, I think. The drug thing I'm working on, but progress!
