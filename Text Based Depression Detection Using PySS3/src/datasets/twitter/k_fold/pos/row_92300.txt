Hi Iâ€™m sad lonely please help Iâ€™m a junior and Iâ€™m on my third high school. My closest friends right now are from my middle school and a few from my second high school. Issue is I keep fucking moving and they all live on the other side of the country so all I can do is play games with them but itâ€™s not the same. I just started going to school in person and itâ€™s so much worse cause now I have to watch groups of people that have been friends for years have fun while Iâ€™m just a lonely loser. I made all my friends at my last high school by joining track but itâ€™s too late in the year to join anything. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to groups of people and although they are nice, they have all been friends for a while and I just feel like a third wheel. I talked to one girl when I took the act before in person and I liked her but i havenâ€™t been able to find her again and I donâ€™t know if she is in person and I donâ€™t even remember her name. Making friends feels like a lose cause. In class nobody talks to each other. So few people are just openly nice to the people sitting near them. Starting a school mid year and moving is just killing my mentality. Nothing is enjoyable anymore as Iâ€™ve lost all my extracurriculars. I just feel so pathetic. Everyone at my last school was so nice and nobody was ever alone and this school is just not like that because itâ€™s so big. I hate it so much and I still have a whole year and two months left here. I canâ€™t just come home and cry every day I donâ€™t know what to do. I was semi popular at my old school and I miss it so much.
