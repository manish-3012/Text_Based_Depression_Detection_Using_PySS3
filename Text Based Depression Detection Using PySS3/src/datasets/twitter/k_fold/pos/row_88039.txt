Do you guys ever feel uncomfortable making eye contact with adults? Like, it's just hard to maintain eye contact. I feel like something bad is gonna happen if I keep looking at them that way. Sort of like intimidation? From waiters and waitresses to even my own parents I cannot look them dead in the eye. Is this just me or do y'all have social anxiety too?
