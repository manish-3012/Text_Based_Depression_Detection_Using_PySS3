Ok this is gonna be a very unpopular opinion I think Non-cis suicide rates are through the roof, some studies estimate its as much as 10x higher than cis people. I'm no scientist, but I have a theory why this is so: *people with underlying mental issues, born or caused by a fucked home life, will try to fix their problem by fixing an issue that was never there in the first place*. Or to clarify some more, many trans and nb people will assume they are not happy or comfortable in their current gender when the issue is not in their gender but a myriad of other factors such as depression, daddy/mommy issues, shit home life in general, just to name a few. And don't get me wrong, its obviously not all non-cis people, if you are truly happy as trans, nb, genderfluid, etc. then good for you, this post is not about you. But if you are considering identifying as non-cis, ask yourself if you would still do that if you had a more privileged life and were mentally ok in every department. Be civil in the comments I'm open to discussion so long as you don't immediately call me a transphobe cunt.
