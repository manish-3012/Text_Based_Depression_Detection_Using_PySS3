How do I get over someone from high school TL;DR: got a crush on a girl I kind of knew, haven't seen or talked to her at all in around 8 months but I still think I have feelings for her despite knowing I probably won't get to see her again


Basically, last year in high school I met this girl in a class of mine, and we would sometimes talk to each other. She was really nice and it was never anything more than her being friendly. But,, being deprived of pretty much any female attention, I ended up getting feelings for her because that's just what happens when you don't talk to girls often. 

For a while we kind of ended up talking a little more but then we kind of drifted apart and didn't talk as much. We never got to talking outside of school or anything so we weren't really friends, but it did kind of suck. However, I didn't really stop feeling for her. I was hoping we would be able to talk some more as the year finished out but then covid hit and we haven't talked at all since (because we never got to talking outside of school so I didn't have her contact info). At that point I was just trying to be friends with her though.

For a while I didn't really think of her all that much but recently I'm starting to think I never really stopped liking her, since I've been thinking about her more often than usual. I don't know why; we haven't spoken or seen each other since March so it should have been long enough to get over her but if I somehow saw her again I  would probably fall flat.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't tell her how I feel for multiple reasons. And I don't think I could meet anyone else that would take my mind off of her (which would also kind of be unethical). I'll also probably never get to see her or talk to her again, so there's no real reason for me to be feeling this way. I figured all this time would be enough to move on but I can't seem to. How do I get over her?
