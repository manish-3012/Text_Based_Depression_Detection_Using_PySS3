College is fucking depressing. Over the past two years of college I have come to learn that college is a pretty existentially draining experience. Not specifically from the work you do or the people you meet, but from watching what happens to the people you already know. 

A few days ago, I got a message saying one of my high school friends had recommended me for a job. I thought it was pretty great because I happened to be looking for work at that exact time. It turns out the company (which did not immediately reveal its identity) was **Vector Marketing**, a MLM which has had lawsuit after lawsuit directed at it for how it treats its employees, or â€œprivate contractorsâ€ as they call them to avoid even further legal trouble. This was the fourth or fifth time someone I knew pretty well fell into an MLM. Sometimes it was DoTerra, pushing their essential oils as a legitimate alternative form of healthcare, effectively preying on the desperate. Sometimes it was Cutco, with all of their shady business practices and lawsuits.

When I went to college like all my friends, I did not expect this. They were all genuine, reasonable people. I wouldnâ€™t expect any of them (except maybe one) to fall into this pit. I have watched MLMs that **specifically target college students** effectively destroy the lives of several lifelong friends. And this, the fallibility of man, the evil manipulation, watching my friends drop out of college one by one, was something I was not prepared for, and is something I donâ€™t know if I will ever come to terms with.

All I can say is be fucking careful. Research **EVERY** company that you work for. Credit card companies, MLMs, Timeshares, and pyramid schemes **WILL SPECIFICALLY TARGET COLLEGE STUDENTS, INCLUDING YOUR FRIENDS** because they have no real world experience, making it harder for them to detect a scam before theyâ€™re in too deep.
