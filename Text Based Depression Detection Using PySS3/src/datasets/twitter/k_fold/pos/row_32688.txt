Iâ€™m in a slump (F) Recently, Iâ€™ve been feeling extremely down for no apparent reason. Iâ€™ve slacked on my schoolwork, I hardly have the energy to get out of bed like I used to, and on top of that, I just feel like a shell of my former self. My birthdayâ€™s coming up soon, and my parents have signed me up for sports this spring. I havenâ€™t resorted to talking to my parents about it because in the past, they only treat it as laziness or just foolishness (Not that theyâ€™re bad parents or anything, Iâ€™m just stating how ineffective itâ€™ll be). I donâ€™t have a lot of things I could do, even if I think real hard about it. Any advice would be helpful.
