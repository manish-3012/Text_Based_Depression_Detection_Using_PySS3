Can you please check out this video i made 
[here is the video it's called "physics for gamers" but really has nothing to do with physics or gamers lol](https://youtu.be/ykhWQxCy8hI) 

I made this video i am very proud of it 

Want to see if people think it's not bad or not not 

If i can criticise myself i would say that the video has no topic to latch on to. It's quite a mess. First 2 minutes are the intro. Then 5 minutes of of me talking about physics classes i have. Then for some reason i get a matches and light them on fire.... then .... &gt;!i say "this is going to be a trash year and i am going to start this trash year today" then i go to sleep on my desk in a sad way while the song "sweeden" from the minecraft soundtrack fades in and the camera pans and zooms into me while i am sleeping in a sad way!&lt; 

If i am going to talk about what's good. it's the editing. I have been learning to do some video editing for the past 5 months and i am still a noob but i am proud of my work 

Really proud even tho i have been learning for just 3 or 5 months and use a free video editor on my laptop lol (which is now broken and [makes me want to kill myself](https://youtu.be/KVpkivTBoRo) but it's okay lol) 

Thanks!
