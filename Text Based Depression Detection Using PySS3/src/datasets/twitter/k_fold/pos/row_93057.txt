We are just like Facebook. When a Facebook post tells you to like it for a stupid reason, do you? No. But when a reddit post has something along the lines of â€œme when meme get 17 upvvotesâ€ or â€œfunny image visit you say hiâ€ or â€œyou greatâ€ or â€œwHeN mY rEddit PoSt maKe 4 PeoPLe HapPYâ€ are just Redditâ€™s versions of â€œlike ifâ€ posts. Itâ€™s kinda annoying and Iâ€™m PrObABly GoINg tO gEt DoWNVoted To HeLL FoR ThIS.
