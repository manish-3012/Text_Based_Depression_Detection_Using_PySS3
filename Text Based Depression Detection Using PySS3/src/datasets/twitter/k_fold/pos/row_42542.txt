How do you deal with leaving your siblings? I (16F) just left my sister (18F) at college. My family (parents, little sister, sister going to college, + me), flew over 6 hours across the country to take my older sister to college. We spent a week in the city sheâ€™s going to college at and just said bye to her as we leave to go back home early tomorrow morning. How do you cope with being apart from your siblings? Whether or not you like them, theyâ€™re a huge part of your life. Iâ€™ve lived with my sister for over 16 years and seen/talked to her nearly every single day of that time. Sheâ€™s the person Iâ€™m closest to in the entire world. I told her I loved her for the first time today and texted it to her, but she didnâ€™t respond and now Iâ€™m even more sad. So anyway, how do you deal with this new reality, especially with the realization that life will never be as it was before?
