The best way to tell your crush you like them In my free time, Iâ€™ve been studying psychology and I believe this is the most creative way to tell your crush you like them. (I think it will work for girls too but this is mainly for the boys.) 

1. Start out with an Instagram â€œAsk me anythingâ€ on your story. 

2. Ask yourself the question â€œwho do you like?â€ And respond to that with â€œIâ€™ll dm you the answerâ€ and do that about 2 times

3. Now hopefully, others will be asking you now and always answer with â€œDm me and Iâ€™ll tell youâ€ 
Make sure to tell them the truth 

4. Wait for their friends to tell them and hope they make the first move. 

It was hard to put into words so I hope that is clear enough. Iâ€™m not going into detail about why it works but I might make an edit of people care about it enough.
