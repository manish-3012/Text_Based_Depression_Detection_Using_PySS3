Looking to form a weekend dnd group of teenagers Because r/lfg is chock full of age-restricted games.

Hi all, I'm Ender. Me and an friend of mine are looking to form an online dnd group that plays in weekends. We understand that this might not be the best place to look, and that there'll probably be a lot of first time players. Don't worry about being new, one of us is new too and I'll put up with it
(also we need a DM please somebody)

We're in GMT and EST so people in this timezone are preferred.

Shoot me a DM on Discord if you're up for it (Lemon #7044)
