Iâ€™m tired (serious post) With all the shit Iâ€™ve dealt with in life itâ€™s just I donâ€™t care for an afterlife anymore and to be honest I just donâ€™t want to exist, I know itâ€™s dark but, I feel like, this world wasnâ€™t made for someone like me, I donâ€™t know if that makes sense but I donâ€™t feel attached to this reality. I hope someone can make sense out of this.
