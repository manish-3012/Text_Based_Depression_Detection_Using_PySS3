day 1 of sharing my abuse so earlier i made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/komt7y/im_so_pissed/) abt how my parents blocked my pc. anyways so i had yt on at the time. and then my dad unlocked it so i could catch on some work. since i didnt get to close it earlier it was still on in the background and i had forgotten about it. then my dad comes in, alt +tabs and finds my youtube.  he threw my headset on the ground :( and yelled at me into a corner for 5 minutes about playing games while working.
