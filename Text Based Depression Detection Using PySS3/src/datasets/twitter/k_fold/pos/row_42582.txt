tw: self harm my friend has cuts all over her hand and has got scratched up knuckles (iâ€™m assuming sheâ€™s punched a wall) 

she keeps on claiming that itâ€™s just her cat that scratched her but sheâ€™s got cuts on the palm of her hand, too. 

she keeps on denying they are self-inflicted. i donâ€™t know how to help her if sheâ€™s just going to avoid the topic and act like they arenâ€™t there. what am i supposed to even do?
