I had the worse dream last night It wasnâ€™t like a nightmare, it was just a really awful dream.

I dreamt that I was about 7-8 years old, and this bully would constantly beat me down, every time I got up Iâ€™d get beaten again, then I was in a hospital with my family around me with that heart rate monitor thing beeping constantly and ringing in my ears, I remember crying and saying things like â€œI donâ€™t wanna go yetâ€ â€œI want to stayâ€ â€œplease let me stayâ€ and then I heard a flatline before waking up.

I almost cried when I woke up and I havenâ€™t stopped thinking about it since this morning.
