How do I stop recording data and being anxious when it comes to game progress? Now I play alot of online games, Overwatch, Valorant,  CS:GO, etc., and I play those games a lot, like any normal teenager.

But I do this thing after I finish playing where I record a bunch of things to make sire they stay the same the next time I login, this includes EXP count, match history, level, rank, all of that stuff, so everytime I login I take out my notes and start checking off stuff that cuts off.

See, this is a problem because it came to the point where I am now afraid to play these games so I can keep the same exp count and match history so I won't have to record again and again, I don't know why I do this and it's keeping me from enjoying my games, to anyone who's encountered the same problem, how did you cope with it?
