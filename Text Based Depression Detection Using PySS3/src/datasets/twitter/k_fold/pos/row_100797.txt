Silence wench I just wanna be happy Dude I don't want a boyfriend I just wanna hangout with my friends. Over break I've literally just sat around and done nothing all day. 

To top the shittiness my friend literally called me and talked to five minutes about how great his break was and then left to go hang out with his friends(it's a guy's sleepover lol he didn't intentionally leave me out). I'm so tired of trying to make plans with people and nobody is reciprocating. 

Anybody else got the same lonely vibes?
