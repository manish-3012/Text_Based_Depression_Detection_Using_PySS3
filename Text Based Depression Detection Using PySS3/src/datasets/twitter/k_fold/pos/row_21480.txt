If youâ€™re a cute girl then donâ€™t click ðŸ˜³ Too late. You are now legally obliged to comment. In your comment you must state your age (if not in your flair), gender, aspirations, 3 things you like to do, 3 things you would like to do, and a short description of yourself. 

I will then dm you if I feel like we would get along, and we can talk for a bit. 

Anyone is welcome to comment. You donâ€™t have to be a cute girl. You donâ€™t have to be a girl at all. The title was just to get peopleâ€™s interest lol. 

Oh, and if you donâ€™t comment then you have broken the law and I will get my lawyer u/your_reddit_lawyer on your case. Be warned.
