My last 6ish hours as a teen. Iâ€™ve been apart of this sub for a few years now. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever posted here before until now, but this sub has been really fun to be in. I donâ€™t really know how to describe it, but Iâ€™m almost sad that I wonâ€™t be a â€œkidâ€ anymore. Being 20 scares me because I feel like I really got to get my shit together and get my life figured out. My message to the kids who just started high school this year or start in the fall: Enjoy it. High school can be a lot of fun if you do it right and surround yourself with people whom you enjoy being around. It can be the best years of your life. Donâ€™t waste it. Being a teenager is fun. Growing up not so much. Anyways, thanks to all of yâ€™all for the laughs and I hope you all have an amazing day.
