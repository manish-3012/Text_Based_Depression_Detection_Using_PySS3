How would I cope with hormonal thoughts/mood swings? Even if im not really in control I'm still curious. I feel like last year I was learning to wrangle these new sexual thoughts, and for the last couple of months my pubescent mind has been oh-so interested in relationships. (even though I really have no friends irl) 

I know that my brain is still developing, and it isnt necessarily healthy for me to pursue what my brain tells me, but it still does affect me, and it does somewhat hurt because of my situation where I just can't seem to keep new people/friends around.
