u/Horizon8969 has been telling people Iâ€™m grooming 13 year olds, donâ€™t listen to him. Heâ€™s just jealous In October I dated his sister and one night we decided to ask private questions because well to get to know each other better and stuff. So we do that and you can clearly see me ask before do you want to do this? And are you sure youâ€™re comfortable? He then went through our convo (going through his sisters messages for some reason) then heâ€™s cropped it so it looks like Iâ€™m just asking them for no reason and Iâ€™m asking for nudes when Iâ€™m not. Here is our convo and you decide what you think. https://youtu.be/-hTEvbHnWpw
