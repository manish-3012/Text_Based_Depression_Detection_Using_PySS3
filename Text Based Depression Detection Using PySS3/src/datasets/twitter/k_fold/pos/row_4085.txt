I got 98% on my first exam! I'm happy for a change after 2 hell weeks. I've had my meltdown and lashed out at everyone in real life last Wednesday after being frustrated for a while, I lost my babysitting job last Thursday, and then my older sister had to become selfish by getting drunk to the point where she became violent and shattered our home's window. She was bleeding a lot and we had to call 911, but next night, we had to evict her out last Friday. She didn't go out in peace. She dropped herself to the bottom of the stairs in front of cops and she banged her face onto a cop vehicle's rear repeatedly. She scared me.

I was like fuck it when I first opened my exam last Monday, and then boom! I got 98% on my exam!
