Broad, dark, sexy Manox Taught me all about dynamics

He was twenty-three

And I was thirteen, going on thirty

We spent hours strumming the lute

Striking the chords and blowing the flute

He plucked my strings all the way to G

Went from major to minor, C to D

Tell me what you need

What you want, you don't need to plead

'Cause I feel the chemistry

Like I get you and you get me

And maybe this is it

He just cares so much, it feels legit

We have a connection

I think this guy is different
