Some random advice I got from a comment on here A comment on a deleted post of mine told me to "enjoy my childhood" or something along those lines. When I first saw it I blew it off because me and the commenter and i were arguing about something, but that  made me think like wow, she has a point I dont amen enough mistakes in the only time your really allowed to make them. Thank you to that commenter, I think your username had bunny somewhere in it but I cant find it again because im a pissy baby that deleted the post/comments because I got upset.
