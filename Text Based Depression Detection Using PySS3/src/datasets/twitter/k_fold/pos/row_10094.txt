Do you guys think I'll become popular if I beat up this one popular douchebag at school? I've been treated like subhuman dogshit at my school for the last 10 years and this kid started going here like 2 years ago and everyone immediately started liking him. I think it's not fair because I'm smarter and a lot nicer than him, and I've done a lot of work to stop being a cringy edgelord like I was in middle school but people still don't respect me. And ofc this guy really mean to me as well and recently he vandalized my house after I made an INNOCENT JOKE ABOUT HIM. I've tried "being myself" and being respectful to everyone but none of it has worked and I'm still treated like a bottom feeding inbred loser that nobody wants to be with at my school. I feel like this is my only option left, but if none of my previous attempts at becoming respected have worked do you guys think this one will?
