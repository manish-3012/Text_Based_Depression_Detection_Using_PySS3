For any of you who think religion is a choice, hi my name is not bob and Iâ€™m an atheist Iâ€™m a normal human being, I enjoy music, video games, anime, and YouTube. My favorite artists are AURORA and Minami, I like fallout, elder scrolls, Mario, and farcry, and I watch way too much YouTube, my favorite anime are a silent voice, â€œAnotherâ€ and Charlotte. Life is terrifying, Iâ€™ve tried to believe in god, it would make life so much easier, but I canâ€™t, death terrifies me cuz I believe that after death thereâ€™s nothing, all consciousness is is the result of the billions of neurons in your brain, why would life after death exist if consciousness is just the neurons in your brain, sometimes Iâ€™ll have random eggs and pencil crises cuz existential dread, religion isnâ€™t a choice, if I had a choice I would believe in god

I know most people are fine with it but some people are convinced that itâ€™s a choice for some reason, and I doubt I convinced any of them
