Story time Like last year I met this really cute girl who was like one grade higher than me. We hung out a lot and we had a lot of similar interests, we became pretty good friends. Sheâ€™s one of the reasons I got into dungeons and dragons and itâ€™s been pretty fun. At one point I ended up getting friendzoned and I didnâ€™t even ask her out, she just said that other kids were saying that they thought we were dating and she called them idiots, and then said that She likes me as a friend. I was starting to like her but after hearing that, It really hurt..So later in the year we start hanging out again and she tells me that she plays sea of thieves, I told her also played and she asked for my gamer tag so that we could play together, I gave mine to her and she gave me hers. That ended up being the last day of school for that year because it got canceled because of COVID-19. So when I got home I got online and tried to put in the gamertag but no matter what I couldnâ€™t find it, which made me sad again. We ended up never seeing each other again because she was at the highest grade that my school went to that year so she would have to go to another school next year. I know she friendzoned me but I still wanted to tell her how I felt at some point, to get it off my chest. So I never saw her again. The end
