Pets suck Why do people keep pets its just wasting your time picking up there filth and cleaning them. Its straight up a time waste. Is it a social status thing like If I have a dog do I get a special invite into a dog club. The most wack thing is that they arent cheap either like a puppy is a grand and I dont know about cats but I think there expensive too.

Where do you find the joy of keeping a pet its like just feed and water the dog like a plant and wait till it dies. Also arent vet fuckin expensive so if it got sick you gotta pay up alot.
