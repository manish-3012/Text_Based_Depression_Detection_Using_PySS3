Do you guys have any recipes for pesto sauce? I love pesto sauce so freaking much. I ate it with a croissant earlier and it was a little weird but itâ€™s honestly like the best thing Iâ€™ve ever eaten. I would chug whole jars of pesto sauce if I could. Anyways, how do you yall enjoy your pesto sauce? Give me sauce for the sauce
