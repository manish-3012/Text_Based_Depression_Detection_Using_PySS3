I dont know whats wrong with me. I've been chronically depressed for the past 8-9 years, I have been through heartbreak, loss of family and friends, been through both mental and physical abuse, had to deal with a drug, gambling, thief addicted mother, and a paedophile for a brother and father. The only happiness I got is from my girlfriend and my step father, but the pain still hasn't gone away, I feel like it never will, I have helped so many people to help cope and I'm happy for that but, even when I try my own advice, I find some way to fuck it up or my family does. I've attempted twice, one is 2018 and one in 2019, I go to a therapist and a psychologist, they want me to be put on so much medication its not funny but I refuse, because of my mother, she has made me terrified to have medication I get scared when I have paracetamol. To sum it up, I dont know what to do anymore. Thank you for reading, dont feel obligated to say anything if you don't want to.
