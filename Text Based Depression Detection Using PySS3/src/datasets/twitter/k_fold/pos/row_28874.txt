Keeping our mental health afloat with online school. Keep communication with your friends! A lot of us have been dealing with online school recently. In the new lockdown in the uk, we were placed back to home learning at least until late February. I have learnt the importance of friendship and routine. I strongly advise that those lucky enough to have a good friendship group create things like a discord server or places where you can communicate both by text and voice/video chatting. Me and my friends have been using our discord server for a week now and it has been so reliving to have some human contact. In between lessons, at breaks and lunchs and lessons where we do not have an online call we chat together. We also have chats where we can talk about individual subjects and ask for help or laugh about dumb stuff that happened in the lesson. It is a wonderful thing keeping all of our mental health afloat. A lot of my friends didnâ€™t have discord but they found it easy to access when making an account. I sincerely hope this helps because I cannot express how this has made me feel so much more alive and not spend so much time in my own thoughts and have relief from the constant drag of online learning. 
Tldr: make a place to easily chat (I.e discord) with friends while doing online school to keep everyone mentally well and feel supported
