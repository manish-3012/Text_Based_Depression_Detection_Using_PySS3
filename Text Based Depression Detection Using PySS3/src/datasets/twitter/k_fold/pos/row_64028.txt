I watched a friendship end over anime once in middle school. Basically, I was walking to my art class and I was late so the halls were pretty empty. There was these two guys walking ahead of me though and one of them was power walking away from the other guy. The guy in front kept talking about how he didn't want to be friends with an anime fan and the guy behind him was trying to convince him that he wasn't an anime fan and he just happened to watch a couple episodes of one. It was really dumb and I hope anime guy has found a better friend honestly.
