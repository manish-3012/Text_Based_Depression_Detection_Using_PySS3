To all the gamers out there, this is a thread for you *The story's a bit long, but it'll give you mixed feelings at the end*

Hey, I am an 18 year old *Lebanese* gamer. The reason Im writing this is to show you a bit of my gaming experience as a gamer in Lebanon

Disregarding the super slow internet, we get power outages every 4-6 hours, which means you get disconnected from any match you're playing. So when I decide to play at 1 PM after studying, Im probably gonna be in a match when the clock strikes 2 and the power goes out, erasing all memories of the shitty randoms and the 9 kills I got this game.

But it doesnt end there! Imagine yourself currently at the heat of the battle and are so close to down the whole squad single handedly while your random teammates spam the "revive me" button, then the power goes out because its now 6 PM.

OR playing Ranked matches! Other than the unstable ping and packet loss like a woman on her period, imagine being so concentrated on the screen of your TV/monitor, calculating every move of the enemy team and doing complex probability... when suddenly the clock strikes 12 AM and its time for your hourly dose of power outage. 

You stand still in pitch black darkness, in eerie silence. As you hear your father snore from the other room, you slowly comprehend that all you've done is lost, and youre probably gonna get a penalty for abandoning the match.

"But I play singleplayer offline games" you might say...well you didnt save for the past 20 minutes and autosave didnt manage as well. You cant log back in and resume because the save file is now corrupt and you have to repeat the last 2 hours of the game

Its a bit sad and funny at the same time, but since we survived a fucking port explosion and years of corruption, we can manage the ping 

Thanks for hearing me out
