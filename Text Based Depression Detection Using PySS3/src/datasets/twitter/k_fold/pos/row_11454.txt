Hello fellow teenagers, help me out with my senior quote Hello people, help me write my senior quote.

I have narrowed it done to two options
1. â€œThe roof is not my son... but I will raise itâ€
*Or*
2. â€œIf no one comes from the future to stop you from doing it, how bad of a decision can it be?â€
