guys a big problem so i have a 3 year old dog named Max. he is half breed bichon and very smart.
a cat came here 3 or 4 month ago and gave birth to a kitten wich we named Lulu.
Max doesnt likes Lulu's mom and vice versa, but he like Lulu



they became very good friends and im scared because he is trying to "ride" her in the nsfw meaning. i am scared i dont want cats who bark or dogs who meow meow
