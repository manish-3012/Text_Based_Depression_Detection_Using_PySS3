if you think â€œheterophobiaâ€ is a thing youâ€™re fucking brain dead heterophobia is not a thing because being straight is normalized. its simple, you cant be oppressed for being straight, no one fought for "straight rights" because being straight is a privilege, no one was killed for being straight, therefore heterophobia is not a thing.
