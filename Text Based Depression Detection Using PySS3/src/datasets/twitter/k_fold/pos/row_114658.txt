Why I do drugs consistently? Iâ€™m 18 I just need to vent, and maybe educate some younger teenagers to make better decisions. At 14 I was invited to my first party I got there, they beat the shit out of me kicked me out. I go home, having to care for my mum who has lupus, I canâ€™t tell her, I couldnâ€™t stress her out. I spent all my time aloneâ€¦ up to about 16 when I once again got beat up in college. Went home and that same night, I hear screaming from downstairs, Iâ€™m already loaded on uppers and downers because I just canâ€™t. I walk downstairs my mum has fallen hit her head had a seizure, Iâ€™ve phoned an ambulance spent a day and night inside a hospital, waiting for my family to come, nobody shows expect my nana. She takes over for my mum, so I go home and my mums card is on the table I go take out Â£600 and spent it all on Xanax and ketamine. she came home a few weeks later, that was over Christmas btw. So New Years I go out, to a party this time with my gf once again kicked out, within a min of arriving. My gf stays, turns out she cheated on me. So Iâ€™m 18 now, I still have my mum which Iâ€™m so thankful for but I also have this addiction on me. I do music, but if I make money Ik Iâ€™d just end up overdosing. Teenagers are assholes, lifeâ€™s hard but stick with your family they got you (well most of you). I also lost a friend at 16 to suicide so I guess that fucked me up. (Sorry if this upset anyone)
