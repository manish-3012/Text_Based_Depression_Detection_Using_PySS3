Does anyone know how to cope with loneliness :( For the past 6 months I have been dealing with some of the worse mental health I have ever had to deal with. I am 17 and have always had my life planned for me, from school to sports clubs people and friends just came naturally. However, since I have moved to sixth form in 2019, loneliness has hit me like a ton of bricks. My boyfriend broke up with me in August which was really tough because he was my best friend and basically the only person I had. He continued to act like we were in a relationship in some ways which only made the depression worse as he wanted to speak to more girls and party more. It really took a huge impact on my self esteem because he had said to me that he had lost attraction and wanted me to lose weight for him to fall in love with me again. We recently decided we wonâ€™t try again which has led to me being extremely depressed. Not only do I have horrific self esteem but now I am completely alone and so sad about what my life has become. I am so jealous of everyone one around me who has friends and people to live them, I just feel alone and hopeless. I hope one day it will get better but for now I am stuck loving someone who doesnâ€™t love me whilst they are fine and moving on. Itâ€™s so painful.
