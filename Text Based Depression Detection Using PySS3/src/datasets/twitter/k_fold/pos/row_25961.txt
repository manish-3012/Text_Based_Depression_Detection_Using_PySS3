Is it possible to tame Pigeons? Yes. It sounds dumb. But after the the situation that a pigeon ate out of my hand (It was cute as fuck) a few days ago I thought to myself if it is possible that one pigeon (Everytime the same) over time will trust you more and more so that it won't fly away anymore.

I know, dumb, but maybe possible.
