Post high school depression 2 months ago i was laughing in Zoom class with my 3rd grade friends and other classmates who've stick w/ me in this journey, now, I don't know if im ever gonna see them again in my life. It all goes back to my mind now, high school crushes, my first kiss, partying, being adopted by the extroverted friend, shitty teachers, all the class jokes, the one weird kid no one talked to, the mean girls group, but mostly the nostalgia it brings, such a simple yet complex world, it might have been the worst nightmare to some, but i sure as hell will miss it :')

TLDR; High school is over, me had good memories, me sad.
