my brain is bouncing around in my skull  this guy- lzdhfgskjfhn he just asked me for advice on who he should ask out and he didn't use names but he LITERALLY DESCRIBED ME and was like "idk they're nicer to me than anyone has been in the past year and i love their music taste and they listen to me constantly but i've only known them for two weeks" (which is how long I've known him) and i told him he should go for it because he was "likeable" (mind you i would marry this guy if he asked me to) and he misspelled "thank you" by accident and then left and came back three hours later asking me to hang out next week.

i am going to implode if he was actually talking about me. and if not, then i hope the person he was talking about is good to him.
