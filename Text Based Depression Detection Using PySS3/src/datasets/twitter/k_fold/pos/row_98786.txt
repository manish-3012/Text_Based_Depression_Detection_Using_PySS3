I have no idea how I am allowed to do hang out unsupervised with my best friend Someone usually ends up hurt and we also live in Australia . For example, the other day me and my best friend went for a ride to the soccer fields and on the new soccer fields there is a really steep hill and at the bottom is a foot wide bit of concrete that goes around the outside of the soccer field. You bet we rode done that hill with no hesitation it wasnâ€™t until I decided to ride up it that something went wrong, I couldnâ€™t get all the way up and I couldnâ€™t get of my bike in time so I just fell backwards scratched up my leg but luckily I had my helmet on cause the noise that helmet made when it hit the concrete was so solid I would have been knocked out. We have also walked in the same fields when it was covered a foot in water and possibly snakes in there. We also decided to go into this mini forest that has red belly black snakes and eastern brown snakes, as well as countless other snakes and spiders.

So yeah this is just a small portion of the dumb stuff we have done in the past few months, no idea how we are still alive
