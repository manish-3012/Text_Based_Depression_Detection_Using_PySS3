Why are 14 year old white girls the punchline of every joke Like come on. It's such a specific demographic, not even "white kids" or "girls" or "14 year olds" that it must suck being one and hearing that all the time. Yeah it's a joke but I imagine it gets old. I'm an 18 year old guy myself but my sister's 14 and idk. Shit's odd.
