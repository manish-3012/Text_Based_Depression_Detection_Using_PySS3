Hehe my life isn't much better, unlike how I thought it was Imagine getting rejected by someone who you love, being told by your ex that she fucks her new boyfriend weekly, being seen as a manwhore for being taken advantage of, being a therapist that holds so many secrets from others and hears depressing stories all the time, not being allowed to eat dairy or meat because its "poison", not being allowed outside at all, being lied to by friends, giving all your affection out and getting none in return, and having next to nothing to look forward to.

Thats been my life for the past 4 days. I almost killed myself yesterday but didn't. I now unfortunately know what tequila tastes like though. The only reason I never say my emotions to others is because no one understands how I feel and just cuts me off whenever I talk. Only one person let's me but they're always busy. I just want to be happy with them but I can't.

Oh, and congrats Spice-L. Congrats on being their world and practically stealing her from me when I tried to do my all for her and still try to.
