How problematic is this? Okay so my brother and i we never talk. But like never. We live in the same house and stuff but we literally never talk to eachother... and iâ€™m on the bus rn and turned out heâ€™s on the same bus but he literally went sitting at the other side of the bus... is that with yâ€™all siblings too or uhmmm
