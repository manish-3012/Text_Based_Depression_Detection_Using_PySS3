Some people are just horrible I was at school the other day, and this girl was getting catcalled by like five different guys, all big douchebags and when they walked away, she was crying, and I asked her what was up. Apparently one of them grabbed her ass, and she said she was used to things like that. Smh, some people are just actual pieces of human trash. I got one of the even bigger guys on our side, and tomorrow I'm gonna record it and hand it over to the principal, while he has a little word with them.
