Alexa ruined my surprise So I was originally wanting a rift s for Christmas after working for and building my first gaming computer but since the oculus quest 2 was announced i asked for that instead (even though Christmas is like two months from now) anyways lets get to the point, today all the quest 2â€™s should be at homes if you pre ordered them I woke up at around 5:30 this morning diddint go to school cause i dont feel good at around 8:30 my Alexa glows yellow with a new notification i ask â€œyo alexa whatâ€™s my notificationâ€ and it says â€œYour oculus virtual reality headset has arrivedâ€ Iâ€™m not planning on telling my grandpa or grandma That i know

For some more back story my grandpa set up all the alexas in our house to their amazon account and he knows you get notifications when stuff comes in the mail but i guess unbeknownst to him my grandma pre ordered the headset and had no clue about the notifications so now i know i have a quest 2 but i have to wait untill Christmas to even look at it (yes i am getting a party link cable to use it with my pc)

Yes even though im exited that i technically have it im still sad the surprise was ruined

Tldr; Asked for oculus quest 2 for Christmas grandma diddint know alexa dropped notifications about whats in mail oculus came today alexa tells me and Iâ€™ll never speak about this to my grandparents
