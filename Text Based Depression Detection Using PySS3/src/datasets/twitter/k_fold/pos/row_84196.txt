Iâ€™m overthinking everything about this person and itâ€™s driving me kinda crazy. So my ex follows me on here, so if you see this, hi. Iâ€™m (15F) bi and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been so stressed about lately since you were asking. But anyways, I dyed my hair yesterday and I posted something about it on Instagram. This girl from my school commented on it and she said how good it looked. And then we started just talking about different hair stuff like colors we want to dye our hair and styles we want to get. And every single one she said â€œthatâ€™d look so good on youâ€. And the other day, she posted a picture with three hearts as the caption. And the hearts were in the same colors as the bi colors, (pink, purple, blue). And earlier today she changed the caption  and itâ€™s just a blue heart, which I thought was weird. Like Iâ€™ve never seen someone change a caption like that. So yeah idk if she thinks Iâ€™m into her and doesnâ€™t want me to think sheâ€™s bi or something. Or if she just simply changed her caption. Or if sheâ€™s bi and wants to hide it. Idk. But Iâ€™m developing a small crush cause of course I fall for people fast and I donâ€™t like it. My friends are saying Iâ€™m overthinking it all and I probably am, but when it comes to love, I act like a fricken detective trying to figure out if someone has feelings. But my gut is sorta telling me this will lead somewhere. Idk what to do but does anyone have any sort of advice?
