What do I do? Ok so today at lunch a girl came up to me and asked my name. This girl is very attractive, and tbh Iâ€™ve kind of been stealing very long glances at her. This girl still hasnâ€™t added me on any social media, and I donâ€™t know what I should do. Should I wait until Monday? And even then what should I do? I am very awkward so I feel like Iâ€™m gonna mess something up. Also I donâ€™t have any classes with her. Any help is appreciated.
