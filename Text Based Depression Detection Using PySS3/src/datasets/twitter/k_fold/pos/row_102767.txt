I'm sorry I gotta hit you with this but Y'all ever play the Resistance trilogy? It was a series on the PS3 where an alien virus infected humanity in an alternate universe and you play as a guy who has natural immunity name Nathan Hale. In the 3rd game you play as another character named Joe and help beat back the infection. It was actually really fun couch co-op.
