i need some advice please help me male creatures hello there folks. i (f14) have been talking to this guy (m15) for around 4 or 5 months. i like him a lot, and he goes to my school, but since weâ€™re in lockdown, we dont get to see each other much.

i thought since there are a bunch of dudes like him on here that you could help me decipher this message:

â€œgod youâ€™re so prettyâ€ (after i sent him a picture of my face).

i dunno man. does he like me?

for context, im the super quiet girl and heâ€™s pretty popular and extroverted, but he doesnâ€™t date a lot.

ALSO man if youâ€™re on here just donâ€™t tell me bc this is so embarrassing lmao
