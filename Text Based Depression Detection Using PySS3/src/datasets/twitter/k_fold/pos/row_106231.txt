Parents and my sister I hate my parents. I have a 30 inch tv, in my room with is connected to my ps4 and my Nintendo switch.  It is my place where I can really calm down and just play with my friends, the minute they are online, I bought all of these things myself. And for some reason whenever my sisters boyfriend is over, I get kicked out of my own bedroom.  So they can play Mario kart.  She doesnâ€™t even ask  and when she asks me to move if I say no, she goes downstairs and whines like a bitch until my dad comes up and tells me to get off. If I say no to him, the power is cut from my room.  Itâ€™s everyweekend and Iâ€™m sick of it. You know whatâ€™s worse, after twenty minutes, they are making out on my lounge. Not even playing Mariokart. And Iâ€™m not allowed to even go in and play my game.
Iâ€™m 15 with autism, anxiety and depression, I need my bedroom more than her and her boyfriend.
