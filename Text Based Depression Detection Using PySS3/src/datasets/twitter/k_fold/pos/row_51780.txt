I swear to God I am so DONE with Madden So here's the story; After ragequitting a game in franchise mode a couple days ago near the end of the 2nd half cause the game was being ridiculous and I was down 31-3, I decided to resume the game today. I led a comeback to the point where I was down by 7 near the end of the 4th quarter. I was on 4th and 3, my tight end was wide open past the first down marker, so I threw the ball to him. He catches it, runs BACKWARDS to the point where he's a couple yards behind the first down marker and gets tackled. ON FOURTH DOWN. Cut to the other team running the rest of the clock out and me saying that I'll never play Madden again for about 100th time this year. So that's how my day's been going so far.
