Anybody ever just kind of chill with the roommates have a few laughs and start looking for a movie to watch not really paying attention to the cover art for the film and youâ€™re just looking for a cool film to chill and watch with your friends and you stumble across the boy in the striped Pajamas And you all donâ€™t really bother to read the summary considering itâ€™s listed with the Disney movies on the streaming service on the TV so everyone just assumes itâ€™s a Disney film that you all forgot about as a kid or a new one so youâ€™re like OK cool weâ€™re bored eat some special brownies and we can chill and watch Disney movies and someone turned on the boy in the striped pajamas and itâ€™s not a Disney movie or if it is itâ€™s a very different kind of Disney movie about Nazis and Auschwitz and the kid dying and itâ€™s very depressing so depressing that not even Aladdin can raise your collective group spirits.

And everyoneâ€™s just very sad for a while because that movie made us all cry
