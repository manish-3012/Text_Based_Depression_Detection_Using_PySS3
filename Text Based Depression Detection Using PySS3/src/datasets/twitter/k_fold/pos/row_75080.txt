I'm sick of wearing this mask. I'm sick of pretending to be someone I'm not. But no one would actually love who I really am, would they? 

Sometimes I think it would just be easier to cut ties with everyone I know, because I'm terrified of seeing the disappointed in their eyes when they find out that I'm not who they've always known me as.
