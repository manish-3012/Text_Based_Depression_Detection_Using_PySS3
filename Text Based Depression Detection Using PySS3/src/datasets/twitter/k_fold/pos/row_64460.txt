Have any of you read Unordinary on Webtoon? If so, I would like to request that you sign the petition that this article links to to try and get Unordinary made into an anime! It would also be helpful if you would repost this and/or share the link! I love unordinary and I really hope it can get enough buzz to become an anime!
