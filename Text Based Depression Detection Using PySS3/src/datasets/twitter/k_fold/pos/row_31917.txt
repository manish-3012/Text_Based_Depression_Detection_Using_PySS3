Any tip how to talk to crush classmate? We have never talked to each other, we go to the same class since few years, she drop some signs of interest, but I'm not sure if it's signs or my imagination. My main concerns is that our first conversation will be uber-awkward and that after rejection, we will still in the same class and this will be awkward too.

I even have no idea how to talk to her, so please dont drop tip "just talk to her". Tbh I'm scared of talking to her as fuck.
