I predict your future ðŸ”®ðŸ§â€â™€ï¸ I see you, with your partner, peacefully swinging together in a beautiful park, talking about cats, and then you get off of the swings and sit somewhere nice. You put your head on your partners lap, and they play with your hair, while you express very deep emotions to them. You start to tear up, and try to hide the tears by wiping them away with your partners pants, but they then sense that you are crying, hug your head, and kiss your forehead, telling you that everything is gonna be alright. You then both smile, and start feeding the ducks. After that they invite you to dinner at a fancy duck restaurant, and hold your hands. You had a great dinner with them. After that you go to their place, and cuddle in bed while you watch SpongeBob. You are holding hands, and are very happy together. You keep switching between who spoons the other. You then fall asleep, and they slowly try to cover you, and then they kiss you on your forehead again, and quietly tell you "I love you". You were only acting to be asleep, so you couldn't handle the warmness of this moment, so you happy cry, get up and hug them so tight, telling them that you love them so so so much and will never ever leave them. They will then happy cry with you, telling you that they will always love and support you, no matter what.
