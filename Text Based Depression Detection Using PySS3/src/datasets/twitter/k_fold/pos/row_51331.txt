It is crazy how expensive old Pokemon games are. A USED Pokemon SoulSilver cartridge literally costs $120 now. As games get older, they generally get cheaper. Yet, Pokemon is the opposite. Pokemon SoulSilver is like $120 now even though it is a 10 year old game. Pokemon Black and White is like $100 now. And these are prices for used games. It is crazy we got to the point that old video games are skyrocketing in price because of low supply.
