I had a horrible dream last night 
I had a dream I was trying to sleep, but then suddenly there was a womans corpse in my bed. I got her out and put her in a box for some reason. The next morning my whole family was laughing at me and acting as though I had slept with the dead body and I was mortified. I cannot explain how fucking scared I felt. They were laughing at me, and acting like I had sex with the body, when I *knew* I didnâ€™t. You can imagine how horrifying that situation would be. I went to my room, then saw how many people were sending me mean messages. It was fucking horrifying. I mean there had to be dozens of people messaging me, just telling me how disgusting I am for sleeping with a corpse, when I didnâ€™t fucking do that. For some reason, some of the messages just said â€œcope.â€ And that was it. Eventually I started acknowledging it was a dream, and that I would wake up. But the dream went on and I didnâ€™t fucking wake up. I kept thinking â€œthis is a dream, right?â€ But somehow it didnâ€™t change anything about the dream, so I just ended up believing the dream. After all of it, I went to my mom and told her I think I should see a therapist. Immediately after that, she lead me to some middleaged woman. She was just talking to me, but her face kept changing to look like a dead body and I would scream everytime it happened. I hated that dream
