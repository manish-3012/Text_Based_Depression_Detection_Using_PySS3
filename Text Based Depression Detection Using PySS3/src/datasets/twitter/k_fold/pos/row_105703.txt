Watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix like, RIGHT NOW!! I just watched it, and like CHILLS man! Chills all over my body. Like seriously, we teenagers need to understand how social media shapes people's opinion and mental health.

We all know how much it hurts if out photo on Instagram get, like idk, 32 likes and then just stops getting further likes. I know, becoz I would re-evaluate my life choices if something I post doesn't ATLEAST reach 100 likes (rookie nos., ikðŸ˜’)

Guys and girls, I know we hate mAtHs (Ughh) and anything related to numbers, but this needs to be said -

Suicide rates in pre-teen girls has risen by approx.140% since the advent of Social Media. 1-freaking-40% à² _à² 

To make it simple, imagine I give you 100$, and it just, as u know, transforms into 240$. FUCK ME! I would kill for such a thing to happen IRL, but sadly (forgive the segue), this is happening to the suicide rate of pre-teen girls O_o.

Also (people from the USA would know this) people believing the COVID virus is fake, or is a government conspiracy. Flat Earthers (another Ughh Â¯\_à² _à² _/Â¯). Why do y'all think people of following such stuff. SOCIAL-MEDIA.

Now I am not hating or ranting against social media or something. All I wanna say is, WE are the future of this world, WE should be aware of what can shape our opinions without us even realizing it.

I did my part. Watch the movie guys!
