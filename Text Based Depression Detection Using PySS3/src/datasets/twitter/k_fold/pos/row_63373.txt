The life I donâ€™t know how to say this, im christian, I believe in God, but I always think that what is the meaning of all of this, I just need to be a good person, if God doesnâ€™t exist, that means, thatâ€™s everything I did in my life doesnâ€™t matter, im just disposable, I understand atheists i always doubt against the existence of God, maybe i do a lot of good things in my life and it doesnâ€™t matter, maybe i did something wrong and going to hell, maybe that doesnâ€™t exist and when i die, everything just finish, im really scared, im scared to not be a good person, if heaven exists i want to go there, doing good things, but if not, everything I just did doesnâ€™t matter, everything im going to do doesnâ€™t matter, nothing matter, i try to study a lot, try to be someone, I want to be happy, but in my head is always that thing of, if nothing matters, i just die, what is the purpose of all of this, im really scared, I donâ€™t know what to do, I want to be someone important, but at the same time I just want to not affect peopleâ€™s life, I donâ€™t know if being atheist is better because you don think of what if the purpose of all of this, i think im a bad person, but the people around me says that no, im a great person, but I donâ€™t know what to believe, I donâ€™t know if I want to have a happy life cuz after i die there is nothing, or if I want just to be a good person and donâ€™t enjoy some things to have a place in heaven, I donâ€™t know, like I said a lot of tines before, Im scared
