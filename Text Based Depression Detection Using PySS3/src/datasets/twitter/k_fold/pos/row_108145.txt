Ya boy ainâ€™t had a suicidal thought in a few weeks! I feel weird talking to irl people about my current mental state so Iâ€™m putting this here

I think itâ€™s been a few weeks. I have an awful concept of time so it could be a decade, idk. But point is Iâ€™m doing better on that front. Iâ€™m still having panic attacks though so I think Iâ€™ll tell the doctor next time I see him. So mentally Iâ€™m getting better. Iâ€™m even starting to get better physically. Iâ€™ve been going ham with exercise and Iâ€™m losing weight. Iâ€™ve also developed a clothing style I like. Iâ€™ve been socially very distant from my friends and family to work on myself but I am starting to bond with someone over music. Pretty cool. Irl school started which is going better than I thought it would. Iâ€™m not staying up til 7 every night anymore. And Iâ€™ve just been jerking off and writing songs. Life is suddenly starting to become ok.
