What do you do when every time you go out in public your mom changes completely Big rant about my mom.  

Recently my mom has done a 180. She wants me to tell her everything, joke around with her, have fun with her. Around 5 months ago I started eating mostly vegetarian, and starting last month she just stopped making food for me. (I also havenâ€™t been able to taste for 3 months. Still hasnâ€™t taken me to the doctor) Which is fine, I can make my own food. Thatâ€™s not my main complaint. For a mom that wants me to tell her everything and joke with her, she canâ€™t take a punch. When I make a joke about myself or another person, she spins it off of herself so I look like a bad guy. Recently, we have had talks after her friend (thatâ€™s repeatedly made her cry on several occasions) leaves the house. She tells me that everything I have is because of her, (including my friends, she says they wouldnâ€™t be here if not for me, and that they really donâ€™t like being around me)that if I donâ€™t love her I can do (list everything you could ever imagine list here) and go live with my dad. (Speaking of which they are married but my mom refuses to live with him and will not let us go to where he works in another state on a regular basis.) She tends to make fun of me whenever her friends or mind are over and I canâ€™t say anything to her, or give her advice because sheâ€™s *apparently* always right. Iâ€™m not the only one that sees this though, my sister and dad both are having a rough relationship with her. It just seems like she switches rapidly from having fun with us to trying to be some extremely strict parent that hates her kids. She is really struggling right now. Sheâ€™s gained like 60 pounds in weight within the last couple of years and keeps doing these â€œ21 day challengesâ€ and spending a ton of money on things that never work(quits after a couple of days). Weâ€™ve tried to get her to go to marriage counseling but they donâ€™t tel her what she wants to hear so she stops. I try to get her to workout but she refuses. 

Not really sure what I wanted from this but I figured maybe saying something here would help me vent and make me feel better.
