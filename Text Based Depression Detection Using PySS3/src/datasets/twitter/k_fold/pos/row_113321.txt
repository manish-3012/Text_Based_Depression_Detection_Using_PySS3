I think I fucked up It all started with a line deal with the class. One was way to the other side and the teacher said to get over here, I said yeah get over here as a joke. Before you say something about that's literally everyone does it. The girl responded back with shut up that's why your always in trouble. 1 that was just today I got in trouble for cussing, I don't stay in trouble all the time and 2 who is she to be talking cause shes the one who is a trouble maker. I responded by saying you shouldn't be talking you get in trouble all the time. She then pissed me off by making fun of my haircut, I mean she wasent even playing. I then I knew  the exact way to make fun of her, I made fun of her braces. She was so pissed that she went mad and told the teacher to get haircut dude. I got her back with the braces thing again. Idk if it was me or her, but she's probably gonna tell her freinds and her sister, which I helped, and act like I'm a asshole. 

I'll admit, I did call her terms like a thot and such, but I didn't know it was offensive to a girl and got it down, here she just made me mad. 

I don't know if I done anything wrong or not.
