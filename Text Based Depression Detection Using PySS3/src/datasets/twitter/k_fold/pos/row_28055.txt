Fellow teenagers with health problems I have a question. So as the title says I have a question for teenagers with health problem and may have needed something like a catheter in the chest or something similar. Did you guys try to hide it or would you openly talk about it? I was very open about my issues and actually enjoyed talking to people about it because 1 they cared enough to ask and 2 because it felt like I was teaching them something new.
