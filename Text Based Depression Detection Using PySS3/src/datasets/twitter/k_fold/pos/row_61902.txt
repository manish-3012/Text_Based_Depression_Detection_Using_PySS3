Do you want a relationship? I feel like so many of my friends want a boyfriend/ girlfriend just for the title, they don't have anyone in mind yet they really want a relationship without ever being in one and even knowing if it's something they would enjoy. Idk I just feel having a bf/gf isn't an accomplishment or a goal, it's positive for sure of it's someone you care about but I feel like they've lost the meaning and are a bit obsessive.
