I want to be a teacher and I need your opinion I want to become high-school physics and math teacher. Now I have very little experience with teaching teenagers so I figured it'd be cool to hear from you! So if you could give me your opinion on these questions:

What makes a good and bad science class?

What thing teachers do is cool/interesting?

What thing teachers do bores you so hard you rather refresh reddit six times a minute?

Do you have any relevant experience with an asshole teacher (or a cool teacher for that matter)?

Thanks for helping me make the next generation actually enjoy school a bit!
