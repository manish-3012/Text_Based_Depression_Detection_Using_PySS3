Gotta love having friends... Just redownloded insta and snap after spontaneously deleting it 6 months ago just to find no new messages or requests of any kind. These school holidays suck, I haven't seen anybody from school in 3 weeks and it feels like nobody cares anyway. One year left of school (next year) and everyone I know won't remember me. Sob story I know but who else do I have to talk to?
