Japan gave us the word tsunami and now we donâ€™t have to say title wave They also have given us really good music and anime but I think thatâ€™s there largest contribution

Theyâ€™ve also given us other words like tsundere, yandere, and karaoke, the Japanese language might not contribute many words but it definitely contributes a lot of good words, [there arenâ€™t that may](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Japanese_origin) but thereâ€™s a lot of descriptive words that we otherwise would have had to make a compound word for, or like tsundere where we just wouldnâ€™t have it otherwise, or tsunami, I must reiterate, if we didnâ€™t have the word tsunami we would be calling those title waves 

Also J-pop is good, and anime, and dark souls but tsunami is definitely there most important contribution
