I'm kind of freaking out here. Ok, so one of my Discord pals who lives in the U.S (I'm Canadian) has been silent for two weeks now, and I'm getting exceedingly worried. He hasn't said a word, and it's like he's just dropped off the face of the Earth. He's had a nasty history of depressive episodes and never gets enough sleep (I'm starting to wonder if he has insomnia) and has a terrible home life, and we're one of the only things keeping him anchored, I've had to pull him back from the brink of mental disaster at least half a dozen times at this point and convince him that we're always here for him. But he isn't speaking now, and I'm worried about what that could mean. I'd rather not think about what could have happened to him. I'm just trying not to lose it right now. We've only been friends for about four months but he's such a great guy and I don't want to lose my pal.
