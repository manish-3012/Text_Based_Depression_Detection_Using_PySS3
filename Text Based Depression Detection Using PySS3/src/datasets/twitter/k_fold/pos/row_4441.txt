Idk who needs to hear this, but You are loved. You mean something to someone. It might not feel like it at times but you do. I know how fucking hard life can be but you can make it though this. And it might be hard to believe sometimes, but somewhere out there, someoneâ€™s life would be worse if you didnâ€™t exist. You make the world a better place. It might seem like thereâ€™s no end to the darkness or absolutely no hope, but it will get better. No matter who you are, or whats going on in your life, you can get though this. I know you can. I believe in you. You are stronger than you give yourself credit for, just for making it this far. Iâ€™m so proud of you. So fucking proud. 

Love,
