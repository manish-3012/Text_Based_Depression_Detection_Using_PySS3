I feel bad for my friend We just had a conversation where he told me once there was a teacher in his primary(elementary)school that'll punish any students who misbehave by pinching their nipples. This punishment only applies to boys not girls, they get lighter punishment(standing for the entire period,etc.)

It's so weird that my friend just told me this casually like it's a normal thing, so fucking weird despite he once almost got his nipples torn off for something minor. There are parents who tried to file a complaint against the teacher, but they never did. I guess nobody ever did because that teacher still teaches in that school to this very day. And my brother went to the same school.

I don't know about the principle, the situation is just fucking awful. Some said that the teacher doesn't use that discipline method anymore because word got out, very few parents tried to file a complaint.

I just need to get this out off my chest. Excuse the grammar, english isn't my first language
