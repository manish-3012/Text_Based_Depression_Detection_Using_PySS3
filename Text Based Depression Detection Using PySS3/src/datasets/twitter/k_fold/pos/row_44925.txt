So, uhm I haven't gotten any wet dreams yet I am a 14 year old boy and puberty has been going fine so far, I have hair growth and "other"growthðŸ˜ and I can produce manly juices just fine. But I was having a little convo with my friend recently and he told me that he had this I cident one time where the whole bed was covered with wetness because of a wet dream and that he found it really embarrassing. Then I remembered that I haven't had incident like that and I haven't had any wet dreams either. Of mabey I never remember them.

Call someone please tell me what's going on, I am. Kind of getting worried.
