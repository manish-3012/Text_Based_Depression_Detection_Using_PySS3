If this gets 1000 weird one word comments I will talk to someone at college. When I mean "weird one word comments" I mean just comment one random word (for instance "egg" or "sprint" they can even be made up words too like "basaloons") . I will count the comment if it is not repeated. And if its a made up word please define it as well as it would be interesting to here weird and wonderful new words and definitions.

I also made it a high number because I really don't want to talk to someone but at the same time I really do to reduce my annoying introvertedness.

I may even use the words to start a conversation!

Thanks!
