Transhumanism is the future and I need it. To become one with the machine would only improve our lives. We could make weak people strong. We could give amputees working limbs. Not to mention artificial organs (Who wouldn't want a mechanical heart, Better than being dead) I hope Neuralink goes well. I just feel so incomplete 

please discuss how you feel about this
