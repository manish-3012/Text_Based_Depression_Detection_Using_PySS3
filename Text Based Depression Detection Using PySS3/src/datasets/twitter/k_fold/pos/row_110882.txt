I found out something extremely disturbing about one of my classmates. Please help me. I posted this on r/helpme but thought maybe advice from other teenagers could help out. 


Warning: Iâ€™m pretty sure this can be considered extremely triggering for some people. If anything relating to CP is uncomfortable for you, please, donâ€™t read about this.



To give some context; Iâ€™m 15 turning 16, and a female in Australia. In my history class, we were put into a boy-girl seating plan and I seat next to a very quiet and socially awkward guy. He constantly looks stressed out and iâ€™m friends with most of his friends. Iâ€™m really concerned about him. Heâ€™s abused by his parents and has guns in his house. It looks like heâ€™s on the verge of offing himself.

But today I learned something extremely disgusting about him. Appearently, he pulled an even worse callmecarson and admitted to having LP on his phone. Iâ€™m really fucking concerned. Appearently he also has CP. he showed his friends only the word anime shit tho. 

I really donâ€™t know what to do. On my hand, I wanna make sure heâ€™s okay and getâ€™s the help he REALLY needs, but on the other, I feel like calling the police on him before the fucked up pictures he has on his phone isnâ€™t enough for him. I actually donâ€™t what to do. Heâ€™s in my dance group for Pe and when he stood next to me I felt like throwing up. I can barely even look at the creep. As a someone that was taken advantage off by an older classmate, i feel terrified of him. I have no idea what to do. My anger issues have been getting worse and I think Iâ€™m becoming way more violent and aggressive then I used to be. I used to have a lowkey crush on this sicko. I wish i never got told about this. I wanna punch, cry, and give this rat a hug all at the same time. Please. Someone see this.
