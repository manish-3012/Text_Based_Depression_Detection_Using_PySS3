Using this sub as a diary day 5 Today wasn't so special 'natural sadness" and then boom talking to my father i just realized that my hate for them all is justified and I don't have to adapt to them it has to be otherwise I feel really motivated to left all this shit behind and seek for my own hapiness and stability. Also went to my grandma and mothers for some shit my grandma treated me like shit andi really loved it just one mont and I feel free from their abuse but I'm  just half in the run.Then thought that i need to seek for actual friends and maybe a girl 

Rating my day 7/10 that optimistic burst feels really amazing and haven't any important suicidal thoughts but let's see tomorrow
