Thoughts in my head Why do I still catch feel for someone when I know damn well no one will like me back?

Why doesn't anything make scence?

Why can't I think straight?

Why do I hate me?

Why do people hate me?

What do my parents love my brother more than me?

Do my parents love me?

Why don't I remember my dreams?

Why do people keep using me?

Why does emotional pain hurt more than physical?

What happens when we die?

Does anything happen when we die?

Is there a point in life?

Why am I unsure of everything?

Why am I even making this post?

Why is anything?

When do I get to be happy?
