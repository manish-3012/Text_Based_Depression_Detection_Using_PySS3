Finally...I confessed! Note: I don't know the result, I only hope we remain friends.

About 11 months ago, I started liking someone. It was my first friend I made at a new school. 
We hung out all the time.  She is my first crush.
She was always hanging out with her friends while I was the alone, quiet and gloomy person.

We sat next to each other in class and we talked good amount. We also share the same interests so that's a plus!

But things took a turn. She was stalking about how she wanted friends and not people who talked to her just because they like her. I had to say no, of course.

And I don't talk to her just because I like her, we're friends first and foremost. 

Then the quarentine happened.
We stopped talking, even online til recently. 
We caught up a bit. We started playing games together about 2 weeks ago.

All this time, I've been stressed out by these feelings I've kept quiet until now.

My very first confession! I might update this to give a result.
