Well fuck I went to a girls house yesterday for a party. And the way girls are willing to gossip and shit talk about people they barely know in real life is fucked. Or like when they talked about all the guys they rejected, or how they said they talk to guys just to kill boredom, or how theyâ€™ll say yes to a guy who asks them out as a joke. I hope that not all girls talk like this. But even worse I worry thatâ€™s how girls talk about me and my boys. :( it just made me sad.
