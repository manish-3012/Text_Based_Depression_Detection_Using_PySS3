I hate my thoughts, theyâ€™re suffocating sometimes Iâ€™m constantly thinking of the worst situations happening. If Iâ€™m at school, the thought of school shootings, being harassed in some way, or just disappointing my teachers is always present. Sometimes Iâ€™ll try to find a solution to the issue but other times thereâ€™s no way out so I let my self die. If Iâ€™m walking home from school, the fear that Iâ€™ll be taken, raped and/or being put in the sex slave ring invades my thoughts, I come up with the dumbest things to easy my mind. Even when Iâ€™m in the goddamn shower if I hear a loud noise from downstairs the idea that someone has broken into the house and is killing my family and then coming for me makes itself known. I canâ€™t sleep if my window shades are open cuz I feel like Iâ€™m being watched and I know exactly when that fear popped into my head too. Ya know the golden state killer? He stalked ppl and even sat in their houses without the ownerâ€™s knowledge, itâ€™s dumb but ever science I heard about that it terrifying to think that someone like that could be watching me or family and weâ€™d have no idea. 

Tldr: invasive thoughts suck, paranoia sucks too

Congratulations if u read through that, anyone else relate?
