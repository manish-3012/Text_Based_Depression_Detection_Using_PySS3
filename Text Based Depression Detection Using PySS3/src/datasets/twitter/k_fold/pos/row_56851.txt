Just wanna put this out there I'm 14, and I guess you could say I'm comfortable with talking about most things to anyone. I love talking to people, love texting them, and I'm not awkward at all when interacting with someone. 

The first thing people need to understand is that insulting people is not always a joke. Especially to those who know they aren't the best and fuck up all the time. 

I really do not understand why people will just say things to me, without thinking of how I'll feel. I do it to them, so why don't they do it for me?

People are just too comfortable around me when talking, so they think it's all good to tell me what I do wrong and how I'm not doing this and how I fucked up here and there. They don't realise it but it hurts so much to hear my friends tell me I'm shit without saying it. 

I fuck up all the time, and I know I can't take it back but they always seem to forget the little things I do for them. 

If you want to do it right, then ask them how they feel about the jokes that you make towards them and how they interact with you, it may not mean much for you, but it'll mean so much for the other person

Sorry if I make no sense, I just needed to get this out
