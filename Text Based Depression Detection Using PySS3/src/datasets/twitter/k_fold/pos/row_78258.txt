im starting to think i have PMDD PMDD is basically like extreme mood shifts leading up to your period (like PMS but worse). Anddddd Im starting to think I might have it because I get super depressed and irritable for 2-3 days before my period all the time. 

Like, I feel like relapsing into my self harm right now because im so fucking depressed and mad at the moment. And this happens all the time before my period. I get super irritable and really really depressed. All because of my stupid period lmao it fuckin sucks and i hate it

Any minor inconvenience becomes the biggest problem in my head and I just hate myself so much rn :///

Well anyways Im basically just writing this to rant and get my feelings out because Im so emotional rn and angry and upset, so idk why anyone would still be reading this lmao
