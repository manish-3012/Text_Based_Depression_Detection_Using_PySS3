I need your help trolling the neighbor I don't like! So I've been watching a yt video and when I turned it off I got a notification asking me if I want to continue on a smart tv, I'm 100% sure it's the one from my annoying neighbor. So how do I approach this? Can I play something without them knowing it was me? Do I need a throwaway yt acc? Thanks!
