Yo Iâ€™m scared because the water wonâ€™t stop coming out of the toilet. Like the fresh water. Itâ€™s not clogged tho Help what am I supposed to do

Update I took the lid of and disconnect the valve from the button and now it has risen and stopped but putting it back on would make too much noise itâ€™s 11pm
