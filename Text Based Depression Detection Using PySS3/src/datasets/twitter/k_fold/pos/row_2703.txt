Getting contacts tomorrow. Any tips? I've had glasses for about 4 years and 9 months. I get my contacts tomorrow. My glasses have caused my eyes to kind of sink backwards into my head, making my nose extra long. Normally it is not noticeable, but it is definitely going to be with contacts. Any tips on how to deal with it?
