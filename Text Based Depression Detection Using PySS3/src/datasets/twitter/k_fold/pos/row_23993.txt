How do you see yourself in the next five years? I'm 15, a teenager who is anxious of the future. I am always worried about growing up. I don't know what I'm going to do or what career path should I take. 

Whenever my mom asks me about what will I be when I turn "adult", I couldn't bring myself to answer. I feel pressured. 

Well, there is one thing I have in mind but I'm not sure I have the guts to do it. Like can I really do it? Is this the right path for me?

What about you? How do you see yourself years frim now? I'd like to hear your thoughts.
