Christmas Gift for College-bound Brother We're in secret sibling Santa, and I have my little brother (18M). He's super social and awesome and just a great kid. 

The only idea that we got from him for secret Santa this year is "idk something cool or random." Our parents are already getting him a portable speaker. 

Any ideas? Range is anywhere from $50-80 USD. I'm too old to know what's cool anymore....

Thanks in advance!
