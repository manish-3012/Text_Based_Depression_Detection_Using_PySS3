Appreciation post u/Blitz5665 has been my Reddit friend for about 10 months now, meeting through his post on this subreddit. Iâ€™ve helped him with his things, and heâ€™s helped me with mine. I appreciate him more than I can express. Heâ€™s been there for me even when I get too much to handle. Heâ€™s so weird and can be a dick sometimes /s but I fucking love him. Heâ€™s like the step brother I never had ;)

Also just making this post cause he goes through my profile so might as well give him something different to look at for today.
