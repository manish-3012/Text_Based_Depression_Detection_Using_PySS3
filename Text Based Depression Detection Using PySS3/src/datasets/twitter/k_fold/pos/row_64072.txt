Can hepatitis be caused from drinking once? On new yearâ€™s eve, I went and drank for the first time with friends, and accidentally had too much than I shouldâ€™ve had. I had about 7 shots of fireball and 2 mikes lemonades, and puked a LOT. probably was throwing up for 2 hours and a bit the next day as well. However since then, my liver area has really been hurting. Hard to take deep breaths, burp, and stretching the stomach area really hurts as well. My stomach has been growling a lot since if that has any information. A friend suggested that it couldâ€™ve developed some kind of hepatitis but I donâ€™t think that thatâ€™s possible from drinking once? Any help on what it could be or if thatâ€™s possible to happen would be incredibly helpful. Iâ€™m hesitant to bring it to ask my parents to go to the doctor (About to turn 17 but donâ€™t have my license yet) because Iâ€™m afraid to get in trouble. Let me know if you have any info please and thank you &lt;3
