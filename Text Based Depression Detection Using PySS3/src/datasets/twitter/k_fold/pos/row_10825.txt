So, second class of the year, the greatest thing just happened Someone just said that their sister makes them do tiktok dances with her or he can't play video games (they annoy them and effectively make it that they can't do anything) and someone said "can i get an F in the chat for them" and literally everyone dropped an F  


  


  


  
Teacher shut the chat off after that :(
