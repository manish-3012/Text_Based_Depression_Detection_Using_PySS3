Why should i even try to do anything Why should I.  No matter what I do Iâ€™ll hate myself for it after, so why shouldnâ€™t I just do what makes me happy in the moment.  I overeat, donâ€™t pay attention in school, and canâ€™t keep my mood normal. Whenever I try to fix those problems I just fail, and make myself feel worse about it. I tried exercising more, and all thatâ€™s done is make me feel bad about not exercising everyday.  I tried quitting masturbating, and all thatâ€™s done is making me guilty about masturbating.  Nothing I do works, so why should I even try to get better if itâ€™ll just make me feel worse about myself.
