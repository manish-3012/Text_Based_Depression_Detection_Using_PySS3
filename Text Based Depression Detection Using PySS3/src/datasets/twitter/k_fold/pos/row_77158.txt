I feel like when Iâ€™m texting thereâ€™s this weird pressure that I have to sound perfect Something really bothers me about the other person instantly being able to see what Iâ€™m saying but they have no idea what my actual tone of voice is. I have this really bad habit of taking days to reply to someone bc I just feel so guilty and itâ€™s so hard. I donâ€™t even know why I canâ€™t do it!! I feel like Iâ€™m better at conversations irl which is saying something bc I get really anxious. Too much thought goes in to texting. Also texting is really just quantity over quality. People expect you to text back instantly and nothing you say is really that important. I feel like Iâ€™ve pissed some people off bc I took my time to text back bc I was thinking of what to say. Why do I need a week to reply to someoneâ€™s text?? Maybe itâ€™s a lack of self confidence, I donâ€™t even know. Maybe I donâ€™t think my text would be good enough if I sent it right away. Maybe the more I take, the better my text would be. Thatâ€™s probably wrong though because a lot of times I say something with zero thought and it actually ends up being good
