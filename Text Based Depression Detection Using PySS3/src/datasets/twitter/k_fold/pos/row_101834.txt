If you donâ€™t speak Spanish fluently after completing you education in America the system has failed you America would be so much better if everyone spoke English and Spanish, it should start in kindergarten, and half of classes should be taught in Spanish, we shouldnâ€™t teach it as a foreign language, we should teach it the same way we teach English cuz it should be just as important, 13% of Americans speak Spanish at home, thatâ€™s over a Canada of people, itâ€™s stupid and wrong that we donâ€™t teach Spanish in school as a required subject from the beginning
