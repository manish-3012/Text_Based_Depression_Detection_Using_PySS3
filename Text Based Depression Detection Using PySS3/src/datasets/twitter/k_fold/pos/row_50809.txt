I got rejected big by my ex I got dumped for being shitty and I deserved it but remained on ok terms with my ex and we had a conversation months after where she implied she would get back with me later.

I texted her wondering if she wanted to get back because Iâ€™m moving in 6 months and she rejected me big and I didnâ€™t expect that

Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this Iâ€™m not owed anything and deserved all of this but Iâ€™m still sad.
