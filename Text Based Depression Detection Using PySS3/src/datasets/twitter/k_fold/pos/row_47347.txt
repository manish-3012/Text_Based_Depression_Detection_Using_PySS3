all this talk about international womens day reminded me of something funny that happened in 5th grade This was like halfway through 5th grade, there was a weekly lunchtime "girl's group" led by some of the teachers, and me and some of the other boys were "jealous" (we didnt actually care) but as a joke we proposed a "wednesday mensday" (say that aloud).

Also I remember after we had did our health unit where we learned about puberty, there was an optional lunch even where people could go in and ask questions to the teachers. they expected a good number of people to attend, but like 2 did.
