So when I was 11-13 years old I had a Guinea pig and his name was Billy I took of him so well but one day I came back from school and found him missing and I searched for him then I stop Then several years later my mom told me that she had buried billy in the backyard because he had died and was starting to stink up the house
Itâ€™s a good thing that billy didnâ€™t do the whole pet cemetery thing that would have been really crazy and creepy
