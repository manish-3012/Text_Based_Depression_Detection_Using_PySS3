I GOT MY REPORT GRADES AND I PASSED EVERY SINGLE CLASS!! I got one 6 (itâ€™s like an A or A-), four strong 5s (B+), one 5 (B), one weak 5 (B-), four strong 4s (C+ or if lucky B-) and one average 4 (C+ but pretty far from B-). I did soo much better than last year!

I wanted to share this because Iâ€™m so damn proud of myself!
