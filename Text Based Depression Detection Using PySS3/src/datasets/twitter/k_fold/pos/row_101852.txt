AITA for wanting my grandma to be put in a strait jacket and locked in a asylum. I was gonna post this in AITA but they don't allow posts that contain violence, so I will post it for yall.
So im on mobile don't blame me, for spelling mistakes. My grandma(67) has dementia and because of it has been unable to take care of herself.My auntie(37) and her children(13-19) moved into her house to take care of her. She likes to go outside and go places and we cant let her because she goes out, gets lost and passes out mid way.So they lock all the doors so she cant get out but when they do this she gets VERY violent and rude.Were a Jamaican family so she will say things like, Me no fuck woman, your fucking sodamine, suck out me blood claught and call my auntie a done out whore.Then her house burned down from my cousins hoverboard exploding, (the old faulty ones) because they charged it overnight and it blew up.So they moved into a hotel and put my grandma to live with me(15), my sister(22) and our parents(46 and 51). She has been here for over a year now and it has gotten way worse over the past few month's, Once again we cant let her out because she will try to go home and obviously the house is not fixed yet. Remember what I said about violent tendencies, well just recently she has tried to stab my mom because she was apparently locking her up.I wake up on my weekends early sometimes frightened out of my sleep because my mom and her are fighting because she got out and my mom is forcing her back in.When she cant get out because all the doors are locked and she wants to go home she starts screaming MURDER, HELP, and THEY GOT ME LOCKED UP IN HERE,  we live in a house a good distance away from our neighbor's, so thank god they cant hear anything.When she gets out it is hell to find her and we usually have to drive up and say will take her home and try instead drive her back to us.Sometimes she will LITERALLY jump out the car and my mom has to hold her back.My dad often had to help force her back in the house and whenever she is watching her, she always yells he is trying to posion her.Constant arguments happen around the house almost everyday and she has broken many things.She literally took my headphones at one point said it was her phone and put it in her panties(so they cant steal it) and PUT IT ON, thankfully my parents bought me a new pair of headphones .I've started having nightmares, so I tell my mom that we should put her in the asylum where she belongs.My mom says to calm myself, im ungrateful, without her I wouldn't be here and that the asylum is a horrible place and a last resort, she says ill understand when I become a parent. So were still living with her to this day and I don't know if I can go on much longer, I am in constant fear of the day she does not miss and actually hurts somebody
