I just donâ€™t get it So Iâ€™m sure if your from America youâ€™ve seen how some sports teams have had to change their name because they are derogatory. (I.e. redskins) My schoolâ€™s name is the Indians, and basically everyone who doesnâ€™t go to my school is hellbent on changing the mascot. Now Iâ€™m not opposed to it, but how about the people who go to my school decide whether it is good or bad. In addition, when I bring this up, I get called a bigot or a racist. Also, when I say that maybe instead of changing the mascot, we could get better computers (they do really suck) or tune up the school a bit (the school is 50 years old) I get called racist or a bigot. You know I just donâ€™t get it. Am I sounding racist? Idk you guys got any advice.
