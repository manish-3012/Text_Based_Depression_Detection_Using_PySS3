Does anyone else just randomly change what type of music you listen to? I feel like I go through a lot of music phases. At one point I like this certain genre of music, and then I get uninterested in that genre and stop listening to music all together, and then I find a new type of music I like and listen to that a lot, and so on and so on. I listen to a bunch of random crap anyways but it just feels very strange. Now Iâ€™m going to start talking about the different phases of music I went through which is unimportant so you can stop reading here and leave a reply if you want.

First, I think I listened to a bunch of YouTuber outros idk why I guess that doesnâ€™t count as a music genre but they were catchy. Then, I think my discord friends got me into nightcore. Itâ€™s actually pretty good but now it just sounds weird. Then I was into video game music. I was there for a while. Then I listened to meme songs like Megalovania and anime songs? Idk that was weird of me. Then I was a huge Pewdiepie fan and listened to his songs as well as the meme songs. Then I think the first real music I listened to was Hamilton after I watched it on Disney+. That actually didnâ€™t last very long I think listened to it mostly last summer. Now...Iâ€™m into kpop. Specifically just Blackpink. My sister liked them and I listened to a few of their songs a while ago, but now Iâ€™m like hard core loving them. I bought their album as a joke and now I love it. I actually hope this one lasts for a long time cause it would be really funny if I got some merch for Christmas. Anyways thank you for reading my weird music journey.
