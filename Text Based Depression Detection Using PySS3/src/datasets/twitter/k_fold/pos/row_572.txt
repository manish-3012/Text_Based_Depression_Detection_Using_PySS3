Last night was a big revelation So I used to really like this girl,letâ€™s call her Sophie, and last night I think I never stopped liking her (itâ€™s been like 3 years), I just stopped trying and it happened because I was at a party for my band section and she was there and we were talking just about anything and everything and I just kept getting lost in her eyes and just her being there.

But for the past few months Iâ€™ve been liking this other girl, weâ€™ll call her Em, and Iâ€™ve been slowly losing feelings and realizing that sheâ€™s not worth it. 

So old feelings are resurfacing again and I think Iâ€™m gonna ask Sophie out soon, because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right?

The main reason Iâ€™ve been losing feelings for Em is that sheâ€™s just been dry, leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours, been distant and just seems uninterested. As far as I know sheâ€™s okay, but I dunno if shes worth all the effort Iâ€™ve been giving. 

So yeah last night was a big thing for me and I think itâ€™s good
