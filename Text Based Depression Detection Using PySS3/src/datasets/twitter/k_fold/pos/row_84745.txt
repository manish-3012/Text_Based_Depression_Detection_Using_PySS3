How do girls work i was recently told by my girlfriend that her friend has "suddenly gotten really hot". i went and looked at her friends insta, and i was like yeah i guess she kinda cute, and my girlfriend went on to tell me about a bunch of "unspoken rules"

&amp;#x200B;

 

1. if she asks of she looks fat. dont look. just say noÂ 

2. if she asks if someone is prettier than her, dont look. just say noÂ 

3. she calls another female hot. dont look. tell her she has nothing on herÂ 

4. if out of nowhere she says like "please call me" if you can, pick upÂ 

5. gm, gn messages are a key to a girls heartÂ 

6. if your upset, or angry, or like feeling "needy" TELL HER
