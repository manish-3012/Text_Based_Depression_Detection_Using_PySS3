Long Distance relationship tips? So basically i met this girl few months ago, and we started talking a lot and she told me how she feels about me few weeks ago, so we've been in a long distance relationship for maybe a month and a half now, her parents know about me, but i haven't told me parents anything about her, i am just scared do you guys have any tips? Also she wants to fly to Germany to meet me soon, but few things are problems like where she's gonna stay (because my parents don't know) how long she's gonna stay and stuff liket hat i am really scared and i was never really in an actual relationship, if you guys have any tips or something about Long Distance relationships please help, i really love her and don't wanna lose her.
