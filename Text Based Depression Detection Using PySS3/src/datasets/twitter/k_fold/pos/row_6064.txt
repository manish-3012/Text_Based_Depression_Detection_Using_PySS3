Do any of you do this? Do you ever guys ever just read the dictionary? I'm not join or trying to flex, I'm serious. If I don't know a word, I don't Google it. I will get up, go to my room and look it up in the dictionary. And other times, I'll flip through it just for fun. I will read the dictionary as entertainment.
