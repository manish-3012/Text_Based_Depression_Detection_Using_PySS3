Does anyone else get paranoid when muting your mic on zoom? I donâ€™t trust muting my mic through zoom and I always have to rip my mic off my headset to feel at ease or else I will check every 5 minutes to see if I really muted myself (same goes for my camera, I feel like the teacher is staring straight into my soul).
