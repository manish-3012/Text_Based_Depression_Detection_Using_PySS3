So there's this rehab program And the people aren't allowed to have coffee because it's viewed as them trying to get high off of caffeine which is somewhat understandable but they're allowed to smoke tobacco you know an extremely addictive drug it just doesn't make sense to me but I guess that's why I'm not running a rehab program and they are.
