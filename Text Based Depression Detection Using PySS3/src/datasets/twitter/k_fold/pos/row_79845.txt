You guys gotta help me out here. So I've had a enormous crush on this one girl, so bad i start feeling sick near her (like stomach ache and stuff like that) but i dont know if im a man enough to confess to her. But how would i even do it? My social status isn't the highest since I'm really introverted and awkward, my looks aren't that high either. So got any tips on how to do this thing... I mean if I'll do it.
