Hoes mad Iâ€™m super frustrated at how I seriously long for a girlfriend but all the girls at my school are complete shite who think that making tiktoks where you pretend to push each other over while dancing is funny. Oh yeah, cannot forget the ones who force their skateboarding onto you and obsess over it and probably only do it for skinny tall boys
