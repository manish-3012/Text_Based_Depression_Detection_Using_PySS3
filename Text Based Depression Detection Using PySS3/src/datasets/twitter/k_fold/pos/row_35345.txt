I didn't know where to go with this, r/ocpeotry was the obvious place but it just didn't feel right and I can't explain why. Anyhow, a poem I wrote. Lmk if you enjoyed :)  

**-The Ice Queen\~ By Q-**

&amp;#x200B;

**If youâ€™re reading this, hey**

**You found my place**

**My secret**

**The little hole I crawl into after I turn out the lights**

&amp;#x200B;

**How did you get in?**

**Well, I guess it doesnâ€™t matter much now**

&amp;#x200B;

**Donâ€™t move anything, please**

**It may look like a mess but Iâ€™m used to it**

**Used to waking up to the clutter that I have created** 

**Used to stepping over and juggling the knives hidden under dirty shirts and old school reports**

&amp;#x200B;

**I asked you earlier but didnâ€™t wait for a response** 

**Sorry, Iâ€™m impatient like that**

**How did you get in?**

**Well, I guess the better question is why did you want in?**

**Did you not see the warning signs and the â€˜Do Not Enter?â€™**

**The walls and the guard tower?**

**Why would you break in, when everyone else wants out?**

**Why would you do that to yourself?**

&amp;#x200B;

**God, again, Iâ€™m sorry**

**Iâ€™m judging you but I havenâ€™t yet heard your story**

**Maybe you know what itâ€™s like and wanted to help**

**Or maybe in the way that paradoxically flaws Utilitarism you were just in the right place at the right time**

**Or-**

**Maybe you didnâ€™t break in**

**Maybe I let you in**

&amp;#x200B;

**I guess this is just a roundabout way of saying thank you**

**I was getting pretty lonely** 

**The furnace stopped working and the floors started creaking with ghosts** 

&amp;#x200B;

**I was cold.**

&amp;#x200B;

**You know that old story we were read as kids before the world caved in?**

**The one about the Ice Queen**

**Maybe itâ€™s just me, but that story was impactful in ways that for years I would never fully** 

**understand** 

**Oh, I changed the subject suddenly**

**I didnâ€™t mean to**

**Iâ€™m just not used to people letting me finish a coherent thought** 

**So-**

**I stopped forming them**

&amp;#x200B;

**But anyway,**

**The Queen cried a crystal shard that stumbled down through karma and irony and pierced her heart** 

&amp;#x200B;

**My furnace broke, Iâ€™m cold, my tears wonâ€™t freeze, right?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Well, I guess you wouldnâ€™t know** 

**Youâ€™re just a visitor** 

**The first one in years, yes**

**But still just a tourist with your momâ€™s old polaroid** 

**Waiting to throw me in a box of treasures that no pirate would ever search for**

&amp;#x200B;

**Youâ€™ll leave.**

**You have to.**

**The words will stop showing up and youâ€™ll be left with no closure to my story**

**You wonâ€™t know if the furnace kicks back on**

**You wonâ€™t know if the ghosts finally decide that torment isnâ€™t worth the everlasting purgatory** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Youâ€™ll have to live without closure** 

**Can you do that?**

**Well, you have to.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Or-**

**You could stay here in my home**

**But trust me,**

**You donâ€™t want to.**
