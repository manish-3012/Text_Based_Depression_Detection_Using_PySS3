Suck the police Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full erect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are: MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy motherfuckin' E"

"Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the mothersuckin' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothin' but the truth so help your black ass?"

"You Goddamn right!"

"Well, won't you tell everybody what the suck you gotta say?"

Suck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Suck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Suckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swole off bread and water
I don't know if they f4gs or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any mothersucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say

Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the Police

"Example of scene one"

"Pull your Goddamn ass over right now"

"Aww shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?"

"'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the suck up"

"Man, suck this shit"

"Aight, smart ass, I'm takin' your black ass to jail!"

"MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this sucked up incident?"

Suck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the mothersuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin, "Suck you, punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma Suck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as suck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any mothersucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The mothersuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as suck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a suck to say

Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the Police

"Yeah man, what you need?"

"Police, open now"

"Aww shit"

"We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em"

"What the suck did I do, man, what did I do?"

"Just shut the suck up
And get your mothersuckin' ass on the floor"

"But I didn't do shit"

"Man, just shut the suck up!"

"Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?"

I'm tired of the mothersuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shinin' the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waitin' to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size ain't shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb mothersucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin' off laughin', this is what I'll say

Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the police
Suck the Police

"The verdict
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chicken shit mothersucker"

"But wait, that's a lie!
That's a god damn lie!"

"Get him out of here!"

"I want justice!"

"Get him the suck out my face!"

"I want justice!"

"Out, right now!"

"Suck you, you black motherfuckers!"

Suck the police
Suck the police
