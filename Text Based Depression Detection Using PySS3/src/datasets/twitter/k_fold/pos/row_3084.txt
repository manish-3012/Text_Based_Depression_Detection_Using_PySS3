No, iâ€™m in a perfectly good mood! not mad about the fact that i have a cracked iphone 7 without a SIM card that i got for my 15th birthday and the fact that my 14 year old sister got a brand new phone with a sim card in it! no iâ€™m not mad at all :) and also the fact that my 17 year old sister still has a tablet and a laptop even tho sheâ€™s almost an adult. â€¢-â€¢ no iâ€™m not mad at all. ðŸ˜„
