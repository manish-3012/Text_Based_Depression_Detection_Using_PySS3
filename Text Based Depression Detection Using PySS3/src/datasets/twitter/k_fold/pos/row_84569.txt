I was at a place called circle music and some crazy guy was there. We were there to get my 4th string on my guitar fixed and I was showing my mom all the cool electric ones  they have and some guy was walking through the store saying hes seen God before. He walked up to me and said "I've seen God before. Ain't that cool?" He said that to everybody there including me and my mom. He then just walked out like nothing happened
