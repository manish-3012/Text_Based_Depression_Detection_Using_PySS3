I have 3 friends But they keep making plans to hang out without me in the GROUP CHAT when Iâ€™m the only one not invited. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because they donâ€™t like me or if itâ€™s because my mom canâ€™t drive me to hang out since she has epilepsy and got her license taken away. The ride shouldnâ€™t be a problem though because I live directly in the middle of both my friends houses and Iâ€™m not out of the way. They literally drive by my house to hang out. Plus, one of them only lives a 10 minute walk from my house so I could just walk. It sucks.
