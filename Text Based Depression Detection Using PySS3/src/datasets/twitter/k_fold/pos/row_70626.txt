My friend accidentally kicked a DEAD RAT at his teacher So yesterday my and my group of friends were playing a game of football and someone pointed out that there was a dead rat , so a group went over to it and out of nowhere someone kicked it and then another did , eventually a few started kicking it around and then a teacher came over and said what are you lads doing and then my friend got a good run up to the rat and kicked it and it accidentally hit her in the stomach. I don't know why i decided to put this here but i hope someone got a laugh out of it. ( No rats were harmed )
