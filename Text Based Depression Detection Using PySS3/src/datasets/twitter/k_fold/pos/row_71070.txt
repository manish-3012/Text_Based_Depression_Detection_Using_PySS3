Are there any car fans among you? If so what is your favorite/dream car and why? For me life without cars is basically impossible. I donâ€™t own a car yet cus Iâ€™m 16 but you bet the day I become 18 Iâ€™m going to get my drivers license. That brings me to the question: if any of you are car people, what car(s) are your favorite and why?

For me my favorite car has to be the Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 (Most people know of it thanks to Brianâ€™s Silver R34 from 2Fast 2Furious as well as his Blue R34 from Fast 4). The car I think just looks insane and the potential for upgrades on it is basically limitless. Also theyâ€™re pretty goddamn bulletproof as theyâ€™re 90s/00s Japanese made cars. *(Fun fact: these cars were never sold in the US and as of now they cannot be imported. Google the US 25 year import rule if you want to know why theyâ€™re illegal to import)*
