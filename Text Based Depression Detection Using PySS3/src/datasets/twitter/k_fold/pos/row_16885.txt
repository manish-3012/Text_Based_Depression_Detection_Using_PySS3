What's the point of even playing anymore I'm gonna start this out on a sour note
I HATE minecraft on console(its on bedrock edition,which is the worst version of minecraft imo) BUT you can change it back to pre 1.16 minecraft and play before it was updated by pressing "editions",now,my playstation hasn't been working with my wifi for some reason so I was surprised when I could use the texture pack I bought on edition,I had my favorite world called "achievement land" where I was going to get tons of achievements done,I had already gotten a good amount on this world,like all 16 colors of wool,scaffolding that reaches beuild limit,and some others,I decided I wanted to take a swing at fighting the enderdragon,i found the base but it was cucked and walls separated entire rooms,making it take an hour to find the portal room,when I found it I was going to go back to base to get more blaze rods,and died to fall damage,no big deal,just take the CD out before auto saving and no big deal,but my game autosave AS I was falling,after multiple failed attempts,I decided to try and delete my last saves(obviously dont know how to do that) and when I came back every block was filled back in that I mined,this got me worried,what about my base,did that reset to? Yep,it did,all my work gone. And that's why I'm not gonna play minecraft for quite some time
