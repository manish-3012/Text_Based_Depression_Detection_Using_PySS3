I went to sportsclips today and made an absolute fool of myself. I was standing in line behind one guy and I overheard her ask for a number and then guy didnâ€™t reply. She asked again and I looked over and realized she was talking to me. Gave my number and then she asked â€œwho would you like to cut your hairâ€. Not understanding I said â€œmaâ€™am?â€ She repeated herself. Thinking she meant who was the haircut for, I said â€œuhh me?â€ I then proceeded to shit myself and cry. (Yes I really did) but she then had to tell me that she meant whether or not I had a stylist that I preferred. Anyway thanks brain, youâ€™re doing great.
