I just want a man That will hug me while Iâ€™m curled up on his lap and let me tell him my problems and just let me cry. 

I wish I had a man to put his head on my chest as I run my fingers through his hair and listen to his worries.

I wish I could support the heck out of a man I love and care for.

I canâ€™t seem to find that man anywhere.
