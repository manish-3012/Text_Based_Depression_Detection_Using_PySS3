I never had problems with being alone I never complained about being single or a virgin or anything like that (unless it was a joke about me being a virgin dweeb)till i opened r/teenagers and saw how everyone was sad and complaining about being alone then i started going with the flow. 

But I know i never cared about loving anyone or being loved  and i would like to remind everyone that it doesn't matter.

Realistically I don't think I will ever love anyone or be loved by anyone  but as i said it doesn't matter.

Don't just be sad because you're alone or jealous because they aren't alone  

Society raised you to want it but do you actually want it?  My answer is no because it would probably suck

That's it
