I Played DnD and was social and stuff I don't know how I pulled it off but I played DnD with some recently made friends. It was really nice to have like 6 hours of being social. 

I played a human-fighter because I wanted to be basic. Alongside me we had a dragonborne, halfling, and two other humans.

Me and the halfling went to the attic of the mansion we were breaking into. At first we opened a normal chest, that contained gold and spiders. After the tango with the Spiders he opened another chest which turned out to be a mimic. He got ate.

That's all.
