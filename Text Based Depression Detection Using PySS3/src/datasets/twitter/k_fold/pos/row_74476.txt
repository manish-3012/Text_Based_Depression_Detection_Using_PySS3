Hi, so, how did yâ€™all learn to let go of your insecurities enough to be in relationships? I see a lot of yâ€™all in here in relationships &amp; I figured you may have gone through a similar thing to me so Iâ€™m asking :P. Over the past year Iâ€™ve kinda gone under a lot of change appearance wise, and Iâ€™m still trying to unlearn the self hatred Iâ€™ve had all of teenagerhood. I met this guy whoâ€™s absolutely brilliant &amp; I think weâ€™d be really great together, but I donâ€™t want to put him through a relationship where Iâ€™m clearly not ready because I still donâ€™t love myself. That whole thing about how you canâ€™t love someone else if you donâ€™t love yourself. Idk how this turned into a paragraph lmao sorry thank u for reading.
