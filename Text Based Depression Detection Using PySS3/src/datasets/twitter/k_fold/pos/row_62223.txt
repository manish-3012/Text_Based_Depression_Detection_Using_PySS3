I am very confused So I have been friends with this girl since 3rd grade and I've liked her on and off. I just found out that she's liked me before. I found this out when we were up all night talking over FaceTime. We talked about some intimate stuff, and even about doing uh... activities together (neither of us have done anything like that before) it was an amazing night just talking but now I can't get her out of my head. It's been 3 days and we talked again yesterday and it was amazing once more but I still can't stop thinking about her. I don't know how to go about this. The last time I was like this was with my first girlfriend and we went out for a long time then she became a lesbian. I think now I'm just worried that's going to happen again. I really want to pursue this but I don't know how. I could really use some advice.
