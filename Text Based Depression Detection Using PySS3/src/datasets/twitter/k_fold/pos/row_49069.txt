My mental health is at the worst itâ€™s been in my entire 13 years on this planet (not to mention my physical health either) Iâ€™m having severe OCD and anxiety, like I cannot stop thinking about things, whenever Iâ€™m about my daily life, those â€œthingsâ€ pop up into my head, itâ€™s severely fucking up my mood. I just feel like Iâ€™m beyond help. I need some advice right now, the medication I am on doesnâ€™t help. Donâ€™t bother linking any hotlines because Iâ€™m not contemplating anything serious and I have a therapist .


It all started when I went to the hospital because I have a severe chronic illness (non threatening)
That barely allows my esophagus to process food. While at my stay, I developed some OCD issues, and since then, itâ€™s spiraled out of control. But not once has it ever been this bad.


I also canâ€™t sleep because I got into some argument with my mom, so that helps, I guess.

TLDR; Mental health spiral out of control, desperate teen goes on rant
