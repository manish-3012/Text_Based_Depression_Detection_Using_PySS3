Well boys.... I got turned down(find my last post for context) So basically I was talking to this girl for about a week now and I was starting to catch feelings for her and today I pretty much asked her out and I got turned down. Well thereâ€™s always more fish in the sea you know what Iâ€™m saying fellas.
