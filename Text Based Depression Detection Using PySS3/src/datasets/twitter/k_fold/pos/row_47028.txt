Signals through Snapchat? So there's this girl I started talking to over snap. We work together and I added her on snap the other day and we've been talking a lot. Now I'm not good at this dating thing or interpreting signals unless they are obvious. But pretty much every snap she sends me, it's her with her eyes closed making a kissy face or a silly face and always adds in something like "hahaha" when responding to my snaps. Does this mean anything?
