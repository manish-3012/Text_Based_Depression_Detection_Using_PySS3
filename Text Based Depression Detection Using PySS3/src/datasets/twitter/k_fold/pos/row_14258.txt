I feel weirdly proud of myself So for a while now Iâ€™ve kinda struggled with anxiety stuff. Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed properly but its pretty obvious that I have some level of anxiety.

This can often make social interactions tough. But today was a bit different.

I was trying to get to my seat when someone way blocking the isle. What I usually do is just wait till they move or notice me. But today I just asked if I could quickly get by. They moved and I said thanks. It went well

Iâ€™m sorry if this sounds stupid, Iâ€™m just proud that I was able to talk and stuff. Sorry
