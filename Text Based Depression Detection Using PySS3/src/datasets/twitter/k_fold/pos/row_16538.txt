Yooo, guys. Im loved!! I got a girlfriend since Thursday.
I absolutely love her, she approached me tho.
She rejected me a year ago, my heart was kinda broken.
Now we are a couple, and I cant wait to meet her irl asap.
Cause of half group system, we haven't meet since Thursday.
Im so goddamn happy, cause I never really stopped loving her
Guys, if I can love and be loved, u can do it, too!
Believe!
