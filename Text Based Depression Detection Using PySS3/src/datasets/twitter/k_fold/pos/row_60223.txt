Posting everyday until someone gets a crush on me Day 43 (Season 3) I know I know I know I know it's been 22 days and I'm really sorry but alot happened and I couldn't control it

We got project after project and work after work ans I didnt do 6 months worth of Engineering and graphic design and my mental health plummeted and its just been hard, so let me fill you in om what happened during the almost month I haven't posted

Everyday when I ussually posted, my phone got taken away

My mental health plummeted, and when I say plummeted I mean it was pretty terrible, luckily with help from Muffin I managed to get back to a... just not terrible place and no thanks to Venus (who caused me ALOT of problems)

It occurred to me that me and Venus aren't exactly friends, she's been through alot and was subconciously trying to control me (alot of people said that) and when it occured to me that this is true I became semi paranoid (cause this is the tbird time it's happened) and these past fee weeks she's done nothing but try and guilt trip me "it makes me sad you don't talk about your problems anymore" I only ever wanna talk to Muffin and u/confused_catfish cause they actually help instead of turning thr problem and making it about them
She was also pretty rude to me and never apologised, but apologised about everything else, and some other stuff, so one day I had enough and told her about how the stuff she's doing was affecting me badly and I wanted her to stop, and we don't talk as much anymore, (afew days after she got a gf so that's her excuse)

My self esteem dropped severly and I was afraid to talk to people, Muffin and catfish helped me through luckily and now I'm here posting and Im ready to talk to people! Go me!

I do still feel kinda lonely though, but we wont go into it

I've also started reading, I just finished "The fault in our stars" and it wasn't as good as people say it is, any book reccomendations?

I wont go into the other things that have happened, you're busy people

Good night/morning and remember! [Insert slogan here]

P.S to my friends reading this, I love you and good luck to those at school!
