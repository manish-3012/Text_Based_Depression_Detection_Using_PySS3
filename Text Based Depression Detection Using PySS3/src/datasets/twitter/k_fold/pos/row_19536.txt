Sometimes I think about this Last year when me and my friend that I like were sitting next to eachother and she wanted to draw on my hand. So I let her since we are good friends, a few minutes pass and a guy sitting near us asked if we were dating.

I was super embarrassed so I didn't say anything but my friend pretty quickly said no.

I just think about that sometimes.
