A song dedicated to u know who 

U cant fade away 
The way i feel for u when every single day i make it through this game of life
Its always filled with pain and strife . Reality will cut u like a knife , it aint right 
But with u by my side we will win this fight in the battle of dark and light 
When we dance i feel alright by your side is where i will be 
Endless love wont fade u will see when i walk u walk me 
TOGETHER LET THE LIGHT SHINE
By your side is where i will be 
Endless love wont fade u will see when i walk u walk with me 
TOGETHER LET THE LIGHT SHINE
