My apologies so earlier today i heard that prince philip had passed away which is sad. I had made a meme about him with the saluting people and I'm sorry if that offended anyone. it did result me in a ban from the sub forever. Does anyone know how to try and get unbanned, I really did not mean to disrespect him and I'm sorry.
