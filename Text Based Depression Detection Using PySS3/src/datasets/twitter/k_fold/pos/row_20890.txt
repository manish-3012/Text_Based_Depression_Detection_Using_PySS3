Are people over 20 still in the sub? Well, when I was about 15-16 I discovered this sub, and browsed it everyday.

In this meantime, I started dating a wonderful girl, went to college and moved in together, broke up and now live by myself with Brita, my pup.

Iâ€™m 21 now, and still feel a connection to the sub, as I did years ago.

So, are there any people out there that still do this?

And by the way, if anyone needs some advice in life from some one slightly older, and prolly nothing wiser, Iâ€™m always up for a chat.

Thatâ€™s it guys :)
