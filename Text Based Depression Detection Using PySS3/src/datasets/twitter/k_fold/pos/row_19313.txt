I know thereâ€™s a lot going on right now and things are depressing, so it might make you happy to know a hamster I follow on Instagram had to get a surgery to remove an abscess and it was a complete success! His name is Vincent, he likes cucumbers, heâ€™s super cute and it sounds like the surgery went just fine and now heâ€™s on the road to recovery!
