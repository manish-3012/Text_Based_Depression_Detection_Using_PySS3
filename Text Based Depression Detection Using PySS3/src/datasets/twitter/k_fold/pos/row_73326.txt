Aight, I am seriously afraid Guys, please help me!

Like a week ago, I was out with my friends, and I got really drunk bec all my friends brought their gfs, so when they were kissing and stuff I was drinking. When we wanted to go home, three beautiful girls came in the bar we were in, and I felt so lonely, I went for one of them (I am telling you guys, I am the biggest virgon alive, and Im really bad with girls, I've never done something like that) she seemed cool and she did not reject me, she really liked that I was flirting with her. Time passed, and we got a little closer to each other, when one of the other girls wanted to talk to my "target" and I found that pretty weird. When they were not there, my friend said this to me with anger: are you fcking out of your mind, XY is her boyfriend if he knows this he will beat you up (XY is a guy in my school, he is one grade above me, and he is not a gentleman type) After this I immediately stopped. Later, when we were heading home, one of the girls said that I should look out and now Im scared af, can anyone give me advice on this shit?
