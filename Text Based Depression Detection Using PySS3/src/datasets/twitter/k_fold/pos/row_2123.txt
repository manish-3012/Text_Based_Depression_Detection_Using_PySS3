i think that my father hates me so it started when i was younger, as a kid i was kinda fat but i did many sports to lose weight, and everytime i came home and ate a snack he criticized me and said that i just eat shit and even prohibited snacks at home

When he calls us (me and the rest of the family) to eat he always gets mad at me when i come alone because i '' didn't '' call the others and that im selfish but when i come last he says that im always late and never want to eat with them and that i wait for them to go so i can eat shit after (which isn't true)

and now he removed my ps4 and said that i '' play too much '' and dont work enough for school even though it's the first time i study seriously for my classes, but he lets my brothers play without any problems

and when i asked (politely) why i couldn't play he threatened to destroy the console because i was 'insolent'
