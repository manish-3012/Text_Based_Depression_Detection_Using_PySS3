Seeing classmates in public Recently, I ran into a classmate of mine at a restaurant. I was leaving the restaurant when I heard my name yelled by my classmate, so I went over and we just said hi, whatâ€™re you doing here, and I went out as I was going to. Thinking back though, Iâ€™m a bit startled for some reason, cause she and I arenâ€™t strangers but we arenâ€™t necessarily close either. Would any of you other girls say hi to a guy classmate of yours in public, even if you arenâ€™t that close?
