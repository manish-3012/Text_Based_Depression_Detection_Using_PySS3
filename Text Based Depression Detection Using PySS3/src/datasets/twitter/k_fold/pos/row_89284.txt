So like two of my dogs just went and chased a stray dog Okay so here's the full story.

We have a garden in front (like where the entrance is) and there's a gate. And we also have a garden opposite that. So our house is in the middle of two gardens. And there are two parts at the side to go from one garden to the other.

So what happened was that my brother had gone out to collect something and he left the gate open. One of my dogs (he's 9 and he's the most ferocious) was tied so that he wouldn't go outside(because there are alot of stray dogs). 

So the other dog (he's 3 very energetic) was barking for a long time. I went outside to check if a dog had entered. I even started to say hush ( stray dogs always react when we say that) but no dog was there. 

So I just thought that my dog was barking cos the other one was tied up (he does that sometimes)

So a few minutes later my brother came back and he told me to leave the tied dog. So I did. And the moment I dropped the chain, both the dogs ran and went to the other garden and strated barking.

I heard a cry and everyone (my family) went to check who was barking. It turns out there was a stray dog that entered. 

Then we tried to stop the dogs but they wouldn't. The stray dog then started to run and my dogs followed. The my ran for like 5 minutes (even tho it's 5 minutes they ran ALOT) and then the older dog kinda gave up because he became tired.

The other one kept on chasing him and ran to the front garden and I ran after them too. I opened the gate and the stray dog went outside. 

Nothing happened to the older dog. But the other one had a few cuts so I had to give him a bath before I gave myself one.

And now he's sleeping next to me.

So yeah, that was one of the crazy moments I have to tell.

(And this happened today btw)


This is how my house is like if you'll cant understand.
