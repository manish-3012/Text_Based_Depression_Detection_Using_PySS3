Right as Iâ€™m about to walk out the door My dads just gonna yell at me for being such a terrible person. 

Why am I a terrible person? you might ask. Well itâ€™s because I have a hole in my pants and am wearing the same clothes as I wore yesterday. Oh and because I forgot to do some homework. Oh *and* because I brought his umbrella back and he thinks I didnâ€™t. 

I deserve to rot in hell for that, right?
