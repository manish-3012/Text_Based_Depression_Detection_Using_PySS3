Siblings suck This is a rant:

Does anyone have younger or older siblings that just piss you off for no fucking reason? Is it just me? My younger brother does anything he can to get me in trouble or piss me off for no reason at all. He blames me for breaking things that he does. Pushed me out of the way. Calls me out for everything. And literally screams at me for not socializing like he is my mother. Its kind of fucked up and I'm sorry for anyone who has siblings like this


Thanks to listening to my rant
