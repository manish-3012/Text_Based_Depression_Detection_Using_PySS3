Is it just me or does your family give really stupid punishments Because of Latin, I am forbidden to see my best friend til the end of the quarter, which usually is the highlight of my week. Yet I still have my phone and I can see all the other friends I want. I donâ€™t understand this at all.

Itâ€™s not even my fault that my Latin teacher failed to teach me, she has a reputation of failing students but apparently, Iâ€™m the one that can do better.
