I finally smiled again :) Am 14 and my dad have been battling cancer for a couple of years now, and everything is going downhill...
It's been really hard for me specially in this quarantine, i barely eat or shower or clean my room, but today, i smiled for the first time since i don't even know when! Just wanted to let you guys know since how much this sub has helped me :) i love you guys/girls...!
