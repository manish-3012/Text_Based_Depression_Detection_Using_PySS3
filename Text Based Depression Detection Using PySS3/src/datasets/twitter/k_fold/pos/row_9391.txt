Is it weird to miss my ex even though we are best friends? So for most of this year me and my ex have gotten along pretty well.
We play Minecraft together for hours at a time, we text each other and some times we FaceTime.
But lately Iâ€™ve been having this weird feeling about me missing her Even though we still call and text each other. Should I tell her I still miss her or ignore it and just hope for the best
