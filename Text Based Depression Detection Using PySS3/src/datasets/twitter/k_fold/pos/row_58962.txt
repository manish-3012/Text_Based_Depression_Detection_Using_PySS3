A question for people whoâ€™ve seen legend of korra. If you havenâ€™t seen it and or donâ€™t want to spoil things then donâ€™t open this Avatar wanâ€™s (the first avatar) life story was summed up In season 2 episode 7 and 8 of legend of korra. I feel like his background and story are really interesting and deserves a whole series. I just wanted to know if yâ€™all feel the same as well.
