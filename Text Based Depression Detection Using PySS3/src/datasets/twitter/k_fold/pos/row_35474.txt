Iâ€™m super duper alone So basically I havenâ€™t hugged a girl in over a year. And now on fucking Valentine I got no one. After I broke up with my gf I havenâ€™t even had a crush. Like I canâ€™t find new people to connect with. 

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m typing. Sorry for bad England me no native speak.
