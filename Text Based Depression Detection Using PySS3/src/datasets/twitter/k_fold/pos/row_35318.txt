Should I text my crush? I've had a crush on this person for a while now. We're not friends, and we don't hang out in or outside school. But we do acknowledge each other and we can talk to each other mostly with ease. I've gotten small hints that they could possibly like me, including catching them looking at me, them sometimes laughing at stuff I say, among other minor hints.

Should I text my crush? In my mind it could possibly spark conversation and get us to get to know each other more. Will I make it awkward by texting them? And if they ask me why I texted them, what should I say?
