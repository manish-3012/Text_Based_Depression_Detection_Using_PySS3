To the people telling me to stop liking Frozen and Disney Princesses If you lot would like me to have a crush on someone else, it can be arranged.  
  
Thereâ€™s Amy and Leela from Futurama, Ellie from TLOU, Gogo from Big Hero 6, Kara from Detroit: Become Human, Mia and Gisele from F&amp;F, Ai from Yakuza 0 and Tracey from GTA V.  
 
Still. I find Anna, Elsa and all the Disney Princesses to be cuter.
