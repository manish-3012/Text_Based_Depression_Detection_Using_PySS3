Being an atheist doesnâ€™t make you a fucking genius No you didnâ€™t find forbidden knowledge.

Like Iâ€™m not religious but I believe in something because when you just look around and actually think about everything it just doesnâ€™t make sense that it spontaneously happened it while the â€œproofsâ€ for a  god donâ€™t prove anything they make a very compelling argument, and while you canâ€™t prove god(s) you also canâ€™t disprove, so stop belittling people based on their beliefs. Stop saying â€œreligion set us back 1000 yearsâ€ whatâ€™s done is done, and no society has ever been even 50% atheist, why? Because itâ€™s in our nature to find an explanation for the inexplainable. You might think Christianity or Islam set us back thousands of years, but what do think would happen if they didnâ€™t exist? There would just be other world religions. 

And be thankful that you were dealt Christianity or Islam, you should see wtf they do in Papua New where they donâ€™t have Abrahamic religions. As of 2012 cannibalism was still cool there. And they still have warring tribes and donâ€™t even get me started on the Etoro and Sambia. Shit is fucking disgusting.
