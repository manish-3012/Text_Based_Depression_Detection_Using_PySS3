How do I motivate myself to actually do my schoolwork? I'm pretty much the world's worst procrastinator, and half the time I end up not even doing the work at all. I have a serious problem getting distracted as well. My parents are making me use a shitty school-owned Chromebook for schoolwork which would help if it weren't for the fact that Reddit isn't blocked on it, and neither is YouTube or [kongregate.com](https://kongregate.com) and other distracting websites. This wouldn't be such a huge problem if we were in real classrooms, because at least in a real classroom I can get my work done but no, COVID-19 came along and now we're stuck doing shitty online classes.

TL;DR - How do I motivate myself to actually do my schoolwork instead of sit here on Reddit and other websites all day and then get almost nothing done as a result?
