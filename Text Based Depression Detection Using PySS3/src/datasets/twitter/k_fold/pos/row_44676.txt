I AM TIRED OF THIS Iâ€™m just so tired of his shit. Like I just wanna talk and heâ€™ll be like â€œidcâ€ but whenever he wants to talk and I say the same shit heâ€™ll say â€œi fEeL LiKe yOu hAtE mE tOdAyâ€ and Iâ€™m just tired of his shitty behavior-! But I still love him...I just wish that he would at least try to not treat me like some shitty pass time. This shit just adds to my forever growing list of problems. I donâ€™t know what I should do whatsoever. I would confront him but Iâ€™m scared it might damage our relationship or whatever we have (at this point I donâ€™t even know). Iâ€™ll try to start a conversation and heâ€™ll be like â€œidc.â€ Today I talked about the anime I was watching earlier cuz maybe he would be interested and he just says I donâ€™t care. LIKE IF YOU DONT CARE THEN JUST DONT REPLY!! Iâ€™m just fed up. Iâ€™ve tolerated this shit for too long.
