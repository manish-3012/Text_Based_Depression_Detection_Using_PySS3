From a girl: donâ€™t be a simp. So a while ago I met this guy on a minecraft server. I had a rank, he did not. We chatted through discord (text only, no voice calls) and he tried to make a move on me several times. I told him that I wasnâ€™t interested in a relationship, not only because he lived on nearly the other side of the world, and because heâ€™s 2 years younger than me (Iâ€™m 17, heâ€™s 15). He still kept trying but I was clear from the start, I was only friends with him because I liked playing minecraft with him. He then proceeded to buy himself a rank and upgrade mine as well, this was entirely his own idea and choice. He then told me he spent all his money on me and STILL tried to get in a relationship with me of something?? No one forced you to spend $10 on a rank for me while I already had a rank and then try to guilttrap me because you spent reallife money on me.
I quit playing with him and we are no longer friends. 

If you get rejected, take the L and go. Donâ€™t spend any time or money on someone who isnâ€™t interested. Donâ€™t be a simp like this guy was because you might lose your friends. No one likes simps.
