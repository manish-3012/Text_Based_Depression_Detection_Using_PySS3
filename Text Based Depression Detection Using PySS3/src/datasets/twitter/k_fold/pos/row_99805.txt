Do you know what you want to do when you grow up? Iâ€™m about to go into 9th grade, but where I live itâ€™s known as your last year of Middle School. I already have plans for my future and my career. Iâ€™ve talked to my parents about college plans, funding, getting a job, renting my own place. 
But I end up getting brushed off with 
â€œYouâ€™ve still got time.â€ or â€œYouâ€™ll change your mind.â€ and itâ€™s frustrating! 
When WILL I have to make the decision? I want to have a clear view of what Iâ€™m gonna do when I grow up. When is it gonna be THE time? What if I end up running out of time? 
My older cousin is gonna go into 12th grade this year and he doesnâ€™t even know what he wants to do! He says he â€œhas timeâ€. Does he?
Itâ€™s all so confusing to me.
