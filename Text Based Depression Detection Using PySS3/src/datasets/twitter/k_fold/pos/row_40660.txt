Bro holy crap I actually got my friend to read a majority of the bee movie script So I had the bee movie sent to me on discord by someone I knew, and so I just sent it to my friend, because why not. About 10-20 minutes later, he invites me to an Xbox party, where he says he read it all out loud all the way up to â€œDo you like jazz?â€. And so I just sat there laughing for about 5 minutes because I hadnâ€™t even thought about it after send the entire script. He just read it all the way to that moment and had no clue it was the bee movie, and I just find that hilarious
