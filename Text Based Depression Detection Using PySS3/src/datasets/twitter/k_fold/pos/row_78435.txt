I am very frustrated and wish to give into to destructive behaviors Mine has been a life of such shame my environmental behaviors are wrong in this climate and while I wish to be adaptive I find nothing but loss of self within mental conditioning. Relocate Relocate Relocate Relocate my body please earth I am still your child I do not belong in our sculpted hives suffocate me in your likeness and domesticate me like the others so that we may bathe in hate for each other paint my soul with metal and hurt bite your throat bite your throat bite your throat we are a mistake and god has left us to rot and fester may all your material goods consume you and may all your hope leave you blind our only truth is death but your morals are fiction
