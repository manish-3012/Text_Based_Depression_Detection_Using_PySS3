Right okay Iâ€™ve gotten myself into a bit of a predicament Right ok so basically at the beginning of Quarantine I was practicing my accents and the ones I did best were my Russian and Irish ones. But over the summer I got too used to talking in the Irish accent and sometimes I canâ€™t do my normal voice, itâ€™ll just switch to an Irish Accent at random times. I donâ€™t wanna walk into my new school next week with an Irish accent. Please help

(Parents making me go traditionally to school dont hate plz) 

Possible Solution 1:
Whenever I play RDR2 for a long time my voice/accent starts to sound like Arthurâ€™s, so maybe I can do that.

Possible Solution 2:
Speak in a Russian Accent and scare anyone who hears me.

Possible Solution 3: 
Listen to the Beatles all day everyday to try and regain my English Accent
