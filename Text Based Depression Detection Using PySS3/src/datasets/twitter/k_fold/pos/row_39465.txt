My girlfriend is moving and i dont know what im going to do While writing this im pretty upset about the fact of my girlfriend who ive been dating for 6 almost 7 months has to move. It feels like a knife in my stomach. Im very sad and upset because i love her alot and the thought of her dating other guys breaks my heart in two. I try to think positive about it and think of it as a new beginning and chapter in my life but im gonna lose my best friend and its making me really sad.
