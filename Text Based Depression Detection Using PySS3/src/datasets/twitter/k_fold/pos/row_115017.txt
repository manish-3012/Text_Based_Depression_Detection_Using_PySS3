Just me talking So I'm 13, in 8th grade, high school starts in 9th. A couple of days ago, I had a meeting with my school counselor to talk about high school. She just talked about all the different options for classes. My parents started talking to her about AP classes, concurrent enrollment and early graduation. I'm already one year ahead in math, so I guess I could handle these things. But a couple minutes after the zoom call ended, it really hit me. I'm not a little kid anymore, and everything I do is starting to matter. I'm going to have to put everything into my grades, since my parents are going to make me get good grades, to get into a good college. I'm not even sure I want to go to college, but I think that it'll be a waste of working so hard in high school to not go. I feel like in high school I'm going to get pushed too hard and end up burning out completely. 

thanks for reading the long convoluted mess
