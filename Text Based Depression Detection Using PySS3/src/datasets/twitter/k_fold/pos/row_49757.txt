i lost my $80 drawing stylus i lost my expensive ass drawing stylus and now i cant draw 
iâ€™m over $100 in debt so i canâ€™t get a new one, and i donâ€™t have a source of income. my mom wonâ€™t buy me a new one. 
iâ€™m beyond pissed, drawing is my only healthy coping mechanism. i donâ€™t have the money for this.
