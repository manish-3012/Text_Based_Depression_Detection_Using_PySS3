In need of a few dollars to publish a website I worked hard on.. Hello

I am a student whose passion is computer science and programming. I have spend a lot of time making this cool website and I would love to publish it.

The cheapest SQL-database-integrate-able domain is $2 and hosting it costs $4 per month, total $6.

Yes, the website will be up for only one month, but that is enough to show my friends and family the project I've put a lot of effort into. I'll try to get more money on my own later I guess.

If you could help me out, even $1, it would mean the world to me.

I will DM you proof of my website (like a video showing my files and the website itself) if you want.
