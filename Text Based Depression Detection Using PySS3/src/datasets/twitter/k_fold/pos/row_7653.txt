Letâ€™s all be honest The worst thing ever is when you heat something up in the microwave the next day and it tastes different like when go to McDonaldâ€™s and you get two large fries (Iâ€™m not fat surprisingly Iâ€™m athletic) and you canâ€™t finish them all yeah you shouldnâ€™t buy them if you canâ€™t finish them but I donâ€™t want to go to McDonaldâ€™s every time I want fries but you canâ€™t heat them in the microwave because it tastes like trash
