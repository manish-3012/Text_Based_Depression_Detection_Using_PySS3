Is what my friend doing an actual coping mechanism? My friend loves to over analyze things like books and shows and thatâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s a very nice talent to have. She said it was a coping mechanism to make her feel smarter too. I guess I was fine with that. But I wasnâ€™t fine with something else. That something else being making me feel stupid. Whenever I would bring something up that I analyzed or my thoughts on a story, she would butt in and constantly try and make herself sound right. It made me feel stupid cause she kept making me feel wrong to prove her point. She said it was just to make conversation but what she was doing sounds more like an arguement than a conversation. I just donâ€™t see how a coping mechanism is effective if all it does is bring down others to make yourself feel better. But please try and think outside the box for this, because I obviously have bias. I need an unbiased point of view.
