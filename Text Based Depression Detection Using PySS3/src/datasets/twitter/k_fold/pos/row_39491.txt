Is it possible to convince the mods of r/teenagers to add a satire flair ? I believe itâ€™ll end up being really helpful/useful and it should really be considered. I know the meme flair already exists but it doesnâ€™t give the same effect as the satire flair would. Itâ€™ll also clear up any confusion of whether the person is serious or not. If any mod reads this please thing about it
