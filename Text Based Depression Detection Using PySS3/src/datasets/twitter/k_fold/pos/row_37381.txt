here's a shitty poem i wrote It's called Reload Spaghetto, by me obviously.

*RELOAD SPAGHETTO*
by me

My spaghetti tingled
like a Pringle
I may be fickle 
but at least I'm single

It's deep inside 
and I can't decide
Should I have depression 
or commit homicide?

I mean,
I've been a mistake before
But must I comply
and become a whore?

This poem, I don't like
My sh*t, I don't like
If I could choose
I'd commit suicide

My friend thinks that
this is almost a rap
so let's give it a wrap
by trying to tap

On the magic hat
of simple illusion
Infecting minds 
with much fascination

About procreation
not falsification
They crave protection
from transformation

Whom shalt
impound upon thee?
Why not sit down
and drink a cup of tea?

For we are wanderers
whom came from yonder
No need to wonder
we don't like being strangers

So to reiterate
For illiterates
We consumerates
would like to say

Our spaghettis tingle
like some Pringles
So suck on them
or else you'll tumble
