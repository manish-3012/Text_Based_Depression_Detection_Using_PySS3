lets say, hypothetically, a drunk driver high on illegal drugs threatened to brutally run me over with his car... what do? lets say, hypothetically, im on a trip to the local netto to buy snacks with my boyfriend and some friends. Hypothetically, the youngest of the group ran out in the middle of the road for no fucking reason, its 10 pm, we cant see much, so i, hypothetically, run out on the road, drag him back to the sidewalk and tell him that its a stupid thing to do, and that he should never fucking do it again.

so on our way back, he hypothetically runs out into the middle of the road again, this time i dont pull him out because it's his own fucking fault, i scream "car!" because i still fucking care about him.

Hypothetically, a few minutes later, another car comes racing towards us, well above the speed limit, almost runs us over, rolls down his window and hypothetically shouts "the fuck are you doing child? im high on weed and very fucking drunk right fucking now, dont just run out on the road like that! do you have a deathwish? I'll fucking run you over you shit child, ill sleep so tightly at night knowing you're fucking dead, but i dont think your parents will" at me.

and lets just say hypothetically that i remember his license plate which is (DK) HG 53 557 and that he drives an old black car where the left rear window is seemingly broken and replaced with a lot of gaffer tape, lets say hypothetically that he himself was around his mid 20s to early 30s and probably of middle eastern descent.

what should i hypothetically do in that totally hypothetical scenario.
