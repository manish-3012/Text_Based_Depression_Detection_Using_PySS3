alright alright gonna be emotionally vulnerable for a moment. or something like that. since my third ex broke up w me and got back together with his ex the day we broke up i have been infinitely more insecure and jealous of people because i always think Iâ€™m a rebound or settled for. even if nothing should make me feel that way. and i ruin things along the way bc this stress gets to the people i care about the most and i donâ€™t mean it to. i lost my self value and iâ€™m trying to get it back on my own. but this shit sucks because things could have been beautiful if i never met the man whoâ€™s partly responsible for the way i am now
