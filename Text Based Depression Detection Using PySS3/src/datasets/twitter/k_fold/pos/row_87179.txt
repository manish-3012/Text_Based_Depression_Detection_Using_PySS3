Made a presentation about the land before time 

Took 7 ridiculously easy quizzes and 1 test 

â€œStudiedâ€ for the PSAT while discussing how fast food restaurants are run by Putin as part of his puppetry of Mitch McConnell, all orchestrated by Bernie Sanders with my crush

Discovered that while I am in reality a heterosexual human boy, when I look at videos of myself I see a gay skeleton
