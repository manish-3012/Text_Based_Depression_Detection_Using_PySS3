I have a friend which I think is fun to hang around with but he's quite disconnected when it comes to knowledge about stuff that I/we like. Which sometimes annoys me. Like, I really like the guy as a friend. Sometimes he does some cool bud stuff but when it comes to the times when we talk or play together most of the time it's just me helping or explaining something to him which is pretty obvious to me. What annoys me the most is that he always doesn't admit he's wrong and blames whatever did bad by him is no way his fault and needsit to be spelled out for him in order to admit/ get it. 

 Take this for an example: we're both playing R6* we're playing against bots. We enter the first room, kill some bad guys, I hear a grenade drop near me, run away from it come back to the spot and my friend flies to Mars after getting killed by the grenade. He then screams what the hell was that, I say it's a grenade, he then insists he didn't throw a grenade and I had to say explicitly *enemy* grenade in order for him to get it like he couldn't connect grenade killed me = enemy killed me with their grenade. 

Plus I'm real bad at explaning and I get annoyed when anybody doesn't get something which is super obvious to me. Like I know this is supremely douchey but I kind of can't control it, like i raise my voice trying to explain something without even realising I raised my voice, and then I get annoyed at myself for raising my voice.

 I seriously don't know like what to say to him, like it's not his fault he doesn't get some stuff but so many times over so many things I have to spell it out for him. Am I just douchey for complaining about this? Like I would talk to him directly but I don't even know what to say. 


*R6 is short for rainbow six siege, a video game.
