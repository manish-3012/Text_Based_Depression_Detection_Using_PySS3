So Americans, what's it like having the spicy cold ? I'm from nz and haven't been in lockdown at all in ages, not to mention schooling has been back to normal since the middle of last year. So I'm wondering whats it like having the spicy cold and restricted schooling ? Also if you want to know my perspective on the whole ordeal from a NZ students point of view I will be happy to answer them !

(Also this is non political btw)
