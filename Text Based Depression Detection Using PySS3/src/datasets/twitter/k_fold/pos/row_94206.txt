My friend got mad at me So today was my female friend's birthday so I gave her a birthday present, it was just a simple chocolate bar that I bought and wrapped up. But my friend who is the ex boyfriend of her got mad at me because I gave her a birthday gift and he wanted to do it but didn't. And the worst part of all is that he is stalking her. I was talking with her yesterday and told me that she's grossed out by him, but still he walks up to her and talks with her. But when he does that you can see that she doesn't like it so then I walk up to them he immediately calls me a simp because I liked her once.

I dont know of this story is clear it's just that I wanted to share it
