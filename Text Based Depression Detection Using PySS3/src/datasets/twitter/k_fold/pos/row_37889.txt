I need words... be it kind or harsh I am on a scholarship overseas. I just got back my results for my finals, and I very probably didn't meet the criteria to advance into the second year. I am highly likely going to lose my scholarship, I will be deported back to my home country, my parents would have to pay liquidity damages which is a pretty hefty sum. 

I guess a simple way to sum up my year was, I started motivated to do well, then I lost track of my academics because I wanted to focus on my passion, of course, it backfired. I didn't sacrifice enough and work hard enough. Though when I came around, it was too late. I did my best. Can I say I gave it my all? No... 

And now, I am confused, sad, angry at myself, my back is strained by guilt of the burden I placed on my parents. I am a disappointment to my teachers, my friends and I am close to done with life.

The only thing I am holding on to right now is that suicide leads to eternal condemnation (because I am religious). Also I want to experience the world, but everything seems so bleak. 

Sorry if I came off as entitled or privileged. If you want you can bash me, insult me and thrash me.
