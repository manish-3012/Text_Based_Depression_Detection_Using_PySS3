The day I move out will be the best day of my life My mother has ridiculed me for years and just recently we had an argument about who controls MY bank account, which legally Iâ€™m entitled to. When I said I donâ€™t want her on it because Iâ€™m old enough and want privacy she couldnâ€™t take that for an answer.

She disowned me, said I was a disappointment, Iâ€™m a little shit, she hates me, and I treat her like shit and that I should live with my drug addicted father. Sheâ€™s obviously bipolar. 

The future holds bad things for me and Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna happen but if I even get to move out Iâ€™ll be so happy. Fuck you Mom.
