I'm scared. This has been in my head for a while but today it just exploded. I am scared. I'm scared that I will never find a partner. I feel like my autism is holding me back from it because I feel like no one would want to date someone like me. And not just High autism, I also have anxiety and ADHD and it dose not help. 
 And it is especially hard during the pandemic because I can't meet people. And I don't want to use dating websites. this is the first time in a while I feel excessively lonely.
