I dont even know anymore about this relationship Why is it that everytime my girlfriend opens up to me and her friends about something that she has in her mind everyone supports her but whenever i say i feel sad or lonely or hurt by something that happened there has to start a fight, for example: (im the â€œtherapist friendâ€ in case ur wondering) my gfs bff was really hurt because of this guy that is playing with lots of ppls feelings and i helped her feel better about herself but then the dude texted her and she fell for him again (cus fucking high school drama) and she ssd the chat and blurred out her typing but left mine in saying that i also dont like the guy bla bla bla and after that she regretted it and said sorry, all fine right? WRONG! SHE SAID SORRY TO MY GIRLFRIEND and i kinda got hurt and i told them that and they fought for like 2 days cus of it... and even like 30 minutes ago my gf was scared of a spider and i sent her (as a funny haha joke) â€œaww cute little baby is scawed of spidew ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆâ€ and i thought it was ok because she makes fun of me all the time as well (as a joke) but nooooo i told her that she also makes fun of me but now shes angry? What do i do
