Parents make no sense I just asked my dad, next time you say we are going to the grocery store can you be more honest and tell me that we have one stop an hour out of the way. And according to him that is disrespect and MAKING him explain himself. I then said all I want is to know how long itâ€™s going to take when you wake me up early and say come on letâ€™s go to the grocery store. With my valid point he said, keep talking back and youâ€™re grounded and not going to be able to go outside. I donâ€™t understand his point of being a dick when I just asked a simple question. Anyways, hope your parents make more since then my dad.
