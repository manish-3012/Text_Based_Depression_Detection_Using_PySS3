Kids who ask math teachers â€œHow am I gonna use this in everyday life?â€ or â€œHow is this actually useful?â€ are just trying to get a rise out of their classmates and are ignorant of the utility of knowing math.

If you ever took algebra or geometry and you asked the teacher â€œhow am I gonna use this in everyday lifeâ€ because you thought it was useless, you are an asshole. First of all it is not the teachers choice what they want to teach because they have to follow a curriculum. Second of all knowing algebra and geometry is very useful for job applications in corporate jobs and STEM jobs. If you are the person who asks a teacher these questions youâ€™re probably the same person who bitches about how school needs to teach people important things like doing taxes. TAXES ARE MATH. Idk how unpopular this opinion is but I needed to vent about this because whenever I hear people saying this I roll my eyes because a good understanding of math is honestly probably one of the most valuable things you will ever get from your education.
