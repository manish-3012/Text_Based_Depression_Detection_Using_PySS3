I came out to my aunt last night (On moblie so spelling and formatting is pretty crappy)

So ive been out to my parents, brothers, and grandparents for a bit over a year, my dad was fine, my mom really doesnt think i can make that choice this early (im 14.) And ive been trying to come out to my aunt legit since last christmas. Yesterday she brought over taro cards and when you get a reading you have to think of a question and so i thought of the question "how wil auntie react when i come out"
I didnt tell her the question though, later we were on a call while she was driving home and she was trying to figire out what it was. "Are you pregnant? Dating a boy? Dating a girl...?" And atter she asked the last one i said "no... but i do like girls" she was fully supportive and i told her what being bi was and she fully supported me. I even sent her a photo of my bi flag!!
