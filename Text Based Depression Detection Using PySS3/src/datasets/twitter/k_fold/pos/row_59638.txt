When you have been told since kindergarten that you don't act or react normal but you don't know what being normal is because you've always been this way Like ever since kindergarten when I would go into meltdowns regularly and subsequently end up having those meltdowns for years, I was often told and knew that I wasn't normal. Like I wasn't explicitly told that but I remember clearly being told that the other kids in class weren't acting that way. And it is just annoying when you know you aren't a normal person but don't know what normal is because you've been this way your entire life and so have no idea how a normal person would feel or react. It just annoys me sometimes.
