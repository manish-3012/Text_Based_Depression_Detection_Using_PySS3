There are some stores on amazon who giveaway free items to get review and ratings. Some one sent me message that we give free items on amazon to get review and rating.  First i think it may be scam but then i decided to give it a try because if i buy anything from amazon at least i can get a product.  He promised that if i purchase the product and gave 5 star ratings and good review then they will pay me the price on my PayPal.  So i purchased their cheap product on 24.99 dollars.  The product was a laptops stand on desks. I realy needed it for my laptop. When i recieved the product it was really ammazing. I gave 5 stars and review . My review came online in 24 hours. I send him screen shot of the review and my order. He asked for my paypal email. When i gave him my email he realy send me 24.99 dollars. Wow that was amazing.  Then i started purchasing from them different products. They refunded me every product. In February 2021 i got almost 34 products for free. I am telling you guys because he told me to tell others too. This is only available for US UK Canada and Germany only.
