My gf broke up with me My gf broke up with me, we havenâ€™t dated that long, but if you consider the amount of time weâ€™ve been Bestfriends and both liked each other and flirted 24/7 it wouldâ€™ve been a year plus. Iâ€™m currently questioning life and I donâ€™t know if I can continue without her, she made me happy and she was my everything. Any advice on how to cope with this feeling, please and thank you. It is greatly appreciated
