My mom does not support my gay friends I donâ€™t understand how we are related. I was talking to my mom and casually mentioned my friend is gay, thinking nothing of it, until my mom started talking. She thinks people canâ€™t cope being alone and thatâ€™s why they say their â€œgayâ€ and that media is shoving it down everyoneâ€™s throats. I had to walk away. She is also biased about race, which one again, donâ€™t understand how we are anything alike. 

I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do. Sheâ€™s probably going to see this post because she snoops, but I donâ€™t think I care anymore. She then had the audacity to say â€œwhy donâ€™t you meet normal girls, meet some dorky girl who likes boys.â€ As if my friend isnâ€™t â€œnormal.â€ 

To add salt to the wound, we recently moved so it has been hard being in a new school. Iâ€™ve finally made 3 friends, and now my mom wants me to find new ones?? Even though they are *new* friends?? This is a small school too, so itâ€™s not like I have a lot of options in the first place. 

God this is long, this happened 2 minutes ago. Iâ€™m going to end it here. I donâ€™t care if anyone reads this or sees it, I just really needed to type it out.
