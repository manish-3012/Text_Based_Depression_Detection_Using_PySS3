Am i the only one who feels like people in public walk too slowly? There are times when Iâ€™m on a consistent walking pace..â€everything is ok..this is the perfect speed, Iâ€™ll get to my destination in no timeâ€, and then some random ass person suddenly comes out of the convenience store, starts using their phone..and moves slower than a dry bar of soap on dusty concrete, and I canâ€™t even tell them to step aside because that would be awkward, so Iâ€™m just forced to move slower for the rest of the walk
