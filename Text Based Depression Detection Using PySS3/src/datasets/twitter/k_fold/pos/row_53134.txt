Quarantine birthday So on 13th I turned 18 and im from the UK and it means I could legally drink alcohol and I fucked up. Bought myself a jack daniels whiskey and drank it all in a night but it was a good birthday, I got super drunk and i dont remember any of it. My advice for all people turning 18 in quarantine that lives in the UK don't make the same mistake you'll be ill for the next day.
