I'm actually looking forward to school Obviously not to do work or anything just to see my friends becuase as my post history will tell u I've been feeling really shit lately. But even tho I'm sorta excited for it anytime I think of it I get these knots in my stomach. Worried about what will happen going back 2 school. Like I dont get bullied but my anxiety goes so high and through the roof I overreact to everything. If I girl laughs within 10 meters of me I instantly freak out and go all shy becuase I think they're laughing at me.

So that's me right now hows everyone else doing?
