I'm happy to announce that I am two years simp sober! On this very day I have officially been simp sober for two years. I know people usually talk about how, " mY cRuSh SaId S/hE tHiNkS i'M cUtE" or whatever, but I don't need a relationship at this point in my life and I feel empowered by knowing that. I feel accomplished by living my normal life and doing something not that many people can.  I feel proud of myself for having a normal life without simping.

( I don't hate the "crush" posts but, I find them very cliche) have good day, comrade.
