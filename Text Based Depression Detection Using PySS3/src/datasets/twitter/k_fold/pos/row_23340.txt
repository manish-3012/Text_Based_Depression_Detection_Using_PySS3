I just got my first rejection letter from uni, lmaoo Well, technically it was from congress, but I need congressional approval to go to my top choice uni, so by extension, it's essentially a uni rejection letter.

Y'all ever have something happen to you where you feel like you should be sad, but aren't? Like, I was 100% going to go to the Air Force Academy, I was excited as hell, and I've been physically training pretty much every day because I'm scrawny as a tooth-pick, but now that the opportunity's gone it's just like "Eh, what's the point in being sad about it? Twasn't meant to be, I'll figure something else out." I don't really have a "holding on" kinda personality.

I am not excited about telling my parents though. I can handle rejection, hell, I practically welcome it in every-day life by practically making an art form out of being the weirdest person in any given room, I just hate being pitied. That shiz is annoying as hell to deal with, where I gotta pretend I'm sad.
