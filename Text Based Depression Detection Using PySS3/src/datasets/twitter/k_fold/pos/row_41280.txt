Iâ€™m not sure if anyone will be proud of me but Iâ€™m posting this here anyway I just stood up to my mom for maybe the first time in history and Iâ€™m shaking, every time I walk out of my room her and my sister constantly disrespect me for being quiet (even tho theyâ€™re the reason it happens because Iâ€™m scared to talk) and she just came to my room to ask for my telescope and I said no and she needed up taking it from me but Iâ€™m just proud I finally took a stand for myself 

TL:DR- I finally stood up for myself to my disrespectful mother
