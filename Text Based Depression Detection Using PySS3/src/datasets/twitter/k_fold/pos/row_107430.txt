Guys I need your help Does going to the movies actually mean going to the movies? Or does it mean fooling around in the back? Iâ€™m pretty quiet irl so I donâ€™t respond to male advances if they happen but a guy friend said he likes me and wants to go to the movies. Iâ€™ve never been on a date but some friends said guys take girls there to fuck around??  if the movies is code for â€œletâ€™s sit in the back so you can give me headâ€ Iâ€™ll pass.
