Am I alone in this or does sbdy do this as well Do you ever just look at your crush's photo where they are smiling and are genuinely happy and just imagine you are there with them where the photo was taken at the exact moment where the person is smiling and then the pleasant warm feeling comes to your stomach which is always followed by the hard-to-swallow truth knowing they don't really care about you and all that makes you happy is just an imagination?
