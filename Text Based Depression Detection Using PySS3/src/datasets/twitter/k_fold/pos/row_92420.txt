I'm cold It's currently midnight for me and I am very cold and you may think just to turn up the heat but then I'm to hot, trust me I tried. I'm in a constant circle of unpleasantness and I just want to go to sleep but it's to cold and if I put up the heat then I'm to hot and I still can't sleep. Maybe if I light myself on fire then go into the freezer and sleep there it might solve it but that's effort and I'm already in bed so I'm back to square one.
