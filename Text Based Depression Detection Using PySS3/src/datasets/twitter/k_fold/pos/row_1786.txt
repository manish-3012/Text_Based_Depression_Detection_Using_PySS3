Wouldn't it be great to disappear Ha I would be life would be so fun. Everyone complains about you anyway, so why not. The most painless way would be simply to not exist, but that's impossible. Everyone is two faced. They talk about your imperfections with each other then smile and laugh with you ten minutes later. Why not just leave if the whole world is like this then? Why not just disappear? Why not? No one is gonna care that much. This is what the voice inside my head tells me everyday. Whenever I'm left to my thoughts it grades on my self-esteem and mentality. Some days it's stinger than other days. Today was a day like that. I feel alone. I feel like a sinner. I feel like today would be better if I was gone. Turns out I'm a horrible person I guess. I've always heard the term gaslighting, but I never though it really happened often. Maybe I'm just oblivious. I feel like a piece of crap. I feel like I'm worthless to those around me. I'm just another pon to be sacrificed for the sake of others. I'm an invaluable piece. I should have know right?! I felt my suspicions rise, but never fully believed others would do such things. I should have noticed that other avoided me like the plague. I'm so naive. I should have known others find me a bother, but no I didn't now I feel terrible. I feel toxic. I feel weak that this hurts. I feel used that others talk behind my back then ask for my trust. I feel alone that no one was there to defend me or inform me. I feel gullible that I feel for this act for 6 months. I want to disappear.
