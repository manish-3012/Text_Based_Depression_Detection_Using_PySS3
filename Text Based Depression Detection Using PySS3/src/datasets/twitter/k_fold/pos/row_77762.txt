Yaâ€˜ll know the quote from Muhammad Ali? â€žI donâ€™t count my sit-ups, I only start counting when it starts to hurt.â€œ 

Well, Iâ€˜ve done that and I did about 40 (of the hurting ones) and the next day every time I laughed it felt like someone rammed a machete in my stomach. 10/10 would recommend.
