Iâ€™m done with SIMP culture Every time Iâ€™m nice to a girl because Iâ€™m a gentleman, my friends call me a simp. Im not changing myself Iâ€™m just being nice to another human being. But nooooo, they have to be annoying like that. It just really pisses me off. Like come on why canâ€™t I just be nice?
