Would love some help So first of all im sorry for the wall of text
For starters i gotta give some back story, about 2 years ago i started playing a game with a few people, a discord was created and we spent the last 2 years having fun in it, we are scattered all over Europe and even a few other countries outside but we still play, joke, talk about everything, these guys became my second family basicly

Lately i've been feeling like shit and while i still play with them, I dont really talk alot (i play less aswell). For some extra context i'm one of the people who jokes around alot and is talking quite a bit, but these last few weeks i lost interest in about everything, I wont say that im depressed since that would be a bullshit claim, my real family is legit the best and i couldnt ask for a better one, these friends are also the best, I have a few IRL friends that i regard close to family level aswell, just that every time i wanna go and talk, i cant be my jolly self anymore, nor can i make myself to join the discord. I keep thinking eh i dont need to be there i'll just fuck everyones mood, and when i do talk i find myself smiling alot but im not actually happy like i used to be while smiling, even in real life i smile quite a bit but i always think now thats just bullshit why are you even smiling. Its like im using the smile as a fake even behind a computer screen. I just dont know what to do, today i talked with my brother (who is older) about fixing my bike, and he was like come over and we'll fix it together and when i read that i burst into tears and was actually happy, even now that im wroting this im in tears and idk why
