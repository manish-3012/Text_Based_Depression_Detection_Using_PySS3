Can you guys imagine what our next generation will look like? I bet every one of our kids is gonna know at least one guy named Naruto

I also imagine this exchange taking place: 

Teacher: Roll call. Uh, Beter?

Kid: Please, itâ€™s pronounced â€œðŸ…±ï¸eter.â€ 

Our future kids are gonna be friggin weird
