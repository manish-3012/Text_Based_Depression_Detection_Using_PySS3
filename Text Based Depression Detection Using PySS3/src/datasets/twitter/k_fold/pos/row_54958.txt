Fellow redditors , I need some help! Soo about a year and half ago I met this girl, I had a crush on her, but didn't have the guts to tell her, fast forward to a year and I find her on social media and we get to talking, turns out she also used to like me, but doesn't anymore, she just sees me as a friend, from that day we start talking everyday, it's been like 4 months and I re-develop a crush on her, she finds out and says she doesn't feel that way, we still talk almost everyday but not as before, I still like her and I don't know what to do. I would ask these kinda things to my friends, but in terms of friends I have no friends. I don't wanna give up on her because in everyone I have in my life, no one understands me better than her. I have no one else to talk to so I am asking on Reddit. What should I do? If you are still here reading, then I thank you with all my heart for your precious time. Feel free to PM /DM /message me.
