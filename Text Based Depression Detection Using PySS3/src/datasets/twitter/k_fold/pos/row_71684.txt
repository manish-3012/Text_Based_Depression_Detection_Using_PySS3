its sooo hard to me to choose clothes the hardest fucking thing ever. I think i have a anxiety (im really anxious about being anxious. and and because of that i feeling really anxious). i had a choose, one white, one black. I think that white suits me more, but black doesn't suit at all, but white thing is really not cool, but my mom saying that omg white thing is sooo cool but im like not it's not cool but black thing on me seems really cool but black doesn't suits me, but its cool but my mom likes white more. finally my mom shared that to my father and he said that black is cool. then i finally realized that THIS white thing sucks, and now i have choose buy black or nothing. after 10 minutes of "choosing" (just fucking thinking: 1. this thing looks cool 2. nah black doesn't suits me 3. repeat) I bought that cool black jacket. (or not cool????, black not suits me)
