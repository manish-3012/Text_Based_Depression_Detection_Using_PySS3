Why are things that are supposed to be â€œfunâ€ and â€œrelaxingâ€ end up being just another chore I donâ€™t even know if that title makes sense. It kinda sucks how things that are supposed to make me happy like talking on the phone or going for a walk just sound incredibly painful to me. Itâ€™s not even the act itself but itâ€™s just starting it. People just do so much and they say itâ€™s fun. Fun is laying in my bed. Fun is not doing a single thing and eating some good ass food while watching something maybe. Anything that requires me to get up and work or put some effort in to isnâ€™t fun. Itâ€™s basically homework
