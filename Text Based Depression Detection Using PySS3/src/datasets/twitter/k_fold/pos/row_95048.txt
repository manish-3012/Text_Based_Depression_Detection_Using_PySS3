So my first day of school (sixth form) and hereâ€™s what I have to say about it. Friends are definitely not going to be made in the first day. I mean itâ€™s not like anyone is rude or anything, everyone is pretty chill. Just not my kinda people. Maybe giving it a few days/weeks and Iâ€™ll see. Not going to do lessons until next week and Iâ€™m probably going to go to clubs, might try to talk to people then. Just need to give me a bit before trying.
