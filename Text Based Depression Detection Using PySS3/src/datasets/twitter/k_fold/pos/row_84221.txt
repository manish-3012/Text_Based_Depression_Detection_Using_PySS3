HELP ME!! Iâ€™ve had writerâ€™s block on one thing for 4 years!!!! Iâ€™ve really wanted to write this story for about 4 years. But the only thing holding me back is that I canâ€™t figure out what kind of character the antagonist is. What is his backstory? What does he want? Why does he want it? If someone could please help me, This has been driving me insane for a few years.
