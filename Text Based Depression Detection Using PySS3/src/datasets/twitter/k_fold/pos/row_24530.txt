I hate how people will look at statistics and genuinely believe them because of bias posted [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/m31osj/i_cant_believe_people_like_this_are_real/) and it got some backlash, as well as a pretty bad downvote ratio. Why are people so keen to invalidate the experiences of others? Damn. It's kinda gross. Just co-exist in peace, y'all. stop it, it's cringe. y'all are better than that. this is r/teenagers, not a fighting ring.
