My younger brother in 4th grade has had 3 attempts on his life as a joke. To give context my younger brother at the time was in 3rd grade, he enjoyed playing sports and hanging out with his friends. He may of been loud and obnoxious at time but I still loved him since he was my family. My younger brother has a peanut allergy that can cause him to die if it isnâ€™t treated in time. Heâ€™s never had any issues with this problem other than 2 times on accident when he got into peanut butter as a 4 year old. He was never really scared of his allergy and was a lot calmer around peanuts at the time. Going back to the near present he is in class during snack time when this girl around his age decided it would be hilarious to eat something that contains peanuts and touch every pencil chair and desk. My brother saw this and got scared and told a teacher. The teacher didnâ€™t punish nor talk tot he girl and decided to clean every thing the girl touched. The next attempt which was worse was around a week later in lunch when this same girl and a few of her friends starting mocking my brother for his allergy and starting rubbing peanut butter all over his food. She started to go for his face when my brother screamed out in fear. A helper teacher went over to check out the situation to only punish my brother for screaming instead of the girls for almost killing him. When my brother got home the school called home and told my parents about him screaming. They were not happy with him until he explained why he did so. My parents then decided to email the principal furious as of to why the girls werenâ€™t punished. They responded with some garbage that hey didnâ€™t follow up on about talking tot he girls. After this I believe that 2 days later there was another attempt which I donâ€™t know the details of and then relentless bullying afterwards. All the teachers decided was necessary was just talking to the whole class about be careful around people with allergies. I didnâ€™t know how to react when hearing this especially since he was not the kid to pick on others. All he would do would probably be just talking really loud since heâ€™s a pretty loud kid. My younger brother now has been very paranoid about any peanuts. Heâ€™ll hide as far away from you if you even go near a peanut, he also has cried a few times when more than one person has had any peanuts, along with him freaking out if his skin tone changes even the slightest thinking itâ€™s an allergic reaction. At this point Iâ€™m trying very hard to make him be a little less scared of his allergy to the point of losing some of his social life. I have no idea what to do from this point on knowing that these girls can get away with attempted murder.
