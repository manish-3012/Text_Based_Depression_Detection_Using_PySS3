So it's my birthday right and hear. So yeah, I get to change my subreddit age from the composite number of 16 to the prime number, 17. Pretty cool stuff, one step closer to becoming an adult and subsequently a productive member of society. I can get my provisional drivers license this year(Getting it in like 2 days time) and tomorrow my school opens to all years groups meaning the start of my leaving cert course. Absolute hype and all.  


But the craziest thing ever happened, I was scrolling through reddit and I see a post on this subreddit saying it's their birthday today, he points out the date of his birthday is the 6/9, 69. I never noticed this until I saw that post, my life is just changed forever like holy crap no wonder I'm an unlucky person I had the luckiest birthdate ever.
