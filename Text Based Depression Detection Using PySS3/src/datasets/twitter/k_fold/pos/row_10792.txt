Just posting something here before I turn 20 But anyways, I want a villain. Like, not just some politician who doesnt support the rights of the minority or any stuff like that. What I mean is we need this REAL baddy. I was thinking like some dude who has a robot army and will destroy the earth. Not even just a dude, it could be this huge love craftian beast who will bring havoc on the earth. It could be anything really, as long as it posses a real threat to literally everyone. Why do I feel like I want a villain? I dont know, I guess I just want something to unite all the people together, something we could all hate and fear. I want something all people, whites and blacks, left or right, western or eastern, sitting down or standing up, can all agree needs to cease. So yeah.
