Having a big dick doesn't equal having girls flock to you begging for sex. From a guy who was told the opposite. Ok so I'm 95th percentile cock volume wise so I'm pretty sure that gives me the right to say this stuff. 

Having a big pp doesn't mean you're great in bed or have girls swarming you. Just as having a small or average pp doesn't mean you'll be terrible in bed or be a virgin forever. Does having a big pp help? Yes it definitely does. Is it necessary? No. It doesn't change how good sex is, just what it looks like. So if you are small, you'll have to do different things in order to be considered good in bed. 

This is not to shame or downplay males that are well hung, because guess what? It does make it easier in bed and some girls and guys think that having a big pp is necessarily for having a good time. Are they wrong? Yes. But they still think like that. 

I was talking to this other guy and he said how easy it must be to have just flock to me. Those girls would first need to know I have a big pp and flaunting the fact you have a big pp around will get you called a douch bag by virtually everyone. Not to mention, this isn't a porn movie where that's the only, or most important, way of getting sex. 

He also said that male value is based off dick size. Or at least that's how society values it. No it's not. We're valued by height, bravery, muscle, income, ect. Is it a factor? Yes, but less than you think. 

I just think a lot of you guys need to know this.
