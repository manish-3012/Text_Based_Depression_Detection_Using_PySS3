I canâ€™t fucking stand my parents politics Idk why Iâ€™m writing this I guess to vent fuck grammar fuck this. I live in Kentucky very red and conservative house family friends life. Thereâ€™s no fucking break. On top of that I have several mental health issues the most of which is depression and self hatred. I donâ€™t wanna fucking see anything I just need to vent. I love my family so so much. And they support trump who I have come to hate so much in the past 6 months with the new awakening to the civil rights movement. I try SO HARD to be civil. To bite my tounge. But trump supporters are crazy. Anywhere you look theyâ€™re me maga and fucking cult thinking. Iâ€™m sorry if I offend anyone but at the time Iâ€™m writing this I donâ€™t fucking care so forgive me please. They canâ€™t see why Iâ€™ve changed no matter how many times I state itâ€™s just that I want equality. I want BASIC FUCKING PEACE! They call themselves Christians and to be honest I donâ€™t believe it anymore and somehow I feel more connected to ethical standards. They treat politics like there religion but Iâ€™f I confront it my mom says â€œwell I never said we were perfect chosen party were all sinners. My party upholds Christian valuesâ€ So day what you fucking will about Jesus but heâ€™s a damn good look at how to treat one another. But all of there PoLiTiCs doesnâ€™t fucking support any basic helping of others human beings. IM TIRED OF TRUMP AND IM TIRED OF FOX NEWS AND IM TIRED OF THIS LIFE. Itâ€™s so much pain I have tears rn and it could all be better if they werenâ€™t in a litterally fucking hive mind cult. I donâ€™t care about partyâ€™s all I want is to help everyone regardless of status. You just gotta be human. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all. Iâ€™ll accept you. But no one around me does. I already am fucking screwed in the head but now Iâ€™m living as a minority all because no one around me stood up for the human rights and acts of kindness that they claimed to. I used to be like them but I changed when I saw how they reacted to George Floydâ€™s death and that of so many others. Iâ€™m not here for a fucking lecture on how what to do Iâ€™m just here because if I dm didnâ€™t write Iâ€™d have no other way to get out my hate and frustration for FUCKING HYPOCRITES FOR RACIST PEOPLE. I cry almost everyday I canâ€™t fucking take this. Iâ€™m hoping that someone sees this and gets what Iâ€™m feeling and Iâ€™m sorry if I fucking offended anyone. Night and fuck this life.
