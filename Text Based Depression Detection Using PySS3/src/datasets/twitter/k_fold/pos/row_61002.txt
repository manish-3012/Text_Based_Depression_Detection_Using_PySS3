I don't know what to say I was applying to college the other day and all of a sudden I just started crying I don't know why but I just felt doomed and that it would have been better for me to just stop existing. My mother who was nearby (who grew up with a very narcissistic and controlling mother and had the same experience as my father) came over and asked me why I was crying. By then I was a mess I was almost in full sobs and my hand was shaking. When I tried to answer her I couldn't and just kept stuttering out the word "I" over and over again. I just couldn't move past it she kept getting frustrated with me (this has never happened before and to be clear she wasn't mad" this went on for a while until she just left me there and I eventually stopped. The past few days haven't been the same and I just feel like I'm making some sort of mistake constantly.
