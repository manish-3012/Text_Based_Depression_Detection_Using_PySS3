I accidentally scammed someone So me and this guy were trading in Rocket League, and if you buy Credits (the in game currency) then you canâ€™t trade those for 3 days) and we had our items lined up, then he didnâ€™t want it because it was not the exact type, so we traded back and I couldnâ€™t trade the credits back. Soo yea but we are gonna trade again after I can trade them and he will get his money back so at least I am fixing my  own problem lol
