Don't pretend to... Dont pretent to be depressed
Dont pretent to like someone just to mess with them
Dont pretent to cry in the school halls so you will get attention
Dont pretent to be friends with people
Dont pretent to be quirky and say "I'm just so quirky!"
Dont pretent to do drugs in the bathroom
Dont pretent to be the nerd
Dont pretent to have such a dramatic life
And don't pretend to care about a conversation over text

Thank you
