Throwback to that time my Alexa ordered a... ten-inch black dildo. On my parentsâ€™ account. 
TL;DR on bottom, but reading the full post is recommended to get the whole story.

Context: 

I was watching a YouTube video where a streamer has his viewers donate money to read text-to-speech messages. I happened to be watching said video right next to my Alexa, which for some reason I didnâ€™t consider even though the title implied it. (Small brain move, I know.) 

Anyways, I was watching the video for a few minutes, and eventually that part of the video came. I didnâ€™t think anything of it, until I heard an â€œOkay.â€ come from behind me. Words cannot explain the panic I felt as I tried to cancel it. I tried erasing everything on the Amazon shopping cart, and I thought I was in the clear. 

Days pass, nothing happens.

My dad knocks on my door and says, calmly (I know this is bad, because when heâ€™s really upset he speaks slowly and calmly), â€œCome out of your room.â€ Heart starts beating out of my chest, I know Iâ€™m dead, etc. Well, turns out that erasing the shopping cart only showed up on their phone, and now they know I was aware it happened. 

Now normally, I would lie here, but I was backed into a corner. I explain everything, and they tell me to â€˜just do the right thingâ€™, and send me off. Extremely tame for what I thought was going to happen, but it was one hell of a ride. Thanks for reading

TL;DR A YouTube video orders a dildo on my parentsâ€™ Amazon account, I try to cancel the order, they find out anyways, then are suspiciously tame and send me on my way. (Although now probably are suspicious of me)

Basically, the moral of the story is: mute or unplug your assistant before watching a YouTube video
