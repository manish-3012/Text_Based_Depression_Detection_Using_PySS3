So basically I am no longer able to play games anymore. So long story short my optometrist said that my eyes have been broken so bad that any prolonged screen time can damage my eyes very badly. He said It could blind me if I have way to much screen time. And on top of that my ear doctor said that my ear drums have been damaged so bad that any close/loud noise can deafen me. So in other words I'm no longer going to play games. And I swear to God I'm not kidding.
