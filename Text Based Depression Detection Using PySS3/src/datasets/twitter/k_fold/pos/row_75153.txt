That feeling when your school makes your first 9 weeks online and cancels all extracurricular activities . Damn. This sucks. I really thought being in a smaller rural school would triumph fear, but I guess the 60 year olds on the school board are too scared of the fucking virus to let us have a chance at a normal school year. Imagine working at something for 16 years and all of a sudden you can't go to school and you can't kick ass in golf. You can't cheer on your friends from the student section and yell FF at the top of your lungs and wake up the next day with a sore throat because you sang 100 bottles of beer on the wall in the rain on a rain delay. You can't hang out with your friends and teammates and go to Subway before a basketball game. You can't act like a dipshit and dress up as a squid in homecoming week. You can't hug your best friend after playing your guts out. You can't build a house out of celery in the cafeteria. I would rather get covid than not go to school all year. This fucking sucks
