I know this isn't r/dreaminterpretation but I got lucid and my dream was the matrix I had a dream where I saw the buddha in the sky. when the buddha came to the ground I started beating it up, it was a statue, not the actual buddha, pieces of green code broke off. eventually, the agents took me away. TL;DR go to bed earlier
