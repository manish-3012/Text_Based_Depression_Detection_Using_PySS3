I need help with a relationship issues. So basically, i think 3 of my close girl friends like me. One of them is a part time model and really cute, one is a red head with an amazing personality and also super cute, and the last is a feisty and short but really cute girl.  Theyâ€™ve all been dropping hints for the past couple months but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve been clueless and not been able to see, due to focusing on my final year at school and the gym and work. Us 3, plus my guy best friend always hangout together and they always argue with each other to hangout with me. What do I do. 

I need help. 

TL;DR 
Iâ€™m trapped in a love square I think. I need help.
