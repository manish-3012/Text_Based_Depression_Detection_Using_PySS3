my 2020 wrap up and 2021 goals~ you can too! i first wanna say what a crazy year with politics, breakups, love, lost, messy, sad experiences that only made me and you grow. we go through these things because it's part of life and without mistakes how are you supposed to grow and learn? mistakes are what make us human and it's really important we learn from mistakes so we don't make them again, we need to put our minds in a safer and healthier place for 2021 and get things done, and make this new year yours.

lets talk about some improvements I want to make and goals I have set for myself (this part will probably be edited if I come up with more, which I probably will)~

â€¢ staying up to pace with school
- I have always had a problem focusing on school work just because of how bad my adhd is, but this year I plan on finding natural ways of fixing my grades and paying attention better.

â€¢ bonding with my family
- me and my mom aren't the closest and it's always been that way even when I put the effort in to make us close, there's just always something missing. this up coming year I want to show my mom how successful I am becoming and maybe she could notice and I could get closer with her and fix our past for the present.

â€¢ start my book
- I have recently been thinking about writing a book, I had a job a few months ago that I sadly lost since I couldn't stay on top of my work. this job was going to make me an author and I was just completing the steps towards it, I believe I have potential and I'm passionate about my writing carrier. 

â€¢ watch all of jojo

â€¢ self care 1x a week
- I can't stress how self care is important in our lives, it's so important to take time to ourselves and treat us, it makes you mentally and physically feel so much better after you take a long bath with a face mask or a nice day at a spa. doing this once a week shows yourself appreciation and your basically telling yourself "you did good his week".

â€¢ workout consistently
- I love working out already but I have fallen behind in my academics and I jsut got so busy I lost track of my health. working out is a big part of my life and it makes me so much healthier and feel better. i have goals within this goal, but if you would like to learn more your free to leave a comment.

â€¢ eat 3 times a day, drink 120 oz of water a day
- you MUST eat 3 times a day with a snack or two in-between. in order for you to grow and get the nutrition you need you have to eat or it could mess up all kinds of stuff, which includes your mental and physical health. DRINK WATER NO EXCEPTIONS I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY.

â€¢ independency 
- all my life I have felt like I'm doing things for other people, or like I was made to help people or be what they want, which is not the case. i am my own person and I need to take care of myself and make the choices best for me, not you. i can't always count on people to be there for me either, I have to have my shoulder to cry on when something is wrong because not everyone is capable of being there for you, rememebr that.

â€¢ get my stupid license

okay I think I'm pretty much done with mine, but let's talk about you. do you have your goals set for this up coming year? if you don't, you should make your goals, it will leave you feel organized and prepared for the amazing and bright year you have ahead of you, thank you. :)

again if you have any questions about anything that I talk about feel free to leave a comment or DM me.
