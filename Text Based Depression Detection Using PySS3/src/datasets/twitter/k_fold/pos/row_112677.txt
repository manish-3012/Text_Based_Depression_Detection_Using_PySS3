September has not been my month Today my girlfriend now ex ended a almost 3 year relationship, had to pay 40$ out of my pocket for someone's meal because they were complaining and after I did, they threatened to have me fired for that 
I failed to kill myself on the 17th and I may end up working this month free because a manager forgot to apply my time so by law and contract I may not get paid this month my wifi got shut down yesterday but on the bright side of it all I found two 50 cent coins
