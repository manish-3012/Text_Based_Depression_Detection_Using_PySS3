Does anyone have some hugs left? Stupid 15 year old me traveled to luxemburg city on my own because i want to see more of europe and hoped to meet new people from my age at the hostel where im staying. But instead of having fun im sitting alone in my room feeling bad about everything. I could really use some hugs. Thanks.
