Is my sister racist? My sister (15) was standing in the kitchen and me and my mom were sitting at the table. We were watching a crime show and my mom says "he looks like he has bodies in his basement" my mom the says "wait is that racist" my mom knows it isn't I honestly don't know why she questioned herself. Anyways me and my sister are mixed (black and white) well my sister says "You can't be racist to white people" I look at her with the most wtf face and she looks at me with the most serious face and I say "That is literally the definition of racism" and she looks at me dumbfounded and my mom basically explains to her what racism is. Now I'm thinking like well umm my sister went to blm protests and this is why that shit isn't taken seriously. Now I'm pretty convinced that she is racist what do y'all think?
