I got expelled because I said "slatt" After seeing someone with a similar experience on r/playboicarti I would like to share my story

So around two weeks ago I was in school and I was talking to my friends and I said the word slatt which I use pretty regularly and ironically most of the time. but it the teacher heard me and thought I said slut or shit and the next thing ik I'm getting called into the principal's office. now it's basically my word against the teachers and even tho my friends had my back the principal didn't believe me.  apparently my teachers have heard me say slatt and have been like recording it down as me saying slut or something to bring it up wit the school and ig the principal had been reviewing security footage to try to find me saying "slatt" to fuck me over even more and now even tho in half of the audio clips you can clearly hear me say "slatt" the school still thinks that "slatt" means fuck or like a slur and that I was saying slut and shit too 

So now even without  any proof and the ppl who I was talking to backing me up Ive been placed on a half suspension half expulsion until they can bring it up with the school board 

Now my parents have listened to the audio clips and they think that its a  load of bullshit and they believe me they also know what slatt means.

So I basically got kicked out of school for sexual harassment and bullying even tho I only said slatt.

We're prob gonna sue the school if they kick me out officially
