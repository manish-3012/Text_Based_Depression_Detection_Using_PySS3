I support Trump I am libertarian, live in Russia, hate Putin and support Trump? Why? Because democrats destroy freedom, destroy reputation of USA elections and turn this system out to Russia. They're same with Â«United RussiaÂ» that mired in corruption and falsifying elections. Democrats are destroying independent mass media. Trump not the best choice but he saves USA from USSRing.
