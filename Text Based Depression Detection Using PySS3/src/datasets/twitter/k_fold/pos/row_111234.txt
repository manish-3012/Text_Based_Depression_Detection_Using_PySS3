My parents just found out how to see whos on the wifi network... Parental controls are the worst and I thought I would have privacy unlike a lot of other people, but I guess not anymore. My parents recently figured out how to see who is on the wifi network and for how long, so I'm going to have to go back to a lame 8:30 bedtime which is absolutely despise as well. I'm not in like 3rd grade anymore, can I at least stay up till nine or ten? So today is the last night I'm gonna be able to stay up. If my parents put on parental controls somehow I'm gonna scream. It's my phone, I should be able to have my own privacy, and my own stuff without my parents seeing everything. They wouldn't understand the jokes or a lot of the things I post or search, and I wouldn't have an explanation for them on most of it. (Nothing bad, mostly just dark jokes or inside jokes with my friends) so yeah.
