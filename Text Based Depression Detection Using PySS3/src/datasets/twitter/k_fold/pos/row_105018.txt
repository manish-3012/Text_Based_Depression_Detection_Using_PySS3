A finland fact for every day #54 There is this book called "the 7 brothers". It was written by Aleksis Kivi. The guy was really interesting and had some history, but that is brop for tommorrow. Anyway here is the most iconic part of the book, remember this takes its place in the medieval-reneissance times about.





The 7 brothers, ranging from 11-20 yars old, were quite dumb but they were really strong and athletic. So the boys were hunting, as they do that for a living.
Rifles and axes with them they went to the middle of the forest to hunt. They had quite a good game that day since they got a lot of meat. Until they heard noise behind them, they looked behind them and there were many angry bulls looking at them. (finland does not have that many bulls but ok) They ran away but the bulls kept running too, so bois had to drop all of their game to run faster. Happily the brothers found a big rock and climbed over it. But the bulls surrounded them, but the bois still had their rifles. They shot every single god-damn bull. Now it was evening, and the bois were hungry and all out of ammo. But now they had so much more game than before that the money and food would last at least for half a year.
