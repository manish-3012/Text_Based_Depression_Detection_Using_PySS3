Itâ€™s not just boys Iâ€™ve seen so many post on here about how boys are getting rejected by their crushes and shit. Iâ€™m sorry for them, they deserve better than to be insulted AND rejected. But I, as a girl who isnâ€™t THAT ugly, have gotten rejected by 5 guys... I didnâ€™t even like one of them. So at the end of the day, both genders get rejected. If you do get rejected, trust me youâ€™re going to find the right one for you! This is not a hate post or anything, itâ€™s just something that I felt like clarifying.
