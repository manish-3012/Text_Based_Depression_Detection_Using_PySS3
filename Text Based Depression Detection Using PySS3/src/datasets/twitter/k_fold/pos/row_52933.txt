I'll probably never tell my crush I love her. Just hear me out.

Me and her have been very close friends for a little over a year now. We didn't know eachother well at all but something told me to go to her. As it turned out, she was in the lowest part she's ever been in life. She had severe depression, acted on self harm and was addicted to painkillers. 

Slowly over time she stopped abusing prescription drugs and cutting herself. I was, and still am extremely proud of her for overcoming that rut. I'd like to think that me and her built her back up a much more confident, outgoing and overall happier person now than ever before. Though I couldn't say the same for myself.

I knew at the time that she just needed a friend, someone to guide her and that's exactly what I was. We had become extremely close friends over time, but all the same I was developing feelings for her. Of course, I never told her that. I only want to see her happy and I do everything in my power to make sure to help her in any possibly way I can to make her life easier. She deserves it all, anyway. I could never tell her I love her because I don't want to ruin the friendship we have. 

I'm positive she doesn't feel the same way because she's talked about her interests/standards in SO's. I never met any of them. I can't tell her because I don't want her to hurt or feel bad that she doesn't feel the same way. If I was the reason she was hurting about anything I'd hate myself for it. I plan on keeping these feelings from her as long as I possibly can, it's for the better.

Sorry if you find out by reading this and recognize my name somehow.
