Rant about my regrets (I have a lot) (and I'm only 15) I have so many regrets because I screw up so much. And I literally haven't been able to sleep recently because when I do all I think about is all the places I've screwed up and what could've happened if I wasn't an idiot. I make a lot of mistakes and I always think I'm right which is a bad mix when I dwell on every little mistake I make. Idk though. I've gotten past the suicide thoughts (mostly) but I just always feel like a dissapotment and that the world would probably be better without me anyway. I do way more harm then I do good anyway. idk tho, I just don't know anymore.
