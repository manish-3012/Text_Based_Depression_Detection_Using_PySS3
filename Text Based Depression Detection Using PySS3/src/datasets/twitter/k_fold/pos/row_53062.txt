Halloween costume idea Ok so, the costume itâ€™s self isnâ€™t very original, but the things you do while wearing it is what makes it good

So basically, a medieval plague doctor, BUT, while wearing the costume (if people decide to trick or treat) stand or sit at the side of the road with a clipboard or notepad writing things down and pointing and nodding at people not social distancing

Itâ€™s even better if you carry a medieval doctors bag with you
