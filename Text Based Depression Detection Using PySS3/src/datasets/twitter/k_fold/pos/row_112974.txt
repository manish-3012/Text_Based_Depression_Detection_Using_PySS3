Tell me about what you think about before falling asleep Yes, so I go first alright? Alright!

I think about how my medical entrance exam is gonna go, I think about the talk I had with my bf that day (ldr), I think about the things I did in the day, I think about how humans are weird af and how I came into existence and how everything started and how long am I gonna live for and what I ate during the day and how my dog is getting old and how I've become so much elder (like 19!) And how y'all gonna answer this question
