Am I the only person who likes online learning better? Idk i just like it more I get to eat food from my house instead of school lunch. The bathroom isnâ€™t fucking disgusting if I donâ€™t feel like doing anything that day I can turn my cam and mic off I can get food in between class If I donâ€™t want to I can choose to not intact with my classmates at all. Idk man itâ€™s pretty great for me
