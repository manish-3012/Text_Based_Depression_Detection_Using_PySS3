Am I rich? All of my friends call me rich but o donâ€™t know if itâ€™s true or not...

First of all let me acknowledge the fact you that I know that there are people so much less well off than me in the world and i greatly appreciate that I have a house and a dog and all of that

But the thing that gets under my skin the most is when my friends call me a â€˜spoiled rich kidâ€™ which I donâ€™t know if it is true or not so I was wandering if you could help me...

My mum and dad never revealed to me how much they earn but letâ€™s start off with that I live in a nice area in a three bedroom house with a mortgage (my mum and dad have been paying it off for 14 years now) I go to a free school but we wear ties and stuff and I hate it because it makes us all look entitled. I get Â£10 a week in my own money and normally get around 8 presents at Christmas (which means my mum and dad canâ€™t afford to really do anything until March the next year) and I normally go on holiday to a caravan site once a year

I know that I am privelaged but itâ€™s the fact that they say I am spoiled is what I donâ€™t like...

Thanks! :)
