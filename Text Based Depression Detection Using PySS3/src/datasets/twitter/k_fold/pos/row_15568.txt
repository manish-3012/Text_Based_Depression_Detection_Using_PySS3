I willingly wore a dress for the first time and I'm kinda proud of myself I always had a problem with my body image, the only instances where I'd wear a dress is my school uniform and or dinner parties, but even then it's my parents that would make me wear a dress because "I should act like a girl".

Today I decided to put on a dress because I thought it's the day to do it. And I'm so happy. It may be a small thing to most, but it feels like a big milestone for me. Thank you for listening :)
