Labels can be dangerous Just a random 4am thought, scroll on. So I was reading some wiki article about humanism and anti humanism and a reddit thread about star trek's philosophy and it got me thinking about how labels can be dangerous to shaping our thoughts.

People like to label themselves, they could call themselves a humanist, a nihilist, an existentialist, a communist, a conservative, a democrat, an anarchist, etc. Even labels like 'outcast', 'stupid', 'the straight a student', etc.

And the problem with those labels is that people tend to get too attached to the label itself, trying to fit themselves into a box and forget how to think for themselves.

You call yourself a nihilist or an existentialist, and obess over the label itself. You try to fit into that description of a certain philosophy. And you forget how to question some aspects of your label, and truely think for yourself.

Perhaps this is a better example than the former paragraph. You treat people like they're idiots, and people will become one. You treat them like intelligent good people, and they'll strive towards becoming one.

I'm not saying certain labels are bad, but what I'm trying say is that those don't define you and sometimes you focus too much on those lofty ideals and you forget what's really important.
