OMG! my hardwork paid off For the past 2 months, I have been tutoring my 21 year old sister for her IELTS exam. AND SHE SCORED OVERALL 8 BANDS!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 

People pay sooooo much and study for a whole year just to score as much as she did!!! 

I'm more proud of myself than I am of her. She's literally intolerable bruh
