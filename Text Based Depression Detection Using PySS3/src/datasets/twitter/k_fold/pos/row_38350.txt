A little message to any teenager out there whoâ€™s curious. If youâ€™re curious about your sexuality because youâ€™ve been told that itâ€™s wrong to be Trans, Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, etc, donâ€™t listen to that. You are valid and I believe that you all belong in this world. The way Iâ€™ve been raised, your sexuality doesnâ€™t matter as long as you are good and kind to you partner and that you love them, and that youâ€™re not hurting anyone. I respect all of you, and I hope you get with friends that accept you if your family doesnâ€™t. Also, if youâ€™re worried about coming out, you donâ€™t have a due date for that. Just do it when you think the time is right. Love you all. Stay safe and wear a mask. ðŸ³ï¸â€ðŸŒˆ
