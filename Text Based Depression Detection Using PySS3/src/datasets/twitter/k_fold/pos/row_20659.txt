So this girl is sending me mixed signals I think, I need some outside input on this one So I've been friends with this girl for years, but only recently (as in the past year or so) have been talking to her constantly. We've been talking in all caps for months just as a joke, she often tells me she misses me, and we were sending emojis back and forth in batches and she sent a ðŸ˜˜ emoji. But at the same time she calls me her best friend, and said on her snap a couple months back that she wasn't looking to date.






Seeing as I'm socially inept, I figured I'd get input on it from outside perspectives. I don't want to ruin our friendship but idk if shes into me or not. Thoughts? Am I looking too far into this?
