You know, I can't get a thing off my mind I'm just as confused in guys' feelings as guys are confused about girls' feelings lol

But if a guy tells you you're his happiness, but then says that he's happy with you because helping others is his happiness, wtf does that mean

Do you like the time with me or are you talking with me just because I have issues, or am I just overthinking this??
