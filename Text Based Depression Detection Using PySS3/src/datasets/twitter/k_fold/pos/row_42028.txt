I donâ€™t know what to do :/ So yeah. My life is about to change a lot. My family is basically getting deported and we gonna go back to Mexico.  It just feels so surreal. I feel like Iâ€™m not gonna fit in at all. Iâ€™m pretty introverted, dislike parties, music. Ima feel like an outsider and itâ€™s just making me feel like shit. Plus not to mention Iâ€™m not even sure if we are going to live in a safe area. Iâ€™m always gonna be thinking of getting kidnapped by some cartels freaks.
