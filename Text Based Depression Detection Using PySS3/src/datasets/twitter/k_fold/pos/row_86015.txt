My take on religion This post is to express *my* personal views, and I do not wish any ill meaning toward any group of people.

Gods and Deityâ€™s do exist-Millions of people will them to be, so whose to say that these invisible beings donâ€™t have some control over the world just through sheer Thought power. I mean, letâ€™s take the Christian God for an example. While there are disagreements within Christianity? They all share a similar cod of rules and idea of god. Through their collective thoughts of God, he exists. Christians believe certain this are wrong because God told them so. They believe it, and so he definitely has an influence over the world. 

You can take this and apply it to just about any dirty or god you want to. So by this thought process, **all** gods and Deityâ€™s exist.

Now, About me. I am not religious, but kinda spiritual. I be live their are forces at be in the world greater than science can explain, but I also donâ€™t want to serve them/worship them. I am a good person with good morals by most standards, and donâ€™t need a book to tell me so. If an afterlife exists and I donâ€™t make it there, oh well. I gain no more enjoyment of life by knowing thereâ€™s a being watching over me telling me to act a certain way-In fact, I enjoyed life less when I believed god for a fact existed. By living for my own purposes and spirit feels so much better to me. 

Again, I am not trying to debunk anyoneâ€™s beliefs, just sharing mine. I hope you can share some of yours too.
