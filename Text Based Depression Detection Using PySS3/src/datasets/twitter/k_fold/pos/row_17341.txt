I finally told him My dad has been making jokes that I'm autistic just cause I don't like being touched. He calls me autistic and when I get annoyed starts touching me. He sees this as just a joke but I've hated it since day one. He did it again to me today and I started crying. I haven't cried in a VERY long time. I told him he's gotta stop and I'm like 90% sure he tried to make a joke of it and got annoyed when I was still annoyed at him. The fact that my own father brought me to tears should've shown him that he shouldn't have made a joke. I swear if he continues making these jokes imma be so angry.
