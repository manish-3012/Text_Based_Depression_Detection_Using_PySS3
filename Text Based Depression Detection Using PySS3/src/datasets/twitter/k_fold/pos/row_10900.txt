Madan's fact of the day #29 Sex reduces stress. On top of obvious physical benefits,[ research shows](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051105000736)Â that getting busy calms nerves, lowers blood pressure, and reduces stress.

Thats why you guys are so stressed all the time. Because you are all virgins.
