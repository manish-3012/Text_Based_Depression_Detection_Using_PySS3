How did my life become to this? Just in 2 years everything went such downhill, i know depressed teens are a meme but fuck I genuinely feel bad right now

Everything i once enjoyed is now a pain in the back to do. I donâ€™t really enjoy anything anymore... 

And my social axienty i developed is so fucking bad i lost friends and am lonely in general... i dont feel loved and only hated 

My home situation sucks too

And i almost love nobody anymore, maybe a few in my family but i lost all hope for love and i probably will never find love anyway 

I just wanna go to to the old days but that aient possible, just the inevitable passing of time leading us to our inevitable death
