Just realized the Hype House has no diversity at all. I'm certainly not a social justice warrior, and I am certainly not an avid TikTok user, but I did notice how the Hype House has no diversity at all. I just really started paying attention to other TikTok creators (besides the art ones) die to all these posts about it, and I came upon the Hype House.

Of course, the members do have the right to have an all white crew, but in the context of what they are supposed to be, I find it quite interesting that they have no people besides white people in the house. I don't use TikTok except for art videos, so maybe I'm wrong, but are there *no* Asian, Black, Latino, Middle Eastern, or any other ethnicities that are thriving on the app to the same extent?

 I go to their Instagram page, and they have a BLM post selling hoodies &amp; shirts. While I don't think anything is wrong with that(as they were claiming that the profits would only go to charity), I cannot help but feel as though that was a virtue signaling act. Why not just donate money directly? 

Man idk, but I'm pretty sure on of their members said the N word too, that little hoodie guy I think. I also think about how most of them got famous, and it makes me cringe a little. 

What are you all's thoughts?
