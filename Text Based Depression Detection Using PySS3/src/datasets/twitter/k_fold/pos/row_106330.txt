am i even attractive? i donâ€™t know why but for these past few days, iâ€™ve been feeling a lot worse about being single or lacking any romantic experience. iâ€™m fifteen, and i havenâ€™t been involved with anyone romantically. no one has ever had a crush on me before either (i know this for a fact because everyone in my old school didnâ€™t like me, and the people at my high school only see me as a friend). it just hurts my self-esteem and confidence a lot because all my friends have been seen as attractive/potential lover by both other people and my other friends while iâ€™m just,,,there. my friends talk about their previous relationships/people who have been interested in them, and thatâ€™s never happened to be me. before the past few weeks, iâ€™ve been pretty confident in myself, but, i guess without evidence of other people seeing me as attractive, my confidence has been waning. i think itâ€™s my ignorance that sent me down this spiral. starting high school, i just got this surge of confidence out of nowhere and found myself somewhat attractive for the first time in a long time. iâ€™ve felt that way for the past year until now (iâ€™m a sophomore/10th grader now). i still think i could be attractive, but now,,,i donâ€™t think i am to others, which hurts. i also donâ€™t understand really,,,am i doing something wrong (not to say that everyone else is wrong in some way!)? i donâ€™t know,,,i just wanted to rant about this to someone who doesnâ€™t know me at all, and, if you read this whole stupid paragraph, thank you ðŸ’–
