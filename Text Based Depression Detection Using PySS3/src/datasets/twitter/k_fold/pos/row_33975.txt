I FEEL SO DISGUSTED AT WHAT I HEARD WHILE I WAS IN THE BATHROOM I (17yo black guy) was in the bathroom stall taking a number one because the urinals were full and I hear a lot of people by the sinks saying the N WORD (HARD R) and I walked out of the stall and it was a bunch of white guys and by that time they realIzed that I heard it and they stood there shocked with no words I just washed my hands and walked out.
