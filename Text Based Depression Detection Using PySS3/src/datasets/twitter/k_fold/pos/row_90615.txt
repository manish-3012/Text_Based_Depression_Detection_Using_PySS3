Facts about me every day. Day 9. My opinion on norse countries. My favorite of them is Sweden because it has some of my favorite people including Pewdiepie, Ingrid GarcÃ­a-Jonsson and Alfred nobel. They also invented the zipper and the AB cream separator. I also like the fjords and I'd love to go there sometime. I love the fact that they are really advanced countries and I've always been told that I should go there because I have blue eyes and I am completely different from the people in my country and more similar to their "dry" personality.
