My mom just told my teacher tmi So my teacher called to talk about my grade and tell me where to find makeup assignments and my mom says "Well she needs mental heellpp and physical help, I've been trying to help her but she doesn't cooperate. There has to be something wrong "
1st of all, who are you trying to help? You make my life worse.  2nd of all, the teacher wasn't fucking calling for all of that, poor guy didn't know what to say they just said "I'm focusing on her grade right now" but if I confront her about I get hit or yelled at.  she's such a bitch.
