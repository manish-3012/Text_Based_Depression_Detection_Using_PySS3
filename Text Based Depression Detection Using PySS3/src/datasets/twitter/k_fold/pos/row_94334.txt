Reposting my own story until my brain calms down part1. (14M) I don't know if this is a cry for help, me asking for advice, or just a rant but I've got a bit of a situation. This is going to be long.

So me and my crush have been very close to me for about 7 years. We have always trusted each other for advice, secrets, rants, good times, and great memories. The list is almost endless. So we have been spending more time together in the last two years. 

A few days back I made a few posts about how wanted to ask out my crush but didn't know how. I couldn't do it. I realized that I wanted to wait before I got in an actual relationship. 

At first it was me just biking over to the family diner in the middle of town once a week. Then we started going over to each other's houses to hang out for a few hours and then leave. A few hours turned into almost a whole day. This weekend I have spent a total of 32 hours with her. I had a ton of stuff to do on Friday and it took all day. On Saturday I went to her house on a bike on Saturday at 3PM. At 11pm Sunday I got back. 

We had been making plans for me to stay the night at her house for months. She had been begging me to stay for a few weeks. When I got there we hung out for a few hours and then built a blanket fort. I know that that sounds childish, dont knock it until you try it. The plan was to sleep in the blanket fort last night. We decided to sleep next to each other that night. During the night we realized that the fort was a lot smaller than we thought it was. We ended up sharing a pillow and basically cuddled for 12 hours while listening to creepypasta. 

Neither of us actually slept but we did dose off a couple of times. The night almost felt like it didn't happen. I was in a in between state of consciousness and could sense everything around me but couldn't move. I finally came to and realized that she was asleep and buried her head into my shoulder. She was basically using me as a pillow. I just snuggled up next to her and tried to fall asleep. 

We decided to give up on sleeping at about 3PM. We took the dogs on a walk and played mincraft for a couple hours. After nightfall we decided to go look at Christmas lights. My family picked us up and we went to a local park that has lights up. After we got back she had dinner with me and my family. 

I think I want to wait a couple years until I actually date her. I want to be able to get a house, a car, and a job and have her move in to get her from her shitty home life. She has an emotionaly abusive dad who has some pretty stupid political views. He believes that depression is a cult and that cutting is a way to worship that entity. 

She has admitted to having feelings for me. I feel the same way about her but I don't think it's the right time.
