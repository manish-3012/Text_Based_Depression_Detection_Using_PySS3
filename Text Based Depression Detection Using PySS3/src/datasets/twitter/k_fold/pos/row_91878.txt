So yeah, im a fucking piece of shit Thought it would be funny to randomly pour kissel on my friend's hair. I have this negative trait where i sometimes act without thinking of the consoquenses.

Now im pretty sure he hates me for the time being. Why am i like this? Am i a fucking middle-school? Because that's how i acted today.
