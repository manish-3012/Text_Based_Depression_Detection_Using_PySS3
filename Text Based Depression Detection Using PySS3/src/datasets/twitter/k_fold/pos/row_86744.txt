I have applied what I learnt Somewhere I saw that  the secret to eternal happiness is to not argue with fools. I have been doing it a lot since the past few days because my brother always objects basically everything regarding what I do (even though he is fucking younger than me). Even when I prove him wrong most of the time, he just doesn't want to admit it. 

Now, everytime he tries to make a point I just say 'yeah, you're right'.  For the first few times he actually thought he was right but now when I say it to him, he fully understands that I am trying to say "fuck off" and I just love the look on his face. Hahahaha, Ik I am evil but goddamn I had to share this because he now kind of understands his place.
