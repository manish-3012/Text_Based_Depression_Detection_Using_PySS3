Ever just doing something simple and then all of a sudden you feel like you're just gonna float out of your body Your breathing slows a little bit, you feel a little light, but then you hear a noise or your train of thought iis interrupted and you snap back into reality. I get that feeling sometimes. 

Maybe I'm just going insane. 


Also I soemtimes forget what class I'm in and get confused when I look at my schedule and sometimes I forget or start to worry if I'm sleeping and what I'm experiencing is just a boring dream....I need sleep.
