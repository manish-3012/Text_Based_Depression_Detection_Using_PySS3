I feel kinda emotionally screwed right now I wish I could find a guy that would actually treat me right and not turn out to be trash. CUZ I KNOW GOOD GUYS ARE OUT THERE! Iâ€™ve had two serious boyfriends, one lied to me and dumped me only for me to find out he was actually cheating, and then my second most recent decided to flirt and sexualize my 14 year old sister and she came crying to me cuz she was uncomfortable, so I dumped him.

Iâ€™ve had guys hit me up and show interest, but most of the time they only wanna be fwb, or just wanna make sexual comments about me.

Thank you for letting me rant and I hope you have an amazing night :)
