My crippling Among Us addiction has ruined my life. Hello, I am a 14 year old boy living in Nevada, and I have a crippling addiction to the game titled as "Among Us". I first began my journey into Among us on January, 2019. I instantly became addicted, I was playing Among Us 24/7 every day of the week for about 6 months, until my parents decided to intervene. They grounded me, and then they sent me to my grandma's house with limited technology throughout my summer break, as a way to ween me off of Among Us. During my summer break I was suffering from intense anxiety, and depression, suicide plagued my mind as I was begging god to let me play Among Us with him in heaven. Everywhere I went, I always saw Among Us, Lego pieces, fire alarms, trash bins, I couldn't get Among Us off of my mind. My grandma found me unconscious on the floor after a failed suicide attempt, she dialed emergency services and eventually the paramedics came to take me to the ER. 

My parents decided to put me in therapy, I told my therapist everything, and I am still currently seeing a therapist. My doctor prescribed me Escitalopram and buspirone to treat my anxiety and depression. Everything was going fine and I felt my life was going to turn around, but then I relapsed. I hesitantly opened Among Us up after not playing for 2 months and went to town. I played for 2 weeks straight, with my stats on Among us peaking around 4000 hours. My parents found out and they took my computer away. I went through an intense psychotic episode for 1 entire week, I was convinced that I was an innocent crew member, about to be ejected for being sus, I did not trust anyone during that 1 week. After a second trip to the ER and several therapy appointments, here I am. I am completely lost in life, all of my friends have left me, my family is losing hope, and I am contemplating suicide due to the fact that I cannot play Among Us anymore.
