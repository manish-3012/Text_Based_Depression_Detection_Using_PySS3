Ik most of yall dont know me and wont care but I'm gonna temporarily delete reddit Idk, I'm really kinda at a bad point in life and I'm kind of lost and reddit sure as fuck ain't helping. So I'm temporarily deleting it. Will I download it again? Maybe, which is why I'm not deleting my account. But I might not, who knows. All ik is I need time for myself and to kinda "find myself" again. So I'm making this post for anybody that I might be texting or someone who's familiar with me just so u know why I kinda vanished lol. I'm mostly focused on posting this to my profile but i think I'll post it to r/teenagers too since I'm quite active there

Goodbye for now...
