I JUST GOT A BOYFRIEND! not many people probably care, but i've been struggling with my self worth n thought i would be alone for a really long time. my depression has been really bad this year because for so long no one was around me n i felt worthless.

i then met this wonderful guy on AMONG US (yes u read that right) n life is so good. he cares for me n makes sure im happy. i didn't meet him too long ago, but i really like him. i feel like im gonna muck things up n ruin everything - but im still so happy!

thank u for coming to my ted talk, i just needed to get that off my chest
