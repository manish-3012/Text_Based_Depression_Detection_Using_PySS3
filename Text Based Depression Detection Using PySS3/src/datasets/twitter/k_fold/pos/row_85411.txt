Technically teenagers are night guard s Bear with me for a moment 

You have to constantly pause what you're doing for a moment too listen for footsteps

When your parents walk in you have to close the window

When your parents wake up at 2 am and you're still awake you have to switch to an educational website pretending you're doing school work
