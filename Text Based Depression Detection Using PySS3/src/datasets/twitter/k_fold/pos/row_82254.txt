I'm tired of going to bed every night empty and depressed Every day I waste doing nothing. I miss school. I miss laughing with people and flirting with cute girls. I miss having a reason to wake up and listening to music on the bus ride to school. I miss going to bed, exited for the next day, setting goals for myself socially and getting better at socializing with people. 

God I fucking hate quarentine. My relationship with my family is shit. At home I have nothing, my routine used to be school and videogames, escaping from reality and I loved it. Now I struggle with depression, relationship problems, sleep problems, and lack of motivation to get out of bed and live. It's all just arguments and threats from my mom and my annoying sister.

They recently announced that school will be closed until circumstances change, so there's no hope of escaping this anytime soon. Say what you will about coronavirus cases but extending quarentine this long has been an incredibly stupid move by the government. 

I already know y'all are going to tell me to visit a mental health professional, and I honestly wish I could, but I don't have access to one, and Even if I did it would be way too expensive

I just want it to end, one way or another.
