I feel like total shit, I'm sad and lonely Sometimes I get these bouts of loneliness where I just feel like completely shit and I'll never find love because I've been constantly put down for my family, my looks, my weight and my mental health. Everyone is leaps and bounds ahead of me in all of these things, only thing is that I'm quite smart and slightly taller than average, every girl I've asked out has rejected me and they blocked me on all social medias and it just hurts. I feel like I'm never gonna have anyone to love or share my life with. Does anyone have advice except for play video games to get your mind off it
