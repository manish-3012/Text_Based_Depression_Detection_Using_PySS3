I start high school in a few days I start high school in exactly 16 days, and I have some questions. 

I wouldn't say I'm scared of high school itself, more the social hierarchy inside it. Like I'm not worried about the other grade 9's, they're in the same boat as me. I'm worried about the grade 10, 11 and 12's.  I don't want to get in anyone's way.  To sum this whole post up, its a big change, and I need advice. Like how do I act?  What are the do's and don't s? Any comment of advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
