Should I buy a gaming pc?? Im looking to get a pc, mostly for general use and editing photos/videos/music stuff (the only gaming I do is Minecraft, among us, and occasionally league of legends), but I canâ€™t figure out if a gaming pc would be a waste of my money or not. I have a budget of $500 ish, and according to google thereâ€™s a bunch of decent prebuilt gaming pcs for that price, but I know almost nothing about computers and what specs r good, so idk if Iâ€™d just be better off getting a generic dell pc or something.
