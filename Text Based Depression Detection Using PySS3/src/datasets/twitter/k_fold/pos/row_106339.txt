I'm pretty sure im not okay right now I was texting a guy I'm friends with, and as a joke i asked him if he had a crush on me. I really meant it as a joke because of the context. He just typed in a: "Yeah, so?"

I was already freaking out over that, and he kept making fun of me saying "I bet you're blushing." and "I know you're either laughing or just crying in embarrassment." and he was SO RIGHT! 

Then i asked him a question and he replied: "Listen, honey." 

And holy shit, I am like so sure that turned me on. WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO
