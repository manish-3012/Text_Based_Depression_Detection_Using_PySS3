Is this weird Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

U know

Crushes type things

Sheâ€™s cute, thick but that isnt the point of this post

Well listen, i already liked her for years now.

She has some friends iknow but they always disliked me and ignored me on social media.

Since a while her friends started to act super kind to me and all of a sudden they dont ignore me anymore and they dont dislike me.

My crush prob still doenst like me but this is kinda sus.
