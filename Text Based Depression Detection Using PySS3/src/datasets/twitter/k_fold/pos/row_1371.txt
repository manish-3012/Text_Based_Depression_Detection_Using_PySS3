How to hide cuts from your parents I always used to cut myself under my watch but this time I've gone really deep and I don't think I will be able to go swimming tomorrow like this. I am very scared because while it's not a lot of blood, it will probably be really hard to hide from my parents. I didn't hit a visible(big) vein and it doesn't hurt as much as I want it to but I am really scared. I think I might break down tmr imploring my mom to not let me go to the swimming pool. I am short and going to the swimming pool is my mom's first priority.  I put some paper under my watch over the cur and really tightened it. Please give me a suggestion on how to convince my mom to not get me to the swimming pool. Should I cut myself in a place other than my wrist(like cut my pinky finger off or some shit) and show my mom? It doesn't hurt, I do shit like this daily and I even inject growth hormones in my thigh. Cutting doesn't hurt me

Edit: It's like skin deep. I can see what's under the skin pretty clearly but I didn't cut under the skin. LIke I can still move my fingers and shit, it's like a thin yellow-clear skin under here. I will probably have some stretch marks after this. I don't think I need to stitch or some shit
