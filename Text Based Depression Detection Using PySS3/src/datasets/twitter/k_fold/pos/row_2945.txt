Try hards should stop making games shitty , or maybe a ranking system is the move Like theyâ€™d be playing a game 24/7 because they donâ€™t have a life , and ruin everyoneâ€™s fun. Some may not agree with me but , like If I just got back from school and I wanna play fall guys and try hards keep ruining the game and wining every game like its their last game ever playing like their lives depends on it. And Im here like wtf is he on. Or games should seriously consider ranking systems. 


Im not here cuz im sad that theyâ€™re better than me bcz ofc they are ,they have more time spent playing the game and I have stuff to do on a daily basis meanwhile their only goal in life is to win every single game.
