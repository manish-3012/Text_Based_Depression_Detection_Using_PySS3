I went on a date last night, and it ended with... Repost because I accidentally deleted the other one

I found this girl on a dating app that turned out to be real (I know, shocker). We both go to the same college, so after a few days of talking I asked if she wanted to go on a date. She said yes immediately. We went out to get food (I saw some people from my old school there and tried to avoid them lol), and she refused to let me pay for her food (we used money that our school gave us, so it wasn't her own money per say). We sat and ate for a while and then went to the outdoor area.

At the outdoor area, we sat and just talked about literally anything for about an hour. Eventually, the benches we were sitting on became uncomfortable so we started walking around campus, again talking about anything. Even if there were breaks in the conversation, her smile always inspired me to think of a new subject. This continued for about another hour.

After this, she said that she needed to go back to her dorm to do laundry (we had been out for about 3 hours). I insisted that I walk her home because it was cold, but somehow it turned into her dropping me off at my place. Before I got out of the car, I asked how dates ended (this was my first ever date). She said however you wanted it to end, and I reached in for a hug. While we were awkwardly hugging over the center console in her Jeep, she unexpectedly kissed me on my cheek. I was shocked because this had never happened to me before.

I now realize that I should've kissed her back or given her a more legit hug, but I was a rookie and in shock. We have a second date scheduled for Saturday.

See guys, if I can go on a date with someone, anyone can.
