Anyone been to college? Whatâ€™s it like having zero friends to start. Iâ€™m not even nervous, Iâ€™m already lonely rn and if I start college lonely too, I might go insane Itâ€™s like ugh, I really have to put more effort into making friends again? Once I put myself out there Iâ€™ll just get stomped all over. God please spare me more rejection
