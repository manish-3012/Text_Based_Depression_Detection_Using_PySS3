I failed and I killed someone They were really suicidal I wasnâ€™t strong enough 
 I couldnâ€™t help them No matter how hard I try all they wanted was to end themselves. 


Iâ€™m a terrible human being. I killed someone. Itâ€™s my fault. Iâ€™m a murder. I canâ€™t help anyone. I wish I could just save them, I wanted to help but I failed. What do I do now. Please I canâ€™t be alone but I deserve it
