I asked my best friend out and she said yes! (Ima call her Red btw) So Red was the very first friend I made when I moved to my new school. She decided â€œhey Iâ€™m gonna go introduce myself to the new guyâ€ flash forward 6 years later and weâ€™re always acting like we are in a relationship. She was there for me when I almost committed die, and I was there for Red when her homecoming date ditched her.

I finally asked Red out after mustering up the courage to do it. She said yes very excitedly and gave me a massive hug! I mean Iâ€™m a bit defective with my ADHD, Bipolar Depression, Anxiety, and the voices in my head. She understands that Iâ€™ve been through a lot of stuff and that itâ€™ll be hard for me to open up. But Red is willing to try. 

Iâ€™m taking her to the movies and our favorite arcade this weekend as a â€œfirstâ€ date. Itâ€™s pretty much like the rest of the times we did stuff together. Iâ€™m thinking about telling some more of the stories me and Red have together. Including the homecoming one
