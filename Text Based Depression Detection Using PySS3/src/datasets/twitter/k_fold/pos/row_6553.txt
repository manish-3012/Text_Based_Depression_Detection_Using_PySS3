Friends are weird. My friend  once dated a girl with low self esteem. She cheated on her, lied to her, continued the relationship even though she liked someone else. Now she didn't physically cheat, she emotionally cheated. Which to me is by far worst. What's worse is that she already knew how self hating her gf was but still continued to make moves on another girl which was already in a relationship.  Her gf knew this and you know what she did? She said "Even if its true I know I'm in love." Girl the hell?  Sorry sweetheart but that's not love that's stupidity. Though I guess love is blind. They broke up cause the gf cheated and dated a different depressed girl. So my friend sobbed a bit then went to set her eyes on another  low self esteem girl she liked that just broke up with her ex. Damn she really has weird taste in girls.
