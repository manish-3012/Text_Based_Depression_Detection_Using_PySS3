ITS MY GF'S BDAY, WISH HER!!! HER USERNAME IS U/CHEY1527. She is the most exquisite person in the whole world. There is simply no one else who can compare to her at all, not even come close. She is so unbelievably, jaw dropping gorgeous.

Like for some messed up reason, she doesn't seem to realize just how damn beautiful she really is. But in actuality, she is better than any supermodel to have ever existed. She blends the lines between cute(like cuter than puppies, other girl, anything really), beautiful(like a majestic beautiful, like royal family beautiful), and yet super hot.

But more important than that is her irreplaceable personality. She is so so so effortlessly adorable with her infatuation of stuffed animals, yet her attitude is so amazing. I care about her more than anyone i have ever met. She is so kind and helpful with her friends, and yet really sassy and funny. Not to mention that she is scary smart. I love her nerdiness, her rants, just her.  The way she gets embarrassed, her odd humor, her dedication to SkyBlock. I feel in pain, when she is in pain. She's perfect for me. I love you Ava. So much. I want to be with you for the rest o my life. 

So if you could please send her a quick DM or comment her birthday, that would mean everything to me(and her) :) Thanks
