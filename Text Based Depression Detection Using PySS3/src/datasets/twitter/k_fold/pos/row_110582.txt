Anyone who says wearing a mask cuts off oxygen is full of it. Sorry for format I am on mobile 
 Me and my football team just finished â€œhell weekâ€ wearing mask the entire time. For those who donâ€™t know what hell week is, it is 8 hours a day, 7 days of non stop exercises and working out with your team before the season starts. We had to wear masks the entire time and if you were to take it off, you would have to do 25 push-ups. After the first day I could barley tell that the mask was there. I hear Karenâ€™s (my mom) say that they can barley breath after walking around the grocery store with a mask on.  Oh yeah, if it matters, I live in Texas and it was about 110 f outside. Stop complaining about having to wear a mask please.
