This damn house My mother came home sick yesterday. There were like 10 people where she works that have the virus so she KNEW she could've had it. What did she do after being sent home yesterday? She stayed in the living room where everyone in the house has to go to do anything. Now we all probably have it and she's just saying "ThErE's NoThInG i CoUlD'vE dOnE, i AlReAdY eXpOsEd YoU tO iT". Anyone want a new mother because I'm willing to trade mine for a pile of rocks. Or smashed rocks
