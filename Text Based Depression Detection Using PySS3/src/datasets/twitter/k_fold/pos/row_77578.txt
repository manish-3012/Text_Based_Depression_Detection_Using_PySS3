When I see someone try and pickup a girl on here itâ€™s literal cringe Like the â€œhey DM Meâ€ â€œoh youâ€™re single too? ðŸ˜‰â€, i just canâ€™t help but cringe. 

Letâ€™s be real, you need to stop simping if youâ€™re actually one of those people and do something productive with your life, as right now itâ€™s just cringe.

Anyways have a nice day or night
