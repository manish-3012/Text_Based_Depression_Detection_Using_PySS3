Sometimes I wish I was rich just so i could do so much dumb crap, like seriously If I had the money I would rent billboards and post the â€œGary please come homeâ€ signs literally everywhere. Then I would make a bunch of 5 second adâ€™s to post on yt. Like the ad would just be Patrick saying â€œI love youâ€ then it immediately cuts off then proceeds to the video you were trying to watch. Does that not sound like a good idea??
