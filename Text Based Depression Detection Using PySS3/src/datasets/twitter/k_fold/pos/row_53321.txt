Ima need some financial advice from you fine people Because not all of you play video games, Iâ€™ll put it into context everybody can understand and Iâ€™ll give all necessary details

I have Â£175 and I have no job (Iâ€™m 16)

There are three subscription services for my Xbox. Xbox live gold, Xbox game pass and Game Pass Ultimate 

Xbox Live Gold is necessary for you to play online games and itâ€™s Â£60 a year

Xbox game pass is Â£8 a month, with it giving you access to 200+ games as long as you have the subscription

Game Pass ultimate is both of these and it costs Â£11 a month 

My Game pass ultimate will run out in 6 days and as of now, I only really play two games from the game pass, with most not currently downloaded being games Iâ€™ve already played/not interested in

Both of these games cost Â£17 each with one being on sale, originally priced at Â£25 (Itâ€™ll run out in 5 days)

Now because I have many online games, Iâ€™m going to get some form of Xbox live but should I do it through game pass ultimate or Xbox live gold?

So either have game pass ultimate, letting me play online and have access to 200+ games (some I may revisit?) or buy the two games I know Iâ€™ll play often and go with Xbox Live Gold which is cheaper in the long term?

Sorry for such a long post, wanted to make sure advice is informed lol
