I had a very creepy dream, in which I saw something that looked exactly like me sleeping, does anyone know what it might mean? Basically in my creepy dream, I was myself and I was in my room and I saw a thing that looked exactly like me sleeping. For some reason, I hugged the thing that looked like me while it was sleeping and it didnâ€™t wake up. It was sleeping on the end of my bed in a curled up position. I was creeped out by the thing, I didnâ€™t know if the thing intended to hurt me or if it was nice. Then I was in bed with the thing near my feat still sleeping in the same position. Soon, it disappeared and I got incredibly scared and started trying to calm down. Then, still panicking, I was in the kitchen trying to calm down when another thing came up to me. It looked like my mum. It was exactly like my mum, but I just had the feeling that it wasnâ€™t actually my mum and was actually something that looked and sounded the same. The thing that looked like my mum tried to calm me down by telling me to say what colour some things were. I did that for a bit and then I woke up. I am getting fear from just writing this. I would appreciate any comments.
