[Day 6] A survey on this subreddit... I made a [form to see what people think about racist jokes](https://forms.gle/MxysFdhGnZYDNNzb9). If you're willing to, please share your opinion. (It's a really quick survey and anonymous.)

* I'll be discarding results that are obviously from trolls
* I'm leaving it open for a week to get more replies, then I'll post the results (lmk if you want me to tag you or something)
* This is just out of pure curiosity
* I'll post tomorrow's earlier to try to collect answers from people in different time zones
* So far there have been 102 responses (9 trolls)
