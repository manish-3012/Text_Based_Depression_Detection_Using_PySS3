Y'know that relatable moment when... You ruin your oldest and sweetest friendship because you didn't give up on a dumb idea when you had the chance, and it's all your fault and there's no way to fix things.

But then you see that their general attitude has improved, basically proving that you were a toxic element in their life.

Then your mutual friendvthinks it's great that they don't even care about you anymore.

No, just me? Okay :(
