this is stupid I'm registering for online school, and the staff told me to contact my catchment school for registration approval. I did, and my catchment school told me to talk to the staff for online school registration. That's it. Nothing else. Confused, I contacted the staff for online school and they told me to talk to my catchment school AGAIN. I told them that I already talked to my catchment school TWICE and they are like "yeah you will have to wait and contact them again for information" WTF I've done all the steps, and the only "information" I got from them was "You will have to call \_\_\_\_\_\_ for more information &lt;3" NO REGISTRATION APPROVAL. NOTHING. JUST THIS BS.  

might delete later idk anyways thanks for taking the time to read my rant
