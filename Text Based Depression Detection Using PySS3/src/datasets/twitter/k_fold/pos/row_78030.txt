Me and my friend came up with a secret language to use when you don't want others to know what you're saying. Its really easy to learn but its 100% fool-proof. Basically, after every word you say or write, you add a "pa" after. I tried it while i was having dinner at my friends house with his parents, i told my friend,
"Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa" we both bursted out laughing and his dad was none the wiser!
