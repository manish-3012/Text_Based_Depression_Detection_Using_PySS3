Need help for a friend.  I was talking to a friend when he suddenly told me that he started cutting himself, and that he is "this close" to end it all. He has been going through some hard stuff recently and I didn't know what to say or how to react. I gave him some advice about some personal stuff and told him that he should try to fix whatever is bothering him, and just to stop thinking of whatever made him have these thoughts.

 A few days later the same topic comes up again and I again had no idea how to deal with this situation. I normally just give him the same advice, but I don't know if what im saying is gonna help. I don't know what to tell him so I'm asking for any advice on how to help him and "cheer" him up, and just to try and stop him from having thoughts like that.

  So again, if anyone can, please help.
