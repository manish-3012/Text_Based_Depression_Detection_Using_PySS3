Just kinda talking about life, school, etc. I have found online learning to have taken a toll on me. I often spend the 6 hour day simply staring at the screen, waiting for lessons to be over so I can enjoy myself, or do online courses that I actually believe could help me in later life. Some subjects just feel like long lectures, and I have trouble finding motivation to do the work. Probably the only thing that has kept me going at all is playing video games, that everyone coincidentally seems to strongly disagree with.

I'm not looking for support or karma. I figured sharing this with the internet guys could help me deal with it, and maybe show people with a similar problems that they're not alone
