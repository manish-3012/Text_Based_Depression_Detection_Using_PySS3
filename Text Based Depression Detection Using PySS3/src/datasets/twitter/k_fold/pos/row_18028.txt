I have the worst fucking parents 1. Theyâ€™re both extremely homophobic and racist

2. They shout at me for no reason, and even when they give a reason itâ€™s not true

3. My (step)dad constantly blasts his favourite shows so much it can be heard in the entire house but Iâ€™m not allowed to close my room door, yet my sister is

4. I canâ€™t even listen to music because the living room is right outside my room and I get yelled at if they can hear the music even the slightest and they refuse to get me earphones

5. They blame videogames on everything. I didnâ€™t eat breakfast? THAT STUPID PHONE! Absolutely not just me not being hungry, itâ€™s that damn phone not allowing me to eat.


6. They give the STUPIDEST punishments. I didnâ€™t study my ass off on friday? â€œGive me your phone, youâ€™re grounded for a day and you will study on both saturday AND sunday. Have a good day sweetieâ€

7. They ruin my confidence all the time. I donâ€™t understand a math problem? Iâ€™m a dumbass and will never succeed in life

8. They force me to become an extrovert even tho Iâ€™m not. They force me to go to literally every social event they can and force me out of my comfort zone.

9. Parents to my sister: â€œoh honey you want a big room? No problem, weâ€™ll get it for youâ€ Parents to me: â€œyou want a big room? Whatâ€™s wrong with your current one that barely has any room for movement? Youâ€™re such a spoiled brat, we give you everything (they donâ€™t at all), learn to appreciate your already big (super small, not joking) room!â€

And after all of these they say they do it because â€˜they love meâ€™ yeah, I donâ€™t think so.
