I got my girlfriend to say the funny word Iâ€™m a bit of a degenerate and I use the word â€œpoggersâ€ a lot (usually ironically, but itâ€™s become a weird habit). My girlfriend knows that I say it a lot but doesnâ€™t know what it means. I explained the concept of the word poggers and she decided, to make me happy, that she would use it when the perfect time came. First good thing that happened (which Iâ€™m keeping private since I donâ€™t want to risk her getting bullied), she comes to me super excited. And what did she say to me?


Poggers.



Iâ€™m so proud :,)
