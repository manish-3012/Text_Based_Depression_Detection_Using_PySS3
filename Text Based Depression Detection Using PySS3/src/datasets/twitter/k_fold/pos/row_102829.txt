Im scared first of all, hello people of Reddit I am a male questioning my existence. Due to covid, I have spent a lot of time on the internet, and I went down a rabbit hole. Through this it has given me some time of self discovery. I now do not know if am  a bisexual or a straight male. I have also thought about my existence as a whole.  I dont even know if I exist. I keep having surreal dreams were im alone. I then wake up in a pool of sweat, and go talk to my parents, they ignore me and grab me. then i wake up. I am horrified what is going on in my life right now and I need some help. some comfort.
