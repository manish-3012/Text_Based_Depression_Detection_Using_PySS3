My next door neighbor misfired a gun playing with it from inside his house into mine. We aren't even in a town house. The bullet went through his wall, outside, and into our house. We weren't home but our dog was, and could have gotten shot. My mom reported it and they were freaking out more about that than when they shot the bullet. My mom isnt even pressing charges, Which would mean a year or more in prison and big fines.

Just figured I'd rant about it on reddit bc my mom doesn't want me talking about it to anyone.

I'm American btw
