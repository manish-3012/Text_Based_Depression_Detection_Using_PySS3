Is it just me or am I not that excited for the new gen consoles Hi how are all of you doing?

I understand that people might say I might be salty I didnâ€™t get a next console on launch but thatâ€™s not it. Even when preorders were here I just didnâ€™t care enough to get it. I just generally not in a mindset to play games. I donâ€™t know this is my thoughts. I have asked my local store if they had ps5 in stock just to ask because I was curious and when they said no I wasnâ€™t even upset or nothing I was more like whatever. These are my thoughts I want to hear yours.
