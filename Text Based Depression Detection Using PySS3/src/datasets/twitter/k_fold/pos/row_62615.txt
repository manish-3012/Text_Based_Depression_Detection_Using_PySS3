I wrote a poem for my CRUSH. Tittle- Truly madly deeply. Sorry, reddit messes up the lines. She stood there in the sunlight so pleasantly warm
Resting my eyes upon her was all glee, never a harm
That bright shade of brown in her eyes
eyes deep and beautiful as the seas
I had fallen for her so steaply
I loved her truly madly deeply

When she smiled, the whole world stoped,
And stared for a while
The smile like roses most pink,
It was nothing but love in which my heart did sink
I had fallen for her so steaply
I loved her truly madly deeply

Her voice so soothing it casted on me a spell
Like music whose notes no mortal could tell
The sweetest melody it was my ear could ever hear,
Lost it would be someday was my fear,
I had fallen for her so steaply
I loved her truly madly deeply

I knew teenage love never lasted
Brave enough was I to still to get that tested
Hilarious was that I neved had the courage to directly confess
Did i start too early or did I just loose a race ?, 
I knew not, For all I knew was
I had fallen for her so steaply and I  loved her truly madly deeply
