Why? Why can't I just be like other people? Instead I have to be in my room whilst I shake uncontrollably. It all starts with some stupid stuff like people sitting on my side of the sofa, or rearranging the lamp incorrectly, but when they do that my entire perception changes: my body starts twitching and I feel like everyone is against me. And I know they don't mean it, they don't mean to talk slightly slower or stop making footsteps right around my door, but I stll get angry by it regardless of intentions. And the problem just worsens, and I feel like shouting, but it won't do anything, and my neighbours will hate me.

And If my parents find out they will think I have some sort of phone delirium tremens (not an actual delirium tremens, I have never tried alcohol as it is bad for you, this is just an analogy for my phone) and they will take it away. But this started happening when I was 9, before I had any phone or Ipad ir anything.

And I put this situation in context, and ask myself: why can't I be a normal person? And even though my classmates don't say it, I know I am the " is good at allmost all subjects but will throw a tantrum if you talk to him" sorta guy. I just wanna blend in.
