What do you think I should tattoo myself? I'm getting some india ink soon to do some stick and pokes on myself. 

I know I want some small flowers on my upper thighs, but I'm not sure what else to do with the ink. What do you think I should do?

(Before you tell me its a bad idea, I know that. But I'm going to be really careful and I've thought a lot about this. My body is already pretty fucked up, I just want to do something nice to my body for once)
