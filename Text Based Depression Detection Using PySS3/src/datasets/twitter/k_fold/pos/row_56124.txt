My parents want me to get over my guinea pig's death My guinea pig died yesterday and i cried for two hours and then went to sleep because it was extremely late at that point. Today morning I went to bury her because i wanted to bury her before her body would start noticably decompose. I stood at the grave for an hour and then went to take a bath, mostly so I can be alone for an hour or so. But then my mother called me during her break at work as usual but since I was grieving I wasnt able to pur on my happy demeanour. I thought she would understand but she told me to "get over it because death it a part of life". I understand that neither her nor my dad got attached to the ginuea pig since i exclusively took care of them, but it had barely been 12 hours since I found out she passed away. I feel terrible to my parents since it would demotivate them if I were to be sad since they are risking their lives so we could eat, but I'd also feel extremely guilty if I were to get over her death that quickly and it'd probably hurt my mental health too.
