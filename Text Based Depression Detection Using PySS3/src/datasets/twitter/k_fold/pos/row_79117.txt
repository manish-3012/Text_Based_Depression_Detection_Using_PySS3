The word simp is overused I have a couple friend that i in regularly play Minecraft with and we have this big server with all of us in it. Now weâ€™re all 12-16 year old boys and there is one girl in the group whoâ€™s Discord IGN is Nikky, and sheâ€™s pretty chill, vibing and playing Bedwars. Iâ€™m pretty good friends with Nikky and we talk often and one day most of the people in the server just start being super toxic and bullying Nikky so much that she left the server. And when I went in a VC to talk to them about it their entire argument was â€œoh OP is such a simpâ€ and think that being a decent human being to anyone of the female gender is simping and I canâ€™t even talk to them without them being jackasses about it. Nikky DMd me after she left the server and said that she felt that it was her fault somehow that they were bullying her and now I feel bad cause it obvious that my (boy) friends were motherfuckering for no reason.
