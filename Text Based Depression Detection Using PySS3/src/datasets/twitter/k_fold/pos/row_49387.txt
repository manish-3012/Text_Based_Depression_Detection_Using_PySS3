I am so fucking done My Dad couldnâ€™t find a pair of scissors so he started yelling at me and my brother saying shit like â€œI put my stuff where it belongs but you two fuckers donâ€™tâ€. So I say (exact words) â€œWell maybe you left them in the storage room on accidentâ€ so he flips his shit and starts berating me for â€œBeing a lazy fucker and not helping himâ€ so I obviously get pissed off and start rolling my eyes and walking away. Heâ€™s gets even more mad and says (again his exact words) â€œYea thatâ€™s right, get the fuck out of my face you fucking assholeâ€!!!! So I go up the stairs and he yells â€œGo to your room you cock suckerâ€ so I go upstairs to my room and I pass my mom. He just looks at me and walks away. SHE DIDNâ€™T EVEN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!?!?! LIKE WTF?!?!?  So Iâ€™m just sitting in my room until tomorrow when he goes to work. 

Sorry if this is too long I just needed to vent a bit. 

TLDR: my Dads an asshole who calls me a cocksucker on a daily basis and screamed at me and my little brother for â€œloosing his scissorsâ€
