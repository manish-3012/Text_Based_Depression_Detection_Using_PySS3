Parents shouldn't use "Because I raised you" in an arguement. Is it just me that gets really upset when parents(especially my mother) just shut you up with "I raised you"? I honestly don't understand. What else are parents supposed to do with their children? Eat them for breakfast? I think it's simply a responsibility to raise a child nothing to brag or complain about. Am I seeing things wrong here? What do you fellow redditors think?
