Just started online school It sucks, a third of my teachers have no idea how the internet works. I just sit in my chair doing nothing for 4 hours until I have a 2 hour lunch break which is fine itâ€™s just bruh like honestly I donâ€™t need 2 hours to make chicken nuggets. Iâ€™d much rather just have all my classes and have them end school earlier.
