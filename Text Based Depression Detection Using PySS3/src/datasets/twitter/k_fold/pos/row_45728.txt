Does it bother anyone else that when people list the sexes/genders, they almost always put men first? People always say â€œmen and womenâ€ â€œboys and girlsâ€ â€œhe/sheâ€ for example. Very few people say â€œwomen and menâ€ â€œgirls and boysâ€ â€œshe/heâ€. It isnâ€™t necessarily a problem to list men first but it seems like most people do it, and I think itâ€™s because society has discriminated against women in a lot of ways, and most people just naturally put men first because thatâ€™s what society has basically taught us to do. If you do this, Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re a sexist, Iâ€™m saying a lot of society is sexist.
