Canâ€™t talk to people in an environment where Iâ€™m supposed to talk to someone?? I donâ€™t know how else to explain this but when somebody asks me to say something Iâ€™m at a loss of words. Not always but I feel like if I had a therapist or something Iâ€™d literally not be able to talk and if I do it would be all these words that donâ€™t make sense and Iâ€™d feel terrible after talking because I said some stupid shit that I might not have even meant.
