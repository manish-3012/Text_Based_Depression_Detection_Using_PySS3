in the next 10-20 years there probably wonâ€™t be any more living holocaust survivors thatâ€™s insane to me. idk why but the fact that the
holocaust will basically just be history soon is so weird to me. (i usually consider something history when the people directly affected by it arenâ€™t alive anymore, or when nobody can give first hand accounts of what happened)
