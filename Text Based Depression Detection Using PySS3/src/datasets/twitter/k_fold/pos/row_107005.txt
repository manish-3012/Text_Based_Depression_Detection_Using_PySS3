I have an outfit idea. I don't know if it would actually work but what do you think from pure description alone.

Some blue jeans, brown type color dress shoes, stylish belt, blue cross hash dress shirt, and a black silk bomber jacket with a japanese style dragon on the back.

Does that outfit sound drip or skip?
