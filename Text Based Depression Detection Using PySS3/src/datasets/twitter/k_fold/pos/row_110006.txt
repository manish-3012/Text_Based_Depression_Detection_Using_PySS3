Random story time, this one about gaming. So I was playing roblox, make fun of me if you want, and I was exploiting in a prison life server. I wasn't being annoying and spam killing everyone, I was just spinning with insane speed and noclip to be a beyblade. Anyway, so I was just vibing and the people in the server were vibing with me, but all of the sudden another exploiter comes along. I'd be fine with this if they weren't the exact thing I was trying not to be. They were running around at extreme speeds with killaura on and killing everyone repeatedly. No one could do anything about it but I also had exploits so I fought fire with fire. I basically turned on my killaura and made myself stick to them every time they respawn, so we both kept dying repeatedly but I stopped the abuse. They kept trying to shake me off but failed and eventually we were trapped in the void, repeatedly dying. I honestly felt like Doctor Strange during the "Dormammu I've come to bargain" scene. They rage quit and I felt triumphant as hell. Most of the people I was vibing with left since this fight lasted quite a while. I just kinda went back to what I was doing before and started vibing again.
