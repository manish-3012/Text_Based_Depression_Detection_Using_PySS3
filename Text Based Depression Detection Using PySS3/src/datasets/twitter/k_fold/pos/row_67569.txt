Apparently, Iâ€™m not allowed to be in control of my own life. So, currently Iâ€™m doing cross country at my school due to my father quite literally forcing me too. Iâ€™ve been going to most practices (which are in the morning before school) and sometimes I have to skip to go to tutoring, which makes him mad. This weekend I went to our first meet, and I ran 5K without stopping once. It was so painful, and my legs still hurt, and I wanted to skip practice on Monday only just to get my legs to rest a bit more. My dad is having NONE of it, and is threatening to take away privileges if I donâ€™t. I feel like he trying to relive his life through me or something, cause he literally wonâ€™t let me do anything I want to do with my life.

Another issue Iâ€™ve faced that is similar to this, is that recently, I have lost my insane appetite and hunger that I usually have. I can barely manage half of what I used to eat without getting extreme stomach pain. Along with this, I just got braces so eating is awful for me. My parents think I have an eating disorder or something and keep trying to make me eat more and more, as much as I used to, when I literally just canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve argued with them about this several times, and they literally just donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know why my parents donâ€™t want to listen to me, or even try to understand. I just wish they would listen to me for once.
