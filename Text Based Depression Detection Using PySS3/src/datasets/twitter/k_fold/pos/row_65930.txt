I look back at all the times of messed up things happening to me And I canâ€™t stop laughing 

I got jumped in the bathroom in 6th grade and got my junk touched for a second or 2, then the entire school thought I was raped

I got pantsed 2 times in a row and so many people saw it

I was a porn addict 

A knife was pulled on me for PokÃ©mon cards

These events used to haunt the shit out of me. Now I just laugh at them.

Is there something wrong with me?
