Advice for going through a rough patch Earlier this year I started high school and I found the transition relatively easy. But during the transition I started to stop hanging out with my friends as much to focus on schoolwork and I thought I had a good balance for a while. The way I kept this balance so well is because I played video games with them. Recently over our Christmas break I got a pc while about half of them are still playing on Xbox and it has made me talk to them a bit less every week. I have also been getting closer and closer to a girl that I have liked for a while. Normally that would be a good thing but some of my friends make fun of me for it because half of them think sheâ€™s fine and the other half hates her. I have thought about disconnecting myself from them but I donâ€™t have anyone to fall back in except the girl Iâ€™ve been talking to. I havenâ€™t talked to my friends  for a few days and Iâ€™m starting to realize that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m doing anything with my life. I go through the same routine everyday and there is nothing productive about it. I feel like everyone in my life is starting to turn on me and Iâ€™m having a really hard time motivating myself to get up and do something everyday. If anyone has advice on how to get out of this it would be greatly appreciated.
