So I like this girl So I met this girl a few days ago that's new to my school. I kinda like her, but when texting her, she doesn't seem interested in talking to me. She replies with a lot of "lol"s and "ok cool"s. I just need help in how to talk to her, and keep a conversation going. And should I text her first or wait and see if she texts me?
