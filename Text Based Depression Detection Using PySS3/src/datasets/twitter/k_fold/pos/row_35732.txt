Just came back from a traumatic gaming experience I was playing fallout 76 , and I minding my own bizness, until I heard a girl in game chat . She was with a group of friends and they were talking about some stupid political stuff . When they them mentioned how some people need cut their mesgintic crap , that's when I got furious. I plugged in my mike , and told them how girls shouldn't make fallout political, and they shouldn't be playing video games in the first place .

To my surprise her friends defended her , what a bunch of simps, saying that I was mesgintic. It got really heated until they muted me . 

I just don't understand, why the gamers wouldn't support in Taking down this pretender making my a political game political. â˜¹ðŸ˜¡
