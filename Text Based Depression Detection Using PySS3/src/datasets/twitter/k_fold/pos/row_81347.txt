I want death I guess TW

It's so pointless, everything is pointless. I'm tired of living I want it to end

Everyone just says to think about the people that love me, but I don't understand it, I don't get why it would hurt them

People say it gets better, it doesn't, it gets worse everyday.

Everything is worthless. I would end it if I could.

Sorry for being so negative. Idek why I'm posting this sorry
