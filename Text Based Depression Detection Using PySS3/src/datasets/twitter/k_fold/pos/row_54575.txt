I know life is tough sometimes so I'm offering a hand of friendship and a sympathetic ear. I think everyone has a problem some bigger than others and also some are a lot luckier than others in the sense of acceptance. I am a very open minded person and don't have any biases (I think?)  If you want to just talk to someone about your problems or thoughts I'm here for you. You are not alone okay?
