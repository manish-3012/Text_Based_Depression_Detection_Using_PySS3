Anyone else feel like they are not themselves when they are with people? I'm not sure if that's normal or not, but I don't feel as if I am myself when I am out with friends, especially if I don't know them that much. The only person I'm the most "myself" with, is my cousin because he is the person I'm the closest to, but there are things I keep from him too. The only time I can really feel like I am truly being myself is when I am on the internet, especially on sites like reddit and discord where no one knows who I am.

I really hate this and it's one of the reasons I don't like talking with people especially at my school, because I always feel I am faking who I am in order to fit in, just to have a small conversation and not be alone for a few minutes.

I'm probably known as that one weird kid at my school that doesn't talk much, and it's not that I don't want to, I just hate everything about having to go up to people and talk to them. I'll probably end up pretending to be someone I'm not, simply because I'm desperate to talk with someone and if I were truly myself they'd probably think I'm weird.

I really hate myself for this because I have to spend every break alone walking around the school like a fucking loser. I know some people at my school that I could hang out with but I if I do, I'm really awkward and I distance myself afterwards for no reason other than me believing how they probably think of me as weird. (even though it might not be the case and it's just because I over think every single thing).

I also occasionally daydream about having a relationship but I  won't bother  to even try to ask someone out until I've improved myself and made some friends first.

I'm not really sure wtf this post was, I just wanted to type this out somewhere.
