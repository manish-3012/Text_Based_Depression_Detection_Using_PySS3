I don't understand the accounts on Instagram that share other people's comics Like why. It's not yours to post it.

"but I put the name of the artits(if I actually care) in the description"

Still why would you do that and you have to press read more to find who actually made that art.

I would understand if you share comics from smaller creators. But like what.

And in the end I'm okay if you just share the comics and have the balls to have a add at the end

Not only are you stealing art because you are a untalented piece of shit you are making money off of it. How low of a scumy human being do you have to be to do that.

Rant over I don't even use Instagram that much but when I do this shit happens
