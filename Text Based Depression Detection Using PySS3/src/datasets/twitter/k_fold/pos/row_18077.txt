I've been feeling really depressed lately I'm doing online schooling, which I hate with a burning passion. I got a girlfriend back in March that I can't even see or talk to because we're not going to school and she doesn't have a phone. I can't see or talk to any friends because I'm not going to school, I have online friends that I talk to over PlayStation, but it isn't the same. My wifi is terrible so it makes it difficult to even try to do my schooling. So for the past hour I've been staring at the ceiling lost in my thoughts and feeling depressed.
