I have literally no confidence when it comes to the other gender I keep missing opportunityâ€™s to talk to her by thinking of the worst possible sernario and thinking that will happen. For example she goes the same way home as me and I could of stopped today and gone with her but I thought it would go wrong. And we even talk on snap but i donâ€™t wanna start any proper conversation In case it goes wrong. What is wrong with me?
