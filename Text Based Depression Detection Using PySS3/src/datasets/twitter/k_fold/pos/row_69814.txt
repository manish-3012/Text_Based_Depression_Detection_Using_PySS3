Trying to look at least half decent for the first time in my life Low-key wanna get earings, somebody said I should try subtle eyeliner, apparently a man bun would look good on me? I really don't know anything about fashion and the person I would be asking is busy so I'm here on reddit because I know you guys are great at this. I'll post a few pictures in my profile for you to go off of but I really wanna know what you guys think. I know I need a haircut it looks like I have a mullet, I was thinking of just growing it out long enough for a man bun and just keeping it around that length or something. I also have no fashion sense and like I said the person I would normally ask is a little unavailable at the moment so if you have any outfits you think I might look good in feel free to tell me.
