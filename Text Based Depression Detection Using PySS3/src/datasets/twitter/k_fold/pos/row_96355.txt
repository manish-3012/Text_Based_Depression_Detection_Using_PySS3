My parents are blocking youtube from the wifi I need help. Badly.

before i start, ye need to understand that i fucking adore minecraft, and everything im abt to talk abt will reference it

I (14f) am a massive fan of the dream smp at the moment, and each minecraft youtubers channels, both on twitch and youtube. Except my parents dont allow me to watch youtube, and theyve never even hearrd of twitch but you can bet that if they had, i wouldnt be allowed to watch it. Theyve begun to check the wifi because of my lil bros watching youtube, and they want to keep catching them out. They dont know if i watch youtube or not because i try to keep it on incognito, but the thing is, they wanna put a block on youtube. Not only will that affect my schoolwork bc we're given videos to watch, but they dont get how important youtube is to me. Whenever i have a bad day, or something has happened, i go straight to youtube, and I'll watch some mcyt (think tommyinnit, technoblade, dream) or other non minecraft youtubers. If that goes i wont have a coping mechanism to deal with all the stress from exams and homework. I'm really fucking worried whats going to happen. 

so thats why i came to reddit. I havent logged on here in ages, but i need advice. how in gods name can i keep watching it even with the block. there's no signal in my room so i cant use data. They wont understand it if i try to tell them about it. this whole post makes me sound really fucking spoiled, but im scared.

its not even as if theyre strict. my mam got me a book recently with gay sex scenes in it (tbh she doesnt know but she knows its a YA book so she kinda knows its a bit racy) and she got me Game of Thrones for xmas and from what ive heard thats v. raunchy. so its just youtube theyre worried about and i dont get why. I watch tv shows with worse curse words + some adult scenes, and anyone who knows tommyinnit knows how not pg that child is. 

please help me
