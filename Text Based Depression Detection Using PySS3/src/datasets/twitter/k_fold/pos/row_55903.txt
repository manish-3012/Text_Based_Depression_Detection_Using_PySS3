My crush just told me sheâ€™s engaged. I met this girl online and we got super into it and were texting every day for like 2 months. Then she confessed she was suicidal, and that she was ending it in like 3 days. Long story short, I managed to stall her long enough and she gave up. But she tried. She told me later that night a friend got her to the hospital, and the only reason she called was because I was her purpose for life. Skip forward a week and she told me she loved me and we got super intimate. One night she got really drunk and said said some mean stuff about my self harm addiction and things escalated. Thatâ€™s when I realized neither of us was in a mental state to have a healthy relationship. The next morning she apologized but I didnâ€™t reply right away(I was at work) and she got mad. Then I told her it wasnâ€™t going to work out between us because neither of us is mentally stable. We didnâ€™t talk for like 3 days and then she said this. â€œYou knocked me into back into the friend zone. Got my hopes up and everything. I havenâ€™t eaten since you did that.â€œ I told her I wasnâ€™t responsible for what she did. And I also pointed out that it broke my heart to send that message. Then she told me that she was never actually into me and that she was seeing someone else. And In fact, they were already engaged. 
The suicide attempt, her confession that she loves me, our relationship. All lies.

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m going to go cry myself to sleep.
