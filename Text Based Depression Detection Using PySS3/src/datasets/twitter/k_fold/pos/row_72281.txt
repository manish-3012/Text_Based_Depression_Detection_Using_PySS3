confusion/frustration about my sexuality i've been out as bi for a while, but recently i came out as lesbian. men just dont make me happy, i dont have a real attraction for them, i dont like their bodies, i dont like their personalities. but somehow i keep convincing myself im not actually gay. that im just doing it for attention or so i can pick a side. 

please tell me im not the only teenage girl that feels this? please?
