I donâ€™t really know anymore A bit over a month ago I I got a gf. Before that I had kind off a depression literally the only thing I would do is go to school, go home, look at memes, eat, watch yt, eat and watch more yt and sleep. Every singe fucking day. Now I got a gf, more friends that I can hang out with more often and my school is going better. Only my depression isnâ€™t. 

Every single day I call my gf for like 3 hours but I just canâ€™t be with her Bcs she lives too far away. Itâ€™s apparently really bad when you canâ€™t be with a person you love. I sometimes even hurt myself to get distracted from wanting to be with her so much. 

I also make music which helps with not thinking about her. Only the problem is she sings really good and has a yt channel where she covers songs. So every time I make something I think about her and how her voice would fit my track really well. 

I really donâ€™t know what to do about it I have to go to school for like 1,5 more years and idk if I could wait that long. I just want to be with her so much that I yesterday just punched a hole in my closed door. 

Please if someone knows how to get distracted from her tell me. Idk what to do my life got so much better I got a gf, friends and Iâ€™m working out again after 3 years. Only my mind doesnâ€™t want to believe it for some reason so I stay depressed.

Reddit has helped me go through the worst part of my depression so I thought maybe posting this would make me feel better.

If someone has some advice idc about what please tell me I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Oh and here is [my gfâ€™s yt channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftUioysYky1tfAwG4N4E6g) please go check it out :)
