Ok so I kinda have a problem (TW) So I started taking a ruler with a *really* sharp corner and like scratching my arms really hard and it hurts so much but I like it and I have no idea why. I just want to take it and slice over and over and over again until Iâ€™m bleeding what the fuck is wrong with me
