introverted/shy ish friends are so cool like wow, these people really know how to listen. they're so chil compared to everyone else and its kinda comforting. i can rant about the most random thing possible, and I'll feel like the person is listening the entire time. a conversation with shyer people always lasts days. shyer people tend to have so much about themselves thats really fun to learn about while getting to know them. to all my shy friends and any others ill meet in the future, you all are great
