That time I studied for a math test So recently Iâ€™ve have not been doing as well as before in school, and Iâ€™ve been forced by my parents to spend like 6 times as much as I used to studying (before it was like at most 15 minutes). And so today I had the first test since Iâ€™d been forced to study, and my grades had been going well in every class, even geometry which was what I had a barely passing grade before. So now I spent two hours studying before hand for this test right before it, and then hours the day before as well. I take the test feeling really confident, and I take it slow and check all my answers, and when I finished with checking and submitting I dealt great on a test for the first time in a while. I checked my grades today, I didnâ€™t even get an F I got a whole ass N in the grade book. Lesson learned, donâ€™t study or listen to your parents
