When is the right time to tell someone I like them? I've been friends with this girl I like for a while and I'd like to tell her I like her cuz I do. It's just that it might be too early. We've known each other for over a year and we've spoken and joked a little at school. But we haven't ever met outside of school as friends and just hung out ever. I have been doing subtle hints, for instance I asked if she wanted to be my valentine      

Thoughts?    

Also another question: is it okay if I just shoot a snap saying "Hey, I like you! â¤ï¸"?
