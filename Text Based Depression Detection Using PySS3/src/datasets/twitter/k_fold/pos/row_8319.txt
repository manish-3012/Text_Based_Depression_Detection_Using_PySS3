Iâ€™m slipping I donâ€™t have any motivation to do homework. I donâ€™t have any goals accept things outside of school. I have no interest in anything they teach. My life is wake up, coast through school watch anime, movies and play games, jerk off, and then go to sleep. Iâ€™m tired of it but I donâ€™t have the will to change anything.
