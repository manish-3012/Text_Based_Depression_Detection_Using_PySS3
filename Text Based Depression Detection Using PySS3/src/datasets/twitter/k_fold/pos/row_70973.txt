Why is my mom like this We were at a restaurant and I was eating more than any of us there, which is somewhat normal now, and my mom said that â€œif you keep eating that much then weâ€™ll never find you a mini skirt to wear for dates and partiesâ€. I was contacting so much anger, cause there were so many things wrong with that sentence. First of all, so what if I eat a lot? If I gain weight? Will she stop loving me? Second of all I prefer baggy and non showy clothing, and when I said â€œwell what if I wonâ€™t wear â€˜mini skirtsâ€™?â€ She said that â€œwell are you even a girl then?â€ I was fuming, but I just didnâ€™t respond at that point. Also who said I would go to dates or parties? My introverted ass would prefer staying at home drawing or playing video games. Oh and did I mention that my mom wonâ€™t let me buy black clothes? Like Iâ€™m 13 I think itâ€™s time I find my style and what I like? 
I also want to say that my mom isnâ€™t toxic and I just wanted to rant about things like this that happen occasionally and really bother me, but otherwise my mom is great and I love her.
Um thanks for reading my little rant lol. Oh and if you have similar stories Iâ€™d love to hear them. 
Anyway hope all of you are having a good day and 2020 wasnâ€™t too rough on you.
