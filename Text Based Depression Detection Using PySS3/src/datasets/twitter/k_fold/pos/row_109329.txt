I (14)Need Some Life Advice Please So this story is going to be embarrassing and pretty long.

So a year ago close to the summer holidays, I started talking to this girl at my school since she sat next to me in Science class. I actually liked her corny jokes.I thought she was just pretty easy going and easy to talk to and while my friends wouldnâ€™t agree I thought she was pretty too. We were also surprisingly enough sat together in maths and we would talk enough there that I got a worse grade than usual. Then I realized I liked her.
When I realized I liked her it all went downhill, I started panicking a bit more and being a lot more awkward. This is mostly because Iâ€™m pretty self conscious about my height and my pimples and sheâ€™s taller than me with no pimples pretty much. We started texting anyway and hit it off decently, good nights and all of that. 
So one day I decided to ask her out fully expecting to get rejected but she actually said she liked me too.
The problem is: we would text the same amount of time but I think she had the same awkward effect and it was just an anxious mess.
When she said yes I was really happy but it didnâ€™t go out very well.
I would go and talk to her (still a bit stiff) really trying to just get us talking again and she just wouldnâ€™t look at me. I was so confused and felt really helpless.
A few days later she slipped a really cute note in my bag which said that she thought that I was attractive (something Iâ€™ve never heard before and had told her since even before dating we would have some really deep talks) and that she wouldnâ€™t look at me because her heart would start beating too much. It seemed copulastes from a fanfiction but I was fucking radiant.
She still wouldnâ€™t look at me though and she also didnâ€™t text me for a week. And I once again felt hopeless.
As you might expect, 2 shitty weeks in she came up to me and said we should break up and I said â€œfineâ€ as I thought I had it coming

Present day: Iâ€™m quarantined for 2 weeks since a guy from my vollleyball team got corona. I start taking to her through discord and now i think Iâ€™m catching feelings... maybe.
The thing is that Iâ€™m still as short but Iâ€™m much more muscular which has helped me a lot with my body image. I think Iâ€™m a bit more confident now but I donâ€™t know if I should go for it.

What do you guys think?

TLDR: I liked a girl a year ago, it was an awkward mess and now I think Iâ€™m catching feelings again
