short story donâ€™t read whenever i took my dog for a walk i never encountered many people, and when i did it was annoying but it would be a matter of just walking past them, but sometime this year i this trend started where i would often encounter my neighbor also taking his dog out and it was really awkward and our dogs went bananas, it was also really annoying cause we would follow somewhat of a similar path and it was difficult getting rid of him unlike the other bystanders. the first times i thought it was just bad luck but it kept happening so every time i took my dog out it was a gamble, sometimes i would change up my time schedule and he would still pop up by chance, whenever we clashed there was this vibe of â€œugh i didnâ€™t think he would come out at this timeâ€ and after many incidents, we started figuring out at which times to come out and there was this unspoken rule of when each other would go out. 
after months of procrastinating i now take my dog for a walk somewhat late at night and i can finally be left at peace for sure
