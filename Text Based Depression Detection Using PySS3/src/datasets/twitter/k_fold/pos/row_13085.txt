I dare you to challenge my height While I'm not ridiculously short, it's the circumstances surrounding my height that make it hilarious.

1. I'm 15 years old and 5'6

2. My twin brother is 5'10

3. I'm 90% British genetically so I don't necessarily have short genes

4. My girlfriend is 5'8 (Also 15) (Dutch)

5. I'm in shape and I eat healthy

6. I don't care about my height
