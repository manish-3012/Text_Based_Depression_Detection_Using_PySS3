you know that feeling when you have noone to talk to? so i've been going on my mid school for 3 years now. still i haven't found anyone to really hang out or talk with. i used to have a few in elementary school but things changed. most of my new school camerades dont even want to talk with me. ok, this is exeggarated, i admit. but still. its not the same feeling.

when i was younger, i would think about going on a bycycle tour with my friends. now its not possible. ive cut out all my contacts, or just dont talk to them anymore at all. its a trap. its like all in and either you win or lose. and i took the L here.  


most of my comerades use discord. but they all talk together and im not a big fan of group talks. i just want to have one friend, someone who i can talk with. about the stuff i normally wont shout out in public, if you understand what i mean. not just some stranger on the internet, but a person which i can trust.
