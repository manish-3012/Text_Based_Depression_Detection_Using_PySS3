crazy how people will switch on you recently found out most of my old friend group literally stopped caring after I started talking less to them. Even then I would still drop by and say hi just to be nice and to know most of them stopped even giving a fuck about me is angering. Like it's nothing fully new as the reason I left was that they pretty much ignored me. Fuckin hate it, man the feeling of being betrayed by people you thought you could trust. I've known them for almost 4 years now. And they fuckin cut me out like that. I talk to 2 or 3 of the people still as they also left that group kinda and are much more real and cool people now but the fact they just kick out a couple people like that. It's so fucked.
