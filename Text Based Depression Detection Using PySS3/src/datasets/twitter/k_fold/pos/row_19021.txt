is anyone else feeling like this at this point of the pandemic? does anyone else just feel like there is nothing going on in your life?

I mean, the lockdown was initially about personal growth and improvement but now, everything is just mundane and depressing.

waking up, attending online classes (gosh, I hate them) and then finding things to do and end up wasting time lmao

at least I feel pretty lonely and tired and hope that things normalize soon. the pandemic has definitely taken a toll on everybody's mental health
