I just wanna ask this Why does no one (that Iâ€™ve watched on YouTube or seen really anywhere) use an Iron axe instead of diamond/netherite sword? Itâ€™s so much cheaper and does more/the same amount of damage as either of the two. It also can be enchanted with the same enchantments as swords, I mean I feel like itâ€™s just a waste not to, the strongest tool is the Netherite axe with 10 damage so I also suggest that for when ya get there, but a Iron axe is the second best weapon in the game and I feel like it should be used a lot more then people do.
