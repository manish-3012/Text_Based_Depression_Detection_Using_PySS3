Just curious, are there subs that wind up like ghost towns... ...\*because\* its members were so critical of each other that no one wanted to talk anymore?

What could have been a great sub became the same 4 people posting and literally no one willing to risk karma to comment?

I have been places where you can say, "Nice work," and get downvoted. If that's what they want --- no one except their one other friend --- shouldn't they just move to wordpress or some shit? I'm all for disagreement. But I'm also all for *decency,* too.

So I'm asking you guys, i**n your experience, what are the subs that basically trash all of its members so thoroughly that no one actually posts there anymore?**
