Problem being camera shy For the past year, Iâ€™ve never been required to turn on my camera and when I was. I just had my camera facing above and directing to my hair. Today I gotta have my camera facing me doing the push-up section of the fitness gram. Iâ€™ve been known to lose all forms of physical strength when nervous and or shy. What should I do?
