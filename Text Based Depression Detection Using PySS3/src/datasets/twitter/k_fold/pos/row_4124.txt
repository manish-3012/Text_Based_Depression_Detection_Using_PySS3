Back to school So Iâ€™m going back to school today (luckily I have tomorrow off due to how our schools going back) and Iâ€™m dreading it, i literally feel like serial killers should go kindergarten through grade 12 and I bet theyâ€™d be better people when they got out, anyway, I guess I have to do that but hey to all those people not going back for some reason youâ€™re the luckiest people on the planet. But anyway, I found out that two of my best friends arenâ€™t gonna be in my class but other than that I have absolutely zero clue whoâ€™s in my class would be good to know since those are the only people I can hang out with ALL YEAR. Anyways, good luck to everyone going back to school and have a wonderful day.
