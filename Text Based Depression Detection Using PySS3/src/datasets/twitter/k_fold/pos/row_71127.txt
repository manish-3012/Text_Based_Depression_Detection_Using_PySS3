All recreational drugs are inherently bad I'm going to get downvoted but idc.

Take weed for example, yes it may be less dangerous PHYSICALLY than cigarettes but the phycological damage way tops it, especially if it's being consumed by someone younger than 25 (when the brain is fully matured). And all the other recreational drugs have insane side affects that none of you hippies seem to want to talk about, like lsd having a huge risk of having heart attacks or strokes etc.

I'm writing this because I've seen a growing acceptance online of these substances which RUIN LIVES and a generally a cultural swing (at least on Reddit) of it being completely fine and everyone seems to fail to mention the potential side effects of these harmful substances. I also think that such drugs should be decriminalised but ONLY to help people get the rehab they need for going onto such substances and ofc still punish the dealers for distributing this corruption.

And before you say alcohol is a recreational drug too, I know that it is but there's no point trying to stop it when it's been engrained in our culture for thousands of years. And don't mention medicinal anything this isn't what this post's about.
