Please think before you say something online I have seen on this sub how many people flaunt their weed usage or talk about suicide or about killing people also about porn. as we know most of us are below 18 so anything slightly triggering can hurt you in long term. these are proofs against you which you are only building. If your school counsellor thinks that you are suicidal she may ask your parents to check your accounts and if you clearly mention on this sub they can definitely see it. Just think once because in some countries suicide is illegal so you may face certain charges. Don't just blatantly admit anything if you want to get it off your chest just write it in form of a story, not first-person and mention below to comment on your stories. this method is good and less risky.

don't talk about porn, alcoholism, drugs, suicidal tendencies, or any other illegal stuff
