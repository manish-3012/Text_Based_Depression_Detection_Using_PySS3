Just pulled my first actual all nighter. I am currently taking a poop at 5:40pm, sleep deprivation makes you be real with yourself. I am feeling sleepy, yet realise another flaw on me by the second. It is like I am critiquing my life and watching from a third person view. My brain is thinking too much even though it wants sleep. I tried to nap but I woke up earlier than my alarm, so I can't sleep. I am feeling sleepy, yet my mind is racing faster than when I drink energy drinks, I feel like I could write a book but I am not energised enough to be creative rn. Is this fucking normal? I need answers
