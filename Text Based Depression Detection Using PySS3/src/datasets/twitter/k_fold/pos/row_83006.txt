how do you stay focused during online school? so Iâ€™m a college freshman, majoring in engineering and I feel like I need advice from people my age on this kind of topic. I get easily distracted and I always end up on youtube or something on my laptop when I should be studying for my midterms. this problem could probably be easily solved if I could just remove my laptop from the room, but I need it to study. so just  a simple question: how do you stay focused when something that is prone to distract you is right in front of you?
