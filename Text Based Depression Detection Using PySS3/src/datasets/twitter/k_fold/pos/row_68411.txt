I made a poem about dogs! I hope you guys like it, Iâ€™m sort of new to poetry. Hello friend!

You smell so good,

The family I have

Protect I should


Pat my back!

My golden features

I love you so

I am your creature


I am your pal!

My coat is graying

But it doesnâ€™t matter

My tail is swaying


You love me too,

But you wear sorrow

Donâ€™t worry, pal

Iâ€™ll always follow


Im getting older,

My friend forever, 

But this bond will never sever


My life was filled with joy

From you and others,

In our time together, we were brothers


I may not be here 

In flesh and blood

But never forget, I am your bud


Now let me rest,

My time is over


I love you so,

Eternal brother
