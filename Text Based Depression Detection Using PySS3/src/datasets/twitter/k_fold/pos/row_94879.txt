Day 2 of posting the phrase liquid whales until I get a girlfriend (or more likely forget to post) These bitches love Sosa, Oh end or oh end 

Fucking with them o boys, you gon get fucked over 

â€˜Raris and rovers, these hoes love Chief Sosa 

Hit em with that cobra, now them boys slumped over

They do it all for Sosa, you boys ainâ€™t making no noise 

Yâ€™all know Iâ€™m a grown boy, your clique full of broke boys 

God, yâ€™all some broke boys, god, yâ€™all some broke boys 

We GBE dope boys, we got lots of dough, boy 

*and todayâ€™s filler was brought to you by Chief Keef and his song, Love Sosa*
