Help be my friendâ€™s girlfriend ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰ You may ask, â€œwhyyy do i need to be your friends fucking girlfriendâ€ and youâ€™d be right, he doesnâ€™t need you as a girlfriend, you need him as a boyfriend. Let me explain.

Heâ€™s a witty person from my expert experience as his friend. He is willing to take charge and own to stuff when things get tough, he is a natural born leader from my experience and take charge of situations if needed be but if not he is a funny and chill guy.

Charismatic, yes, he is charismatic and loving enough for me to write this essay fucking praising him. He is an adventurer, his hobby is riding a mountain bike adventuring into the wilderness. Even if he get lost his cool tempered and pragmatic mind allows him to solve problems step by step.

Did I also mentioned he is 6ft tall?
