Iâ€™m gonna do it but I need some help! Iâ€™m finally going to start writing again. 

Iâ€™ve been a bit depressed with everything going on, as well as Iâ€™m supposed to be moving country but that hasnâ€™t been looking good with the virus. 

But what I love to do is write and it is my dream to write books and screenplays. But Iâ€™m always lacking motivation and I never do it. 

So, this is why I want you all to tell me to write and keep telling me to do it so Iâ€™ll push myself to do it. 

Thank you!
