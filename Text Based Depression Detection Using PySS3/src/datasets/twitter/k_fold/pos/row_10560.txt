My crush just said that she likes me, but I'm not even sure if I like her back anymore? Alright so here's the story. Alt because my friends know my real account.

Just about a month before quarantine started, I got introduced to this girl and I really liked her. We had a ton in common, we had the same sense of humor, etc. And during quarantine we texted eachother frequently. But around 3 months ago, she said she wanted to take a step back and stop texting for a bit because she was feeling depressed and wanted to take a break from social media and all. I was surprised but I of course respected her wishes and told her to text me whenever she was ready. But I found out from some mutual friends of ours that she was making fun of me behind my back because I didn't text her to comfort her from her depression. I was so confused since I respected her break but somehow I was wrong for doing that? Today she said that she's liked me all this time and that she really wanted to talk to me but was "testing me" to see if I was proper boyfriend material. But now I'm not even sure if I like her anymore because of what she did, my feelings are almost conflicting. How should I handle this situation?
