A guilty kill in Among Us I know the game is about killing or surviving but I feel kinda sorry for that girl who saw me vent in upper engine and then I killed her just a second before she called an emergency meeting. I feel sad because we had exactly the same nickname (yeet and yeet 1) but we'll, live is brutal I guess, survival of the fittest etc.
