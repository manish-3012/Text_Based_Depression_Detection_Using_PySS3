Who's more stupid, my brother or me? So when we make our cup noodles, we always pour random temperature of water in at the drawn line, and then we microwave it for 3 minutes. And yesterday, me and my brother were making our own noodles at the same time so we decided to put them in the microwave together. And I said that 3+3=6 so we should set the timer for 6 minutes because it divides the heat... or something. But he disagreed and said that we should still set the timer for 3 minutes because (of a reason i forgot). So we agreed to set the timer for 6 minutes but take them out when 3 minutes are left. And when 3 minutes were left, I took them out and felt them and they were harder than usual. He felt them and agreed with me and said to put them in for the remaining 3 minutes... but still disagrees with me and thinks that he's right.

Who's more stupid here?
