Iâ€™m scared So basically I posted selfies around here, a user (not to be mentioned, due to the possibility of her being an actual girl) DMed me, told me I was hot, and asked if I wanted to â€˜reviewâ€™ her (same age btw). Being the dumb teen that I am, I replied with â€˜uh sure?â€™. Then she asked if I had Kik, I said no, then downloaded it. Then she asked for my username, I gave it to her. Then shit escalated real quick, she sent a picture of herself in yoga gear and I was dumbfounded... then she asked me to take my shirt off, because she thought I was â€˜fitâ€™. I was denying that, but at the same time wondered where this would get me. So then I took my shirt off and then took a picture, her replying with ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜. Then she sent me a picture of her posing in a bathroom, and asked a picture of me in my boxers. I had nothing under my pants at the time, I was just about to sleep, and replied with â€œI got nothing under these pants?â€. Then she pressured me by literally sending a topless pic. I felt so insecure, I snuck into a room to retrieve my undies, she replied with, â€œthis is your only chanceâ€, and that basically pressed on my neck, it felt as if I had to take the picture, I felt as if I didnâ€™t, I would be considered a huge pussy. So then I took a picture of myself in boxers, first checking if I woke anybody in the house up. Then she sent a full on vagina pic, I replied with â€œwoah what noâ€. I did not even realize up until that point that we were â€˜sextingâ€™ the first time I even heard of that word, and now it disgusts me, but I was kind of â€˜in the momentâ€™, and she pressured me for a dick pic. So I sent her a dick pic, then she sent back a full on nude photo, my brain says â€˜FUCKING ABORT DUMBASS WHAT ARE YOU DOINGâ€™ but my horny said otherwise. At that point I was so tipped off the edge, she replied with â€˜jerk off, moan loudly, and cum, record itâ€™ or something like that, too scared to look back and find everything on read. So then I shamefully took a video of me jerking off into a mirror, then releasing, sent it, and no reply, she didnâ€™t even see the video, it was all left on the light D. Iâ€™m scared, what if sextortion happens? What if I get kicked out of school? What if my parents disown me? What if she got in trouble? Why did I agree in the first place if I knew I wasnâ€™t supposed to? I honestly hate myself at this point knowing what I  had just done, I donâ€™t know how to deal with it, I honestly wish things like this would slide but no there would probably be consequences, and Iâ€™m fucking scared
