Coming out to my parents So I am leaning bi but it seems every time I consider telling my parents cause they say theyâ€™ll love me no matter what, they then turn around and insult my friends (sometimes infront of them, and Iâ€™ve overheard them doing it behind my back) specifically over being gay. And all my friends think I should tell them cause either way I barely see them so if they react badly it doesnâ€™t matter, but idk if they even need to know.
Also is the advice flair for asking for advice?
