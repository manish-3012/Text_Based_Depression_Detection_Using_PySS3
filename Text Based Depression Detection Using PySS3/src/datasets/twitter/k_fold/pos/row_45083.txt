Sad By Tinylnd I'll give anything for the worries to go,
I'll give my life for you all,
My death will help people,
Even if I'm not by their side,
My sacrifice will make all problems die,
They will not have to waste their time with me,
They will be allowed to breath in,
As my frequent problem take over,
I try to escape them,
I hate them,
I'm not enought,
Didn't try enought,
Still gave them my all
But still fail,
I've been throught alot
I had enought,
I've seen thing die in front of me,
Nothing helps with all,
I go to bed hoping I dont get up,
But look at the bright side my life will make everybody smile.
