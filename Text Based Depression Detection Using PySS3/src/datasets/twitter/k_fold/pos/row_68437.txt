Everyone please take some time out of their day to congratulate my parents, who finally found a real problem that they can actually blame on me watching television My sister started school before me this year (usually we start at the same time of year) so for a couple weeks I can watch tv most of the day, if I want to, but my sister canâ€™t. Obviously I take time to read, exercise, etc.

Anyways, my dad is working from home for the same reason that my sister is going to school from home: the pandemic. So theyâ€™re both on zoom meetings almost all day.

Zoom, to any reasonable person whoâ€™s used it, is notorious for having slow connections, so having two people on zoom meetings at the same time would screw over anyoneâ€™s connection, right? Wrong, theyâ€™re both using computers that use cable, Iâ€™m using WiFi. 

But my mom doesnâ€™t know the difference and I donâ€™t see the point trying to explain it to her. Sheâ€™s going to turn it into a full-blown argument, then my dadâ€™s going to get involved, and heâ€™ll play the good old totalitarian dictatorship card and change it from being 1 day without TV as an experiment to 1 week or even 1 month as a punishment.

So yeah, everybody please take some time out of their day to congratulate my parents, who finally found a real problem they can actually blame on me watching television.
