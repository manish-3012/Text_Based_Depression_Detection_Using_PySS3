Anyone here play Apex Legends? Im looking for people to play with. Doesnt matter if you're good or not but just in case you're as competitive as me, im plat 4, im trying to get to diamond before the next season starts.

But im down for some casual play too. 

Im on Steam btw, also this is for people from Europe since i play on european servers and im from Turkey (gmt+3). I mostly start playing around 5pm (for gmt thats 2pm) and play until 9pm (6pm for gmt).

Comment if you wanna play with me. Also i dont like using voice chat but i use the in game chat often. Idc if you use your mic or not just know that i dont.
