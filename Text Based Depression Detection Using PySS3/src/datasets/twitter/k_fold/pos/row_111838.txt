Covid, myself and the weather ruined valentine's day already Well it's about 9am right now here I already now this is gonna be a shitty ass valentines day!

First off I already made a post that I feel like dog shit and I didn't even get her a a present, I'm a lazy and stupid idiot just sitting in his room all day.

Then I planned on going to a nice place with her, it's a beautiful flower field with a sea next to it and a week ago we had sun shining and everything.

Now today it's stormy and snowing outside with over -10Â°C

I guess I'll have to rely on making hot chocolate and watching a movie and hope it's not THAT bad...

also my mental health got worse for anyone wondering

Anyways, I hope y'all having a better day than I am and I hope you'll at least can do something nice, thanks for listening.
