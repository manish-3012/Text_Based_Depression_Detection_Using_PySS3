Just got denied So I made a post here about 3 weeks ago (deleted now) asking for advice on a girl . We went out in a group together a load of times and she said some things to me that are not something that you say to someone unless you want to get into a relationship with them. She said " you have a better chance at a relationship with me than he does "(referencing another friend) . She also was doing stuff to me thats pretty inappropriate. Just spoke to her about it since she was acting wierd and she just said "oh sorry for leading you on" . Really pisses me off how someone can treat another person like that and when I get all the confidence I can muster , she denies me. What the fuck. Not in a good place right now and don't know what to do . Am I ugly ? Who the fuck treats me like that and then just decides to say no. She made me so happy whenever I was near her and im just so lost without her. She was one of the girls that makes you plan your life together WHAT THE FUCK....
