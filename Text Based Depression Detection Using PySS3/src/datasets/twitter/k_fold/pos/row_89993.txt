I miss my ex My first real relationship. We were together for 7 months, I know that ain't long but it was the best 5 months of my life. Then corona fucked up our relationship and we started talking less and not being able to hang out and agreed we should end things.

I wish I could have hugged them 1 last time. They said that they wanna stay friends but I've had to inniteate DMs every time and they leave me on read a lot. I just fucking miss the hugs and having somebody to care about me. They were the person who helped me break my self harm addiction and helped me regain the will to live

I fucking miss them
