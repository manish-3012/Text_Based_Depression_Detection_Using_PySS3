how do I support my friend's goals he lately has been into rap and is trying to sing some songs

the song he is singing rn is 3 foot tall which is a song i can't bear hearing i don't like it at all the beat and melody i don't like. he sings it and sends me voice records and so on 

i want to be supportive yet i can't tell him i like his cover of a song i already hate 

when he asks me to criticise him idk what to say to him please can someone help me
