Just deleted my 2 TB homework folder. I'm leaving you guys. I'll comment on this every single day I succeed, in my quest of no jerking off. I hear it makes you feel better as a person. And that's what i mean. Good bye. Itll be a rough journey. 

Day 1:

I got nudes from a FWB. Failed.

REAL DAY 1
Starting now.
