My boyfriend has depression Posting this on my alt because my friends know my main

Iâ€™m 13 and my boyfriend that Iâ€™ve had for around 8 months is going into a depression and is shutting himself off from his friends, family and even me. 
We used to text each other for hours a day and now he texts me once every day or every two days, occasionally talking about his depression and how he constantly feels dead inside. 
I often see his friends and they always ask me if heâ€™s ok and why he isnâ€™t talking to them, and at this point I donâ€™t know what to say, because I want to help him but I donâ€™t know how and when I try and plan to meet up with him in or not in a group, he tells me he has no motivation to do anything and is afraid of seeing people (extreme social anxiety). 

I feel like I need to give him a hug but I canâ€™t because he is barely even leaving his house, and itâ€™s currently school holidays so I donâ€™t get to see him. 
Does anyone know what I can say or do to help him get through it or find motivation to see his friends?

Thanks in advance guys
