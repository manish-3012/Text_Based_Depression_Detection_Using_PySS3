Everyone who is telling me to sleep, I literally cant. I lay in bed like 10hrs a night but cant fucking sleep. Oh, and I have a tolerance to sleeping meds. Music doesnt help, reading and watching something just makes me bored.

I just cant fucking sleep, my brain will crash soon enough. And Im not on my phone for at least 10 hours a night :/
