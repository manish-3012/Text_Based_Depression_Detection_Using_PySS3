Confused on the Carson situiton I read on an article by Prena Nambiar were she shows a tweet saying that the girl Carson was talking to was 17 and Carson was 19, in which case I think this is all being blown out of proportion but I'm not sure if that statement is true

Like, in my country 16 is the age of consent so maybe I'm biased but 17 and 19 doesn't seem like a bad age gap to Me
