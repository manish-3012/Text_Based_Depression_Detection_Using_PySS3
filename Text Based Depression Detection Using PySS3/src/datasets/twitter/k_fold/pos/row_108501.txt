In a few hours I'm going to the psychiatrist And I can't wait. If anyone of you struggles with mental health problems please seek for help. 

This is the second time I'm going to the psychiatrist, and the last time I swear I felt like for the first time someone was understanding me and made me feel... Kind of light if that makes any sense.
