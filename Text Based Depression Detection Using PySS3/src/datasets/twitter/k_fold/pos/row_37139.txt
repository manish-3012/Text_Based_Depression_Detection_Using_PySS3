I Figure This Is A Good Place To Talk About Dieting I'll get down to the very basics very quickly. Extreme diets don't work, extremely restrictive diets don't work, and most fads are just fads and sometimes even bad for you. First things first, keep track of calories when dieting, but don't drop them too low. You need to exorcise and eat the right number of calories to lose weight, otherwise your metabolism will slow down. The exact number depends on what activities you are doing and a lot of your physical traits so a 1 size fits all is not a good solution. If you need help, Michael Mathews has some good books in proper nutrition. Second thing, please don't catch onto super restrictive diets. Not only do they often just not work, but they can lead to serious health problems, be extremely expensive, and they run down your self control which could be better spent elsewhere. Lastly, fads are almost never worth it. Chasing them will get you almost nowhere. If you have serious concerns about your weight or body shape and do want to slim down or bulk up, please look up proper nutrition and make sure you're not just slowing your metabolism. Thank you.
