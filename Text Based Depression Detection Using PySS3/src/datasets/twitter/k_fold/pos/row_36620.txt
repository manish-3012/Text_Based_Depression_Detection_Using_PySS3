I know this isn't the usual stuff this sub get but I need help Our family dog hasn't been her self lately. She's been passing and has barely eaten and wont stop whining. She always wants in her kennel bit the immediately wants out. It's the same for going outside she wants oit but then wants in. Not sure if this helps but a few months ago we lost one of our other dogs. If someone can help find out why this is happening thank you.
