I wonder what happens after death (not encouraging anyone) Yesterday I had an existencial crisis. What really happens after I die? Do I turn into a bodyless soul that can travel the world freely ? Is my body a simple conscious metabolism that will lose its memories after I die ? 

If after I die, and i turn into a soul, then im reborn, do i have a chance to become the shittiest person in the universe ? Do i turn into an animal, that will be abused through its entire poor life? Is the whole universe a creation of my counsciousness to think i exist and am part of something ? Do you have counsciousness ? Is god real ? Can there be a god if souls exist,or not ? What will happen if Earth explodes and all free souls will live without Earth. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk
