Need help, asking a friend out So, I was introduced to her by a friend a couple months back. But we didn't talk much then. For the last month, we've been really hitting it off on text and call mostly (we only met 3 times yet cause of the pandemic). Initially, I was thinking that I wasn't ready to be in a real relationship because my last one had me questioning if I was good enough to be boyfriend material.

But with her, I feel like I want to ask her out so bad but she knows about how I didn't want to be in a relationship and she totally respected that. In fact, when we talked a lot and I was getting those obvious signals that she likes me as well, I had a conversation with her about this and she said that we should stay like we are, because it's great for her and see where it goes next. 

Now, I'm in a place where I think I really want to ask her out but I don't want to do it normally like when we meet. I wanna do something special when I ask her out, can anyone help me with ideas? Also, I'm financially okay, but not that great to give some sort of grand gesture so, if those could be avoided in the advice, I'd be really grateful!
