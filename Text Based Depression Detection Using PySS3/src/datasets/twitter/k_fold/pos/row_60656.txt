Parentsâ€™ Hoarding problem and thereâ€™s roaches. We used to live in a 1 bedroom house and we can use the garage for storage. Now weâ€™re living in a 1 bedroom apartment and there is about a dozen boxes filled with old clothes and random stuff in the living room. Itâ€™s been 1 year since we moved here and itâ€™s still there. Iâ€™ve asked them so many times to move them out and they wonâ€™t budge. I canâ€™t even get inside the room easily because the boxes filled the way. Now we have a roach problem. I saw one on my bed and I canâ€™t even sleep anymore. Theyâ€™re all over the plates, bathroom,etc. I honestly look like a panda right now because of my lack of sleep. I just want to sleep in peace and get rid of all the junk.
