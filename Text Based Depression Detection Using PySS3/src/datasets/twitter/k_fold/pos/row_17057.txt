Man loneliness is a bitch. It compounds everything Iâ€™ve had a lot of time to myself to observe my own mood and behavior. Whenever Iâ€™m with genuine friends for a healthy amount of time per week Iâ€™m so much more optimistic, energetic, and mood stable. 

When I spend lots of time alone, I inevitably become cynical, lethargic, stress compounds Iâ€™m more likely to procrastinate work, and extreme loneliness can cause suicidal feelings. 

Itâ€™s just sad that ever since late high school and now the pandemic, I spend so much time alone and have a hard time making lasting friends. Right now at least I have 1 good friend. But itâ€™s a tough battle spending 70% of my time completely alone nowadays
