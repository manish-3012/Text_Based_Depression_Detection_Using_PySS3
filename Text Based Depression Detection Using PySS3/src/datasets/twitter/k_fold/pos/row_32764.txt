OMG I WON well kinda...


I was one the phone with my crush who rejected me a few weeks ago (I made a post about it) 

We decided to play a game of chess (though an online program)

I won a few games, he won a few games. Btw he normally DOESNT talk to me. Like he doesnâ€™t like me at all. His parents have controls on his phone so he had to go at like 10:30. Right before he hung up he said â€œhey do you wanna do this again tomorrow after school? It was funâ€ and i said â€œyeah totallyâ€ and after he hung up I started screeching. I know it doesnâ€™t mean anything butttttttyt
