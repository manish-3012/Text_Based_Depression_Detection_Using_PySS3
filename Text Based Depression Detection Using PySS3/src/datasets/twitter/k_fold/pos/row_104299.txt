I'm so happy my school is on Zoom and not on a website When Covid started I was doing math on a website that had 1 star (bearly any troll reviews)  and I wanted to smash the computer 

The teachers were so fucking condescending. It sounded like they were making fun of us

I was in 12th grade and they were teaching us like we were 8th graders
