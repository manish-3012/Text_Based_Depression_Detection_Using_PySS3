My lazy ass sister lost the dog and wonâ€™t even look for it. Last night I our pure bred basset hound up in the pen after my sister tryed to sneak him into her room. Well while I was asleep my sister tryed to do it again.

Apparently somebody let the dog outside and he ran off. But my lazy ass sister wonâ€™t look for it because â€œitâ€™s not my fault!â€. For those of yâ€™all that donâ€™t know much about dogs. He was worth eight hundred bucks when we first got him. 

She is the reason he runs off almost 100% of the time. And every time my mom and step dad make me to look for him. I have to literally chase him through other peoples property? Doesnâ€™t matter because Iâ€™m obviously not gunna get shot in the rural usa. Fuck this.
