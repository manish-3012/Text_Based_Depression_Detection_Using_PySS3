Kinda freaking out about the election American polotics are a joke im not supposed to be paying attention to it bc after a few too many mental breakdowns my therapist told me to avoid it but its literaly being shoved down our throats every second reddit keeps trying to reccomend things from r/polotics i look outside and ppl have political signs and flags in their yards i open any sort of app and most of the ads are political and on that note why are the ads made like how every disney channel teen show had that one episode the kids were running for class president and they'd make ads just talking trash about their opponents like instead of talking about what they can do for america the entire ad is posed as overdramatic and them just talking trash about eachother whoever is making the click bait thumbnails for trumps ads needs to be fired they look trashy af both of our top candidates are racist old white guys who are losing their minds
