How the fuck do I force myself to do shit? I literally just donâ€™t care about anything. Iâ€™m so lazy itâ€™s gone to the point where playing video games fees like a chore. I just wake up and do nothing all day, maybe check Twitter or Lurk reddit for a few minutes but I just donâ€™t want to do anything. Everything bores me and everyday since March of 2020 has felt the same. Wake up, turn on a computer to sign into classes, just sit and do nothing until 2pm sign out of classes. Do nothing until I have to eat or go to sleep. I feel like Iâ€™m wasting my life
