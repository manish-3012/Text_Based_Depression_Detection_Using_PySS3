Okay so I've been staying up every night watching my front door for the past few days. For some context someone was infront of our house with a flashlight. We live on a hill in the woods sort of so there's no reason for anyone to be here besides us. They were looking at the trash bags on our front porch with our recycling it tends to fill up because 7 people and we don't live in town. But I've been so damn scared of it I haven't been able to go to sleep at all really I get like 3 hours. And there's so many eery noises at night. Its honestly like a horror movie for hours on end.
