I need some help finding good headphones Hey, so I've wanted to get some good over ear headphones mainly for music and other stuff (so I don't need a full gaming set with all that) but I don't really know what to look for..so if anyone has some recommendations that be amazing! 
I looked some by JBL already cause I already have the I'm ears from them. 
Price range is like up to 90-120 â‚¬ max.
I Mostly need bluetooth maybe sound cancellation and for them to look good tbh 

Again every help is greatly appreciated
