To the US ppl here: How are saunas (private and public) handled in the us? I heard there arent a lot or barrly any saunas in the states and for me as a european where in every bathhouse there is atleast one sauna this sounds soo unbeleaveable. Also how do you handle it. For example in france you go in fully nude public and private. In germany for public saunas you wear your swimsuit and privates you go either blank, swimsuit or a towl.
