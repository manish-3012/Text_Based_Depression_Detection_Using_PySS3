My little brother was talking to me about why I should join my high school's choir Even tho I told him I don't like singing to an audience, I don't like singing with other ppl, and I just don't like music all that much in general.

Idk why he was so keen on trying to convince me, either. I've done choir before and I hated. But just wouldn't shut up about it.

...But then he said he thought I would be a good addition to  my school's choir bc I'm a male. Jesus fucking Christ I felt like I had just gotten stabbed. I almost yelled at him for it before I remembered that he doesn't know I'm trans.

So that was fun
