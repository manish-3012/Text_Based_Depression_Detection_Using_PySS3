hahah I get pissed about small things sometimes Itâ€™s annoying how I say something and people go like â€œa lot of guys relateâ€ but Iâ€™m not a guy and I never indicated I was a guy but itâ€™s an automatic assumption for everyone and I donâ€™t blame them bc I do the same to everyone on here. I hate awkward situations and I donâ€™t like correcting people
