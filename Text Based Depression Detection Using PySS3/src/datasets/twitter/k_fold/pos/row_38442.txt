Joe mama virus vent: Is it me or does it seem like itâ€™s still unnatural to go outside. I know corona is still not over, but it feels like it is. Many places in my area have opened up, though with a mask policy. I just find it so odd. Itâ€™s probably because Iâ€™ve hardly been outside besides groceries or work. Like the other day, I went out with a few friends and asked me if I wanted to go to this restaurant. I was confused at first because I thought everything was still closed. But apparently not. It still feels so odd to me. It still feels like corona just only happened. It still feels like that time period where everyone was playing animal crossing and post about how â€œtheyâ€™re gonna be productive during quarantineâ€. I still donâ€™t believe that my â€œgraduationâ€ happened. It just feels like time is slipping by. I honestly donâ€™t know how to feel about it.
