Adults are people too!! What I've noticed from time-to-time here and in real life is that some teenagers often just say that they hate adults either for no apparent or some stupid reason (i.e. they did something wrong, got what they deserved but felt like it was unjustified while bitching about adults in general). Don't get me wrong, there ARE adults who are just plain stupid and go against any social norm just to make a point (i.e. "Karens"). 


They have their motivations, their reasons and their own beliefs. Learning until death is something we should all live by. Sometimes they stop trying because they can't keep up. They did their best and are upset when they see how young people think they can do whatever they want, disturbing the picture of the perfect world they made. 


Hating on your parents can be justified but keep in mind: they want the best for you. There are some exceptions but in general, they want you to be someone and will always support you, even if you don't see it.
My dad is a hard working guy in his early 50s. He is a peasant but not in the vulgar way. He is an honest worker down to the bone and will probably die while driving his MTZ on the fields. Love him. Why? Because despite being so old, complaining about us doing jackshit the whole day and thinking that when we go with him to help is a torture, he loves and cares about us. He has little to no time with his family, but when he does, he appreciates it. He accepts things work different and tries to adapt, but ultimately relies on my mom when it comes to these matters. 


Your teachers are your second parents. There are cool teachers and there are slightly less cool teachers. 
My literature/grammar teacher is laid back, takes things easy but her job seriously and accepts that the world is changing. Maybe because of the subject she teaches, but one thing is certain: we adore her. She is always honest, never hides a thing and openly talks about subjects others refrain of. Even better: she asks our opinion! 

Then there is my history teacher who is not only stubborn but should have retired and it shows!!! She doesn't even try when it comes to changing! She just bitches about everything, even when it's in her best interest! Like seriously, her biggest complaint about the whole virus thing was that "Why did they announce this whole thing at 10 PM??" Bitch you are up until 1 AM, why is it a problem? Middle-Europe was dangerous from the end of WW2 until the early 90s when the regime change came. She clearly comes from that time along with most veteran teachers in our school, but she is the most boomer boomer I've ever seen.

Over the course of the last year, I realised how much I've matured. I don't jump to conclusions but try to investigate as much as I can. I try to be responsible for myself, my money and my family and friends. I also see why some people are the way they are. Being spoiled from birth, divorce, child being transgender and so on. There is always a reason. But there is no reason to not change. 

TL;DR: Adults can be assholes, but they did their best to change the world and are upset because we often don't appreciate what we have and instead of improving it, we make it worse.
