How I likely avoided one hell of a situation This likely would fit in r/creepypms. 

About six months ago I made a post and then someone sent me a pm I'll call them amj now he started off by just saying I seemed really cool so no red flags there and I initiate a regular conversation with him.

Then at midnight is where the convo took a slightly dark turn....

He said he had to go since he was at a strip club and a hooker was there which was weird since he knew I was 14 I told him only for the next day to ask me to come there like wtf bro I'm 14 this is when I should have blocked him but I didn't...

This immediately gave me pedo vibes then here is the bad part he asked where I lived and I gave him very little information on that ofc but then he asked an odd request he wanted me to search a specific place which I found very odd then I turned off my Google location and guess what happened the next day he said I lied about where I lived!?!? I immediately blocked this mf.

Btw before I end this off I have a question i heard people can track the person who most recently searched something on Google I didn't search it(the specific place) since I've heard of this but is that true because that would be just more evidence of him being a pedo
