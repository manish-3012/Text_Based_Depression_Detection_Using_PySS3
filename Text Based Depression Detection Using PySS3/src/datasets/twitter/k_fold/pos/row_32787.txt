(F16 idk if thatâ€™s important) Me and my best friend used to call eachother our wives as a joke and it was fun then I started to develop a crush on her and I know she liked me back because sheâ€™s said sheâ€™s had a crush on everyone in my friend group at one point. But then she got a boyfriend which made me really sad. I think sheâ€™s the reason I know Iâ€™m bi and I helped her find out sheâ€™s pan. Itâ€™s been a while, they broke up and I think sheâ€™s over him. I think I still like her but sheâ€™s going sixth form and Iâ€™m going college so we wonâ€™t see eachother everyday like we used to. 

Should I try get over her or keep hoping weâ€™ll get together one day
