Check out the new episode of my podcast where we go over all of 2020's major events! My podcast, called "A Second Impression", is a podcast that covers divisive topics that teenagers care about today with fresh and interesting perspectives. We've covered topics like cancel culture and the death penalty. But to celebrate the new year, we cover all of 2020's major events. I think the best way to start the new year is by taking a look back and laughing at what we lived through this past year. Check us out at [anchor.fm/secondimpressionpodcast](https://anchor.fm/secondimpressionpodcast), or just look up "A Second Impression" on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. This is a passion project of mine and I would really appreciate it if you guys could check it out. Happy new year!
