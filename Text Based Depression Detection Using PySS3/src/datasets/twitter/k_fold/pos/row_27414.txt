Is this common? So I dont know if this is a common thing that parents get annoyed about. My parents (mostly my dad) tend to get really annoyed or angry if I don't use headphones when talking to my friends on the phone. If I don't use headphones, no matter where he's at or what he's doing, if my dad hears me not using headphones while talking on the phone he will immediately come up to my room and yell at me. Do other parents get annoyed about this? Or is it just my parents??
