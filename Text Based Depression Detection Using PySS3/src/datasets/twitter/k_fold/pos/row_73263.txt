As in introvert, I'm more excited about turning 17 then 16 I'm 15 rn with a birthday in December, and yeah, sure I'll be able to drive when I turn 16, which is cool I guess but I don't really leave the house unless it's with my parents anyways so whatever.  


But 17, oh boy. Because, you see, my parents let me play e10 games when I was 7, T games when I was 10, but for some reason are ADAMANT that I must be 17 to play M games (although I convinced them to let me get Skyrim, but no more). So yeah, driving is nice and all but being able to play whatever I want without anyone being able to stop me, that's what I'm looking forwards to.
