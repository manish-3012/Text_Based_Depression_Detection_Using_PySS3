Yo I just found this out and wanted to share it with someone so here we go. A distant but also not so distant relative is good friends with Bill Murray... yes THE Bill Murray. Also Iâ€™m not saying this for attention, this is real, I know the guy whoâ€™s friends with him but didnâ€™t find out until now. Imma put how they met here cause Iâ€™m bored. So my family member (weâ€™ll call him Jeff) was at a casino when Bill Murray walks in and Jeff goes â€œisnâ€™t that the guy from (insert movie here). And they were friends from then on.
