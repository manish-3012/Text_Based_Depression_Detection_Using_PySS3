I just did the 16personality test and I highly recommend I got INFP â€œMediatorâ€ personality type. It was so cool to read. I always feel so stupidly unique and unable to relate to some peopleâ€™s actions. After the test I found out thereâ€™s a whole personality type of people just like me!! It was amazing to see. Itâ€™s like if a person analyzed my personality for 5 years and then wrote down everything. Its pretty accurate if you answer the questions honestly.
