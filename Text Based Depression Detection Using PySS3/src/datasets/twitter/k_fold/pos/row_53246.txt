Girlfriend is pregnant sooo i fucked up, and...my girlfriend is pregnant, totally was NOT prepared for this. i feel like a deadbeat, i don't even have my license yet, but i'm getting it very soon. it's just the realization of having a baby that's really pushing me work harder than ever before. i'm scared, guys...ngl, i'm this young having a kid, but in a weird way....i'm excited to be having a baby. sorry about the rant, i just feel like people will listen to me here, thank you:)
