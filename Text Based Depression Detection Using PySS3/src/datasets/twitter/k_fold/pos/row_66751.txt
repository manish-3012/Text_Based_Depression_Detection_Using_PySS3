Guys I have a question So like im 17 and so my dating options are limited in the people I spend the most time around(other teenagers) since like 15 is really pushing it so I feel like I can only really see 16, or 17 year olds, snd like 18 feels too old to go for at the same time? Idk tell me your opinions on what the age range should be idk
