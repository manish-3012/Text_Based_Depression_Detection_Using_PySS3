stan twitter is such a fucking mess it's always the kpopies

like can they please chill out for a week

like right now it's the BTS stans saying BTS paved the way for blackpink?? it has really sexist undertones. I even seen someone be like

"men can and never will be able to pave the way for women" and someone called them sexist-

do these people not have better hobbies? like read a book, go for a walk, play a game? K-pop idols aren't gonna fuck you no matter how much you defend them
