Officially 6 months free of trichotilomania. If hou don't know what trichotilomania is, it's basically a form of OCD that makes you have the irresistible urge to pull out your hair. Only 2% of the population struggles with it. I've been struggling with it for 5 years now. Since the end of 4th grade. It made my life a living hell. But finally after all these years of bullying and suffering, I've managed to break free.
