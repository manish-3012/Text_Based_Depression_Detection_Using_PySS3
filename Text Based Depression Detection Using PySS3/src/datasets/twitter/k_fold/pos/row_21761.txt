welcoming a relapse first day of senior year is tomorrow and so is the first day of training for my first ever job. honestly i am not opposed to the idea of relapsing. i mean i would like to know one person who can manage babysitting 3 kids and everyoneâ€™s school work including their own while having a job and being expected to do no less house work. 
i mean a little xanny never hurt me.
