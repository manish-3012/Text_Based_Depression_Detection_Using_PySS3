its getting bad again i can feel myself drowning and i just dont see the point to swimming up

i tried that multiple times already and everytime it doesn't make a difference so why try

some of my closest friends just randomly decided to ghost me after i was grounded for 2 weeks and i relapsed the other night so theres nothing im rlly fighting for anymore

dont rlly know why im posting this. maybe someone will give it a wholesosome award
