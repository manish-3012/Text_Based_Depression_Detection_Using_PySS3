at this point I've heard the term "yee yee ass haircut" too many times for it to still be a coincidence Like, seriously. I feel like I'm being targeted by Chrome's statistics or something, including Reddit, YouTube, and general search results. My FBI agent thinks I need to fix this yee yee ass haircut, so fixed it shall be. Anyone else got a quarantine yee yee ass haircut?
