My dad always tells everyone to always be honest...  

Just finished eating...

Dad: would you like to put the plates back?

Me: no, not really

Dad: is that a serious answer?

Me: yeah.

Dad: proceeds to lecture me despite he tells everyone to always be honest, then tells me to leave his sight.

Me: ok. \*leaves\*
