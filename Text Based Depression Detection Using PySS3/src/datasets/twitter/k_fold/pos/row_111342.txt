What would y'all want from therapy? I've been "lurking" for a while around here and have run into quite a few posts where we have fellow teens going to therapy, or they've GONE to therapy, or they're avoiding therapy.

It seems to certain degree that THAT help isn't really fulfilling what it should.

So, I want to ask: what would people who are going to therapy like?

Some people say that therapists pretend to listen, while they don't care. Others say they are very optimistic in their perspective. Etc etc.

I would really appreciate responses :)

TL;DR: why therapy no work aaaaa tell pls k thx bye

Have a nice weekend.
