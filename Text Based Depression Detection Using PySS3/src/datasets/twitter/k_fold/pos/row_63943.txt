Yeye my dad let me drive his new Porsche in a parking lot He has a brand new 718 gt4, and it's freaking amazing. 

There is so much road feel in the steering wheel, the transmission clicks into place, it brakes like a fucking champ (except the brakes are squeaky, but that's just high performance brakes for ya), it hands super well, it shifts amazingly, it's just an amazing car.
