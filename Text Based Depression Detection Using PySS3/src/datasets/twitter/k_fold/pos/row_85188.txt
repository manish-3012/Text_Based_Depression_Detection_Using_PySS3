I am a cafeteria worker and I need to figure out what teenagers eat. I recently started as a sous chef at a boarding/private school in my area. I am hired to create sweets for the teens to buy between 8-10 am. I have not been able to make an item that sells more than 2-3 a day. I am unsure what the tastes of teens are. 

If you wanted a sweet thing for breakfast, baked good, frozen, etc. what would you get?
