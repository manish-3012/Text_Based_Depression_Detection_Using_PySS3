I need some help pls I feel so lonely. Basically everyone one I know went to a party for Halloween. I went to one, but I didnâ€™t know anyone and most of them were older than me. I was pretty awkward at times, not knowing anyone. Sometimes I was just standing there. How do I get more social with my peers and make new friends in large groups and get invited to this kinda stuff.
