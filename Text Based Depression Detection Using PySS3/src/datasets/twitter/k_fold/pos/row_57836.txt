OI. YOU. YES YOU.... wanna join a modded minecraft server? OI. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE ON OUR MINECRAFT SERVER. It's a modded server using the latest version of Forge. We have a kitchen mod, space mod, 2 weapons mods and a nuke mod. What more could you want? It's a psuedo-roleplay where each player takes on the role of a country. You'll be put in creative to build your base next to the Walmart version of the UN.

&amp;#x200B;

Rules:

* Don't be sexist racist, etc. Just don't be a dick.
* DON'T USE THE BALEFIRE BOMB. Please for the love of all that's holy don't use it.
* Follow the rules set out by the UN. If you're gonna go to war with someone, you gotta declare it in the UN meetings.

Message me for further details!

Please note that the server does tend to lag and the Flans mod we have can be a little laggy. I'm able to run mine with 8 GB of ram, so you don't have to have a high-end computer, but you can't have a really bad one. STILL - you never know until you try the server!
