Iâ€™ve been going to a new school and I have a crush. So, Iâ€™ve been going to a new school, and itâ€™s a lot better than my old one. One of my friends (who will remain nameless) Iâ€™m attracted to. Sheâ€™s really pretty, really kind and funny, and I really enjoy hanging out with her. 

We sit next to each other during class, during lunch, we even play among us on the bus and at home. So, r/teenagers, I need your help. Iâ€™d like to text her soon to tell her I like her, but Iâ€™m not quite sure what to say. 

Btw, Iâ€™ll be going to her house for a Halloween party in a week, Iâ€™ll get to hang out with her there too.  So, does anyone know whatâ€™s should say exactly? I feel like I should tell her soon because if I donâ€™t I might regret it. So, can I have some advice?
