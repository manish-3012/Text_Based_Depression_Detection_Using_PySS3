I wrote this to myself a couple of weeks ago, figured it was worth sharing. Youâ€™re weird, but only in the eyes of those who see you as such, for every individual has a variant threshold compared to the next of what they conceive to be â€œweirdâ€. The same concept can also apply towards every individualâ€™s views of normality. That said, one can be seen as weird by a certain group of people that see themselves as normal, but that group will inevitably be seen as weird by another group that sees themselves as normal, and that group by an other, and so forth and so on, creating an endless loop of weird and normal, intertwining throughout society and the human race as a whole, thus meaning that no matter who you are, where youâ€™re from, what you like, or how you live life, youâ€™re neither weird nor normal yet youâ€™re both at the same time.
