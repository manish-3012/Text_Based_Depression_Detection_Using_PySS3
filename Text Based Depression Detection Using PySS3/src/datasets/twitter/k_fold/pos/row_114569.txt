You Guys Donâ€™t Have To Read I Just Wanted To Vent &lt;(â€˜â€™&lt;) Hey, Iâ€™m on mobile so the formalities, etc... anyways it may not be much to others but, it hurt me a lot. My family is confusing so to simplify I Change stuff up.

Characters: OP=Take a guess, U=Grandmaâ€™s Brother (uncle), LC=Uâ€™s grandson (cousin).

Settings: Point A, Point B, House 1 and House 2.

Me and My immediate family live in Point B while the rest live in Point A. We are taking a trip to Point A for 4 days. We are staying at H1 for our trip, I head over to socialize with family living at H2. They have an elliptical, I ride it for a while it fine I go back to H1. For the remainder of the trip I had not gotten on the elliptical again (important). We visit all of our family and spend time with them, which we eventually head home. When we get home the next day thereâ€™s a voicemail on my phone, and dialogue goes as follows:

(Translated From Spanish)
U: Why The F*ck did OP break my elliptical?! Heâ€™s such a F**king B*tch!! 

(Canâ€™t remember the rest).

My whole family saw who actually broke it, they were upset at this outrageous message. It was LC when he was play with other family, he started slamming it, kicking it and more. The Worst Part is, is that Uâ€™s family blames me. I wasnâ€™t even there at the time.

Anyways, it feels better to get this off my chest. I was in tears, this just hurt me.

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk!
