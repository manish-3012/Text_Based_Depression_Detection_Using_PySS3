Am I â€œdepressedâ€ or am I just lacking motivation? Or purpose. So I saw a post on insta with a picture of a mansion and the caption said â€œHow would you feel if you woke up in this mansion?â€.  All the comments would say 

â€œOmg I would cry of happinessâ€  

â€œDREAM COME TRUEâ€ 

â€œParty Time!!â€

And honestly I just thought to myself that I wouldnâ€™t feel any different. I would still feel kinda idk. A bit empty. Idk why I made this post
