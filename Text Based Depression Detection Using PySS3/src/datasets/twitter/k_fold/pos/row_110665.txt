i feel bad for my teacher My teacher Mr. Downing, who weâ€™ll call Mr D is very sad

to begin with hes boring so chances are he gets shitted on by the students, he isnâ€™t married and he plays league of legends, nothing wrong with that but that makes me think he has no friends outside of gaming.

i can tell he is depressed, or at the very least mega lonely, i want to help him but idk how to just message him and say â€œaye bro, you lonely?â€ it breaks my heart to think that heâ€™s probably microwaving a pizza rn and eating it alone, he asked me what pog meant last week. 

is there a way to ask him if heâ€™s sad the best way possible? he seems to really like talking about his passions so iâ€™ve been asking him a lot of history questions just to keep him active. please help.
