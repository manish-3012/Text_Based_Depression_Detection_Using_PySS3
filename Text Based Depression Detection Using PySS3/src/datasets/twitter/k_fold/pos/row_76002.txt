Guys, please read what I have to say. It will be worth your while. Sometimes, you may feel you have nobody to talk to at home or at school, or may seem powerless in your situation, like you can't change things no matter how hard you try. Especially children and teenagers, who's brain and body are still developing, and sometimes we don't know what we are feeling, or how to even handle certain situations. But I wanted to tell you. No matter what the situation is, you have the power to make a change, even if it takes some time.  I am going to make a change by being a psychologist, but I'm still a teen, and that is years and years from now, I haven't even entered college. Some things, you can change. Right now. But sometimes, we have no idea how. And sometimes, we have a hard time just adjusting to change. I wanted to let everybody know. You are not alone. You have the power to achieve your dreams.

Use this comment section to vent or rant about anything you feel you need to say, whether you think it is big or small. Me, or another kind person will reply. And if you feel you need to, you can PM me and vent or rant about anything you feel you need to let out, if you feel you truly have nobody else to talk to in your life, or even if you do, and you just need to get it out anyway. 


You matter, you are not alone, and you have the power to make change.
