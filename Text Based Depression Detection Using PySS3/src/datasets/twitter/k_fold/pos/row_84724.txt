Alright, i have a question. So how do i know that the red im seeing is the same red that you are seeing ?

how could you prove that my red isnt your green ? 

how do you know that the blue color im seeing isnt your red ?

because it would look naturall to you anyways since you wouldnt know what red it in my vision vs your vision

How do you know that fire isnt green to me  (traditional green but i dont know what your greens look like) ? but green is red to you ?
