I hate it that men feel uncomfortable when I compliment them Like, bro, we get it, you ainâ€™t gay, but Iâ€™m not flirting with when I tell you that your t-shirt is kinda cool. Get over yourself lmao. 

Why canâ€™t people take genuine compliments??? Iâ€™m not even being creepy or telling them anything inappropriate. Just the most basic of compliments.

Also, bare in mind I barely compliment strangers, most of the time itâ€™s friends.
