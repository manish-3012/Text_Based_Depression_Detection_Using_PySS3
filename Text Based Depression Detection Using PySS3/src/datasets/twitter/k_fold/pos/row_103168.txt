My cousin's children just came over and I'm literally so stressed about it I hate kids.I would never go anywhere near them.I'm a teen and still a kid too but little kids like toddlers they kinda scare me and I get so stressed out around them hearing them screaming walking around doing whatever they want.

I want to lock myself in my room rn but I cant do that.Ive been hiding in the kitchen for more than an hour now getting stressed out every second I literally cant do anything else someone help.what should I do?
