People actually be telling their mums about their crushes/SOs Like why. My mom keeps asking "who do you like" "do you have a girlfriend" I'm gonna make her think I'm single forever which I probably will be tbh l0l. Also idk it's embarassing. Like I'm not religious and my parents condone it and stuff but it just feels weird for me to talk with even my friends about romantic stuff. So why do people talk to their parents about it?
