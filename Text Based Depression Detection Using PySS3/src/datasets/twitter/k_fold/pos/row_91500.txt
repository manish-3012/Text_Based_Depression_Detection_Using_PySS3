My family is loud for no reason... this is my first post here lol. anyways, iâ€™m a lil mad rn bc iâ€™m a gamer, but my family doesnâ€™t understand that i talk to other ppl when iâ€™m playing. iâ€™m not allowed to have a tv in my room so iâ€™m forced to play in my living room. as it is, most activity happens in the living room, but when you see someone playing a game and talking with a headset on, do you think itâ€™s appropriate to yell or start talking abt embarrassing things that you wouldnâ€™t want other ppl to hear if the roles were reversed?? iâ€™m in a party with a friend, first time i talk to him with my mic on and weâ€™re playing a game. as it is i didnt talk much at first bc of the noise and he said he didnâ€™t really care abt the noise so i kept my mic on and was having a conversation with him. i have an older brother whoâ€™s walking around the house shouting (in a joking way bc heâ€™s just loud, but still) and my mom whoâ€™s saying all these embarrassing things that are so out of pocket. when the roles are reversed and theyâ€™re on the phone, iâ€™m quiet and respectful but whatâ€™s the difference between me and them? 

i know it seems like a stupid reason to be mad, but iâ€™m finally finding and making friends who i can chill with and during this quarantine i just wanna make friends...
