I just listened to the story of Ted the Caver That was genuinely the scariest story Iâ€™ve ever heard. I was gripped. The setup is super slow, but it builds atmosphere, and the climax of the story literally had me shaking. That story got the most emotion out of me Iâ€™ve ever experienced from any media (besides laughter cause Iâ€™ve seen some hilarious shit and it shouldnâ€™t count)

If you have 2 hours and happen to not have a crippling fear of caves, why not go acquire one?
