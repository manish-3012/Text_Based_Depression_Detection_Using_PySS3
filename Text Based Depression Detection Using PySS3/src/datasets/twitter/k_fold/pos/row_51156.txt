Why do people not like me I feel ignored and second grade when ever Iâ€™m around other people and that Iâ€™m weird in their eyes, honestly I feel like shit most of the time. I just want to be appreciated by the people around me not like Iâ€™m some kind of monkey exhibit for people too look at like Iâ€™m worthless
