Do you have a job? Why or why not and what is it?

I don't work (fully aware of how terrible and spoiled this sounds) because my grandparents already give me lots of money to the point where a minimum wage job would be so little and I'd rather just have fun. I do work as a marketing intern for a swimwear company though :)
