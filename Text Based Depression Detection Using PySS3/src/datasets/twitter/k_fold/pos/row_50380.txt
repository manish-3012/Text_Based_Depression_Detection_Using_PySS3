My Nasty Sister Is Borrowing My Books And I Am Flipping Out I donâ€™t like her. I wouldnâ€™t call her a girl, because well, girls donâ€™t make you repulsed. Some are more pretty then others, but overall, I havenâ€™t seen a girl that made me repulsed and want to evacuate,  but I have seen such a sister. 

I canâ€™t explain why I donâ€™t like her, but I think she is nasty. Could he how she was young, but at the same time I have simped on girls her age before, so itâ€™s likely not. Could he a natural repulsion or something mental, but I just know I hate her.

Well yesterday, she tried to borrow some books. I kept her from doing that. I screamed at her to put them back with all my might and ability, until my thought was sore. She ended up surrendering and putting them back, crying. Like WTF you were antagonizing me and then you cry when I put a stop to it.  I felt proud for protecting my books from her nastiness.  

Well I couldnâ€™t protect them for long, because today my parents made me give her a book or Iâ€™d lose my phone. I actually opted to give up my phone to protect them. They realized their tricks wouldnâ€™t work and just instead gave her the book even when I insisted they take my phone instead.  

Now all I can think about is how she is touching them with her nasty-ass grubby hands and it will now smell like her. I kid you not, she has a smell. It isnâ€™t a BO smell or typical nasty smell, she has a typical smell. That smell is naturally bad and smelly because it is associated with her.

I try to avoid breathing the same air as her. In the car with her, I sit close to air vents and breath air straight from the vents to avoid the recycled â€œher airâ€ because I donâ€™t want to share air with her.

My family insists sheâ€™s my sister but I refuse to recognize that. She is simply not good enough to qualify as a sister in my books
