My boyfriend and I aren't celebrating Valentine's Day, and it's honestly so silly that our friends all think we're really weird for it or that something's wrong. A) we're teenagers. Which I guess is the group that celebrates this holiday the most? But still, maybe we just don't want to go all out for something like that?

B) It's not a real holiday! We both think it's just a greeting care company, capitalistic holiday that has no purpose when we know we love each other and show it every day. 

C) Christmas just recently passed, and his birthday and our anniversary are soon, so it'd just be a lot to get gifts for all in a row.

Can people just stop thinking we're weird and then proceed to be quiet if I maybe/maybe not buy the Valentine's chocolate at a discount the day or so after?!
