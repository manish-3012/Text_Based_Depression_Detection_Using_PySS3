did anyone else play really weird obscure mobile games when they were younger my parents donâ€™t really like videogames and i only had a wii when i was little, so i mainly played mobile games. and now that i look at them now they were really weird, like i can see all the games i used to play back in 2012 and theyâ€™re all super obscure games.

doesnâ€™t mean i didnâ€™t enjoy them, some of them were really fun
