I got Rick rolled by a radio So I work at a wood processing company and I was just doing the same as usual, dragging the wood to the machine. We always have a radio on, as it is pretty boring to do the same for 8 hours without any music.
And then it happened. I heard the start of the song and I knew it immediately. I got Rick rolled by a damn radio!

I do like the song tho, it's not bad
