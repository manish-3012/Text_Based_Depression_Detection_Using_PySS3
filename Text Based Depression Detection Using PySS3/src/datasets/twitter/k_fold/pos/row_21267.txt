Why must my family be so loud It's 10 pm, I've been trying to sleep for 2 hours so I can wake up early and be productive tomorrow. Only my parents are home and yet they don't stop making noise, they basically shout when talking to each other, my mom wanders around singing, whatever they're doing (tearing cardboard maybe?) is excruciatingly loud. I can't use headphones cuz my phone will die, I can use ear plugs because then I won't hear my alarm, and I can't tell them to shut up because they wouldn't listen anyways.

Plus they leave the heating on even tho the house is much warmer than it needs to be and space heaters exist 

Am very frustrated
