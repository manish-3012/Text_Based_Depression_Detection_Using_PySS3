I donâ€™t even know anymore So yeah. 

One of my best friends has like completely ghosted me. Like out of no where.

We had texted last weekend but she hasnâ€™t texted me or talked to me at school or anything but i donâ€™t even know what i have done wrong because i havenâ€™t even said anything? 

I have voices in my head telling me 2 things. 

1 is anxiety saying iâ€™m stupid and messed up and do everything wrong and the other one is trying hard to fight back but isnâ€™t winning. 

Now i feel kinda like i hate myself because my friends are kinda drifting away and one has just completely gone now and i donâ€™t even know why.

I want to say this is an oof but it just hurts.
