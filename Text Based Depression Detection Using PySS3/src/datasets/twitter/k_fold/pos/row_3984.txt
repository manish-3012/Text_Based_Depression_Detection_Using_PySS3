Getting unfriended from Snapchat Hi, so this is kinda weird that it even bothers me tbh. But this girl who I kinda compared myself to, suddenly unfriended me on Snapchat yesterday. I honestly donâ€™t know why. We never really talked on there tho (a few times), but she posts a lot of pictures on her story, and all of the sudden I didnâ€™t see her posting. So I just looked up her name and then it said that she didnâ€™t add me (said that it was â€œin processâ€ with the gray arrow). Which is weird because she still follows me on Instagram, and I can still watch her story. I know I shouldnâ€™t be upset by this tho, but it kinda makes me sad. Anyone knows why someone would do that? I mean she has a lot of people on Snapchat so itâ€™s kinda weird to remove someone. Maybe Iâ€™m just overthinking it a bit?
