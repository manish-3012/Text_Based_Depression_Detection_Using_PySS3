what do I SAY if a girl says she has a boyfriend after I ask her out. Like I am not scared of getting rejected but her saying â€œI have a boyfriendâ€ and I just awkwardly standing there and saying â€œok.â€ And just walking off. What would be the best thing to say?

And I deleted the last post because some were speculating I wouldnâ€™t accept the fact they are dating.
