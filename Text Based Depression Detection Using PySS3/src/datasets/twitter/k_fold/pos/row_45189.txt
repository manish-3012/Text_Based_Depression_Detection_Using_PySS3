This jerk has crossed the line Iâ€™m looking for advice on what to do so please let me know
Recently Iâ€™ve gotten into a relationship with this girl, and sheâ€™s absolutely amazing. And on the rare occasion that I do get in a relationship I usually try my best to keep it a secret and only tell the people I trust most. But unfortunately the information has gotten into the hands of a jerk who canâ€™t keep his mouth shut. It started out with the normal banter but tonight he crossed the line. He DMâ€™d my Girlfriend Via my discord server which he had joined a few minutes before he DMâ€™d her, and heâ€™s trying his absolute hardest to break us up. What to I do in this situation? Iâ€™ve advised my girlfriend to block him which she did, and I obviously banned him. But most likely he will attempt to do more.
