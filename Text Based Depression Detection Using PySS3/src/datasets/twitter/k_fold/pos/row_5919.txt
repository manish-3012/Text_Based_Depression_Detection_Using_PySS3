Something hurt me just now. I can't say whether it was the cartilage in this fried chicken

or the tendency to lie at an angle so as to hold my best friends up

.. or the way I walk on unevenly tread shoes 

I can't say what, if anything there's, to do 

the prenup of friendship split on the rocks of shaken-up stuff,

of the tenuated tongue-tied interruptivity of every frickin'

moment I held your soul as it cried - dry-eyed enough to be tough

..or the way I walk on unevenly tread blues. 

..I lay the flower of my trust on another gravestone.. 

and roll against the tomb another chicken bone: 

the tread is a march of masqued tenor; A bird

of no one's monochromatic feather, 

I am none at all to be kept not under a rug swept -- 

discard or stow, I am grateful 

grateful. 

I had one more of you to know.
