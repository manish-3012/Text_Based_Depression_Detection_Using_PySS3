so my aunt who hates my guts accused me of being a mental person who has actually lost their mind. huh.(rlly long ass story lol)


yk I was rlly actually going to just laugh it off bcs often times when ppl say "You're crazy" they dont mean the crazy that applies to mental people in a psychiatric hospital??

I was just talking to myself while I was cooking in the kitchen and she heard me laughing and saying smtg,dude its ntg serious I was just thinking about how my tchr commented on my homework,she said "Good job!You are a very talented person.Wonderful job completing your work." And I just thought that was funny bcs me?Talented?That's a huge ass joke.

So I was laughing out loud while thinking about it in my head and saying things out loud,and she got mad at me.

She got mad at me for laughing.WTF?Idk why she hates me so much.I dont think I've ever done smtg so bad to her that I deserve getting her insults and criticizes every single day and have her shit talk about me behind my back and in front of me like half of my life.

She was a better person when I was rlly little.Idk why shes become like this to me.I swear I just exist and breathe and she hates me for that.

So anyways she yelled at me and demanded me to tell her the reason why I was talking to myself and called me a crazy person/psycho and wondered if I lost my mind.


yo that shit was funny at first but now that I'm thinking about it,its really disrespectful and offensive not just to me but to people who actually have mental illnesses.

She even said that to my brother,that I've gone mental.He told me that,I wouldn't have known that she said that to him if he didnt tell me.She's probably telling my grandma the same thing about me soon enough lol
