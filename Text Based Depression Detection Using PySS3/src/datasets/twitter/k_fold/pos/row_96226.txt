I've reached the "Everything is going to be fine" part of life planning Ok so tell me if I'm being delusional. (Australian)

I'm at the back end of year 10 now (third last year of high school) and have made my plan for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna

Work my ass off in year 11

Campaign the shit out of the Prefecture Elections (School Captain) and become a Prefect and reform the shit out of everything

Smash the HSC Prelims

Do early ANU application in year 12

Do well in the HSC and not fuck up the ATAR

Go to ANU. (PoliSci or International Relations or something)

&amp;#x200B;

it's not gonna happen is it? I suppose most people make these sort of plans, but now, I don't know whether I shoot for the fucking moon, or try and be more "realistic"
