My State is stupid Basically Covid is getting really quite bad again where I live but the state says they will do everything in their power to stop the Schools from closing. So basically the virus is worse right now than in may but now they aren't locking down beacause they are to afraid there *poor* economy will get affected. Well if everyone is sick beacause students bring this fucking virus home then your economy is fucked anyway so they might aswell close everything before it gets too bad.
