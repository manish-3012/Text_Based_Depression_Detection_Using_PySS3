Let's clear some things up here I've been seeing a lot of transphobia going around, so I'm here to clear some things up.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first. **Being trans and/or having gender dysphoria does** ***not*** **signify a mental illness.** Many people who are trans experience gender dysphoria, which occurs when people feel they can't live up to -- or feel restricted by -- their gender, or don't match up with how they were born.

Gender to dysphoria comes in many different forms, such as depression, anxiety, and more. A direct quote from a transgender woman: "Gender dysphoria is something that is painful. It hurts. It's... looking in the mirror and thinking, "Holy heck. Who is that person? Who am I looking at? Is that- Is that someone that's come into my house?" And then realizing, no, that's just- that's just me in the mirror."

Second important thing to note: **You don't have to change your body to be trans.** You can identify as a certain gender without your body matching that, although it is more difficult in many cases. Being non-binary, and going by they/them pronouns, is still being trans and has nothing to do with someone's body. It's their identity.

Think of it this way. If you are reading this and still disagree, you are almost certainly cisgender, meaning you identify as the gender you were born with. Can you imagine yourself as being the other gender? Try, for a second.

If you can: Then you already understand more than many. If you can imagine it, then you can put yourself in the shoes of someone who *wants* to do that, who *wants* to be a different gender than they are. It's a normal thing that happens all the time, and you are so close to accepting it. I'm proud of you.

If you cannot: Then imagine you were born as the other gender. If you are a boy and cannot imagine being a girl, imagine being *born* a girl. Imagine being stuck as someone you aren't. Imagine if your body somehow changed, right now, to the other gender; you'd identify the same. Just because your body changes doesn't mean you do, and you don't have to identify with how you look.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly: **You don't have to agree, or be trans yourself. But you need to hate people for what they do, not who they are.** I understand that you might disagree with being trans because of your religion, or how you were raised. That is perfectly fine. But you need to accept this community for what it is, instead of telling trans people that they are wrong, or mentally ill, or stupid.

Some of you think trans people go to hell. That the entire LGBT+ community is tortured for all eternity because of our "sinful ways." So, you try to tell us we're stupid or unholy. Well guess what? You're not going to convince us. We are who we are, and if we get tortured for it after we die anyway, then leave us the hell alone during life.

This is flaired as "serious" because it is. These are important things that everyone needs to know. I'm willing to discuss this more, but I refuse to label this as "discussion" because everything I have said is a fact. While I am not trans (yet), I wanted to say this because many people are uninformed on this.

I don't know what I want to identify as just yet, but I do know that **the people who want to change are not doing it for attention, or because they want to be unique**. They simply don't like how they were born, or genuinely feel more comfortable as a different gender.

One last note: Don't be that guy that says "eww" then refuses to explain. Don't be that person that says "ok boomer" and calls it a day. If you disagree, I'm happy to discuss it, but don't take a shot and leave. It helps no one, and does nothing besides make people feel worse.
