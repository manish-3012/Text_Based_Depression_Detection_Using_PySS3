Day 1 of doing pushups every day so I can stop being a fat fuck and look more like a man For context I'm a bit overweight (but not American) and I am a transgender guy. To help me look more like a guy I want to lose some weight. It's also to improve my health, but looking like a guy is higher priority. 

My friend told me I should start doing pushups, starting with 5 (because I'm just starting out after years of not excersizing properly) but will probably add more in the future. 

I have done my pushups for today! I'll post again when I do them tomorrow.
