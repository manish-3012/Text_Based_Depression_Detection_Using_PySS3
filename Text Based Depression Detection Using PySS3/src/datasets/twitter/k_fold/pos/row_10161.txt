is this selfish or not? my crush and i are having a deep convo and she says shes not on snap much bc of school and she only regularly answers 3 ppl which are her friends she known for years and she knows them IRL.

Whe she said this i felt rlly shitty because i wasn't included in the list....

but also, ive only known her for a month and i dont know her IRL

so is this selfish? If it is i understand..and i can even see why its selfish because i have a crush on her so i expect more and she doesnt (she has a boyfried) so she expects less.
