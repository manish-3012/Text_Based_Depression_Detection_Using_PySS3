some of you boys need to learn some fucking respect i'm so fucking sick of being a girl because of how much negativity i get from boys every single day. these girls vs boys memes are not as light hearted as you think, i'm so tired of seeing the same fucking meme throwing all girls into the same stereotype just to be called boring as a whole or bitchy and fake. or taking a normal thing that everyone does and making it seem like it's only boys that do it. 
i play a lot of video games, and i rarely use voice chat because the few times i do i get fucking told to go back to the kitchen. every single time. and it's not enjoyable. wasn't funny the first time, never has been. some of you can't take dark humour against yourselves either. it's all fun an games, joking about women's rights until it's about you, and apparently *we* can't take a joke, or get too offended over "harmless" shit? nah.
if a girl is talking about period pains or something, don't jump in a fucking say "oh but you've never gotten kicked in the balls before!1!!1", seriously man, come on. we don't get to choose wether we have periods or not, and the pain lasts for a week, sometimes so bad you can't stand up. you just can't compare other people's pain when you haven't experienced it yourself.
stop treating yourselves as the "superior gender", because none of us are better than anyone else. 
this is just a handful of the stuff myself, and i'm sure a lot of other people are just fed up with seeing.
