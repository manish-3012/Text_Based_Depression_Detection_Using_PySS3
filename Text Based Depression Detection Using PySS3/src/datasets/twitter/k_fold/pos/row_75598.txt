Both sexes have a hard time, stop making it a fucking contest. Both have  unrealistic psychical expectations forced onto them and both have  unrealistic behavioral expecaltions forced onto them

Girls I think have more psychically expection, girls have to have big tits, big ass, skinny waist, flat stomach, gorgoues face and are shamed to wearing makeup, and must never have any body hair,leading to body dysmorphia. 

But guys have to deal with the pressure of having to surpress any kind of emotion because if they do they will face harsh backlash. Men also face more prejudice in the justice system compared to woman because people can't empathise with men. 

So can we just agree that all of us have dumb fucking social pressures? And that attacking each other and comparing it like its a fucking contest as if you're gonna win a prize is stupid.
