This is why I canâ€™t stand social media especially ones with a lot of teen girls Honestly I donâ€™t care if people call me incel a lot of girls are just so sensitive, itâ€™s getting ridiculous. If a make a â€œwhite girlâ€ or a Emily ACAB meme Iâ€™m misogynistic, if I comment on anything a woman say does wear etc, Iâ€™m misogynistic. If I speak on anything women do wrong Iâ€™m misogynistic. Hell if I donâ€™t like a show with a female lead Iâ€™m misogynistic, Iâ€™ve seen people make jokes that arenâ€™t even offensive [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/iddyba/basically_every_white_girl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but since the woman was the punchline itâ€™s misogyny. And Iâ€™m the incel, are you serious? So Iâ€™m an incel because Iâ€™m making memes and some of those memes happen to have women as a punchline. The ones getting offended any typing paragraphs are fine thatâ€™s not incel behavior at all?

And I get called misogynistic because I donâ€™t like anime characters that happen to be female, I remember I said â€œwhy do girls always get so pressedâ€ and Iâ€™m a sexist for that because Iâ€™m generalizing all women like men donâ€™t get generalized ever as only wanting sex and objectifying women. Iâ€™m actually starting to lose it, Iâ€™m just gonna have to kiss everyone womanâ€™s ass for the rest of my life or get spam called incel or misogynistic.
