I did something really funny at church when I was 13 So I was 13, and I had given up christianity (I dont wanna get into it) but I had to go to church anyway, so before I went to church, the day before I went to one of those leave a book take a book things in my town, and usually they have those fake million dollars with the jesus babble on the back, so I took one, put it in an envelope and went to church on that Sunday then put it in the little bin that they pass around, so that when they opened it, they would get a taste of their own medicine. It was pretty funny, i have nothing against christianity, I just dont like religion in general, and it was a funny prank.
