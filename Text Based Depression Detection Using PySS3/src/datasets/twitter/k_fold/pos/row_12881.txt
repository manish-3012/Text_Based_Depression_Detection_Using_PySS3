Dreams that give hope are the fucking worst. Like you go to the doctor but due to irritatingly long queue you get out of the hospital and then... you meet your crush from highschool (the dream takes place in the future) and you both talk about some shit and go on a date and you end up one year later living together and sharing your passions and then..... POOF!..... it's fucking gone, you wake the fuck up, samurai.

I fucking hate this.
