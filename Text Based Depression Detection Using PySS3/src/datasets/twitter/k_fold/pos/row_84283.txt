This sub is filled with incels Not just this sub but also every meme sub. The behaviors and posts of so many people here is just crazy, I don't know how some of you are allowed in social media. You come here and spread those thoughts and insecurities through memes that people actually agree with. You keep saying that "girls are bad and boring but boys are so cool and good". The difference is that at least most incels are self aware but you guys just don't notice.

No, not all women only want sex.
No, not all women only like "chads" (which, btw, most of those people you call chads are just popular because they're funny and unlike you, they have a personality)
No, not all women hate short dudes.
And no, not all women bad and boring.
If you actually got out of your house and interacted with people you'd realize it's your fault people don't talk to you, if you didn't answer in a monotone and harsh manner to people everytime they talked and stopped thinking they just want to insult you, you'd actually have friends.
And also, if a girl doesn't like you, it's not because you're ugly, it's not because you're under 6 feet, it's not because of your posture, it's because of your manners and they way you mistreat her.

Being an incels doesn't just mean being a virgin or not having sex btw, incels are hateful people which right while they read this are probably running down to the comments to write "Simp" just because I'm not one of them.
