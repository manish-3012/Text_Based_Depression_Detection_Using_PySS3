Can I get some friends? When I started freshman year my friend group started ghosting me which was cool. I met a girl named Morgan, she was new to public schools bc she went to a Christian school. We became close and she adopted me into her friend group. Fast forward to the start of Junior year. She had a huge glow up and started trying to get with more popular people. She becomes best friends with the ringleader of my old friend group, well aware that I hated them. Whatever. I canâ€™t control her and who she hangs out with. Suddenly sheâ€™s blocking all contact with me, too. The only one from that group who ended up not being an asshole told me Morgan told everyone I was being manipulative and that Iâ€™m trying to make friends feel guilty about it. I try for about a month to try and get answers from any of them as to what exactly I did, because if I genuinely did do something wrong I didnâ€™t even realize. Nobody answers me. I finally asked Morgan to tell me whatâ€™s up. To paraphrase, I said â€œwhat did I do wrong. I get that you think Iâ€™m manipulative but how am I manipulative. What exactly did I do. Iâ€™ve asked everybody and nobody has been able to tell me where I fucked up. It makes me think u just made some random shit up to get rid of me.â€. She blocked me. Just as therapy was starting to work. Thanks Morgan. Itâ€™s been 5 months since that happened and since then the only person Iâ€™ve had a conversation with has been my mom. To put it simply, having friends has upgraded from a want to a need, and I need ur help. Iâ€™m 16, male, and in EST time zone. Dm me if ur interested in just talking. I might not respond until morning if you do, so sorry. Thanks
