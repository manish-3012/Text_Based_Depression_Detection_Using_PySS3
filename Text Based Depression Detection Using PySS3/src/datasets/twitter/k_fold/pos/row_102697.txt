I'm kind of annoyed at my friend He's my friend so obviously I like talking to him but today it's really gotten to me how he complains a lot about the people in this after school thing we're both in. I'm starting to think it's slightly toxic because it's unhealthy and not good to constantly have that negativity on one's mind :/
