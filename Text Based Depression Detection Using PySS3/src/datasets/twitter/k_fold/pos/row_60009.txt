TIFU by accidentally saying something rude to my aunt So this happened not even 5 minutes ago, and I'm fucking *reeling* -

Me and my parents were in a virtual meeting with our extended family members for Thanksgiving, and when it came time for us to go, I was going to say "goodbye" to my aunt, but my dumbass brain decided to say something else. 

You see, I'm autistic and while my family members do know this, sometimes I can accidentally do things that are very rude without meaning too because of it. However, what I said was very uncharacteristic because normally I'm not this rude when I am accidentally rude, but I digress;

My aunt was about to log off the video chat, and I decided to make a joke so I said "wait, who are you again?" and I was going to follow it up with something else but after I said that I froze after I realized what I had just said and then my aunt hung up. 

So naturally, I was upset asf after realizing how rude I was, so I ended up cussing up a storm which only pissed my stepdad off even more however he ended up comforting me but not even TWO SECONDS after I exited the room, he went to go talk to my mother and say that I was stupid asf and tell her about what I had said to my aunt before she left. 

And then my mom was also like wtf and then I realized the magnitude of what I had just done, as my aunt is a major narcissist and would most definitely use it against me, *ESPECIALLY* my parents. 

So I went and apologized to my aunt, and she said it was fine and so did my dad, given that he said had my aunt actually heard it she would've been blowing up my parent's phones, and I'm sure she hasn't either but now my stepdad thinks I'm fucking stupid and so does my mother and now I want to go curl up into a ball and jump off a cliff into a pit of hellfire. :D

TL;DR: Accidentally said something rude asf to my narcissistic aunt and mild chaos insued.
