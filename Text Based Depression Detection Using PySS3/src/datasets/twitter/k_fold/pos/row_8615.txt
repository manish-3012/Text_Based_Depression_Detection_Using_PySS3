Guys, if you feel unattractive read this Whether your tummy is soft or you've rock hard abs you still matter. 
If you've scars , acne, not curly hair you still matter. 
Don't let the media fool you. 
Your height and your d is something that's out of your control whether you like it or not. 
You're still beautiful. 
You're worthy and deserving too. 
Sincerely, 
A Girl.
