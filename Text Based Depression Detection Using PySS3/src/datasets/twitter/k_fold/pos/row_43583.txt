I have reached a weird state of limbo; something that should not exist yet does I am sad but not, somewhere between horny and neutral. A state of taking to someone but who? And about what? Total nuetrality but for the first time I don't like it. I am not comfortable with myself yet I'm not uncomfortable. To put into words is difficult but every thought it's in my head. All of my worrisome thoughts fleeting into the darkness again. As i slowly slip into a vibe i simentneuosly don't want to. This is...weird for lack of better word..
