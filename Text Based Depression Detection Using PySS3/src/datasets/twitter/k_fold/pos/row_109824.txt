What could your parents do if anything to support when youâ€™re feeling at your lowest? Iâ€™m a mom who genuinely wants to help my son through a rough time in this Fâ€™in  pandemic. Heâ€™s been grounded but keeps doing things to prolong the grounding. Trust me, I get no thrill keeping him restricted and feel itâ€™s almost inhumane. I try talking to him openly, letting him know if heâ€™s in a bad situation to tell me so I can help him not judge him, remind him of his worth. Give him space when asked. Heâ€™s says Iâ€™m being reasonable and â€œnot an annoying Karen snitchâ€ We both agree itâ€™s getting worse. I grew up in the 90s/early 00â€™s so I have no idea what itâ€™s like for you all. Iâ€™m at a loss, so Iâ€™m here taking a leap of faith asking the teenagers of Reddit (his peer group) with an open judgement free mind, what would help you when you feel like youâ€™re spiraling out of control?  What would you like from your parents if it happens? 

I appreciate any one willing to give input and hope not too annoying a parent invading your subreddit.
