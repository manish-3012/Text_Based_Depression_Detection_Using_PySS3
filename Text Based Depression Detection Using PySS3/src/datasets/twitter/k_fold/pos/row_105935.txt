What should I do? Ok so let me give some background, I am a honor student in 8th grade, and I am currently am having a panic attack, because Iâ€™m failing 5 classes. I have been distracted with my life recently, and I havenâ€™t been paying much attention to anything really. But now itâ€™s all coming to bite me in the ass, because progress reports are tomorrow, and I am failing 5 classes. My parents are the kind to make straight Aâ€™s a requirement, due to my mom being a teacher, and my dad not having enough educational support when he was growing up. So basically I have to get straight Aâ€™s, which I donâ€™t do (I am an A/B honor roll student) and right now I am failing 5 classes. It isnâ€™t the work is hard, per say, itâ€™s just I am not doing it. I am in gifted classes, so that means I have an unusual amount of work, and I only have tomorrow to finish. I am panicking to the fact that I am unsure if I will complete it, or hell, even get enough points from the make up work, to give me a passing grade. Please help, advice would be loved, or at least help comfort me. Thanks.
