My dad has now started putting screen time on MY Xbox! What the hells with that I donâ€™t even play all the time. But when I do play Iâ€™ll pause if Iâ€™ve got chores I wonâ€™t play until after I do my school and I donâ€™t stay up all night playing. Anyone of you have this kinda thing happen to you with devices?
