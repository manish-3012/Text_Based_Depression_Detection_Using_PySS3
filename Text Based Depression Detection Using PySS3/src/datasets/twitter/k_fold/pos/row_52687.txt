This may be the worst part of the fact that school is starting in a week During school my parents won't let me play videogames during school days wich fucking sucks because I'll do like 2 online hours for school do some homework for a few hours the just sit and watch the tv untill night comes and I'm forced to go to sleep at 10 pm(I have to go to sleep at 10PM even during breaks).and also my grades aren't even that bad my yearly average was 9.68 or something
