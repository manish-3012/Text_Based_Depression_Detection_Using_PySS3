Sooo I kinda got sick I have a gluten allergy so I canâ€™t have a lot of foods, so I have alternatives. Idk what went wrong today but I guess I accidentally ingested gluten and when I got home I went to the bathroom and barfed. Idk wtf I ate bc it was all foods that Iâ€™ve had before and yea. That was my afternoon, how about yours?
