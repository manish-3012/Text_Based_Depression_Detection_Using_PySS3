Is this normal for a teenager? Hi all! I am new here so sorry for anything i do wrong. 
So, concerning the title above, i wanted to know if this is something normal teenager do because i'm getting a bit worried. Is it normal for teenagers to not want to ask their parents to buy them something that is inexpensive? For example, if i see something that i like and it is $1 USD, i will not ask for it because i will think it's too expensive. My family is not in a bad place financially but i still feel horrible asking them for anything. I'm sorry for the long post!
