Real talk,do you all have found a reason to live?If so,then what is it? For me,I don't mind dying but then I realised I still have my cats to take care of.

I mean,I must admit they're pretty annoying sometimes but even so,they have been with me for quite a while.(In a way)They felt like my sons and daughters despite them just being my pet

So yea,guess I'll just live for them at moment.
Once they die,then I will accept death
