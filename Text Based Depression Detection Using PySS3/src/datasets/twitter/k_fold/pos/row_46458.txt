An actual message to my 17 year old daughter on Discord, not that you would understand Not gonna be active on Discord tonight. I'm meeting a girl (a real one) in half an hour (wouldn't expect a lot of you to understand anyway) so please don't DM me asking me where i am (im with the girl, ok) you'll most likely get aired because i'll be with the girl (again I don't expect u to understand) shes actually really interested in me and its not a situation i can pass up for some meaningless Discord shit (because i'll be meeting a girl, not that you really are going to understand) this is my life now. Meeting women and not wasting my precious time online, I have to move on from such simple things (you wouldnt understand)


Edit:  the group received this from a kid on discord, and we thought it was hilarious
