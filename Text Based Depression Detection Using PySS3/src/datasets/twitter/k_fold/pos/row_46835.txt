I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BE THIS HAPPY Ok context. I'm a bi girl who's had a crush on this girl since July. I was positive she was straight, with my thoughts being confirmed when she got a bf. 

5 months later, and she not only broke up with her bf, BUT TOLD ME SHE WAS FUCKING BISEXUAL

I CAN'T CONTAIN MYSELF

(Yes, she can still reject me, but I now have a possible chance)
