I miss my best friend I was really good n close friends with this girl and I loved her like a sister, she was just great to talk to. but during this summer she got into a toxic relationship with this guy (he threatened to kill himself in a video while loading a gun) and she still stayed with him, she didnâ€™t like that I told her how it was because I donâ€™t wanna bullshit her and then we stopped talking, I find out she blocked me on both my Instagrams, I ask her about it and she just acted clueless and deflected, so naturally I said ight, unadded her snap and removed her as a Facebook friend. the guy she was with made her so toxic. she was a great person before.. :( I just miss her in my life
