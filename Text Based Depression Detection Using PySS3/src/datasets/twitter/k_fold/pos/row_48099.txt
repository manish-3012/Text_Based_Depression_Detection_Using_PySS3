I was watching Pinky and the Brain on hulu and there's a bit where they dress up as typical suburbanites to get back a package that was mistakenly sent to their very weird neighbor

so Brain (under the persona "Mr.Feldman") leaves the "very young and nubile Mrs. Feldman"(Pinky) to seduce the neighbor

and the neighbor says, "Excuse the mess, some of my used clothes have become ***crunchy***" and shapes a pile of clothes into a recliner and sits down in it
