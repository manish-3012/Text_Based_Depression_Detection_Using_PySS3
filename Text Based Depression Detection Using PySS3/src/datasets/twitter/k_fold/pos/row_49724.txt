wtf is wrong with people i was playing among us yesterday and this girl and i started talking. eventually she gave me her snap so we stayed up late talking and she eventually asked me out. at around 2 she had to go so we said goodbye and this morning i opened the app to send streaks and i saw a message, this said

â€œyour snap is pending until ... adds you as a friendâ€ 

this is not the first time a girl had unadded me out of nowhere. i donâ€™t know why girls like to do this, it doesnâ€™t feel good to be talking with someone and then she just unadded you. i know itâ€™s not always in thier control, who knows, she coulda had an overprotective parent. but they could at least say something about it. we just want to know why you do this. some girls say that men are trash and shouldnt exist, but the. they go and do this shit..... if this has happened to another guy iâ€™d like to hear about it to see how many people this had happened with.
