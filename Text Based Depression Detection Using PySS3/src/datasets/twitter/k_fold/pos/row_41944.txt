Moving away, any advice on how I make friends in my new school? So since I'm moving away, I also must go to a new school, because my current school is too far away. But I really don't know how to make friends, I'm really awkward and have social anxiety. Literally the first year of 5th grade I just went behind bushes and stand there, because I had no friends. So if anyone of y'all got any advice/tips on how to make friends at a new school, I would appreciate it.
