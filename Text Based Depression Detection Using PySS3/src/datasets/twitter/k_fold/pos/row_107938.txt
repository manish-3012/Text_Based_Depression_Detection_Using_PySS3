How many YouTube videos should I make before posting Because Iâ€™m animating some parts of them it might take a while (Iâ€™ve been working on the same one for like 2 weeks)

So I was thinking that I would give myself time to make videos before I start actually posting on a schedule (that way I donâ€™t rush)

Although I did hear that consistency is key to YouTube (that way the algorithm can see when / how much you post and know what time they should be recommended at)

Iâ€™m going to probably start posting with at least 6 pre made videos but just donâ€™t know how much time I should put in between then

I heard 3-4 days is good, but again Iâ€™m drawing / recording these so it might take a while

I guess Iâ€™ll just see how long it takes me to make an average video and post based on that
