my cousinâ€™s grandmother went missing i never thought something like this would happen to someone relatively close to our family

even tho we seldom talk to each other nor technically are blood related, i think sheâ€™s still considered part of *my* family

i heard she went to the restaurant at the lowest floor alone to eat dinner that night, her family came back home from work and stuffs, except for her. everyone suspects its her alzheimers acting up, theyâ€™ve already reported this case to the police

sheâ€™s been missing for over 36 hours now, itâ€™s currently raining heavily for several hours straight, it really makes me wonder where all the people who went missing cuz of alzheimers stay at... i really hope someone took her in

but the thing is.. whoever took her in shouldâ€™ve reported to the police already, i mean, they just took a random old lady in and took care of her... when i heard about this, i actually kinda freaked out a bit inside, what can i do except to wish for the best to happen? 

apologies for bad grammar, im just a little tired rn, thanks for taking your time to read this
