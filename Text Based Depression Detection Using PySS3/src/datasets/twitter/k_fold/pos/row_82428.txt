Hey guys I just wanted to let you know that I'm safe So recently iowa the state I live in has been berated derecho which is basically an inland hurricane.  Thousands of people have lost their homes and many more have lost their power.  There has been a lot of flooding which has destroyed many acres of crops like corn and what not.  Help will be coming slowly which is very unfortunate to the people who were affected the most

But I just wanted to let you guys know that I am safe and healthy.  My area didn't get hit too bad but we still have been affected majorly by the storm.  Let's just hope that help comes to the people who need it the most.

Take care you amazing people
