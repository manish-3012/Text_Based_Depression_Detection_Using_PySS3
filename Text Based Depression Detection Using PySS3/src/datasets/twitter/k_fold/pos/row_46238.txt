State Testing Soon, Wish Me Luck Soldiers Itâ€™s as the title says. I donâ€™t know about you guys, but my school has decided that on May 6th, we will be doing state testing. 

Now context, Iâ€™m usually a straight A student, but this year has been a bit harder on me as with everyone else. Hence, I have never done badly on these tests, and I am not equipped to do badly on them or deal with that if it came to be. 

Well, we were online for the first half of the year, and itâ€™s been made apparent to staff that we do not remember anything from then, and we should do something about that. But no, we are still going to have to do that, and since weâ€™re almost guaranteed failure, thatâ€™s going to be on the records of everyone in the school. I can probably say goodbye to my shot at a scholarship!

How about you guys? Any of you have this going on? Letâ€™s be honest. Most of us were either too disengaged during Zoom to learn anything, or just flat out didnâ€™t care.
