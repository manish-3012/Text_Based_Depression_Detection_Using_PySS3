Wandavision after-credits scene If anyone on this sub watches Wandavision, you should know that there is an after credits scene in the 7th episode. There might be for the 8th and 9th as well. Just so nobody misses it.

Slight spoiler:

It's because the 7th episode is set in the 2000, when Marvel started with after-credit scenes.
