Just got a respectable PC for first time in my life..... And holy shit, it's so smooth, there are occasional lag spikes and small frame drops, but I grew up in lag and low FPS (like 30 is max I would get from 2012 game ffs) so I don't even notice them.

Oh and I am extremely happy, been long time since I felt geniune happiness tbh.
