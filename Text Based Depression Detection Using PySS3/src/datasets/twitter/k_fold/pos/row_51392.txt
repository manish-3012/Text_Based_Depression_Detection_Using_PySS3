I wanted to tell this to you 3:33 PM 12/7/2020

NO i am not talking about suicide, Suicide is never an option.

First of all, Sorry u/mistaken0bacon, I want to apologise to you in front of 2,286,580 members

I just wanted it to post it in a funny way in memes, 

u/MrCharisma101, thanks for calling me a whore reposter, My greedy shit mind needs to hear this, I hate myself too

&gt; My good sir this is a repost from [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/) that you have given a heading 

u/_darthjarjar69_, didn't know that this is called repost, i added my joke on the image i found on internet, is this not meme making? ( I am geniunely asking)

Am I a Karma Whore?

ok, I just see things now and think, this should better be in this subreddit and then i add my touch and sometimes i don't, no i am not greedy for meaningless internet points.

BUT NOW

I PROMISE TO ALL those who are reading that I won't Repost ANY thing, and this shitty person inside me respects his words he has told to all 2,286,580 members.

I also want to vent that I hate myself, I just slapped myself, (No i am not a lunatic) I fucked up my teaching presentation to the class, My Computer chose me to teach one topic to the whole class, great opportunity right?, I created a good ppt, but at the time of presentation i got nervous as fuck, started stammering, when one classmate asked a question, I wasn't able to explain

If you have read till here, Thanks,

I will leave Reddit after 12 December

Once again sorry, u/mistaken0bacon

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself too
