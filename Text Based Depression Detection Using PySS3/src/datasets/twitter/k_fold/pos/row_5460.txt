Sometimes I fucking hate being an introvert To all the introverts, I'm not hating on y'all, I love the lifestyle it's just that sometimes it sucks as, especially when it comes to crushes. Over the past two years I've been informed that three people had crushes on *me* of all people, and worse enough, I had a crush on two of them at the times they did, too. That's were it starts to suck, big time. It's not like I was afraid to talk to them, it's just that I was completely unable to make a conversation where I was able to open up about myself, because, well... introvert. The second one of those two crushes that shared the, uh, crushiness, I was actually hitting off really well with, but then the introvert in me punched myself in the throat and made me stop, I also didn't know until a year later that she was crushing on me too. Last one, well she liked me, I didn't.

And that's the story of my "love" life. Now I'm delusional and unable to make casual conversation, so I doubt anything is gonna happen for the next few years.
