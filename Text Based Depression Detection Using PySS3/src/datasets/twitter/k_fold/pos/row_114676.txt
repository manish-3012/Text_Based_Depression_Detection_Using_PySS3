My new year So at new year 2020, my family had a party as usual and invited all the family friends, some of these family friends dislike our dog so my family put him and me in a room for a few hours, you know till BEFORE THE COUNTDOWN, 
So now I'm playing a few games and scrolling reddit when I hear the countdown and hear them cheering with joy, they FORGOT me, okay I'm not very Noticible in a few people, now after they all start celebrating and singing I walk out and they stare at me for a few seconds and then try to indulge me in celebration like nothing happened, I felt awkward and then my crush called to wish me and told me that I'm like a brother to her, needless to say, the year was already fucked.
