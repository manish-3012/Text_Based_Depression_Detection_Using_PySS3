So me and my girlfriend of 8hours broke up so she could go back to her ex and Iâ€™m not mad I just donâ€™t like him at all heâ€™s kind of a dick So she went to him and it made sense she just said she didnâ€™t feel the same after the first little bit and itâ€™s alright but her ex is kind of a dick, Iâ€™m mean heâ€™s my friend but I wouldnâ€™t want to get any closer because heâ€™s the kind of guy who would stab you in the back for a dime bag of weed. And they say breaking up with someone is what should be best for them but, this guys kind of a dick he wears chains and is a douch bag in general and shes great and deserves someone better 

Sorry if I sound like a neck beard 


TL,DR girl broke up with me and itâ€™s bugging me because she went to a dick
