posting everyday until I go on a road trip day 2 8th month of August, year 2020

12:42 AM

I am watching The Lego Movie and eating peanut butter m&amp;ms, made a video of Emmet Brickowski dancing to Ievan Polka on MMD, realizing one of my most recent youtube videos blew up and the video after that is getting popular too

I tried to put Eddsworld episodes onto DVDs, didnt work cuz I'm a dumbfuck, I won't be able to watch Eddsworld on the road trip unfortunately

scared of online classes cuz I wanna buy stuff for school that looks kinda badass even though it's made for kids half my age

I wish schools werent cancelled, I wanna talk to people and tell them about the shit that happened over the summer (Eddsworld coming back, me getting into The Lego Movie, Bob coming to my Island on ACNH)
