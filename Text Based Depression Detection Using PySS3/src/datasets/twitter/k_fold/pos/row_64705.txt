When is it too early to drop out? Hi! Iâ€™m an 8th grade F average who everyone says is really smart but then I keep struggling at every single thing they throw are me. Recently Iâ€™ve realized that I either fail 8th grade and have to redo it or I can drop out. The pressure that everyone puts on me to be the greatest thing theyâ€™ve ever seen is so hard to live up to, not to mention the fact that Iâ€™m failing by a substantial amount. I think it might just be time to give up and give in. Itâ€™s been a good run.
