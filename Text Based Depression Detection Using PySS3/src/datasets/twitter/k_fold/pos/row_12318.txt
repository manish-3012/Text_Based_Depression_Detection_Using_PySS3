Tf is your problem with the opposite gender? You are so afraid of the opposite sex. Is it because of your sexual orientation? I'm a lesbian and I speak normally to girls, bitch, we arent monsters.

Or is It more of a "uknown-subject" thing? Is It that hard to have opposite gender friends for y'all? 

This is a question I swear.
