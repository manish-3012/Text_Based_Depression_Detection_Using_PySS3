I confessed and got a no. What do I do? This happened 10 minutes ago and I have no clue what to do. I confessed to my crush who I have known for a while and when said "I am so sorry but I have a bf" I totally get that and understand that. Infact I am proud of her for sticking with her bf. I have never had to deal with rejection on this scale before and I don't know what to do or think. (We are still friends and still plan to talk I just need help with my emotions right now)
