my parents kiss and make dirty jokes and it makes me and my sister very uncomfortable My (f17) parents used to never show affection. now all of a sudden they have been showing love and making dirty jokes in front of me and my sister (f13.) We have told them and expressed it makes us uncomfortable and they don't care. I know we are lucky to have parents who love eachother, but I wish they could respect that certain behaviours or statements make us uncomfortable. I don't care if they hold hands or hug, but when it's more than that we really don't like it. Do your parents show affection in front of you? Is it normal? Maybe we are just not used to it because they never showed affection at all until quarantine started in march. They used to argue and not be in love, but all of a sudden now they are always mushy gushy and it's so annoying.
