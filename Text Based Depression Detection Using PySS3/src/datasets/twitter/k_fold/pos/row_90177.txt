OH MY FUCKING GOD! I FINALLY FOUND A SONG I REMEMBER FROM MY CHILDHOOD! I finally did it! I remembered a song I used to hear when I was baby!

**How I found it you might ask?** 

It wasn't exactly easy and I wasn't expecting to find it, but I got a recommendation for an Uncharted 4 trailer (1). I liked the song that was in it, so I went from forum to forum, and turns out, they used a cover of the song (2) I remembered from my childhood!
