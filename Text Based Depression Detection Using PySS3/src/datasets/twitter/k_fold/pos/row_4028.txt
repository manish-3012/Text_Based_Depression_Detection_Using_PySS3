Anyone else have pp/boody problems in fitness classes Now that we've filtered out the little kid language, I would like to ask if your dick is an inconvenience and your ass is too heavy for fitness classes like mine? I'm probably going to take ballroom dance next semester so it doesn't matter too much but I need to know if anyone else hates it as much as I do.
