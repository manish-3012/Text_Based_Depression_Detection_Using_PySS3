If you use religion to justify bigotry you're stupid. Imagine not liking someone because a book written 2000 years ago said so. If you say "oh I love these people but I just can't support them" then you don't actually love them, that's just your own shitty definition of love. If you truly loved them you would support them no matter their identity, religion, sexuality, or any other fucking descriptor. Don't use a book that can barely hold up today to get your morals
