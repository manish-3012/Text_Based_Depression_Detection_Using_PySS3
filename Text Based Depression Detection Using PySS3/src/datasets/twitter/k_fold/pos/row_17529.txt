god I hate how liberal gen z is not that I have a problem with liberals itâ€™s that we need political diversity. I myself am libertarian, and am somewhat of a centrist. But gen Z, somewhat becuase of social media, is so incredibly liberal. Canâ€™t have a different opinion then whatever the main stream thoughts are.
