do you think itâ€™s more important for an album to have really good tracks or for the combination of tracks to be really good eg nirvanaâ€™s nevermind has a lot of reallyyy good songs however itâ€™s sort of just a list of songs whereas kendrick lamarâ€™s to pimp a butterfly has the perfect structure and combination of songs even if some of them canâ€™t really be listened to on their own (eg i personally donâ€™t like to listen to u for free? for sale? wesleys theory and institutionalised on their own) 

it doesnâ€™t matter, theyâ€™re just both brilliant albums in different ways but what do you prefer? personally i prefer concept albums
