Why are some people homophobic? I just don't understand. Could like someone tell me why? It's just two people kissing what's the big deal about it 

Why are people aphobic? Like you cant stand someone not having sexual attraction or not kissing? What are they gunna do? Eat too much cake?
I'm confused
