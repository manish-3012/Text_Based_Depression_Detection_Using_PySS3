in my opinion, online dating most of the time looks stupid itâ€™s an opinion so donâ€™t go off on me, skip the post if you donâ€™t agree with it idk. You canâ€™t please everyone

Like thereâ€™s just no way people can be serious when doing it, it seems like one big joke. Getting dms from random dudes on reddit where theyâ€™re trying to get a relationship with me is pathetic. 

Thereâ€™s obviously exceptions in some relationships but a lot of the time I really judge those who do it. Iâ€™m not a total asshole so I donâ€™t just say â€œthat relationship is fucking hopelessâ€ and I just let them know I support them but holy shit, Iâ€™m such a fucking asshole. Damn I seem like a miserable person but yeah I definitely judge the shit out of you. I feel like an asshole when I do it but Iâ€™m just gonna assume itâ€™s from the trauma idfc, take it easy, bye
