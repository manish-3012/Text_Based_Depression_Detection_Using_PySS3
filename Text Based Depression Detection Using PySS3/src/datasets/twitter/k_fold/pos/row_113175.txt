Can we stop hating on Elon Yes, has high standards for his employees, but he also (almost) never asks him to do more then what he himself is willing to do. 

We also have to remember that this guy is directly responsible for revolutionizing 5 different industries (digital mapping, online payment methods, space stuff, electric cars, and hyperloops), along with creating a potentially huge new industry (neural link). Also he is a billionaire, but almost heâ€™s constantly releasing the technical specifications to the general public. I mean a lot of what Hyperloop Transportation Technologies is doing out in dubai is based on Elonâ€™s designs and visions.
