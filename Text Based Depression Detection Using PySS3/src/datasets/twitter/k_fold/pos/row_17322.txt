Iâ€™m giving some advice. I want to say that in the last five months, I have learned many things, especially this summer. I lost 30 pounds, stopped using most social media, and I also became much happier. Iâ€™m Autistic and I used to use food to cope with my anxiety and depressive episodes. Iâ€™m going to give some tips to help you beautiful Kings and Queens to become healthier mentally and physically. 

1. GET ENOUGH SLEEP: I go to bed at 10-12 and wake up at 6-8. For military time users, thatâ€™s 22-00. 

2. Eat healthier. I blend my fruits and veggies into smoothies so I can get all my nutrients in one drink. I also try to eat healthy throughout the day as well.

3. Develop some form of exercise, strength, or cardio routine. I bike 10+ miles 5-6 days out of the week and I also lift weights at least every other day along with sit-ups. 

4. STOP THE TOXICITY: Delete social media if itâ€™s affecting your life and/or your mental health. 

5. Find other friends online or in real life. Find people that are becoming healthier or are nicer in general. 

*Thank you for reading all of this, I hope my â€œspeechâ€ was worth your time!
