Please give me an honest opinion, even if it means crucifying me in the comments. Idk where to post this, I dont think it fits on AITA since this is all hypothetical but I want someone's opinion about this.

Sometimes I feel like I have no remorse, and no ability to even feel emotionally attached to anything, I didn't cry at my grandma's funeral and I probably wouldnt bat an eye if my parents died this second. It almost scares me that I might one day go out, murder people and just be completely fine with it. I dont think Ive ever felt bad for doing something that hurt someone, be it emotional physical or otherwise and in all honesty there is a part of me that wants to experience hurting someone or being hurt just to know what it feels like. Idk why, theres always been a part of me that just wants to hurt people. Not to mention that I physically cannot cry unless I myself is the one that is hurt, like sure I cry when my parents shout at me for extended periods of time but even that is rare and I dont think Ive cried because of anything else. Its to the point Im scared of not feeling remorse or fear. So am I a psychopath or what am I?
