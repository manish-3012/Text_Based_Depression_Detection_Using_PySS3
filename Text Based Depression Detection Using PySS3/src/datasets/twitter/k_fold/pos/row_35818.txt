Why people on reddit hate tik tok Some people on r/cringetopia think its cringey that we hate tik tok, but let me list up why we dont like the app:

The drama

The toxic people pretending to know everything

Songs becoming so overused that everyone hates it

Cringey dances

Cringe in general

Sexism

And so on. Iâ€™m not saying that reddit is perfect, but Iâ€™d say its better than tik tok. Downvote me, but this is my opinion
