iâ€™m constantly teetering between thinking iâ€™m the ugliest and most annoying creature in the world and thinking iâ€™m *the shit* just saying if i lost 20lbs, slept more, started eating healthier, put effort into my appearance, learned to use makeup, exercised  more often, got money for nice clothes, did my hair once in a while, dealt with my mental
health and body issues and actually got some friends i totally would be the shit. just saying.
