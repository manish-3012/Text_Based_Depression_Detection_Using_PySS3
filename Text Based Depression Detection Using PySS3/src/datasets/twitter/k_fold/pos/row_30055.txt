Help me. I need help guys. A girl added me on snap and started talking to me and stuff and we're in the same grade and same school, so we exchanged selfies and she's kinda cute but now she's obsessed with me and she's like really awkward and boring to talk to so what do I do. Also sorry for the run-on sentence lol
