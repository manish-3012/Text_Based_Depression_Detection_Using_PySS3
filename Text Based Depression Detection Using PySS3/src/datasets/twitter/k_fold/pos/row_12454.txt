I need help I am having serious problems with suicidal thoughts and i feel like i am losing. The last four years of my life have been nothing but pain. I moved away from all my friends and entered a school where i was bullied by almost 70 students and all my teachers. One of my 3 friends started bullying me and choking me every single day and threatining to stab me. I then got raped in the school locker room. When i tried to tell the gym teachers assistant she said "boys like you don't get raped". The bullying then got worse. When i could finally escape i got so badly injured i had to travel all around my country to see doctors. The pain was so bad i passed out becouse of it. I am finally out but dealing with severe anxiety deppresion and suicidal thoughts. Please help the suicidal hotline in my country is offline becouse of a massive snowstorm.
