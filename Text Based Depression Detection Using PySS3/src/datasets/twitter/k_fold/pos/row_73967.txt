I drove a car for the first time today! It was p cool, there was this grasshopper that just stayed on the windshield and i named him perry

Honestly the only real problems were me constantly forgetting how to turn my blinkers on and also me not being able to stop at the right moment when thereâ€™s a stop sign 

Overall 8.9/10, kinda scary sometimes but pretty fun
