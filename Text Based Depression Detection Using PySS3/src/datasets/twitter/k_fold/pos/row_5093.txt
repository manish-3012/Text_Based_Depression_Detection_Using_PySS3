Man. Why are teachers such bitches sometimes? For a while now I've been struggling in Spanish class, and yesterday my parents and I had a meeting with the teacher that went well.

Today I managed to stay in the class the entire time and do the work asked of me, so you think the teacher would be proud right?

Well she decided to do a thing where we have to share our screen with her to see if we actually did any work, but I did all my work on my desktop which has a bigger screen so I can see it better. 

I sent her a private message explaining my situation and asked if I could send an email, and she laughed and said to the class "It's crazy what students will do to get out of work "I dId My WoRk On A sEpErAtE cOmPuTeR.""
