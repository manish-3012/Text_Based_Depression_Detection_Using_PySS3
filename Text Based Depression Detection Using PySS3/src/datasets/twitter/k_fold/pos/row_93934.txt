Horny posts shouldnâ€™t be looked down up....wait hear me out So a lot of people here make horny posts and thatâ€™s ok, weâ€™re all teenagers, weâ€™ve all got hormones and emotions. Sometimes people wanna share those emotions but they donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to and this SubReddit is probably their only way of expressing those emotions. I feel like shaming them or acting disgusted isnâ€™t right, Iâ€™m not denying that It could make certain people uncomfortable, thatâ€™s understandable too however if feel like shaming them or saying something rude isnâ€™t the way to go. If you donâ€™t like like just down vote the post and leave(sorry if that came off a bit turned, that wasnâ€™t my intention). Having said that there should of course be a limit to those posts. Spamming the SubReddit with those posts will get annoying
