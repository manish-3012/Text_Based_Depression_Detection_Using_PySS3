My mom has been forcing me to stay indoors since schools closed in mid March and I'm losing my mind She won't even let me go on the balcony

I've seen all my friends go outside together and hang out (with masks) and no one has caught covid and this has mad me sad that I cannot hang out with them

I'm in University (college) and the stress of school with not being allowed to have any form of social interaction (she won't let me spend time on video games) is doing shit for my mental health

Anyone got any tips?
