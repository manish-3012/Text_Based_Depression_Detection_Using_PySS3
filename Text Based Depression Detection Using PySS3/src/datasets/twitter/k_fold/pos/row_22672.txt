Me, an Atheist, still haven't told my grandparents about it. My grandparents are your typical god fearing gun toting rascist homophobic Christians. And everytime I get sent to my grandparents house, they take my to church 4 times a week and try to instill some of those good ol' Jesus values, yet I don't have the heart to tell them that I don't believe in squat. People who have done this before, what do I do?
