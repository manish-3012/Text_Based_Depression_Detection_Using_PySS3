Spanish is a waste of time and should not be something required to graduate I don't know about you guy's school, but at mine spanish is a elective required to graduate and i don't understand why. I also don't understand why we even need to be multilagual. Its so misunderstanding. But my school has alot of fucked up rules other than needing to be multilagual.

Why is spanish so hard lmfao?
