Can i be honest about something that nobody likes? So weâ€™ve all seen that cuties trailer right? If you havenâ€™t itâ€™s basically about a preteen whoâ€™s family is super religious joining a dancing group and joining social media. And nobody likes it cuz she transitions from religious cover up wear to crop tops and jeans and her dance group is very suggestive when they dance and she dyes her hair purple. Itâ€™s supposed to be a coming of age story b it Netflix had to rate it tv ma because everyone is mad about the dancing and clothes and says it encourages pedos. I know Iâ€™m gonna get downvoted to hell cuz of this, but cuties is somewhat accurate. Think about it, what do people see on social media, theyâ€™ll see the same things the girls on cuties were wearing and theyâ€™ll see the same dance form. Not saying that this is ok but sheâ€™s 11. Why wouldnâ€™t she want to dress like how the people on social media dress if itâ€™s all she sees? Not saying itâ€™s cool if sheâ€™s 11 and itâ€™s a tv ma rating, but what do 11 year olds want to wear or wear nowadays? And her dance group that she joins does a lot of provocative dance moves, most likely because thatâ€™s what they see on social media. And then thereâ€™s the whole thing where sheâ€™s talking to boys who are way older than her. Literally all of our parents have told us how weâ€™re going to start liking people of whichever gender you prefer. Basically I feel like French Netflix had the right idea but went about it totally wrong and could have left out some parts if the girls were ment to be 11, or that they could have use young adults to film the movie instead if they still wanted to keep relatively the same script. And if youâ€™ve read this far and havenâ€™t instantly downvoted me for quoting the accuracy of the movie , feel free to politely downvote now. Goodbye Karma
