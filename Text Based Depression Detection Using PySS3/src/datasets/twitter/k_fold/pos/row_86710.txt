Do you ever get that feeling That itâ€™s late and you are super tired and you get that feeling that you gonna be extra toxic and you donâ€™t know why but like you prob gonna wake up with upside down blue houses but itâ€™s fucking 3 am and I wonder how hard I can push this guys buttons and how much of an asshole everyone thinks I am? Because damn I kinda want to be a complete prick for like no reason jeez I think I need sleep before I make someone feel sad or mildly annoyed or something
