About School! My teachers robbed me of my practical scores they gave every student who got an A or A+ in theoretical portion got A+ in their practical exam (since no practical exams took place this year due to COvid) except me I got A only which made me from what would have been the highest grade to getting low grading I regret studying in this school .
When I said them about it it has been 1 month of constantly asking the teachers to give good grades. I think they won't give me my deserved grade 
I got robbed....
