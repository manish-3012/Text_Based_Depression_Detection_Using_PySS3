Kink Shaming People shouldnt kink shame others. I believe the only two exceptions are:
1. If it's illegal, i.e. pedophilia, necrophilia.
2. If that person forces it onto you/others.

But if someone keeps it to their self and respect your views on it, you shouldn't make then feel bad about it. Some people can't control what turns them on and shaming them on something they can't control is wrong.
