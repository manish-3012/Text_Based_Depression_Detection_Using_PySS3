I told my friend that I wanna hang out and I really miss her(which I do) but we havenâ€™t communicated after that for 2 weeks I feel like this always happens. I even told her sheâ€™s basically my one close friend. I feel like Iâ€™m nothing to her tho bc she has friends she closer with. Itâ€™s a big deal for me tho bc I donâ€™t share as much about myself with people as much as I have with her. She doesnâ€™t even know how I am entirely, itâ€™s crazy. Anyways, I get too attached to people and it sucks how fun it is every time we talk but I get too excited when we make plans to meet and it usually doesnâ€™t happen. I feel like Iâ€™m putting too much responsibility on her to make me happy bc she has told me before that she has a lot of shit going on in her own life and she doesnâ€™t like when she has to deal with other peopleâ€™s shit too. She also embarrasses me every time I get excited when we make plans
