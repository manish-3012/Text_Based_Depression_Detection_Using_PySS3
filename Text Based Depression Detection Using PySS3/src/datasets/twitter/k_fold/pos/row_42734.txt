How do guys like to be flirted with over text/snapchat? Iâ€™ve kinda realized that Iâ€™m a little mean to the boy I like. We are friends as of rn but we used to hookup a while ago and nothing serious ever came of it. He calls me pretty and stuff but heâ€™s really not over his ex dumping him so iâ€™m helping him through that bc he is depressed (ðŸ˜”). Iâ€™m kinda bad at giving compliments/flirting but I want him to know that I really like him. Unfortunately iâ€™m the type of girl who teases/is mean to a guy when I like him but thats hard to do over text without looking like a bitch. Anddd Ive kinda been a bitch to him unintentionally bc sometimes itâ€™s rlly hard to hear the guy you like talk about how heâ€™s depressed over his ex. Do guys really appreciate it when you say he looks nice/good morning texts, etc? I know that sounds obvious but if there are other things they prefer more I would appreciate hearing that too.
