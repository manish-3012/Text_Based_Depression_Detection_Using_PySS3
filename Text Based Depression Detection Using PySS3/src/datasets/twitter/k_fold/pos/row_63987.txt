â€œOnce I Got Bannedâ€ Once I got banned

So I sat in the sand

With nowhere to post

And nothing else planned

But I would come back, unlike most

To this wonderful land!

With many stories to boast

And many gifts on hand

I would come back to this wonderful land

Come back, I say, to this place I canâ€™t stand!

The people are annoying 

The posts lack luster

You really are boring

Is that really the best you could muster?
