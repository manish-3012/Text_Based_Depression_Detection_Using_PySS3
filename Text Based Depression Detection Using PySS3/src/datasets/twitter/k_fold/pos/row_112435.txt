My crush said I was sympathetic to her I don't really know where to begin this. I saw this girl and I thought she was cute and nice. We have a mutual friend so I asked her for some help and she was very helpful. Through her I got to know her a little better. Later, my crush told my friend (or she asked I don't know) that I was sympathetic to her and a normal guy.

Tomorrow I'll meet them again. I hope one day I can make more of just being sympathetic to her, to something more. But I don't want to enjoy this situation too much and imagining us as a couple and so on. Because if I fail, then it'll suck.

If something notable happens I'll make an update.
