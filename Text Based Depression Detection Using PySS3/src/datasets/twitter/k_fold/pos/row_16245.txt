Do yall mind (espacially girls) So i have a job at a fast food place and every once i  a while cute girls come in. So there am i asking myself should i talk to them at the register, or just leave them alone because they only want something to eat. I only began talking with one after i saw she had a pewdiepie phone case which i had to point out. So what do yall think is kt weird kr nkt if the fast food cashier starts small talk with you?
