Asked if I could buy halo mcc with my own money, apparently I CANT BE TRUSTED AND AM NOT HONEST so I did one single late assignment that was a day late. 

First year of highschool btw, and been at home most of the time except for the first term. 

I asked them if I could buy a game for my Xbox with my own money. DURING THE SCHOOL HOLIDAYS. after I got As for pretty much every subject in the last term. 

They turn around and say I canâ€™t be trusted and arenâ€™t honest enough. 

Meanwhile my brother was given a new $100 game the day he asked for it. 

In fact he deleted a year old save on another game, and my parents literally said donâ€™t do that and forgot about it.
