The mysterious creature Document page-4

I have discovered a few rare species of creatures on r/teenagers my recent discoveries have baffled the common man and shakes the foundations of science as we know it. Some people arenâ€™t horny, we thought it might have been a fluke, but NO we thought it impossible. 

Note: Needs more research for conclusive evidence

Itâ€™s been 5 hours Yes my findings werenâ€™t false the specimen isnâ€™t horny, although if I revealed the specimen the other insects would devour the subject within mere seconds. 

Note: must not reveal name

I believe this is a mutated insect that suppresses how horny the average teenager is. I must gather more research. Although I have shared my opinion with my peers: they agree this is revolutionary. Certain individuals gain an almost cult like following, these ones tend to be slightly less or more horny. HOWEVER  this must be an insect that wishes to lay low and pick of people from the side lines truly fascinating.

Note: normally the horny beetle increases urges this one suppresses it but why?

I have delved into researching more mature specimens that have been infected with the mutated insect, it appears that the insect is cannibalistic in nature and one by one slowly abducts members of the subreddit under the guise of them â€˜leavingâ€™ or â€˜taking a breakâ€™ very smart creature indeed.

Note: avoid direct contact might get infected with beetle.

Shit shit shit itâ€™s too late Iâ€™ve been infected damn it I almost had a cure! Fuck whoever find this finish my research.
