How would I convince my dad Ok so we have an MYP project due in March, how would I convince my dad to let me drop the project, itâ€™s optional but my dad wants me to do it or at least attempt it. My dad also got me a job babysitting the neighbors dogs for two weeks plus I have to start studying for the PSAT and AP physics finals, and i also got a shitload of school work daily, so how would I do this? Do you think I should convince him to let me drop the project?
