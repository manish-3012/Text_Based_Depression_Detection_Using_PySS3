i probably should have flaired this as rant but whatever

i hit up this girl from my orientation at uni and was like "hey you want to grab a bite sometime this week? im mostly free on Thursday" and she was like "sure we can grab a bite once i finish this paper ive got this week" and naturally im like "oh ok dont worry dont let me distract you" because like were both in majors with fairly intense curriculums but she really just like, didnt lmao. girls really be out here saying ill let you know and like its monday and i saw her in the res hall and she said hello and i was like hello and im just thinking here like how are you gonna be like yeah lets do a thing and then not do the thing

i dont know im sad and my dorm is lonely because im in a single and im single like its kind of funny lol
