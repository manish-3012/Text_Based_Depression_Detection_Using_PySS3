This kid is racist as fuck. This kid litterely has "White Lives Matter" as his profile pic in my PE google meets. Like at least with "All Lives Matter" or "Blue Lives Matter" you could argue the person is misguided but there is no way in hell you could argue white people are being discriminated against. Also I looked up his name in last school year's yearbook and that makes perfect sense for him.
