I shouldn't have joined this subreddit I joined this subreddit so I can have conversations with people my age, as I look through the posts literally all of them are about how they're depressed and lonely. Some people even post the same shit that they're depressed like 4 times a day, it's pretty annoying now and if you feel down get some professional help, I dont know if yall are serious or doing it to gain sympathy. Either way this subreddit is pretty disappointing.
