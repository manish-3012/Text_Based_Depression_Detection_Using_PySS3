Guys settle it or atleast help me. 
(Summary down)

So this dude called  X  was my bestfriend for like 4years he was kind of a nerd and i was one of the "cool kids" whatever he used to get bullied until i beat the shit out of the dude that bullied him and we became friends i had his back and someone was gonna hit him once  and lets just say he couldnt walk right for a week 
I had his fucking back always and one time there was this french teacher who  had one too many xanax pills that hated me idk why  so one day she kicked me out idk why and i dont really care i just went out sat with my friends and didnt think about it  the nextday this whatever she is  lifecoach/ mentor  whatever talked to me and told me that the teacher said i was dancing in the class  so i called bs and she told me if i said sorry she will "let it slide" i told her well i didnt do anything so i dont have to say anything (im stubborn as fuck) so she got my bestfriend and a girl to be like witnesses  so i was like okay no problem he will say the truth but then the girl was like he was dancing then my boy goes in like uhh yeah yeah idk why   so after the incident we all went in class we asked the whole class they said no
So i  asked him like why  the bullshit he was like i didnt even say u danced i know it looks dumb but this got me suspended a week  so i was gonna fight him but i thought he wasnt even worth it and u just told him like fuck you and just left  so come 2 years later you dont forget a bro  so i thought he wasnt worth like bothering myself but then  a friend told me like why the fuck bother its been like a year  just drop it. So i dont know what i should do i usually finish everything in a fight not keep a fight bottled up cus u didnt fight with him 




SUMMARY
Bestfriend threw me under the bus  cus a girl said i was doing something. got me 1 week suspension we aint friends no more should we make up cus we were once bros or fuck that guy?


Should i drop it and just be bros?
Fuck him he betrayed me?
