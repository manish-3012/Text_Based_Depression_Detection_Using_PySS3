Iâ€™m scared of the dark. Well not really the dark on its own, but my imagination tells me there might be something there, and I either have to check or say â€œoh, like what?â€. Would not recommend going down that path, because then I start imagining the things in detail. Then I try telling myself to not worry, because I couldnâ€™t possibly imagine that thing appearing wherever I am. And then I proceed to imagine it standing right there, maybe even with a jumpscare and music. It just spirals out of control and makes it very hard to sleep, and Iâ€™m almost 17 now. Itâ€™s like 3.30 am here, and Iâ€™m supposed to get up at 9. This sucks, does anyone else have this?
