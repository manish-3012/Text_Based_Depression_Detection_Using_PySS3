I'm in a little bit of a "girl" predicament. Now, I HIGHLY recommend you read this before you go jumpin' to conclusions.

I don't like this girl (just thought I should clear the air). But she thinks I like her, and everyday she says "I know you like me, Just say it". But that's a load of crap. I ain't no ladies man. I never been in a formal relationship. But, if you're still reading then you might think "well maybe she likes you?". Simple anwser. she likes to "run around" she was with some kid last week then they broke up now shes with someone new. I need loyalty in my life.
