my gf never initiates conversations w/ me and I don't know what to do It's so weird, she never texts me at all, I always have to text her, and even then there's only about a 60% chance she'll even respond. Her phone is old so I can't tell if it's read or not. I don't know if I need to do anything or what, but I doubt this is good lol. Any advice?

(also we can't meet in person or anything like that rn)
