How old should a 16 yr old's go be at least? I just started dating this girl and she's really sweet but I'm worried I might be too old for her. I'm 16 and she's 14. Our birthdays are literally 4 days apart. I've heard mixed opinions on this subject and I'm sure I will here too but I'm scared to ask my friends. Please answer honestly.
