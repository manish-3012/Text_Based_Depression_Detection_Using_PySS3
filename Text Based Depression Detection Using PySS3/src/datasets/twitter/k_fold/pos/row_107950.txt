Why did they broke with me So here is the thing : in total I got 7 gf and they all left me without saying why but I was trying to be the best bf possible like I was doing whatever they wanted I tried to hide my flaws as much as possible and I was nice and all with them (and everybody else  I'm not a simp). So can you girls please tell me your reasons why you left your bf?
Thanks for reading.
