Does anyone else have a list of people they absolutely hate? I have a list of people I know and hate in my brain. There's people who have been on my list since pre-school. As I get older the list gets longer.






























I just want to know does anyone else do this or am I just weird?
























Also to clarify I put people on the list based on how they treat me. I'm generally a fun and humble dude, but if you piss me off I can make your life hell. Even Satan himself would be jealous.
