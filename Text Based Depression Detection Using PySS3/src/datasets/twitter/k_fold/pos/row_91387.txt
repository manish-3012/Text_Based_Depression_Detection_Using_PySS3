Greetings from an Ojibwe Greetings, they are important to my culture. I give them to you all to reaffirm what this season should be remembered for. I believe that this time is so much more than time with your immediate family. In my culture, we have a belief about what family really means. Family to us means all humanity, as opposed to just immediate and extended relatives. We are taught to some degree or another that all humans are family thus meaning you should give love to others.  So please, give kind regards to others you may not think of. - Xander (Ojibwe Warrior, brother)
