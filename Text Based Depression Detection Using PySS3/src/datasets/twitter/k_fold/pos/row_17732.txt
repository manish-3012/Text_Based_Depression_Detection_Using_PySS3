I've understood how lucky I am So I've always been the nerdy short white introverted boy. And I have Asperger. I had luck in elementary school, because I was in a class full of nice kids and the teachers are who were mean to me.
If I was in another class in elementary school I would have been bullied.

Later, in middle school, a stupid thot was bullying me for being a nerd and short. I punched her with my sandal and got detention, but it was worth it. If I was in other classes in middle school, more kids would have been bullying me, and I would have probably suicide.

Now I'm learning in an Art-School, one of the best high schools in my country, and I'm surrounded by other nerdy people from my kind.

I hope all of you have luck like me. Don't suicide. Don't bully others. Be nice to others to make them feel good, it'll make you feel good too.
