When did I say that? So my crush and I have been dming on discord and we both know we like each other we don't live near each other and its pretty early on. I don't think much is going to happen with him but I love talking to him, and he is cute in more ways than one. There is another guy I talk I thought of as a friend. The friend has an amazing voixe that any girl would die for and I love it but I don't like him like I do my crush. So after a couple hours of not texting (its fine we are both busy) my crush dms me and says the friend told my crush I like him (the friend) and that I said that. I did not say I like the friend as anything more than the friend. It maid be mad and I just needed to rant
