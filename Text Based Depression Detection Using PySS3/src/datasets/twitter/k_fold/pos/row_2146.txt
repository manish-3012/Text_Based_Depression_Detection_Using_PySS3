Itâ€™s my birthday!! I am turning 17! None of my friends texted me, so I doubt you guys will care. I got some money I am using to save up for a PC! Itâ€™s pretty awesome that I have school off today because I rarely have school off on my birthday. If this post gets high enough one of my friends might see this.
