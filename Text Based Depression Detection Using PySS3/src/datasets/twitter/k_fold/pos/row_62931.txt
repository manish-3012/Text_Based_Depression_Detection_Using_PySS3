Are promise rings supposed to be closer to engagements? I heard somewhere that promise rings are supposed to be given to your girl as a sort if pre-engagement ring, but i dont know if that's true. I got my gf one for our one year anniversary, I didnt think it was like a mini engagement. I still dont think it is a mini engagement or anything, am I right in thinking that? I think it's just a ring to show you are committed and in a real relationship, I'm just curious to know what other people think promise rings are.
