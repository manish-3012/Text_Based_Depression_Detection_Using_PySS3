So my mom just left home because of a film My dad wanted to watch godfather with the family but when I looked away to my cat because he was eating my food. Then my father called me menntally disabled because " I can't concentrate for 5 mins"
We haven't even watched 5 mins in the film, then they started screaming that we should watch the film, that I'm not disabled...
Then my mom left home and...
I hope she comes back

Sorry for bad English but I'm very nervous and scared...
