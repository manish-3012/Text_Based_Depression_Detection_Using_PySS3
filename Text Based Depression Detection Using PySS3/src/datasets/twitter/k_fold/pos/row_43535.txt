2. I havent been able to eat sense 1pm yesterday (5:30pm rn) without puking it up
3. I fucked a lot of things up in a very short amount of time
4. I feel the same way now than I did two years ago when my dad passed
5. Everything is numb inside 
6. If I did the math right, I lost 3lbs this week alone because Im not able to eat a healthy amount
7. Im down to one friend 
8. I want absolutely nothing to do with anything horny for the rest of my life
9. I actually have regrets now
10. I want to move on but cant stop thinking about stuff
11. I have no will to do anything anymore
12. Nothing can cheer me up
13. I have a headache from thinking about how I could have prevented things 

There you have it. hope yalls life is better than mine atm
