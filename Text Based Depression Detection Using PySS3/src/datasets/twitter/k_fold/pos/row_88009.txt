I think my career shall be as a stay at home dad. I don't know what I want to do with life. And if I ever come to a determination, would I ever become successful? Good, even? 

I have become so vulnerable to the harshness of life, and I feel like my emotional side can be best nutured to nuture others. To teach others.

I want to be able to support a woman in her dreams. I want a wife who aspires, who is intelligent enough to become something great. Intelligent enough to support our family.

That said, I wish to also provide for the family, but I fear I may never be able to effectively provide for myself. Thus, in a family situation, I would wish to raise children.

Young humans whom I can voice love, preach against violence, raise to be thinkers and praisers of morality. Give them discipline without a single strike and teach right and wrong in a calm tone.

I want to be a good husband, and I wish to be a good father.

Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.
