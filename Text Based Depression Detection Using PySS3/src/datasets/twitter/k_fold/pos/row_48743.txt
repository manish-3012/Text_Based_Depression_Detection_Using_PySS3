As someone who lives near the negorno Karabakh region, let me clear up the fake news. â€¢The region belongs to Armenia: this is a lie, the international community recognizes negorno Karabakh as property of Azerbaijan.

â€¢Turkey is helping Azerbaijan in fighting: this is partly a lie, they have hired mercenaries from Syria to assist the Azeris, the are not fighting directly

â€¢Armenians have lived there for thousands of years:
The Armenians have lived there for just 30 years, after  beheading and burning multiple Azeris and taking the land in the 90s

â€¢Azerbaijan started the conflict: no, the conflict was brewing ever since 2016 and both sides are responsible.
