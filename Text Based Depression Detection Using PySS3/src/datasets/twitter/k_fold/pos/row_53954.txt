From next Tuesday on Masks are not going to be mandatory at my school I (14, f) am a student at a German school in NRW, where the masks arenâ€™t going to be mandatory from Tuesday on.

Before Summer vacation I went to school for one month with a A and B week concept. This means that we were split in two groups and we  went to school for one whole week and then the other group went to school. We didnâ€™t have to wear a mask when we were sitting at our seats because we were keeping the mandatory distance (1,5m/6 feet). But we had to wear them in the hallway and outside.

Since the beginning of the new school year we have been going to school with masks the whole time and with everyone together.

However the state is getting rid of the mandatory masks. A majority of my class agreed that we should keep wearing masks because it is the only thing that keeps us safe, especially because we are sitting really close.

The state is saying that we donâ€™t need the masks because we have low cases and everything is under control.

In my opinion it is not smart to get rid of the masks because we only have so few cases because of the masks social distancing and other factors like lockdowns that lower the risk of getting infected. By getting rid of the masks the numbers would just go up again. 

I would like to know what others think about this so it would be nice if you would tell me in the comment section.

TL;DR: My school is getting rid of the mandatory mask rule and I donâ€™t like it. Wbu?
