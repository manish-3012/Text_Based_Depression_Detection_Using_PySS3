This sucks So basically, Iâ€™m in the 7th grade rn. I had this gf, but I broke up with her. Even after that, we remained rly good friends. We had even talked about getting back together a few times. So she was playing a prank on me, pretending to be suicidal, and I spent 8 hours strait trying to comfort her. Apparently, one girl found out and told the principal of my school. Now, she has external PE, so she goes home instead of going to 8th period. I was called to the office, and questions for around 1 1/2 hours. Then I heard the police say they were going to her house, and my heart stopped. Eventually, everything *kinda* worked out. The thing is, everything me and that girl had together is gone. We were close enough to be family, and this thing ruined all of it. We arenâ€™t allowed to talk, she was offered a restraining order on ME, and itâ€™s just ruined everything. I just thought this kinda belonged here
