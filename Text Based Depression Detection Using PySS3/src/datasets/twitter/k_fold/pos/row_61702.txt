Terrible news... On new yearâ€™s (January 1st) my friends (twins 13m and 13f) lost their mother due to a terrible disease (Iâ€™m not sure what it was). I reached out to them to tell them that I was there if they ever needed to talk or whatever.
I guess what im trying to say is you should appreciate the people surrounding you while you can.
