Im hungy and nobody feels like going to the store and my mom made fun of me for being hungry Anyways, hereâ€™s the lyrics to buttercup by jack stauber but google translated. 

Forget it, I'll do it someday, oh
Trapped in a button
Can't you do it someday?
I pushed too much!
Well, please electrify me
Electrify my golden teeth
blind
Without scattering sparks
Electrify my mind
Electrify my mind
Yeah, surprise, I'm at the same time
In the same sun
(Yes Yes)
Oh, you cut me to size (ow)
My little buttercup
(it hurts!)
Well, my electrification
Electrify my golden teeth
Can't see those eyes
Without scattering sparks
Electrify my mind
Electrify my mind
Electrify my mind
Electrify my mind
