ugh i hate it when It's 12 pm on a school night and my boyfriend snuck in through my window, so I'm ------- him to the tiny meat gang podcast and he's eating spaghetti o's out of a can, and we hear my mom coming up the stairs (probably just to use the bathroom, because the one downstairs is broken) and my boyfriend freaks out and accidentally drops the can on my face, and i get covered in spaghetti o's and it gets in my eyes and i cant see. As soon as I hear my mom walk across the hallway, Cody starts moaning really loud. We hear her walk towards door, and my boyfriend starts trying to get dressed, and i realize that my face fucking hurts really fucking bad. I jump up and try to turn off the podcast, but I still can't see, because spaghetti o's, so I trip over a pile of books and knock over a candle and catch the curtain on fire. The fire alarm starts going off, and my bf grabs the only water in the room which is in his bong. At this point I'm getting super lightheaded. My mom opens the door to my shirtless bf with his pants unbuttoned holding a bong, the curtain still on fire, me on the floor with no shirt covered in spaghetti o's, and Noel and Cody making porn noises in the background. My boyfriend puts out the fire and grabs a towel out of the bathroom to clean my face with. He starts wiping my face, and then all of the sudden he stops. He says, "Oh my God...." and that's the last thing I remember before I black out. I wake up in my mom's car with a towel under my head and my boyfriend holding my hand. We get to the ER, my boyfriend is shirtless, I'm only wearing panties and a bra, wrapped in a blood soaked towel, still covered in spaghetti o's, and my mom is wearing her bathrobe and slippers with her bonnet on. Apparently, when my boyfriend dropped the can on my face, it cut my head open pretty bad. We're sitting in the waiting room, and my boyfriend's ex walks in with her brother. I ended up getting 8 stitches in my head, and the next day at school, everyone knew what happened because my boyfriend's ex put a bunch of pictures of us on her snapchat story.
