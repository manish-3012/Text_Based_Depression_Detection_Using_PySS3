pee pee poo poo title there's this girl i rly like and i've been taking to her for a few months. we both rly like each other but she lives kinda far so we aren't dating yetttt. but she's like super dumb. i'm not trying to be disrespectful towards her or anything but that's the only way i could put it. she has basic human knowledge but no common sense at all. i wasn't gonna post this but just a few minutes ago she asked me why i had normal kitchens ingredients in my house as if it was a bad thing. i like her but i'm starting to wonder if i should keep taking to her. she literally just found out what "24/7" meant last week. her questions get dumber and dumber everyday and i can't stand it anymore. but i also love her.
