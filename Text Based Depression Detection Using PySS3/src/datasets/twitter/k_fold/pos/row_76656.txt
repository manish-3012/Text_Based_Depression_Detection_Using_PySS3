i wish i could get used to being lonely so i think i never really had any good friends up until almost a year ago now. i met a dude on here (ill call him nick) who had a similar taste in music, and i figured itd go the same way all my encounters here do: wed talk for a bit, maybe a couple hours at most, then go about our lives the next day and forget the other one existed. anyway tho nick actually hit me up the next day, and the day after, and so we kept talking and became good friends. i met several friends through him and vice versa, and we all had a gc where we basically just shitposted and talked about music, and we would call on discord pretty often. so after awhile, in i wanna say august, he started getting sorta distant and we talked less and less. i was still friends with our mutuals tho and we talked plenty, so i could cope with him not wanting to talk much anymore. but after a bit our mutual friends stopped talking to me as much too. i found out they all had group chats without me, and a bunch of other friends. this made me feel really shitty and lonely, so i kinda resented them, nick specifically. i still talked (and still do) to two of our friends sorta often, like almost every day, but its never much more than a few sentences. anyway ive come to realize that if id never been friends with him, i wouldve never known what having close friends was like, and i wouldnt feel so empty like i do now. i just wish i could forget about them, but at the same time i dont because i had some great times in that period of my life.
