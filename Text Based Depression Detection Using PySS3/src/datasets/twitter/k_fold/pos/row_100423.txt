Looking at my past posts on this sub and CRINGING Jesus Christ, why was I so HORNY. ALL THE TIME? I mean, i know why: I had been sexually repressing myself because of my conservative Christian father, so once I realized that being gay was ok all the repressed horniness came flooding out at once, but JESUS. Maybe it's because I'm legally an adult now, but looking back at my posts on here from when I was like 16 - 17 makes me cringe really bad. I'm sorry if I made any of y'all uncomfortable. I'm working on bettering myself now.
