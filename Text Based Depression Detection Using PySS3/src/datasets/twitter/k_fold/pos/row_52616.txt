How do i convince my mom to let me take the bus to work? Weâ€™re literally broke at this point. Weâ€™ve been on disability checks for awhile now and weâ€™ve been good on it, but i turned 17 this month which means they cut off 500$ from it. Which means hardly any money.

I had a job before but they terminated me due tk covid. I really want to get a job because its the perfect time due to only having to go to school 4 times out of the week for 4 hours, plus i really wanna focus on music which costs a LOT of money. 

Even my therapist agrees that now would be a good time as long as the place has good covid conditions. My mom says something is wrong with her car, so she cant drive like everyday. So I suggest ok let me take the bus then. But then she says â€œno how about we wait until we get the car fixedâ€. But since shes getting 500$ deducted theres almost no way thats getting fixed anytime soon.

Shes only saying this shit because shes too damn overprotective. Like literally im 17 now i should be able to take the bus to work especially in a time where we need the extra money. How can i convince her?
