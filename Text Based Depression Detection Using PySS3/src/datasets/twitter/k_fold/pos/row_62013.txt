No one will care but I wrote a poem ***Dear Kid- OC poem by*** u/books4introvert

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid with the yellow backpack,

Do you still remember the day we meet?

You may not but I'll cut you some slack

It was a very cold and gray 

We were both very new

and both very gay

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid with the pink hair,

Do you remember the day you sat next to me?

I was in dismay

Then I saw you and knew I'd be okay

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid with the pretty dress,

Do you know how bad I wanted to be friends?

I made countless drawings

all were shitty

all of different things

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid with the amazing frog drawing,

Do you know I never got your name?

You would've been my first friend

I guess I only have myself to blame

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid from study hall,

Do you know that I won't be there come Monday?

My personal life has grown too much

and now they want to take you away

&amp;#x200B;

Dear kid,

Do you want to be friends one day?
