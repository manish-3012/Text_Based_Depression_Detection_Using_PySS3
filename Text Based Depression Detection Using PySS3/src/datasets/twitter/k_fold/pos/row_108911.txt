I and another girl are designing a Tee Shirt for a spiritual retreat that is supposed to mean a lot to us and she traced I am so pissed off right now.  In the junior year, my school does a spiritual retreat to become closer to your class.  It completely changes people.  It means a lot to me and to my class, and being put on the staff of it was a HUGE excitement to me.  We were also told that some of us had to make a Tee Shirt for the Back Crew which we got to name and which I can't tell because she might find this.  

I and this other girl were working pretty closely together and she showed me a refrence image pretty early.  When she showed me her final design it looks suspiciously similar to the reference, so I checked it, and guess what?  It was traced.  100%, no way around it.  It was traced.  I am so pissed off right now.  Like, I put effort into my design.  She just traced it, like it didn't mean shit to her.  I can't believe her.  I even asked her if she traced and she said that she was just good at drawing from refrence.  NO YOU FUCKING AREN'T YOU  BITCH YOU JUST TRACED IT!!!!

I'm going to the teachers in charge of it and I'm going to try to get her design kicked out.  I don't want her to get punished by the school, I just want her to realize that you have to draw from with your own hands and that tracing is flat out wrong.  Any other ideas as to what I should try and do?
