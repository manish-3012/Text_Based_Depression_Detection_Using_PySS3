Teens are stupid and I dont care I went to an arcade and met a grp of Teen who hogging a arcade cabinet, maimai. I waited aside for my turn to play. One of them, unknown of my skill level, approached and challenge me to beat their most pro player, who can "A" a lvl 11 chart (while i can "S" a lvl 12 chart), in a field of rhythm game.

Midgame, he throw curse at his buddy and also me (i think so, too focus on game to give fuck)? Game over, he handed a sum of money to them, apparently they gamble if the most pro can beat me, which i found unworthyly stupid and funny.

15 yr old me would prob join the gamble and prob never learn what is gambling addiction.
