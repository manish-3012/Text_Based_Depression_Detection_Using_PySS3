Damn i just had a hard day So my school has canceled our first module of the day because of health concerns, so i currently meet at 10 and stay until 16, instead of 8-14 or 8-16, so i have plenty of time in the morning. I slept at my girlfriends last night, but i woke up and walked her to school (She goes to school in the same city as we live, whereas i attend one about 45 away by train), and then went to my school just to meet in early... Anyways that school day was really damn warm and boring, and i was really tired for some reason. Guess i didn't sleep well. On the train home, i was supposed to get off 1 stop later than my home city, because i had a shift, and i work outside of town, but i fell asleep in the train at my normal stop and FUCKING SLEPT 15 MINUTES PAST MY STOP.... anyways, i caught a train back and came in 30 min late, which wasn't a big deal because my boss is also a real pal, plus it was a lazy day today without much to do, but still, dissapointing your boss sucks... When i got off work 2 hrs ago, my train home was cancelled as well, so that sucked. I'm so wrecked that i'm not even gonna meet with my gf tonight, just going to bed and listening to 808s &amp; heartbreak tbh. she's real supportive tho, so that's really taking the edge off of feeling shitty.

Sorry, just needed to vent. How Y'all doing?
