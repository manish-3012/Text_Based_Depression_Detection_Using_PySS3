Trying to understand whether something my girlfriend did was on purpose or just coincidental So last night me and her were watching Talladega Nights on zoom (we do virtual movie nights together) now idk if you've seen it, but there's a few scenes wheregirks flash people. So after one of those scenes, I saw her look down, then adjust her shirt, and move up and back a bit so more of her chest was in frame. 

I'm really confused cause also she was biting her lip and also her shirt was way too big so it was kinda barely hanging onto one of her shoulders.
