To my broken hearted comrades...do u ever just... Imagine some scenario or something and they change their mind. Tell u they were wrong, they're starting to feel differently, or maybe that they didnt realize that they had liked u all along

But it's all in ur head and the reality is that u mean fucking nothing to them...and somehow, remembering that that scenario will never happen makes it hurt more
