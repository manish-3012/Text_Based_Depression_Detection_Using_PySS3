I think it's strange seeing 13 year olds around Reddit Ok, so I'm sixteen, it's not that long ago since I was thirteen. I kind of remember the time, and when I see users here on r/teenagers I very often think it's strange. You know, of the way they all seem to talk and act. Maybe it's because most of the users are americans (?) and I'm not, maybe it's because I've totally forgotten what it's like to be thirteen. But like, having so much problems with relations? At that age? It feels so weird 'cause when I was at that age there wasn't so much talk about such things. I feel like I'm at least ten years older than them.
