Do EVERYTHING you can in highschool I'm a senior this year. Looking back on my highschool years they were nothing great, I spent 3 years going to school thinking it was prison and only living through it so I could go home and play videogames. I messed up. There is so many clubs and amazing opportunities in highschool, I wish I would've known how much I would regret the decision to not do anything now when I was a freshman. I think about turning back time so I could do it all again differently. So please, learn from my mistakes. Don't put any "normie" shit below you. All those people that you see the ones who do clubs,organize events, and play sports. They're the ones who don't have regrets, they're the ones who truly enjoy their highschool experience. So I don't know who has to hear this but, do EVERYTHING you can do in highschool because time is the one thing that waits for no one and it sure as hell won't wait for you, the only thing you will be left with at the end is regret and regret isn't something you can fix. It took me 3 years of high school to come to this realization and now that I finally have COVID has destroyed what little hope I had left as I'm sure it has for others as well, but if you are not a senior yet I don't care if you're a freshman, sophomore,or junior. Do everything you can as soon as possible. Learn from my mistakes.
