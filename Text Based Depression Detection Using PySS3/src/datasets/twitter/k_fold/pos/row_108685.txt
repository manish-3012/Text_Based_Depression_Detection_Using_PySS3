I Need Help It has recently come to my attention that one of my Discord friends lives in an abusive household. Their only non-abusive family member is their dad, who lives about 2,000 miles away, and doesnâ€™t have much money. Note that Anon lives on the East coast, and I live on the West coast. They also doubt CPS would do anything as there isnâ€™t much visual evidence, despite the fact that Anon has asthma, but their family refuse to acknowledge this. They are also quite sure that if CPS doesnâ€™t do anything, their family would take everything from them. I seriously do not know what to do, any help would be much appreciated.
