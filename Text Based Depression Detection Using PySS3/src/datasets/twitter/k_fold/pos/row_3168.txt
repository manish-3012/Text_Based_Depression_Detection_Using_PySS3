Day 3 of walking away from a toxic friendship: She scares me Yesterday was the first time I've felt a sense of self after walking away from a seven year toxic friendship. She'd conditioned me to rely on her for all my happiness, so I couldn't walk away. 

Now thinking about it, she scares me. She scares me because not only is she a bully and a bitch, she's incredibly smart. She's scary because she knows exactly how to manipulate others and use them to her whim without them ever saying a word about it.

 It takes an incredibly strong person to walk away from her, the only three I know of that have ever broken her hold on them are my best friend, one other guy friend and myself. There's others who've seen through her before being drawn in though, which takes a very perceptive person to do.
