How to let go of grudge?  

I'm a senior in high school right now. About a year ago, someone took his embarrassing pic of me, and it wounded up spreading. This wasn't a nude pic or something that was compromising, and no one really cared about it, but this kid is a real snake and the way he did that makes me wanna punch him in the face.

I remembered him saying something about the "whole school seeing it". For some reason, none of this really struck me until quarantine started and everything shut down. When I had more time to dwell, I confronted him online about it, and we talked over it and he apologized. According to him, he wasn't trying to hurt me or embarrass me, and wasn't trying to be mean, but was simply trying to be funny. However, when I inquired him about him saying that the whole school saw it, he kept insisting that he never said that.

I can't report him to the dean because I tried to get back at him in various ways. By making a fake Reddit account and impersonating him and saying awful stuff on there, and then sending the account to 5 people to try to get it to spread. While him and I were talking about stuff, he mentioned about getting bullied on the bus once, and kids would mock him for liking cows (he was indian), and he would come home and cry in his room every night. I mocked him for liking cows and called him a cow shit.

In response to the Reddit thing, he said that he would report me to the dean if I did that again, even if it means getting himself in trouble. I wanna break his nose and get even with him so bad.

How do I go about doing that without getting myself in trouble and have some sort of plausible deniability?
