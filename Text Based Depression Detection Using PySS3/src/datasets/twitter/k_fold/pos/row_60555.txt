I am going set my school projects on fire. It's 6am when I'm writing this, just pulled a all-nighter and feel like shit. Cognitive powers are somewhere, but I don't know where. Am bare able to write this. I swear if I don't get good marks for this b.s I will set my project on fire, make a video of it being on fire and send it to my teachers and the rest of the internet. This rant makes me feel better.
