Friend keeps putting herself In bad situations that are completely preventable. What can I do to help her? I have a friend who, for as long as I have l known her, has put herself in a place where her grades are failing and her parents are upset with her, continuously. For example, she will knowingly neglect her schoolwork, her grades will suffer, and then want us to feel bad for her when she receives consequences from her parents. Itâ€™s starting to become very irritating, is there anything I can do make her understand this?
