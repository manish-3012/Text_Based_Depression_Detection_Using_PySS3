A is for Apple - a hate story by me. A stands for Apple. Apple stands for â€œpiece of shit computer company that should honestly only make phones because thatâ€™s as close as they can get to making a semi-functional device that still works after updates. Apple also doesnâ€™t put previous versions of apps on the App Store so if you use an outdated OS you canâ€™t download the app even though literally 1 version ago the app was running fine.â€

L is for Love, and Bush was involved in 9/11.

Thank you for coming to my rant. Please join me again next Friday night at 9PM where we tackle the topic of â€œbiphobesâ€. Until next time, this is your host Stereotyped Moped.
