I have a lot of questions on my mind so buckle up or dont, idc 1.)How do you deal with family drama that you feel you started?
2.)is it normal to feel like you have nobody that you can depend on?
3.)am I posting too much today? I've posted like every hour.
4.)What r some wholesome/cute subreddit I need something to distract myself

Have a nice day:) *hug*
