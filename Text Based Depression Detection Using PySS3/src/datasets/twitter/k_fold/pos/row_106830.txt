Why would I fo to therapy when I'm feeling better? So i was extremely low for a few months. I completely isolated myself from other people. I was seriously thinking about myself and got kinda close to doing it.

But things have improved and for around 7 days I've been able to actually enjoy doing some things. I'm still low but I'm able to feel happiness again.

So I asked here whether I should still talk to a therapist about it. Everyone seemed to think that I should. 

But I don't understand why would I. Don't people go to talk to a therapist to feel better? I already feel better.

So could you explain why I should get help. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings and allow myself to be vulnerable. I'm actually scared of going there.

So why should I reach out for help?
