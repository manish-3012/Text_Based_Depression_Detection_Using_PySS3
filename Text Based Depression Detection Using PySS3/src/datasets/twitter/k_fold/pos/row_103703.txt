Diving deeper into the Auras: Galaxiea 
This is the first of a series I hope to do about my god species The Auras! I will be going in age order so letâ€™s begin! First on our list is Galaxiea!

## Physical/ social descriptions of the Auras can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveDaydreaming/comments/mkqcma/introducing_my_god_species_the_auras/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)



**Basic info**

Galaxiea is the oldest of all the Auras and the firstborn of the Council. She is also the largest Aura in Pris, standing 33 feet at the ear. Galaxiea has no siblings or children.

Galaxiea is everything physical in the universe. She creates and controls stars, planets, black holes, neutron stars, and pretty much everything else that inhabits space. She decides what moves where and when often planning the course of entire galaxies hundreds of thousands of years ahead of time.

Like all Tier 1 Auras, Galaxiea possesses telepathy and telekinesis. She uses it constantly to keep her items floating around her as well as to lift and move items. She (as well as all the other upper Auras) only talk through telepathy.



**Physical description**

Galaxiea is the tallest of the Auras, about 33 feet at the ear. She is tall, stocky, muscled, and well-built. Her short fur is dark blue-black in color. Her eyes are a rich dark purple.

She has several planets, rings, and asteroid belts floating around her at any time- never touching her fur. Large, yellow, planet-like rings dance around her neck, tail, ears, and ankles like jewelry. An asteroid belt floats down her spine from neck to tail, weaving around the rings. Planets of varying sizes and colors orbit in between the rings and asteroids. None of these items actually hold life. They are simply shrunken-down versions of the real thing Galaxiea wears for show.

Sometimes, especially when bored, Galaxiea will pick up one of the planets that float around her, inspecting it. She may ever play with the rings or watch the asteroids soar around her. She doesnâ€™t do this often as it breaks the cold, uncaring front Galaxiea puts on.

**Fun** **facts**

* Galaxiea has sworn off having children saying â€œNo one has, or ever will, share my power. That is final.â€

* Galaxiea loves murder mystery books; itâ€™s the only genre she will read. She has several bookshelves filled with murder mystery in about a dozen languages that line her room. Very few know about this though, since Galaxiea only reads the in her room and is slightly embarrassed. Only her personal servants know, as she occasionally sends them out to retrieve her new books. She absolutely loves them and has read each book she owns at least 3 times, but will never admit it

* When she wants to look fancy or regal, Galaxiea will change the items that float around her. She may add rings above her head like halos or planets around her neck like a necklace. She never wears regular jewelry and instead uses these items as fashion.

* Galaxiea can sometimes be seen tutoring young school-age Auras on physics and laws. Always get flustered and closed off whenever someone points it out.

* Galaxiea is one of the few Auras that enjoy swimming. Most Auras do not enjoy getting wet. On warm days, Galaxiea may be seen dropping her floating items beside Prisâ€™s lakeshore before diving in. She says that the water reminds her of floating in space. She doesnâ€™t swim often as she believes that it undermines her cold exterior

* Since Galaxiea has no blood family, she is not very close to many other Auras. Her closest friends are Time, Death, and Electricity.

* Though Electricity is a tier 2 Aura, Galaxiea spends a fair amount of time with him. This had led to rumors spreading around Pris about the level of their relationship. Some say they simply work together as their powers relate closely and intertwine often. Others say they have a more intimate relationship. Neither Galaxiea nor Electricity have spoken out about these rumors. Though Galaxiea hates rumors, the blind male has convinced her to let them go, but she still snarls at anyone she catches talking about it.
