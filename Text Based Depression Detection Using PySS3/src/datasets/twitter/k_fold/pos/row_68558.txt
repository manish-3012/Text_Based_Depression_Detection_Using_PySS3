I feel like such a failure I feel this way due to my algebra grade. I'm failing the class and my dad has always been about good grades and I have always got them. Now, though I feel like a failure because this is my first time ever failing a class. I don't want to tell my dad, but I will have to because I will get kicked out. I feel like a failure and a letdown
