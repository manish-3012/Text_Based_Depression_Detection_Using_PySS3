Please read this. You don't want to have regrets in life. Hey guys/gals I'm 23 ATM. I have some life advice as boring as that is to share. Please listen, the future you will thank you.

Whatever age you are right now doesn't matter, what matters is time is always passing. I'm 23 and just yesterday is was in high school. As it turns out our perception of time speeds up as we age. https://youtu.be/aIx2N-viNwY

While time is going slow and you are in school please take a look around and reflect upon what you are struggling with right now. Take small steps to get past whatever hardships you are going through.  It will be scary, but the future you will thank you! I can't understate this enough.

My personal hardships in high school which I still haven't moved past have been:
Major social anxiety especially with women
Major confidence issues
Having very minor amounts of friends.
Having a porn addiction since the age of 11 give or take.
Never valuing myself

If you relate to or have your own struggles please work to resolve them now. We only have one life and one time on this earth.  Also trust me these problems never get any easier. Tomorrow never comes. Saying I'll do this tomorrow and then the next DAT saying the same. Soon it you will be my age and realize you still haven't gotten past your fears.

Please please take the steps now to better your life. Whatever that takes: therapy, new friends, a new environment, building up support structure, going to a different lunch table and hanging out with new people, standing up for yourself, telling the bully you aren't afraid of him, distancing yourself from toxic people,
