What is the actual point of this sub and is it even being used for its proper purpose I'm gonna be real here, the majority of the posts here are to get the attention, karma and awards for a few things: pet died, feeling confident and posts a selfie for the first time, really shitty meme, not feeling suicidal for once. sorry now but we all know that this is the internet and the majority of this is outright bullshit but yet due to the general age democratic we feel the need to take the safest option instead of question the validity of these posts and I believe take advantage of it

If you genuinely have some form of social or mental issue there are actual services out there to help as well as dedicated subreddits. Now the argument played is that this said person wants the support and backing from their peers which I respect but I think you can probably approach the situation less wanting the attention through extravagant pictures and stories and rather approach it through discussion and conversation

I joined the subreddit thinking we would be discussing and debating issues involving our peers, how to do and accomplish such and such as well as passive support to those who need it and directing them to the proper services (not filling them up with attention and karma) 

Take this how you want
