I accidentally got myself out of a presentation Basically Iâ€™ve been dreading a presentation I had to do for one of my classes for about 2 weeks.

I got into class and the teacher asked â€œWhich of you two want to present first?â€ One of the girls in my class rose their hand. She did her presentation then the teacher switched it to another kids presentation. I was confused but decided I would be presenting next. Once he finished, the teacher said, â€œI guess thatâ€™s all the presentations for today.â€ I was super confused. 

I thought about it a little bit, then figured it out. Last class the teacher asked me if I finished my presentation. I told him yes, because I assumed he meant if I finished making it, which I had. He probably was asked if I had *presented*. 

But Iâ€™m not complaining.
