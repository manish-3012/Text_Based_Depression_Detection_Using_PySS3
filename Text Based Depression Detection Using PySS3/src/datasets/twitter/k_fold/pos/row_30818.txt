I just asked out a girl for the first time,and I have no idea how you guys do it with no problem I just asked out a girl(result still pending,she said she needs to think) and like,it was stressful as all hell man.I have no expectation of actually getting with her,and still it was still super stressful,like I had to do everything to have my hands to stop shaking so I could type the damn message,and I have no idea how some of you people can just casually ask people out as like a dare or just out of nowhere. Anyways,you people are crazy,and I will update on how it goes.
