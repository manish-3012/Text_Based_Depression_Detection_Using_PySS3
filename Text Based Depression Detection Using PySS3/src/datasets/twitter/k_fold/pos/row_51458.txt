Which should I delete for RDR2? CoD or Rainbow Six? If I delete CoD than I can definitely download Red dead but if I delete rainbow I might have to delete a small game. I havenâ€™t played CoD since like early July (hoping season 5 will bring me back) and havenâ€™t played rainbow since like May or something. Iâ€™m not playing to play rainbow but it was the first game I got on Xbox one and I have such great memories with it.
