Iâ€™m working on moving to Japan when I turn 18. Iâ€™m working on moving to Japan sometime after turning 18, but still before my 30â€™s. Not because Iâ€™m a weeb, but because they have several good tech jobs, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m studying for. Also, I really love their food. I know a little about how to live there, but Iâ€™m worried about having to walk everywhere because Iâ€™m used to driving everywhere. I know that trains can get me places, but I would totally get lost a lot.
