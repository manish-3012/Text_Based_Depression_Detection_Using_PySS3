Are my standards low? I only want a guy whoâ€™s 5â€™7, or 170 cm (which is my height, but he can be taller), is kind, likes cuddles, gaming, and is at a normal weight for his height. Is that low or high or normal standards? I just want cuddles. I want someone to watch movies with. Imagine having physical contact with another human being.
