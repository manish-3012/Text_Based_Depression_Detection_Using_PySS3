Single this valentines? Me too, here is how you can make someone's day better (for free). Hey! I am going to be single this valentines (like most people on this sub ðŸ’€) but just because you're single this valentine's, you can still make someone's day **FOR FREE**

Shoot someone a DM with a nice compliment, ask someone if they want to play a game or even drop a like (and a share) on someone's YouTube video. Anything can make someone, even yourself happy.

Millions are doing the same as what I am saying (likely right now!). So why don't you? Doesn't cost a dime.
