How many people will this annoy here? So you know those rain grates that are on sidewalks and stuff and how most people walk around or over them. Iâ€™ve taken it apon myself to prove itâ€™s statistically improbable to fall through one by jumping on them every time I see one. I was on a walk with a friend a few days ago and I jumped on my one and his eyes just widened like wtf are you doing.
