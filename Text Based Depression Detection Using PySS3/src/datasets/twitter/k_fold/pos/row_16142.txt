Please dont watch megan is missing if you aren't the type of person to enjoy gory movies So there was this zoom call two of my bestfriends were in, it was just the two of em, i ask what they were talking about in the gc, they told me to join the call and watch the movie. Ofc i said yes, didnt really expect anything until i asked what the movie was about. They told me its this trending movie called megan is missing, i was intrigued. Until one of them sent a tiktok, it was the director of the movie, he was there to say a bunch of warnings, i who isnt into this said 

"fuck me why did i agree." 

So anyway there were a lot of messed up shit that freaked me out, but i didnt listen as much nor watch since i was checking my own homework. 

Theres this part where a disclaimer was shown, its two photos of megan, photo 1 and photo 2. Before photo 1 was shown i immediately covered my eyes since i hate gory stuff when its actually real life, for a split second i looked at it.

A very close up shot of megans head with blood, i cant describe it as much since it was only a little amount of time i looked at it, eventually photo 2 was gonna come up, ofc i didnt look at it.

But i absolutely feel sad for megan and her bestfriend amy, they were just ordinary friends until this happened 
(Wont spoil as much if you guys are intrigued)


Ive gained a lesson during this,

If you dont like it dont do it *please*
