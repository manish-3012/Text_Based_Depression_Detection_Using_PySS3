Advice on how to get boys to like you? I try to be casual and social but the guys run away from me like fleas. That doesn't make any sense but I'd still like some advice. Any and all men welcome to give me advice. Preferably around my age or older no offense but I don't want dating advice from a 14 year old. I mean you can give me some if you want but it better not be some weird kid stuff.
