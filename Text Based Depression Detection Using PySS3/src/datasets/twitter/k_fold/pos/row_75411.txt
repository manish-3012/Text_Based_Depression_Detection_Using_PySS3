I wanna play D&amp;D Iâ€™ve had 4 first sessions, none of them with a follow up. Three of those have been online with friends, and one has been in person with some of my brothers friends. Part of me wants to try and DM a game because that way I could actually make the game Iâ€™d want to play. But itâ€™s just like the meme â€œI guide others to a treasure I cannot possess.â€ I have so many goddamn character ideas floating around in my head, if I just got A CONSISTENT DAMN GAME. I kinda want to try going on r/lfg but Iâ€™m a little nervous as to how playing with random people would go. My computer is next to my brotherâ€™s so theyâ€™d hear him yelling at League and shit, and Iâ€™d feel bad if my schedule conflicted.
