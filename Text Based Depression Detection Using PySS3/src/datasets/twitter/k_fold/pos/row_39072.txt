Binge watching personal records (to be continued) Please note: when I say "binge watch", I mean "watch as much as possible while remaining healthy and keeping grades up in school". Also I know the list is short but I only decided to start keeping track around 1h ago.



- "The end of the f***ing world" (5h42): watched within 1 day

- "Friends" (121h = 5 days 1h): watched within 1 month

- To be continued...



Do any of you have any suggestions on series to watch? This list isn't going to get any longer by itself... (no anime, sorry)

Also, do I flair this post discussion, rant or other? I never know...
