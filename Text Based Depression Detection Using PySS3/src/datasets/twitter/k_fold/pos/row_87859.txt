I (16 M) have been around the same weight for 2 years, is this normal? Like the title entails, I have been about the same weight for 2 years now (around 120-125). I am currently about 5'6" and over the past 2 years have maybe grown about 2 or 3 inches total. I haven't really been concerned about this because I'm still a healthy weight, but is it strange that I haven't gained much weight? Should I be doing something to try and gain more weight?
