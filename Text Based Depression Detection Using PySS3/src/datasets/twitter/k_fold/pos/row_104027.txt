I hate my life So I started college maybe 2 months ago now and I absolutely hate it. My parents werenâ€™t home until recently, so when I would go home for the weekends, I would be alone and so I would stay for sometimes a week or more. I know I need to stay at school to â€œimmerseâ€ myself, but itâ€™s really hard rn with covid to meet people, and 95% of my classes are online. When Iâ€™m home, I dread going back to school, and when Iâ€™m at school, my depression gets 10x worse. My parents have made a deal with me that I can come home every weekend if I work Saturdays but I just want to stay at home all the time because thereâ€™s no point in me even being at school. I feel like I was not ready at all for college because I was ripped away from the rest of high school in March and didnâ€™t really get closure, and Iâ€™ve been with my family constantly since then, so itâ€™s a lot harder to leave them than I thought it would have been under normal circumstances. I have severe anxiety and part of that is separation anxiety, so I would have had problems going to college anyway. Iâ€™m only 1.5 hours from home and I have a car, but my parents donâ€™t seem to understand that maybe the best thing for me isnâ€™t being forced to stay at school. Iâ€™m planning on becoming super involved once everything is closer to normal maybe next semester, but for now I just want to be at home. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I enjoy the classes, I just hate being at school. I hate it so much that even though I enjoy the work, I would rather drop out than be at school, even though thatâ€™s something I wouldnâ€™t do because I need a degree. I wish my parents understood how hard it is to be at school during COVID because all they know is how hard it is normally and they donâ€™t even think itâ€™s that bad. What should I do?
