Why do I suck at finding a gf I always am seeing and hearing stories about how others are dating and they are really good at it. I'm not, apparently. I've never had a girlfriend, and I have really been trying my best. How come I am so unlucky?
Basically; help. I need some words of wisdom to help me date.
