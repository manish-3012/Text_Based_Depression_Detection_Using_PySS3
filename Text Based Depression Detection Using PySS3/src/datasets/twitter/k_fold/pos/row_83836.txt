Listen, I love reddit and everything, itâ€™s got some good content and some cool people buttttt.... Goddamn it can suck here. The people that hate emojis, hates everything that has to do with tiktok (which to be fair, I donâ€™t like that website since it promotes some bat shit crazy stuff) and mentions a meme template during a joke every two seconds irl are the people that kinda ruin it for me.
