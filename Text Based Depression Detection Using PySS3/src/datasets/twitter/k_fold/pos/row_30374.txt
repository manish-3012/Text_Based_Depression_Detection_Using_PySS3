starting a youtube channel is hard... so 3 weeks ago I started a youtube channel. so far it has been quite fun. the editing has been boring but definitely bearable. I finished papers please, I am almost done with FNAF and I just started Minecraft hardcore. I even started working on a discord server.

so far I have:  
12 subs

17 uploads

OK motivation

mediocre thumbnails

ok editing skills
