Fuck me this weightloss stuff is harder than I thought I do the excersise, I balance the diet, I get the fresh air, I sleep the normal, and I still notice like barely any change. I'll notice that I lose weight on my stomach, and it will INSTEAD be in my chin like God, I wanna delete this useless data from the cloud, not transfer it to another storage device. If I notice that I lose weight one day it will PILE on the next for whatever ungodly reason like I will legitimately go from 0 - O in 24 hours. I will eat less than 1k calories on a good day with as little of it being empty as possible and try to get nutritious food every day, and I still have no energy like I've been doing this for 2 months now, can God make some balance adjustments to the upgrade times please. Any advice anyone?
