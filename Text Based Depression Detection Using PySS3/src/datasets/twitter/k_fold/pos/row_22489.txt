How to make an x wing from star wars Ok so if you know me I figured out how to make a lightsaber and I posted it on here 

Btw im using yards because I don't know any other forms of measurement 

So the first problem to making a x wing is the problem with the fuel because you need do store the fuel some place and enough fuel so it doesn't run out mid flight ok and you won't be able to add a Droid because of aerodynamics 

Length and stuff 
Nose: 10 yards 
Cockpit: 5 yards 
Fuel area: 15 yards 
Wing length: 12 yards 
Guns: 5 yards
Also we can't use lasers because we don't have that technology 

What would the engine be?
So the engine would be a so the engine would be a mock 4 engine to deal with it incredible weight and the mock 4 engine would only be able to make it go mock 3 so the plane is really heavy as you can tell 

Guns:
The guns would be able to shoot 60 caliber high explosive rounds as the ammunition being inside the wings as the wings would be able to hold over 1000 rounds of ammunition and can shoot over 100 rounds a minute the gun is suppose to knock aircraft out of the sky quickly it not made to just spray aircraft out of the sky 

The Armour:
The Armour will be about a foot thick to protect it from being shot down and it won't provide the person flying it as much comfort he/she will only have a padded chair and thats it and the person flying it can only be a kind of skinny dude and not a big body dude 

Aerodynamics:
So it kind of weird but the x wing is a realy heavy plane and it was insane aerodynamics like really insane areodynmics because if it doesn't have the aerodynamics this plane would have it would just fall and break on the ground and not have much airtime 

Wear to store everything:
Wires and such would be in the back as there would to be a shorting of the fuel by removing 6 yards of the fuel all together to run the beast 
Fuel the fuel would be stored in the back where the wires and stuff would be it won't touch the wires tho and how the fuel would reach the engines there would be a device in the fuel area that will give fuel to the given engine And remember there are over 4 engines 
Ammunition the ammunition would be stored in wing as it can go in to the guns that are on the wings but they have to be in a certain order so there would be a line with a small conver belt connecting the gun to an open area that can be only be opened when nobody is in the cockpit and then it can be opened with a key

So xwings are not hard to make its just looked down on by other people
