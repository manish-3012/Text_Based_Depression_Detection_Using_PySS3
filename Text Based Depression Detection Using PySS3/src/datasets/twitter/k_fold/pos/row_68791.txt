Iâ€™m honestly gonna cry I told my dad if he thinks my bike could be fixed. Like Iâ€™d pay for everything and Iâ€™d just fix it up. And he was like â€œyou know what you need to do. You need to get your license before youâ€™re on a college campus talking about some biking. Take your older sister in the car and go practice.â€ And honestly Iâ€™m sad. I failed the first time I took it and my permit expired. Iâ€™m just not ready yet.
