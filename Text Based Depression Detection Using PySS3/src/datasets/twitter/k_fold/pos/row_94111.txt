Do you guys find it really difficult to read long text posts? Basically I find it impossible to focus when reading long text posts since I get bored or distracted after the first paragraph or so. This means that reading stories and stuff is really difficult for me, but I feel like i'm missing out on a big part of the internet by not engaging in any posts/stories that include lots of details. I'm curious if anyone else is the same, or I just have a shit attention span?
