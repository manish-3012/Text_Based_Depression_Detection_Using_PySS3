Help me find a rap I saw here years ago. Iâ€™m nearing 20, and many years and accounts ago I would to post here a lot. Thisâ€™ll be my final post on this subreddit, so hereâ€™s an impromptu and preemptive goodbye. 

But I need one final favor. Back when I used to regularly browse here a user posted a rap track they made and it was pretty good.

The only lyrics I remember are roughly â€œI like to watch hentai and ....â€ 

I donâ€™t remember anything else other than it was posted on Soundcloud and the person rapping had a pretty nasally voice. The post got quite a bit of traction so maybe itâ€™s still out there.
