School isn't too great I feel out of place pretty much anywhere so Im probably gonna keep to myself and just read in the library. I don't like really any of the class except for art cause I have two of my best friends in that class. All three of us were bullied as kids and mostly introverts and two of us are music nerds. My grades aren't too great but at least I'm passing. I regret the holidays cause I don't really have anyone to hang out with and my sister and mum fight all the time. I just kinda wish I could go to school forever even though it don't like it that much. Art is just my favourite subject for the work and the people in it.
