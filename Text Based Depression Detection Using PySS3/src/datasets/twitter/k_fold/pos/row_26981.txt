The girl I thought was "the one" isnt ready for a relationship Been talking with this girl for two months, had several date which were great in the difficult conditions we're in nowaday, so I finally declared how much I loved her ever since I saw her, but she told me she wasnt ready nor confident enough to start something and now I feel like I jumped a 3 story building because I was so confident in our relationship.
I just wanted to vent everything with strangers because i'm too destroyed to even tell my friends.
