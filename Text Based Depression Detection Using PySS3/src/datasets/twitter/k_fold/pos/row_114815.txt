Anyone else dont have a sense of identity Like, I dont really have any beliefs at all politically or religiously (I mean atheism is sort of a belief Ig but I dont feel strongly or adamantly about it). Ive never had a hobby besides sports video games and netflix even though Ive tried many. I have no idea how to describe my personality since I have so many different personalities depending on who I am with or where Im at. My morals constantly shift and change. I have no clear longterm aspirations or ambitions. 

Basically I lack all of the personality charecteristics that make up someone. Anyone else relate is this nornal am I just young I hope its just cause Im young
