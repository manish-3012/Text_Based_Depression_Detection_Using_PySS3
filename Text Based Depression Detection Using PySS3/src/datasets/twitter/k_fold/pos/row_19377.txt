i donâ€™t really know a title for this but i just needed to get this out the last few months iâ€™ve not really been doing much (obviously) but iâ€™ve also just been thinking about myself a lot. not in good ways, more like how my family thinks iâ€™m a disappointment, how my friends wouldnâ€™t care if i was even there, and about how iâ€™m just a useless waste of oxygen on the planet.

i get to talk to like two of my friends about this shit and it kinda helps by just getting it out of me, but i really donâ€™t feel that different afterwards.

iâ€™ve been struggling with personal mental and physical issues iâ€™d rather not talk about here for over a year, trying to make myself better and just fix those issues but whenever i start having hope in getting better i just go back to those issues like i never got better at all.

iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s hard to understand what iâ€™m talking about but i assume you at least get what iâ€™m trying to say.

i really just donâ€™t feel that happy when iâ€™m not doing something with my time. usually iâ€™m playing video games or babysitting my sister, watching tv, eating food, etc. but sometimes i find myself just laying in my bed at 3 am listening to music thinking about how much i hate myself and how a lot of other people donâ€™t care about me and how iâ€™ll be alone forever, since i donâ€™t want to date until iâ€™m over my issues since i wonâ€™t be happy with someone else unless iâ€™m happy on my own.

it makes me feel a little better when iâ€™m just texting my friends late at night but even then i go between basically laughing to almost crying within seconds and i really donâ€™t get myself.

well heres my rant. i just wanted to get this out really. it doesnâ€™t really make me feel much better but idk maybe 12 arrows might. honestly i have no idea why i decided to go to reddit for this.

whatever, anyway goodnight, sorry for wasting your time.
