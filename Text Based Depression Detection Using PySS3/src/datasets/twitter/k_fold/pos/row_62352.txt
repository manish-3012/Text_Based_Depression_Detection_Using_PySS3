Expressing my opinion in my house is not allowed because i am not an adult thats why i cant have an opinion (not that i live in china or anything). The problem is that i already have a set of friends and i dont want to make new ones and my friends are not that good in studies so whenever i ask a random classmate to send me some notes he doesn't respond because he sees that my friends are not good so the person thinks i'm not good too.

then my mom told me to make new friends because ur friends are not good at studies and because of them no one talks to u. 

I said i dont want new friends and thats my "opinion"

My mom then said in a mocking way "wow, ur just 13 and starting to have a opinion against ur parents, that's disrespectful"

What? So it means that having a opinion in my house is disrespectful and you should be an adult before having one, because if i have one that means im disrespecting my parents?

Why is my family the way it is? 

They are also against the LGBTQ+ community and also Meat eaters and are forcing their opinion on me and i said that everyone has their opinion but no "opinions" are available only when u are an adult.

Why?
