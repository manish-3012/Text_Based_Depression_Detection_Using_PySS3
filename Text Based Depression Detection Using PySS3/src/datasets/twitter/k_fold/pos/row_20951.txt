How do I get a boyfriend? (13f) Yeah ik Iâ€™m kinda young but I need advice. Iâ€™m so lonely and want a boyfriend. I just want to date a nice boy whoâ€™s sweet and cuddles me and all that, but Iâ€™m having a lot of trouble. Yes, I do talk to boys. I got to know one really well a little while ago but when I asked him out he kindly rejected me. Does anyone have any advice on talking to boys / getting a bf?
