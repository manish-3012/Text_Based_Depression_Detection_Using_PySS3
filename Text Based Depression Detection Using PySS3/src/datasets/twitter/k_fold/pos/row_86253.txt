Am I the bad guy? Or don't I look good enough.... I do not know if it's my fault but I do have many friends, but tbh I don't have any friends. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, basically all of them are fake.

The only reason they keep in touch with me is only for getting their work done... be it assignments, learning and so on, considering studying and coding are the only few things I'm kinda good at and passionate about. But when the time comes for enjoyment and partying, they exclude me and don't even bother to invite me and pretend I'm non-existent.

I do not like being rude towards others and whenever they ask me for help I go out of my way to fix their issue knowing that they are using me and this makes me sick, but once done *poof* they vanish and go to their respective friends groups. 

I'm not sure why though, I know that when compared to them, they live a fancy life, look good and have money... whereas me I'm just an introverted teen who likes to spend time coding and do not have much money nor look as good as them. I would love to have friends who honestly treats me as a friend and not a WikiHow page, but I'm not sure what to change in order to become "cool".

 I do not want to fake my personality so I'm not exactly sure. I try my best to improve, by working out and meditating. It would be great to talk to people who have undergone the same experience as me!
