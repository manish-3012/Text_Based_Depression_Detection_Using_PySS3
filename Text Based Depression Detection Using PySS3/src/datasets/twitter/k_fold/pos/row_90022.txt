my dad finally found out i have insomnia and told me to quit lying. how and why the fuck should i lie about this?? Why is it so hard for both of you to just fucking accept that mental health is a thing??

im not lying, im literally having troubles to fall asleep and sleep like 12 hours a week. Fuck you, really.
