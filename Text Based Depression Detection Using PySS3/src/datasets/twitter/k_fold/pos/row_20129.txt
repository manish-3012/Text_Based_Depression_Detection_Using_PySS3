My friend application 16 M - Hi I'm Aadi , I live in South Asia and I don't play games (I used to , but currently I don't) , I'm into lofi music and most of the time I leaf through my books. You can say that I'm kind of a nerd , I topped my school last year in G-10 and that's my only flex . 

I'm currently in high school and people say that I'm boring and I admit that I'm a wallflower . I hate xenophobic people so don't come to me if you are . 

Games I have played - minecraft , gta , pubg , csgo .

I was working on game dev few months back but I don't get time so I will focus on that once I clear high school , although I know the basics now (physics, movements ) 

I kinda feel this post is cringy, or maybe I'm not confident enough . Anyways Im not sure if anyone gonna HMU but it's upto you all .
