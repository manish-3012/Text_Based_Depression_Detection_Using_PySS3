I wish my mouth smelled like BVLGARI perfume! 17 M, I had recently gone for a wedding and had put on my Bvlgari perfume. Since I entered the place, every girl and woman I know of and the ones I'm unaware of; Came to me, talked to me and their eyes were rolling. It seemed as if they wanted to come close and sniff the smell of my skin. My cousins and their relatives, my aunts went crazy for it. I felt really special! 

Now I wish my mouth smells the same and girls wanna relish the flavor of it!
