Donâ€™t know if this is the right sub for this but here we go... Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for about two years, we are good friends, and I kinda formed a crush on her, only some of my closet friends knew (other than her) and we all would hang out together. Eventually the news spread and she knew I had a crush on someone and begged me to tell her, she said â€œyou can trust me, Iâ€™m a girl maybe I can set you upâ€, things like that went on for about 5 months and I decided I was going to ask her out to the christmas dance, but I kept getting cold feet, and then two weeks before the dance one of my friends told her about my crush on her, and I couldnâ€™t deny the facts, she already knew the truth, it was kinda awkward for the rest of the day, she kinda didnâ€™t talk to me and would avoid me , at the end of the day my friend that told her about my crush was talking with some of her friends ( we are all kinda close) and apparently she liked me back, but was afraid that if we got together and broke up we wouldnâ€™t be friends anymore, I thought that was respectable, but I still havenâ€™t tried asking her out so the Monday before the dance I did it, â€œWould you like to go to the dance with meâ€. She just walked away and didnâ€™t even show up to the dance saying â€œ she dosenâ€™t like crowdsâ€, I have been depressed even before this, but after she ghosted me, it was an all time low it was like we werenâ€™t even friends anymore, well I had to deal with that for all of Christmas break and when we got back to school it was kinda no different, every time I would try to rekindle the friendship we used to have and confront her, she would say, you are my friend and always will be, but still didnâ€™t really show it, and then one of her friends spilled the beans, turns out she liked one of my other friends more, and one detail I havenâ€™t added was he liked her as well, I was heart broken, I stopped talking to people I stayed inside listening to music and playing video games 24//7 instead of studying for school, I started to feel like I was being resented and hated by my friends and I even thought that she never thought of me as a friend anyway, but my friend ( the one that told her I liked her, not the one that likes her), started comforting me and I got on my feet again, I asked her ( Iâ€™m tired of writing her/she, so letâ€™s call her piper), so I asked piper If she liked him, she said yes, I asked my friend ( the one that likes her, lets call him Dan) I asked Dan if he liked her and he said yes, I was so sad but I was like screw It lets get these people together, so I pep talked piper, because originally she was scared of what to say, and I helped Dan ask her out by giving him advice since I know her better than dan, well they did it, started dating ( even to current time), dan was a jerk to me after that since I kinda still liked her, I almost got kicked out of the friend group because â€œstill liking her is wrongâ€ , he almost got kicked because â€œ you donâ€™t take a friends crushâ€, well it all finally settled when I got bored of this shit and started looking for a new girl to like, Dan and I are neutral , piper is still dating him, and Iâ€™m alone and kinda donâ€™t care, piper and I ended up talking it out and we are ok friends now, Even though I still like her, just by the way she talks, and acts, but nobody will ever know that except the possible billions of people on the internet.

Sorry for probably the overlong story, and the weird end to things, I thought I was at rock bottom so, I thought the least I could do was help Dan out a bit.

Thank you for reading this, I needed to get this off my chest, even if its just a bunch of internet strangers

Finally, sorry for the poor grammar, this was all on phone.
