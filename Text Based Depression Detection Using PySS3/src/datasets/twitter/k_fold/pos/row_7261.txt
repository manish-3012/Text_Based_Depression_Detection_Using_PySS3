The true side of the furry fandom I have noticed a massive amount of hate for us, but I have decided to spread the truth on this subreddit. Where do I start, I know, art. On the r/furry subreddit there are many people showing off art, and giving tips on how to improve on parts they struggle on, even commissioning art for a small price. On the comment sections on the furry videos I watch have all been civil and friendly, they talk, give virtual hugs, even giving support to smaller channels. Yes there are bad parts, but that is a tiny part of the fandom. No matter what you are, except pedos and the crappy people, we hate them, we accept everyone. Furry conventions are a place to meet new friends, talk about anything, and if you want to give a hug irl, ask first, they are still human too. You don't need a fursuit to be a part of it, a small percentage of the fandom actually have fursuits. I hope this explains everything about the fandom and you all to understand, this will hopefully change some people's minds about the fandom. I have been a furry for around 2 months, and it is the best thing I have ever joined
