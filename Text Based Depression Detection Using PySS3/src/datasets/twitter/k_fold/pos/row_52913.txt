Kind of scared of overworking myself in college Iâ€™ll be going to college in a few years (ignore age discrepancy). Iâ€™m kind of scared that Iâ€™ll be revising day in and out and not have any time for fun. On the opposite end, Iâ€™m scared of having too much fun and not getting any work done. Between the two, Iâ€™ll automatically pick the former. Anyone know how to judge/ maintain a good school/life balance?
