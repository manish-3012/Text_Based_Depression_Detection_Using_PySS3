You donâ€™t sound black... I get told that a lot because of the way I talk. Iâ€™m black and I donâ€™t use slang often when talking to new people(you donâ€™t know who u will meet good or bad) so I always talk with my words pronounced. Sometimes black, white, Hispanic, who ever tell me, your dark but you donâ€™t sound black...how should black people soundðŸ˜’(the media fucked me up)
