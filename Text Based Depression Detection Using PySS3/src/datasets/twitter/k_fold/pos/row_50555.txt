how the heck are you supposed to meet girls right now? Iâ€™m in high school. I spent the last few months of quarantine really improving myself and building my confidence and social skills. But I feel like right now itâ€™s just impossible to meet any girls or even just be friendly with them. Like when we are in school everybody just kinda does there own thing and only like close friends will ever talk to each other, but even that is discouraged. So I feel like unless iâ€™m just literally forced into a situation like a group project or something I canâ€™t really just get myself out there and meet girls.

Also, I have snapchat and instagram, but i feel like thatâ€™s not even good either. I legitimately do not understand the concept of how people just slide into someoneâ€™s dmâ€™s. I feel like if you donâ€™t already even know the girl from real life and stuff, it would just be extremely awkward on both sides if just dm her â€œheyâ€ or something. I feel like you need to already have some sort of connection with her before you can do that. But I was always known as the quiet kid so I literally know 0 girls and as I said itâ€™s like impossible to meet any. 

It would be nice, but I guess I donâ€™t really care if i donâ€™t get a gf this school year or during high school. But like i just want to meet girls and get to know them and stuff, but I literally donâ€™t know how to right now.

I donâ€™t know if iâ€™m asking for advice or just ranting. It just really sucks :(
