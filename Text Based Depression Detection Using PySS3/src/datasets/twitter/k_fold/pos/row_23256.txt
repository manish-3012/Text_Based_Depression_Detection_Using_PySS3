Do ya'll have any small thing that makes you happy? Mine is my cup! I have these two cute lil mugs I keep in my bedroom, everyday when I wake up I either make a hot cup of tea or cup of coffee in my adorable little cup! Makes me feel put together and happy at the start of my day. 

My first cup is this sage green cup, with my initial on it thats drawn with flowers. 

and my second cup is a white dolly parton mug, it has flowers on the inside of it and on the outside it says "cup of ambition"

(I've been wanting to buy this one cup shaped like a mushroom to add to my happy little collection)
