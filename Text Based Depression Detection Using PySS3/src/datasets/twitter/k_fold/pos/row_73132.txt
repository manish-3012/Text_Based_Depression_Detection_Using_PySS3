U ever been on the verge of tears realizing you don't have a chance anymore with a girl you really liked but happy at the same time because you get to feel a strong emotion for the first time in months I have lol 

I wanna reckless shit to feel things u know

shit's bland nowadays, feel like it's harder for me to fit in to my crowd now than it is for my friends

idk
