I guess my friends are toxic . My friends are the only thing I got but they never take anything I say a bit seriously ... I opened up to them about my attempted sucide and also about my personal struggles but they made fun of it ... I was shattered and I stopped talking to them but then I realised I have no one ... I was alone so I texted them back ... They still don't care but I feel something is better than nothing ... I don't want to be alone , it is killing me , being alone is more scary ... I am clueless and ig I am a loser and I don't think I will ever be happy .
