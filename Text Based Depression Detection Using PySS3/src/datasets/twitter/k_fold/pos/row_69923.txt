Is it normal/anyone else not into regular porn. This will sound kinda pervy/creepy but...

 First of all, i have a bondage fetish. Like, i really get turned on with tied up women. Some groping or vibrators are cool too, i like it when they moan, struggle (guess I'm kinda a sadist too). But when the guy actually puts his dick in and has actual sex, I get totally turned off. And I've never gotten hard watching normal porn before, only read wholesome hentais to feel good.

Again, sorry if this was creepy, is this normal/anyone like this?
