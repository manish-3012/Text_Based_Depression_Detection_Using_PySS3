Give me an idea I have an mc server, and was thinking of doing a podcast on twitch with the server to try and raise money for us to get a better one, as the one we use is bad and free. Itâ€™s not bad, as it the site is ass, but more of it canâ€™t handle us being online a lot. So I decided to put a special event. Itâ€™s call the Wishful Tunes. They are renamed music discs, with a special language so I cannot have forged ones. It grants the user a special â€œWishâ€ once all are collected. I have six ideas that are more item and structure base and wanted to ask reddit for some more ideas! No overpowered gear tho...
