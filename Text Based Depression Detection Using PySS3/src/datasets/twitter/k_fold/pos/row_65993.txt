My best friend dog is dying. I have had my dog since i was about 5 and im 14 now and we've have had so much fun together went on so much adventures through the back fields and i really dont want to have the feeling of being sad as its such a bad feeling crying endlessly feeling depressed so really want to not feel that way and try and stop ny feeling from being felt.
Because i love him so much and would be destroyed i dunno why i typed this i guess i had to get it all out.
And dont point out my grammer and english i really dont care.
