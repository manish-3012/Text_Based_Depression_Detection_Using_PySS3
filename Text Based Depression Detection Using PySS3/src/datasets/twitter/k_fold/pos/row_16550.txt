Sorry, but I need to vent I've been having a lot of trouble keeping up with school. I have really bad short term memory so I quickly forget about himework or simple assignments. Even when I remember assignments, I have troubke finding the motivation to do it or even turn it in. Not because I think its bad, but because I can't even find motivation to take out my phone and take a picture. My grades are starting to fall and I've been hella stressed. I can't bring this up with my dad because he'll just ground me until I fix them, which I know won't help. I really want to get on top of things, but I can't get everything together
