I don't know what to do at this point...(vent) I feel like I wanna scream but I feel like that's not gonna do anything. I have WAY to much shit pent up to just let it out at once. I feel like killing myself would be a solution but it's not, that'll just be dying a bitter death, I'll just take my shit with me to the grave. Telling people won't help, hurting myself won't help, unleashing it on others will certainly not help, I'm at a lost right now. I want to cry but I don't like crying everytime and I feel like it won't help at this point. I feel this knot in my throat, something heavy pressing against my chest and I don't know how to get rid of it and I wanna do it on my own, I have always needed help with everything, I wasn't able to do something on my own without fucking up and I don't wanna bother people with my shitty teenager problems cuz what's the point on working on something of it's gonna go away at some point, because it *will* go away at some point I guess, I hope. I feel like I'm close to filling up the glass and when it overflows somebody will probably get hurt and I don't wanna do that but I don't know how to avoid it either.

I also feel like it's wrong for me to feel like this, like I don't have a reason to be sad and should just stop bitching about every little thing, and that just makes it worse. I feel more like nothing important rather than less sad. I feel like I'm simply pathetic in everything, school, personal life, social life. There's just a lot of secrets I always kept to myself and I feel like telling them would make everyone laugh and move away from me and I hate the thought of being alone, I already feel alone and knowing this would make that feeling a reality is painful.


Thanks for reading this shit, of you choose to say this is "fake depression" idgaf at this point, I just don't want to live with this shit in my head and wanna just feel, even for just a second, that doing this will help

Sorry if I misspelled smn
