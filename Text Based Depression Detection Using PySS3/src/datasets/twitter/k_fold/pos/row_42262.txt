question for other homeschool kids what do you guys do to socialize ?
like where do you even go for that
iâ€™ve tried looking up like homeschool and youth groups stuff in my area but i have no idea what to look up to get results

just looking for general advice on what other homeschool kids do and what to look up online to find similar groups in my area
