Thanks for everything So about a hour ago I posted sort of a suicide note telling everyone that I couldn't live with my depression and I was going to kill myself and I got a lot of comments telling me not to and links to the suicide line and I was about to end it but then I well couldn't and I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you have sent and your help with my selfish decision but I spoke to my mum and we are trying to figure something out on what to do
