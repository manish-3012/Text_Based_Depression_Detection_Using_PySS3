Is it a bad sign to always be texting someone first? I have a friend that I met through social media (they live halfway across the country) and Iâ€™ve noticed that most of the time when we text itâ€™s me texting them first. Iâ€™m not sure whether this is a negative thing or not, mostly because they donâ€™t seem annoyed when I text them and they never push me away/say things like â€œgotta goâ€ or â€œiâ€™ll talk to you later,â€ and they have texted first before.

Is this a bad sign that Iâ€™m always texting first?
