My mom is not willing to let my school give me the HPV vaccine, she says the vaccine dangerous, and not getting vaccinated will prevent me from sleeping around. Is there any way for me to get vaccinated without her permission? Title says it all, do I have any recourse?
I live in California, if that's relevant.
