My terrible luck. I know this may seem kinda cringe but please hear me out. Like the title says, I have terrible luck and it tends to hurt me in more ways that one more often than you would think. Any luck based game, always getting the worst possible outcome if its be rng or dice. The one I love ends up loving me in more a brotherly way and a lot more. My family, practically hates me. But I'm not here to talk about my life story. The point is, I honestly don't know what to do about it. I've tried good luck charms, being more cautious, trying to get better karma (not religious or reddit karma), and I still get hurt psychologically, physically, or emotionally. Got tips for one of your kind? Also sorry for the long post.
