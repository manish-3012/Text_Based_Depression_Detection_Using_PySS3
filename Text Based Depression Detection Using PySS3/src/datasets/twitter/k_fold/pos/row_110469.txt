Your boy won! I have the absolute best girlfriend possible. She cares for me, gives me hope, lifts me and loves me to pieces. Chelsie, you are the love of my life and my partner in crime, sorrow, joy, pain and pleasure. Iâ€™m so lucky to have you in my life. Youâ€™ve indeed become a part of me.

It honestly feels like weâ€™ve known each other forever and our love spans millennia, you make me feel warm on the inside, youâ€™re the warmth to my cold winter morning. 

I canâ€™t wait to just swim through the sea of life with you babe. Iâ€™m glad to call you mine. Youâ€™re the last piece of my puzzle. Youâ€™re my little aunt Cass lmao. 

Love you sweetheart, may the lord bless you.
