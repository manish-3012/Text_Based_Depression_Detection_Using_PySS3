I'm so tired of this My mom takes pictures constantly, atleast 4 times a day of me. Well I hate my picture getting taken, and she sends every single pic to everyone. Even distant family. Well for Easter she promised me she would not send these Easter pics to ANYONE, she just wants them in her phone. I almost cried seeing how I looked but, they weren't being sent. Later I saw she sent them to EVERYONE. I love my mom but she lied to me, and we don't do that to eachother. I literally tell her everything because she is like my best friend, so I even rat myself out to her. Lying is a big thing in our family. She disrespected my privacy. I'm almost an adult, I think I'm old enough to have a say in having my picture sent to people. She has no respect for me. Maybe I should start acting only like her teenager, and no longer a friend. If she can't respect my 1 wish, why should I respect her. Idc anymore. Sorry I just feel betrayed. She always lies to me about this.
