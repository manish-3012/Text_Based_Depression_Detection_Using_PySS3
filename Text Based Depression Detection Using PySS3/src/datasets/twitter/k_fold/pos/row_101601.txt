Some please help me ðŸ˜” So to start things off. Hi Iâ€™m Aidan and Iâ€™m 16, I have a girlfriend of 6 months. We met for the first time about a year ago. She lives in the Middle East. I know people say that online dating doesnâ€™t work, but her and I genuinely believe that we belong together. The first time we talked her parents found out and she got in a boatload of trouble. I recently contacted her because I couldnâ€™t live without her. Since that day in March everything has been going smoothly until today. We were playing Among Us just laughing it up in a FaceTime call. Then her sister came in the room and caught us. She said that her and I wonâ€™t be able to talk for the next week just to be safe so we donâ€™t get split up again like last time. Iâ€™m worried that I wonâ€™t be able to talk to her again. The amount of fear that I felt when she said the words â€œwe got caughtâ€ is unexplainable. I need some advice on what to do to not be so paranoid and scared. If someone could please help me I would be very grateful.
