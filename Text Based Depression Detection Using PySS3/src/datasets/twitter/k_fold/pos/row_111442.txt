An update to an update of one of my past posts Previous Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/f6ikr0/an_update_to_one_of_my_past_posts/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

So yeah. Yesterday, I was thinking to myself what would happen if my older brother or uncle never lived with us. Well for starters, we would be in a different house than the current one we're living in. But that's not the point. 

Today, my stupid ass brother decided to try to run from the police. This could've been easily avoided if he cooperated with the police. But oh fucking well, He's going to inevitably get arrested for 5 years. Damn.
