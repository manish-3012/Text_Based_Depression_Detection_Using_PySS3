Being Gay sucks â€œno pun intendedâ€ Iâ€™m a sophomore now and I go to a school in nebraska thatâ€™s fairly small and full of bigoted people, and even though Iâ€™m out as gay Iâ€™m scared to dress the way Iâ€™d like or act the way Iâ€™d like because people here are very judgmental, and because of where I live and the circumstances I also feel very lonely, and like Iâ€™m not going to find a boyfriend who I can share intimacy with. Since Iâ€™ve moved out here I havenâ€™t had that feeling and Iâ€™m really close to just ending it. I miss my boyfriend but I had to leave him due to moving and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve never been this depressed and Iâ€™m so close to just ending it so I need to make it clear that I love you allâ¤ï¸
