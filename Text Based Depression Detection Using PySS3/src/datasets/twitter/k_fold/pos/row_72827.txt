I wanted to talk about this but I didnâ€™t know what to talk to so Iâ€™m ranting on Reddit Throughout my life I havenâ€™t had a lot of friends. Initially it never really bothered me but as time went by I felt really lonely. I tried making a few friends but things didnâ€™t work out. I had no one to talk to so I just kept all my issues to my self. I kept all those emotions buried it. I feel like as time went by and all those emotions pent up, they manifested into toxicity. Thatâ€™s why I have this insatiable need for attention and the need to feel loved. Cause I didnâ€™t have any in the first place.this has led me to do some stupid/outrageous stuff (which I really regret).I feel like if I had an out, that one friend who stuck by me, things would be a lot different. Of course I donâ€™t blame anyone for this, I take full responsibility of my actions but I just feel like if I had that one constant who was there for me Iâ€™d not have become this person I am rn.
