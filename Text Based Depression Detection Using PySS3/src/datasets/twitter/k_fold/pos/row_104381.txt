Um..Dr Squatch? I think we all know what citric acid is I got an ad for this shampoo

Guy pours green grey shampoo/liquid on his hand

subtitles go 

"citric acid"

"cocamidopropyl"

"What the hell is that?"

Have never heard of cocamidopropyl before, but doesn't everyone know what citric acid is???

I googled cocamidopropyl, looks like it comes from coconuts...

Not sure why Adsense thinks im a guy, but ok. 

I also got a sperm donation ad once...
