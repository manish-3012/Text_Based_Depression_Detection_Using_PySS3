I did it!!! So basically, I took Reddit's advice and asked out the guy who was making very obvious hints that he liked me. I just went ahead and asked over text, and he just said "k". Lol I honestly am relieved since I expected it to he more awkward. So I am going on my very first date ever on Sunday at a pizzeria. Wish me luck!
