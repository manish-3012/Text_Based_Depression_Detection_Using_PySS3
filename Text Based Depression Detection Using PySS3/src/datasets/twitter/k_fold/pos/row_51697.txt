i pulled a prank on my sister and i don't know where to post it, so here goes!  So i was walking past her room when i heard her talking in conference call with her friends so i knocked the door pretty loudly and said "you told you were taking a shit an hour ago? everything alright in there?"

she slammed the door on my face, worth it.
