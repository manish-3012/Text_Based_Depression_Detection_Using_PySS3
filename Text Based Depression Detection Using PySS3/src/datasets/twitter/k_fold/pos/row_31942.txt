Being in a religion but wanting to quit Well, my family is extremely religious. They are Christian. I am in-between being an atheist an Christian. My family would probably disown me if I confess it. What do I do? I've stated that I don't like church due covid but... I don't know. I need mental help, but when I ask for help my parents just push it away like its nothing. What do I do?
