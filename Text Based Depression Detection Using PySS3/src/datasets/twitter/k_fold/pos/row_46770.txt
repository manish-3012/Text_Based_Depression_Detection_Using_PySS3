My confusing experience with bullying in 4th grade So this was a super weird scenario that I doubt anyone who will see this can relate to

So in 4th grade, I was pretty up there on the popularity list (This was before I got Reddit, dooming me to the middle of the food chain, being friend with people who are friends with the most popular kids) and I had a ton of friends, then when on of the people in our friend group left the school and moved. All of a sudden I was bullied by everyone else for maybe a week, then it all went back to normal and they were my best friends again. I was super confused at the time and shrugged it off. But now Iâ€™m looking back like â€œwhat in the world happenedâ€. 

TL;DR : I was popular, friend moved schools, got bullied for a week, then everything went back to normal, weird. 

There was also another situation where a kid had to move schools cause he and some other people were planning to bring nerf guns to school and â€œshoot upâ€ a kid. But thatâ€™s another story for another time. Tell me if you want to hear it and Iâ€™ll edit this post.
