I made this post before but I'm posting it again. I get this urge to stab myself in the head with a knife every time I pass by one I don't want to die but EVERY time I pass by a knife I get he urge. Nobody knows this except the people reading this post. How can I stop doing this? I have a few other things that I do but not as deadly as this urge. I always want to stab it in a certain place and when I walk away I yank my hair where the place is.
