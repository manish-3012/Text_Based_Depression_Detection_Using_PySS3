I need help dealing with Discord drama (Pls ignore grammar Iâ€™m on mobile and if anyone is confused on a part Iâ€™ll try to explain it better)Me and my friends have a discord server and we talk a lot in it itâ€™s an all guys server however girls can join but no one has yet. Recently the owner made friends with a few people and invited us to there server. There server ended being just like ours except itâ€™s all girls. A few days ago my best friend (Iâ€™m gonna call him Tim fro privacy) got banned from the guy server. The only reason we could find was a dm that owner sent one of the girls that said Tim was a different person around girls then the guys and and a new rule added saying that simping is not allowed. No one could really find a reason because Tim acted normal around me and normal around the girls. So earlier today the owner and admin (the one who added the rule) invited me to a call and he explained everything. They said that Tim has been being very rude to them saying they should be banned from the girl server and a lot of other things. So the mods voted on wether they should ban them or not and they decided on yes they should. After that they said I could not tell anyone about said conversation but at the same time idk if they are lying or theyâ€™re telling the truth so I need some help because idk what I should do
