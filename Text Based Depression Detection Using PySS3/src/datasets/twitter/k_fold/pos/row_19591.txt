How can I avoid burning out? Iâ€™ve been working HARD during online school. I have perfect grades and am doing really good considering I just started high school in online classes. I do school work for 8-10 hours a day just to keep on top of my stuff. Iâ€™m already losing a lot of motivation and am feeling mildly depressed. While I donâ€™t have lower than a 99% in any class, I donâ€™t think I can keep living up to that standard without taking a huge blow to my mental health. I have holiday break soon and hopefully this gives me enough time to de-stress but if it doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m going to need to figure something out. Any suggestions or is it just something I have to get through? What are your experiences like?
