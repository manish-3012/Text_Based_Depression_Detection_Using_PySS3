So basically Iâ€™m quite sad right now and would appreciate some advice on how to cope. So basically I have a mom and dad, they were divorced but stayed friends when I was 3 but continued living with each other, my whole life until now they would get into some arguments which would scare me but overall, they were pretty nice and I even heard my mom say they would get remarried! But unfortunately today, my dad was caught cheating on the phone with another girl with a son too. A whole year itâ€™s been going on actually. My mom was obviously mad and planning to move out in October before this came up so now she said â€œIâ€™m still moving out in October so by then, you find a place for yourself,youâ€™re not coming with meâ€ worst part is this is 2 days before my birthday is coming up.  Can someone give me advice on how to cope maybe?
