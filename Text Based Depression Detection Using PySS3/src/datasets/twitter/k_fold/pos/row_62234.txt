Has anyone else just been feeling really tired lately? I'm a 15 year old sophomore, and recently I've noticed that I'm feeling completely different to any time before now. I used to get straight A's, I didn't absolutely dread every coming morning, but ever since September I've had no motivation to do anything whatsoever. I used to draw, now whenever I try I call myself a talentless p.o.s. and don't pick up my sketchbook for a while. My grades have dropped dramatically, I've started caring less and less, the future I imagined as an 8 year old getting dimmer by the minute. I physically can't pay attention in class anymore, no matter what I do I can't get myself to slough through anything. When I was feeling suicidal 3 years back due to complications I won't get into my friends told me to make a list of reasons to live and to look forward to those, and said list is getting thinner and thinner. Any moment of bliss is crushed by an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, the world isn't going to get better, I cant bring myself to look at the overdue work, I've hit the zenith of my abilities and there's no way ill be able to survive as an adult. Every battle feels like its already been lost, every assignment has become completely incoherent as work has gotten exponentially more difficult. Sorry for the long read but I really needed to rant.

TL,DR: Has anyone else felt a general lack of will or motivation to live recently? Because I've been feeling like absolute sh*t recently and never before have I wanted to just disappear more.
