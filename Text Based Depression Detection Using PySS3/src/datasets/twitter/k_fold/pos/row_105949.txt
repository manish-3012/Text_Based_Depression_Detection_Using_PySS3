My opinion on masks I just donâ€™t see the point, like, why? They donâ€™t do anything for me, theyâ€™re uncomfortable and embarrassing, and itâ€™s already hard enough having to deal with people making fun of my looks already, like, I understand that I am a lego T-Rex missing itâ€™s lower jaw, but come on. Do people really have to be so rude about it?
