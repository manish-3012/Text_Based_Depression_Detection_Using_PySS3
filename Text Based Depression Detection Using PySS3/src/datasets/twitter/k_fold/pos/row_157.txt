I feel really insignificant in peoples lives I know people are worried about themselves the most but I just wanna be someoneâ€™s favorite. I just wanna know what thatâ€™s like. I donâ€™t think anyone really hates me (that happened to me before but I think weâ€™re good now.) Iâ€™m just this random person that no one thinks twice about. I donâ€™t even feel like a real person that can actually affect people. I feel like I donâ€™t even have that kind of power. People donâ€™t take me seriously and I barely talk to the people I thought were my friends. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a me problem or a them problem. I donâ€™t wanna get in to that though. In my closet friendships Iâ€™ve ever had Iâ€™m never the favorite or thereâ€™s always someone better than me that theyâ€™d rather hang out with. I just wish someone would actually acknowledge my existence, I hate this
