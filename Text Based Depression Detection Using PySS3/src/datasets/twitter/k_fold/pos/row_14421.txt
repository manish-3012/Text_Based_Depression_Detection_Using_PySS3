What should I do? So a little back story... 
In august of this year I lost my job due to covid but I graduated secondary school at the same time so I decided to take a year off to gather money and get in shape before going to college and it was working for a while. 
About a week after I lost my job I got lucky and found a full time job that I have been working at since then and it was fine at first sure I had the stress that came with getting a new job but other than that it was fine until I meet my boss. 

So at first I noticed that he was impulsive and extremely impatient but he didn't do anything but the first time I did a little mistake (forgot to patch one bag of soil)  he lashed out at me and has been treating me as if I am less than the dirt. 

Obviously that started to take a toll on me at first I took it personally but other employees tell me that he dislike this with everyone so my fear and sadness turned into anger but I've been told that itonly gets worse if you confront him so I've let it sitfor a while. 
But now I can't spend a living moment without being angry at that s. o. b and honestly I'm starting to breakdown more and more everyday. 

I'm really thinking about quitting I mean I'm starting to lose all motivation and drive and I can't even relieve stress by masturbating anymore because I'm just constantly pissed off,  I think that quitting  would be good for me but then again this place closes in November and I can use the money so idk what should I do any and all advice is appreciated. 

And thank you if you've read this far
