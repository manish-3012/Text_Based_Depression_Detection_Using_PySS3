Fuck sake Just because me or someone else doesnâ€™t like you and you happen to be a different race, have a different religion, have a different sexuality, are a different gender etc etc doesnâ€™t mean I am racist, sexist, homophobic etc I just donâ€™t like you, which is pretty rare might I add because it takes a lot for me to genuinely dislike you
