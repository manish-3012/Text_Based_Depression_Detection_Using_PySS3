Friend disappeared a while back, since both her accounts were deleted. Would like some help finding her again. TLDR AT BOTTOM.
So, recently I saw a post on here about a guy who wanted to contact his old Discord pal. I also have a similar experience and after his post worked, I simply *hope* that mine could too. Her name on Discord was Gloomy Lunar#5052, we met  2 years ago, I know, stupid of me to only do this now but the post reminded me of this. We talked for like 2-3 months, each day and we got along really well until I suddenly couldn't text her anything anymore. Aside from that, I also know she lost her password, don't know if it's relevant. We met on ROBLOX (I know, stupid, but it was a simple fun game, we met there and kept in touch), the name of her account was Soulessbodyx, but for some reason it was deleted. Now, I know I asked this question too late, but yeah, it reminded me of this. Alliea, I don't even know if you remember me, but it's worth a try. It's Xander, we used to play Magic Training on ROBLOX.



TLDR: I met a girl on ROBLOX, we used to play Magic Training together. Her account is deleted. Her Discord account, under the name of Gloomy Lunar#5052 was suddenly uncontactable at the same time. Alliea, it's Xander, I don't even know if you remember me lol, but hey, I can try.
