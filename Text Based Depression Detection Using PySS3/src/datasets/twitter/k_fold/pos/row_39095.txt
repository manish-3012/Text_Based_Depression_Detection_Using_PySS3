Can anybody here try to explain Snell's law of refraction to me? 11th grade Astronomy Or point me to a sub that might have some people who know how to?

I'm really struggling it tbh, I have the equation, but I have no idea what "n" actually is, or how to apply the equations to figuring out any properties of the medium the light is going through. I've tried looking it up on my own but it's just so confusing
