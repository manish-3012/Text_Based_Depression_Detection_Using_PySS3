I just got my first real gf I've never really dated before so I kinda just stumbled into this relationship, but my gf is so nice and is just amazing and I need to talk about her somewhere. She lives out side of my school and is a little older than me by like 3 months. I've spent a bunch of time at her house and her parents and siblings are cool and just let me chill. Just last week I've started having dinner with them and it's become a pretty regular thing. Thanks for listening no my rant also sorry on mobile so bad format.
