Who else has to pay rent at 17?! Yup you saw that correctly... I was told by my parents that I have to pay $250 a month for rent?!! Thatâ€™s like 50% of my pay check BEFORE taxes. Please just shoot me omg... 
Do anyone of you guys have to pay rent too, if so how much? It feels like Iâ€™m the only one with strict parents. Sigh. ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜•
