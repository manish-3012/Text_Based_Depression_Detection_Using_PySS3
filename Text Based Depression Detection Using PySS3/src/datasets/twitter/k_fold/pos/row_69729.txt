Im gonna ask out this girl tomorrow I'm not too invested in it, only known her for a few weeks and I only have 7th period with her but I have a feeling she might say yes. I saw her get a weird 1 arm hug from some short guy who wears the same thing everyday one time, and she seems to have a complicated relationship with him. 

She's gonna fw me though. You know why? Because I'm the shit. I don't care how I feel tomorrow, don't care how tired I am or how nervous I get, I'm asking this girl out in person because there's nowhere else this relationship can go right now. She's cute and I wanna get physical. Fuck that wack ass brokeboy creepin on her.
