Also, teen r*te me subs make me vastly uncomfortable The thing is, beauty is subjective, and people get r*ted based on what other people like, and trying to please random internet strangers seems sad imo. Like I completely understand where people who post on those are coming from, but I feel like it's better if you try to please yourself with how you look compared to with others. The more confident you are in yourself, the more other people will like you anyway. 

And there's nothing wrong with not being super skinny. People fat shame addison rae and she's literally normal-sized. 

And don't listen to those "body positivity won't unclog your arteries" assholes. Part of body positivity is being healthy in the body that you're in. You can be healthy and overweight.
