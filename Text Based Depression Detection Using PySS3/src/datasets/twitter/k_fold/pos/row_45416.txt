I hate acne Both of my cheeks have acne and so does some of my forehead. Itâ€™s typically always been my cheeks but since Iâ€™ve been under an overwhelming amount of stress lately itâ€™s affected my forehead as well. 

My face hasnâ€™t been clear in over a year now. Some days look better than others. It also depends on how much water I drink which helps and taking a shower makes it look smoother. 

Iâ€™m 18 almost 19 now and have been struggling with acne since I was 13. No one else has acne my age. People who donâ€™t struggle with acne are so lucky.
