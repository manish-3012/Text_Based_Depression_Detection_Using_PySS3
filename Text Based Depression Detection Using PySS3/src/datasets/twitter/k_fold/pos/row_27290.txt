My dog was killed last night After almost an entire decade of trying, our parents finally let us keep a puppy. We got him as a birthday gift last month from our neighbours so we decided to keep him. He was an English cocker spaniel, so small and so sweet. The first day he wouldnâ€™t eat and couldnâ€™t walk, we thought he had parvovirus and that he would die, but luckily it was just separation anxiety. Over the course of the 4 weeks we had him, he went from a silent teeny puppy to a lil doggo twice his size. He would eat well, run around a lot and generally was sweet and friendly. Last night my brother took him out to pee like always, and a 45kg+(100lb+) German Shepard must have mistook him for a rabbit. My brother tried to run and scoop up the puppy but the dog got to him first. My brother managed to wrestle the dog off him but it was too late. It was so shocking and tragic I donâ€™t know what to do but cry. I never thought that I would have to bury the puppy that constantly pissed on the floor yesterday. My brother was so brave for not even hesitating to take on that massive dog. I donâ€™t know what to do it hurts so much I canâ€™t stop crying I just want to talk to someone.
