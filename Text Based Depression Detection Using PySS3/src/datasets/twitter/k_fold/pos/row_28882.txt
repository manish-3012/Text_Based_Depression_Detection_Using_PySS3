When you come to realizations When I when I was in 4th grade I was bullied way to much not only that there's was nonstop violence from punching to being hit into hard surfaces it was just pure terror FOR FUCKS SAKE I KID BROUGHT A FUCKING BB GUN TO SCHOOL AND THERE WAS NO METAL DETECTORS NOTHING anyways this lead to permanent trauma I never forget what happened as it was everyday non stop and get panic attacks when fights are starting to form. But despite that I would still try to make friends later would I realize I did make friends but friends who were manipulators assholes or violent. So starting of with friend number one I won't mention his name to protect him but let's call him raisin (stupid name ik just move on) anyways he would always lie and inject fear into me if I didn't do what he wanted this would range from giving him snacks to giving him my toys or money my mom gave me I had no other but to comply he was no match for me now I'm a tall and can fight but before I was a wimp and small and didn't know his to fight he knew that and took advantage of it threatening me if I didn't comply because of this I lost a lot my belongings my mom worked super hard for and I had no other I was just being used and manipulated for his owm ego. Now moving on to "friend" number  2. Now he was way smaller but don't let his size fool you he was a backstabber, manipulator, and blackmailer and would ruin your reputation if you didn't do what you say which let's say losing your reputation in my old school wasnt very fun anyways he would always make me do douche moves on other kids for his own good  and even worse he was friends with raisin so they could instantly destrory me now for the others I met they did the same beat me up manipulated me and backstabbed and all that now people who were just straight up awful once I was running into recess when I accidentally bumped into the most powerful tankiest dude in the school he got mad grabbed me by the neck and throw me like snowball I got hurt really badly and vouched to never go near him again.Second the second friend backstabbed me into my secrets of my crush which at first is just ohhh you'll probably just get embarssed no if you had a crush on someone some kid was already with.. Surprise surprise you get beat welp kid told the girl the boy found got beat to again.... I was tiered of this and when it tired telling the teachers they didn't do jack shit I got to and pummeled one of my "friends" it worked for nothing and got slammed on the stairs and switching schools wasn't and option during all this I was living in a abusive relationship when I was 3 my mom and dad broke up after which my mom just popped up with a new boyfriend at first and thought oh what I nice guy he looks handsome he looked nice little did I know that was far from the truth he'd always come back drunk yell at my mom and me he would always do something for me in a bad manner and which forced us to escape Into two shelters and my mom couldn't do anything so I was forced into the school... So I don't want to write much more cause this already to long and it just hurts more to write this so here's the last thing that left traumatized crying in pain and tears one day a kid grabbed and dragged me to the bathroom threw me there got a sprayer and filled it with pee other kids were there to and after which they started spraying me with pee and kicking me like a soccer ball this lasted for two minutes and then they left I was crying and looking at my glasses saying "why....why....a...l...l I wanted was friends I just wanted to be....nice... I.... Didn't mean.... No harm" after which I realized I was being used all the "friends" I had weren't actually friends they were people who did so many horrible things to me they just used me they knew I was weak and a rookie this made me go really sad and angry and confused and tried to commit suicide for relive the pain I couldn't take it and then tried to recover I went to therapy after telling my mom and got a a bit better but to this day it still leaves my traumatized and this affected how I acted in middle school but now I forgiven them and moved on with my life I'll  still get PTSD from time to time but now I'm chill have actual friends and I'm doing ok in school.


Damm that was long now I'm not asking for sympathy or karma but this is a lesson  to be careful with you want to be friends with and don't be weak defend yourself always be strong if a someone insults you insult them back don't be scared. And learn to forgive no matter what somebody did to you. you must seek help and learn to forgive when you don't forgive you'll live with negative energy which can hold you back in life but although really hard you must forgive and move on knowing you've forgiving and can move on with life and no longer have to live with that negative feeling. 



And finally if any of you "friends" see this I hope what you did was wrong and will no longer do it again anyway have a great day or night. later
