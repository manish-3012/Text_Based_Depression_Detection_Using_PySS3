rex orange county he helps a lot, with the pain, idk why his music just resonates with me but i only know three songs 

nothing - i think itâ€™s so soothing and beautiful 

never enough - so nostalgic from fifa 18 and i LOVE the lyrics, they sum up mental health so well 

a song about being sad - very relatable and thought provoking 

can anyone suggest similar songs, preferably by the same artist but im open to any suggestions thank you
