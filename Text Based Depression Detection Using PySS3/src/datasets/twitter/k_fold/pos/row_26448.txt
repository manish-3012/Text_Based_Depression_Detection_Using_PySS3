I did an experiment on racism On a video of champchong titled: ps5 loading time test than he posted on 10 nov I told my story about going from syria to the Netherlands to see what people would think. I quickly got comments and most of them were very nice and some people even offered help but some people just started saying shit like I hope you get deported and your kind doesn't belong in Europe. So the results of my experiment are mostly positive there are still hateful comments and I don't know why. My comment wasn't political at all and I didn't offend anyone. This has to stop. Fuck racism. If any of you guys has a story about rascim feel free to tell it. Stay safe
