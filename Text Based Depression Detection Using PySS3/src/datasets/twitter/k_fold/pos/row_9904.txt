Any good advice would be appreciated!(getting over someone) Well hi guys!
I used to have a crush on my bestfriend and slowly started loving her but i never told her about it even though sometimes i felt she was interested too maybe
But then i felt that she wasnâ€™t into me much so well uhmm sad story for me
Well sheâ€™s still my friend but even now I randomly remember stuff which could have been well or bad stuff too but that stuff happened like in the last year so i really wanna get over this feeling
I know it is getting weaker but still it kinda hurts..
