I need to fucking vent. So, I really love using Twitter and my main parody account has been fucking cancelled and I lost almost all of my 700+ friends because some fucking leech of an account that won't fucking stop trying to be friends with me decided to go and say some really transphobic shit and call all my friends idiots, so I blocked him and I wanted to apologize to all of my friends on my main account but, my main account has been suspended for an entire week because Twitter didn't understand a post where I was mocking someone's flawed logic and I said "By that logic \[insert something offensive that no one believes\] Now one of my last bastions of social interaction during this pandemic has banned me because of a misunderstanding and I have lost all my friends on my other account. I know this sounds pathetic but, I am really sad because of this.
