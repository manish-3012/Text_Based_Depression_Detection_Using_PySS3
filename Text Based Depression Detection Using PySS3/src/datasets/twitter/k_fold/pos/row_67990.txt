Guidance Counselors are really under appreciated I know thereâ€™s this whole stigma against them, but they are legit really helpful. Iâ€™ve been having trouble registering for one of my online college classes, and my guidance counselor walked me through it until I figured it, and no lie, I fell like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Just thought Iâ€™d mention it here.
