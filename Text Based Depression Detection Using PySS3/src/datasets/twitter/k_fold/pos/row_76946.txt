Why did i use my real name as my reddit username like seriously. i see people having weird, unique, funny usernames and it's fun and shit but you go to read my username and it's just harsshvvardhan (my name is harshvardhan) oh yeah and im indian haha so goodfuckingluck trying to pronounce it or understand what it says. i wish i could make a new account, which i did, but see the thing is that i have a decent 100k karma here, and my account is just five months old, plus i have 30 followers lol(half of them are bots i swear, ig ppl won't follow bc of the weird ass username) so the second account is just useless at this point.

also, i am a clown bc i posted a screenshot of a reddit post on my instagram, and that had my username in it. so yeah, everyone at this point knows what my usename is on reddit. ik no one cares but what if someone does check what i am up to? i can't even post some text stuff bc then he/she might know. god.

anyways thank you for listening to me. i guess that's it for now.
