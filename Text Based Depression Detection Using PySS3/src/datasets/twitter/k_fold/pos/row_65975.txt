Does anybody else like online school more than in person school? Honestly, I don't want to go back. The only reason I would actually want to go back is because I'm just starting high school and I want to try to make new friends (all of my friends go to a different high school). If I want to get out of bed two minutes before school starts and do school in my pajamas I can, if I want to play online games with my friends at lunch I can. I don't have to worry so much about how I look, my facial expressions, etc... I also get work done faster because I do work during breaks more often. I can't explain exactly why I like online school better than in person school, but there's my general reasoning.

For those of you that share the same (or opposite) opinions, what are your reasons?
