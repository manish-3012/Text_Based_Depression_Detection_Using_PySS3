I feel like a failure and it breaks my heart every day I f(16)  feel like a failure and it hurt me 
In my country without college u can't do anything , am an artist i draw realistic portraits , i do animation, I design logos, and i design clothes . 

My only dream is to be a designer or a fashion designer 

The problem is my community doesn't appreciate art 
U either be a doctor or a lawyer other than that they consider u a failure 

I started talking with my family that i wanted to go to  the university of Jordan ( biggest and strongest university in my country) , in October so i can get a recommendation letter  so it can help if i wanted to study art outside , i try god knows how much i try to get out of my country to Europe to get a better life 

Yesterday after i talked to my parents I went to my room and then i heard my sister (36) ( how lives with us) talking to my parents trying to convince them that we should be realistic and that it's a miracle if I pass high school and that i have big imagination and that i should study something normal and stay in my country and that I will never get out, 

( am a childish person and i was act like i don't care about what people say about me because i want to keep my out going and positive personality but am actually really sensitive especially when it comes to family it hurts to see that nobody believes in me in any way I feel like I am fooling myself with all these dreams . 

I went out of my room to argue with my sister and then in med conversations she went to my room and started ripping my art 
More than 11 art work witch means about 44+ hours of work was destroyed in seconds 

I screamed at her , kicked her out of my room , and started crying like a little kid, i was heart broken, that she could something like this to me, that she can't respect my art, I treat my art as a piece of me and everyone in my family knows that. 

At this point i really feel like a failure i don't know what should I do , I feel stupid and worthless that there's no other career that i will be good at  , i know that am dramatic as hell right now but this makes me feel bad about myself every time I think of it. 


Sorry for my bad English , it's not my first language 
Have a good day guys &lt;3
