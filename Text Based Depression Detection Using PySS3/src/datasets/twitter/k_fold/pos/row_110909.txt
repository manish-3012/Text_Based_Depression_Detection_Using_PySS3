Anxiety when I get a haircut I hate getting a haircut cause every time I go I never know what to ask for and how to ask for it. Every one I've told about this always says to just ask for a basic trim but when I do they ask me what that means or something like that. It's fucking scary cause I'm put on the spot and I feel like I'm an idiot that doesn't know what he's doing and that I'm wasting everyone's  time. My dad would tell them to give me the same thing every month from kindergarten to 5th grade, I go to a new place and have longer hair now so I have no clue what to tell them. I also hate it when they try having a conversation with me. Honestly I'm probably over thinking things but its difficult when " just a basic trim " isn't enough
