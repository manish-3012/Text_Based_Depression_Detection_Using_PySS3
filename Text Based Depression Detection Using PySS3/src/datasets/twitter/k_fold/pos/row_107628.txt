idk if I have just the shittiest luck ever or just god hates me But I cant have shit apparently, like this is fucking ridiculous, i finally meet this girl and i think she's cute and i finally work up the courage to ask her out and the day i was gonna do it, a fucking virus started spreading (not covid, EEE, its a mosquito transmitted virus) and i couldn't see her so i couldn't ask her out and our relationship fell apart "fine" i said, "ill just find a new girl" i said, then I get rejected 5 MORE FUCKING TIMES until i finally get a gf, then guess what happens? COVID happens and i cant see her and she treats me like trash and our relationship falls apart and she breaks my heart. TWO FUCKING TIMES I TOOK AN L BECAUSE OF A VIRUS. "fine" i said for the second time "you clearly dont want me to have a successful relationship so ill learn Chinese, i think its really fun and i found a very nice teacher" i said, "Chinese is forever, it'll never go away" which is what i thought until my chinese teacher MOVES TO THE FUCKING UK (disclaimer: im not mad at my Chinese teacher, im glad she moved outta china) but this is fucking ridiculous \*deep sigh\* this is why i cant have nice things, because of your sick joke. I hope you're having a real laugh right now because when i die, im coming up there and beating the fuck out of whoever is controlling the shit going on rn. words cannot describe how fucking mad I am, but a YouTube link can[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2Y8vqZr-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF2Y8vqZr-Q)
