Sooo... Ive kinda been away from reddit for awhile... You may remember me as the guy who posted on reddit everyday until he got a girlfriend, but never got one. If you remember me and want to talk send me a dm or something or just anyone lol. I kinda miss being in quarantine becuase I was on reddit so much but the real world is better.
Also school and sports are kinda stressin me oit rn so i just need a few hours to escape yaknow
