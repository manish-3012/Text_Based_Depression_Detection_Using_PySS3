Hey fellow teens, I know you've been lazy af since online school happened. I know all of us anxiety-ridden goblins have been lazy this online school. Sitting all day, looking at a goddamn computer screen for 9 hours (in my case), and having mental breakdowns due to the assignments. I just think you all should know that to prevent being a fatass due to poor physical and mental health, we should use our negative feelings to fuel our workout plan. For me, I do 1 push-up every time I get nervous, 1 sit-up every time I have uncertain thoughts, then count the number of times you did a push-up or sit-up. 1 time=100 meters then go for a run at the end of the day. I just hope I help you guys sorting in new out.
