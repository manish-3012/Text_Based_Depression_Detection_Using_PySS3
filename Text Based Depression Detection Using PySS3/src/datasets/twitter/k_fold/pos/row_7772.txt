Just some thoughts when I couldn't sleep yesterday \*This is just some space and timeline theory talk, so if you're not interested in those things keep scrolling. Or stay, by all means, maybe we can have a good discussion together.

So yesterday night I couldn't fall asleep, so I was laying there and thinking about random stuff when I suddenly start thinking about the grandpa paradox. If you don't know what it is I'll explain it in short:

Imagine that you go back in time and kill your grandpa, but if you kill your grandpa then you wouldn't exist, but if you don't exist then your grandpa would still be alive, but if your grandpa is still alive then you would exist and could kill him. See the problem?

So I was trying to find an answer to this paradox, and what I concluded was that every time you change the future, no matter how small the change it, you will create another timeline. Say for example you go back in time and buy a banana, then that means that you would have changed the future (butterfly effect and all that), and that new future is a new timeline that you now live in, while the future that would have been is another timeline. 

If my theory is true, the magnitude of it would be absolutely huge, like unimaginably huge. Because every time a new timeline is created, it would be a copy of the other timeline on the grand scale of things, like the same stars, galaxies, and whatever. That means that create entirely new universes by buying a banana if you go back in time.

What do you guys think about this theory? And please tell me if there's any hole in my theory, cause I'm just a 15 year old dude after all. Or maybe you have another answer to the grandpa paradox, then please do tell.
