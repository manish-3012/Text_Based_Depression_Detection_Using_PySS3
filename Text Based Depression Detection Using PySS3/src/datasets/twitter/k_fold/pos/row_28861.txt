Somebody down to keep me company? Hey, I'm a German guy and if somebody is down to talk, please feel free to DM me. Honestly, I'm just hella bored, however I'm also a good listener who would love to get to know other people from different countries with different cultures or just chat about life. And, well, work on improving my english.

So, anyways, have a nice day and/or night!
