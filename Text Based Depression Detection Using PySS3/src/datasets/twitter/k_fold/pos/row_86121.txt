I'm 15, and my mom wants to get me a job without me thinking about it, or having a choice of a job, and she's making me fill out an application tomorrow, take note, during a pandemic. do you think thats, right? She gives me the excuses of, "you need to be around people", "you'll get  good money", "no you don't have a choice you're gonna do it", "i was  working when I was 14".  
note, the money choice, I don't have a problem with it, but she also says, "oh it's just life you have to deal with it."

I  never had a choice and she's forcing me to do it. I asked her if she  felt like she was a good mom for forcing her 15 year old to do a job,  and she got pissed off.

I asked  her this, "so, that must mean in your mind, that when I'm in the future,  you're going to choose a job and say I'm going to do it for the rest of  my life?" that made her pissed off so bad, but it was an honest  question.
