I just remembered the worst nightmare ive ever had There was a generic sitcom i was acting in and the main setting was this house with a bottomless pit in the floor. If you fell in the pit and touched the side you would cease to exist. Naturally i fell in the hole and eventually ended up touching side. I was still able to think but i didnt realize it. So i was somehow aware that i no longer existed, which has got to be the most terrifying thing imaginable
