I need your advice So everyone knows now that online classes are a thing and its taken a toll to my mental health like really affected it, so ive been deciding for a while now to just stop my studying for this year and take a rest. But on the other hand theres this guilt that everyone would judge me for stopping my studies and im also feeling the guilt that im just wasting my life and should have continued my online classes. So whats your opinions on it? Let me know especially for those who stopped online classes tell me about your experience and if its worth it or not.
