I got banned for a week on PlayStation So I was gonna play some destiny, then I see that Iâ€™m not online, so I check my connection, and I see that my PSN connection failed, so I go to re sign in, it tells me that Iâ€™ve been banned for 7 days, then I remembered, that one time I told some kid to fuck off for teabagging me, his boypussy mustâ€™ve hurt so bad he told his mommy to report me and get me banned for a week.

For those who think Iâ€™m pissed, Iâ€™m not, I found this funny, actually, itâ€™s funny that people online are that easily offended, but then again, we live in an age where I can piss someone off for saying they have a cat and they say â€œItS nOt A cAt, Iâ€™m RaIsInG hEr LiKe A dOgâ€
