Today is my Birthday I just wanted to tell someone, I've been feeling kinda down today and wanted to share. Other than my parents no one really remembered. Only 2 of my friends said happy Birthday only after I mentioned the gifts I got the day before. I didnt get texts from anybody today. My birthday was mentioned on Friday over the loudspeakers at school and I heard people "Camilla's Birthday?!" Not even my really close friends remembered even after it was mentioned. I got a lot of gifts that I'm really happy about but I still feel kinda empty. Im really grateful Animal crossing has a Birthday celebration because if I didn't I would probably feel 10 times worse than I already do. Am I being too greedy? I just wanted people close to me to celebrate my special day with me. Thank you so much for reading my vent, I really do appreciate it.
