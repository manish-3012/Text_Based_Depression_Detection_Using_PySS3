kindness doesn't cost you anything, neither does being nice Today for some reason I've had probably the most Pleasant encounters with people online. I was down and they helped me. Such kindness in taking time out of their day to make sure I was okay and talking me through some issues...

Anyways yea. 

Helping other people. Being nice.

The world would just be such a nicer place if everybody was like that to each other
