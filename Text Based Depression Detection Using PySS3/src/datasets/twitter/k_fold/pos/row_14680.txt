Quick rant Im sick of standards. I mean as an individual person you can have yours. If you like tall men or blonde women thats fine. But as a society I get sick if it. 

I know all these girls from my school who are complete jerks! Some who have threatened me just fir correcting them, some who have punched other girks in the middle of class fir no reason, some who have gaslighted and manipulated other girls for the fun of it. Yet they all have 1,000â€™s of followers because theyre pretty. And it makes me so insecure. 

I look at myself and feel so ugly. Bland. I feel like my face is chubby, i barely have a jawline at least thats how i feel. 

You know I do enjoy makeup and doing it but Im too scared to wear it out. Or make videos that people who know me will see. So when i go out im not comfortable. I just always feel awful. I feel sad and alone and ive felt like this fir so damn long. 
I havent been called pretty in who knows how long. I havent been talked to by people from my school in forever. So many things just make me feel sad. And My first thought is alwys ending it. But im too scared to do that. And my animals would miss me. 

Idk i even made a fake Instagram where people who know me wouldnt find me just so i can feel slightly confident. But idk i guess Its just me.
