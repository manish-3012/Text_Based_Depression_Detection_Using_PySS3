I think my friend knows I'm gay He has called me gay a few times. We were installing wood panels to our school's hallway and I told my friend to lift it up because I'm not as strong as him and he said jokingly "gays like you don't have enough strength to lift things this big". (Something like that, he said it in a different language)

I have not come out to him but I have joked about gay stuff and I think he knows.
