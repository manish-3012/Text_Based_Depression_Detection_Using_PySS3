I think that rather giving awards to those who lost their loved ones, we should celebrate the success, talents and kindness of the living more. I understand that its a tough time for the ones who lost their loved ones but that is no reason we shower them with all *50+* awards. If you really want to be there for them, a wholesome comment or a good talk in the PM would do. His father dies and you give them awards? it just doesn't make sense. And yes, I get it that it is to let them know that they are strong for handling such stuff but giving awards is no way to convey that. Not to mention that when one loses his loved one, it's not the awards they need but rather some kind encouraging words. Also, it's not about "awards are superior, they are the ultimate form of validation/appreciation", it's more about how less of giving awards to those who lost their loved ones make sense. Instead, we could celebrate (by giving awards) to the kind acts of someone, or some amazing art skills of another. This, I think would pursue people to follow their passions or be more kind.

PS: if I am wrong anywhere, let me know instead of attacking.
