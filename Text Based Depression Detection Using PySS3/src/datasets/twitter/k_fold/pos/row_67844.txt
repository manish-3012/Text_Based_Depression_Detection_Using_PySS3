I dont think i am a good person I dont think that the use of my life is something good, im not here on earth to do good things.

I am obsessed with money, girls and other things.

I dont care that much about helping people, i would only help family and friends. Yeah i might be wrong for this but if i be honest this is how i really think. I think the use of my life is just earn as much money as possible, pass it on to my kids and die.

I dont think im terrible but certainly not good
