I had sleep paralysis last night and now Iâ€™m afraid to close my eyes Yep. You read that? Cool. Anyway, I was sticking to my usual sleep schedule of 4:00AM because I have trouble sleeping. I eventually drifted off and started dreaming. Normal stuff. I then wake up and thereâ€™s something in front of my bed. It had like multiple arms and shit, long hair. My bodyâ€™s natural instinct is to lean up and scream, BUT IT DIDNâ€™T. MY BODY WOULDNâ€™T FUCKING MOVE. No matter how hard I tried it wouldnâ€™t move. I tried screaming, but it was just silent. I tried so hard but nothing worked. I couldnâ€™t physically move at all. All I could really do is somehow close my eyes??? I did that until it stopped, which felt like a whole fucking hour, WHILE THIS DEMON ASS HOE IS JUST STANDING THERE. I woke up, moved my fingers, and literally cried. Then slept like a baby. Iâ€™m so tucking terrified of sleeping now **HELP.**
