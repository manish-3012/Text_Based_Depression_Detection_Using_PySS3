I don't think that my mom knows how to raise a child... My mom verbally abuses us telling us that we are useless, we make her life harder, calling is donkeys and pigs, you know the standard. I have a 5 five year old brother and she thinks that introducing school as a chore and a time to work will encourage him to do his work, for example he has to every week he has to do 40 minutes of a program... He has to go 80 because my mom wants him to Excel in class but all she's doing is getting him to dislike the program and to get stressed out. And what is her solution? Scream at him and tell him that if he does not finish he is going to get beat. Oh and God forbid if he makes a mistake or starts crying because oh yeah he is being threatened to be beat by your own mom at age 5 when their brains aren't even developed they are starting to develop a personality for his sake. oh did I mention that whenever she does not want to take care of them she will give them her phone for hours and then get mad when they ask for it like no shit Sherlock you got them addicted,as a matter of fact I can hear those fucking song lirics blasting out of my mom's phone as I write this.

It's fucking ennoyng. Also she tells me that i spend too much time In my room and how I don't socialize anymore. Like yeah i have online school. I also developed a habit of putting on my headphones and just play music to keep the constant screaming and threats out of my head, and then shell get mad at me for that that because of those fucking earplugs I can't hear shit like yes that's the point.

Also one thing she says is that me and my oldest sister are the most calm and quiet and you know who raised us? Not her my grandma. And you know what she did not do? She would not beat me or theatend too if I made a mistake as a five ear old.

Oh did I mention that she spanks my 2 year old brother for literally no reason I mean he doesn't know what he fucking doing.

And God help me if I defend them because if I do then , DOOT DOOT VERBAL ABUSE TRAIN ON ITS WAY!

This happened do often that I developed a heart problem because of how mad and stressed I was 24/7.

I became fucking suicidal at age 10 I would put a blade up to my wrist and think just one slice and it's all over, I can finnaly get out of this, would anyone even care? Maybe if I hung myself maybe they will..

It's fucking pathetic


She wants perfection but she does not understand that that's impossible.


My younger sibling comes up to me and asked

"Why does mommy hit us"

And 

"Why does mommy scream so much?"

And you know what's my answer  it's I don't fucking know she does not know how to raise a child for God fucking sake.

Also she hides the truth of everything I did not know my grandpa died until two days later

Or when my uncle got hospitalized I had to over hear it from one of the constant gossip calls dh had with my aunt.

And when my uncle died she was not even going to tell me it was my stepdad who did he is actually a good parent unlike her.

And the double standards holy shit, and she acts so different when my stepdad is here. 

And just go clarify my stepdad isn't perfect either he puts me down some times but he is way way better than her.

I have more to speak about but no more time so I'll just go with this.

So in conclusion she does not know how to raise a child.

Btw- I'm fine now my friends and older siblings got me out of suicide mode and my heart issues are gone after 1 and a have years of constant exercise and healthy habits.
