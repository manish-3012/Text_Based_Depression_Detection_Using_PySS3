How can you seriously be a conservative in 2020? in like 50 years we will look at people who say "trans women are just men" the same way we look at people who used to say "the negro race should not mix with the white race, lets stick to our own"

For real though, why be conservative? Conservatives have been on the wrong side of history LITERALLY EVERY TIME EVER FOR THE ENTIRETY OF HUMAN HISTORY. Modern day conservatives (transphobes, trump supporters, republicans) will be looked at the same way that we look at conservatives from 1950, 1900, 1850, 1800, 1750 1700.. etc
