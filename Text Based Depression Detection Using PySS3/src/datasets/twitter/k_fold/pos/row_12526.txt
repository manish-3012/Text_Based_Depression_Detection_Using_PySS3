[Serious] here are my thoughts on the mods So since where all talking about the mods banning a girl for calling out a pedo, I think that the mods who did that should be replaced or a new sub Reddit to be created entirely. This is inexcusable and disappointing. As kinda safe place for teens Iâ€™d hope the mods would take a Pedo claim with some sense of importance.
