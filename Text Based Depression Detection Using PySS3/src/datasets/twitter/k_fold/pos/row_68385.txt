Looking For Artists, Writers, Photographers, ETC. Hi! I'm a high-schooler that recently started a literary magazine with a team of my friends. Our goal is to publish and share works of young artists between the age of 13-22. We accept submissions on a rolling basis (no deadline) and we are searching for submissions!

We are also looking for more team members to fill positions like writing-editor or weekly contributor. If you want more information, or if you're interested the website will be linked below:
