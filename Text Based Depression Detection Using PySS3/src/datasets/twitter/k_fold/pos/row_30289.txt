My country wants to add a tax to the tax and a tax on almost every tech paid product So let's say you're paying your taxes so you do a bank transfer but there's a tax on that.

They are also charging 13% of everything you buy online, that includes: Steam, Playstation, Amazon, Spotify, Netflix, Google but not the porn sites which is interesting. Companies are supposed to file themselves in the tax institution but instead banks will just charge it.

Yeah my country is shitty ^(all of that goes to the president's house)
