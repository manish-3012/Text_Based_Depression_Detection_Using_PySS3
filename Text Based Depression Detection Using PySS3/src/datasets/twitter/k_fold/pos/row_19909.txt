I want a second lockdown Okay this may sound crazy but unlike some people i enjoyed lockdown. I could choose how long i would do work for and i didnt have to deal with homework and annoying classmates. And I don't think i am the only one who thinks this but, it really helped my mental health after school pushed me to a breaking point and just being at home is comforting, even though i'm stuck inside i didn't care (although i suppose that is because i didn't really go outside to begin with). And there is a real possibility in the UK. Who else wishes for a second lockdown or do you prefer to not be in quarantine
