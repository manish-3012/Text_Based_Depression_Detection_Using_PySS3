What is the best job for us 16 year olds? Iâ€™ve literally had 3 job interviews this year and all of them have rejected me because Iâ€™m not 17/18 
Iâ€™m in dire need of a job due to one of my parents not being able to get a job anymore so if anyone knows where I can look for a job that hires 16 years olds then please let me know
