Oh no Iâ€™ve ruined it. Well, he ruined it too. Weâ€™re friends. But Iâ€™ve just woken up to a lovely text message from this guy from school, saying that he likes me. 
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve flirted before so this feels like itâ€™s coming out of no where. Maybe itâ€™s a joke. Should I ask if itâ€™s a joke? And if itâ€™s not, how do you suppose I let him down easy. 
â€˜Cause I donâ€™t date people, at least not yet. Is that a valid enough reason?
