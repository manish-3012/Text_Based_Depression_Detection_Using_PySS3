Pedophilia isnâ€™t a sexuality, but why? Iâ€™m not debating if pedophilia is a sexuality, but I would like some good arguments other than: Â«Beacause itâ€™s discustingÂ» or Â«Because itâ€™s unnaturalÂ». To me, those arguments seem like what they used against homophilia or being jewish back in the 1800. 

I want to know why pedophilia is different.
