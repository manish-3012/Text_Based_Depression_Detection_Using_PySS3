I'm addicted to video games and need to stop, would love some advice on how

I am gay and and have a boyfriend, sadly we won't be seeing each other until we are adults now, moved away to a different country

I use to live with my mom, but not so long ago I moved in with my dad, so far it wasn't bad, wasn't good either
