Iâ€™m bored and itâ€™s 2 am so I counted the types of clothes I have in my closet. Two nightgown things, one crimson with gold tints the other is black. Both Harry Potter themed.

One black dress.

8 hoodies, 6 is black, one is white and has buttons, and the last one is a very dark blue.

2 shirts with long sleeves. One is black with a white and gold heart in the middle. The other one is a greenish grey with a Harry Potter reference and a hood.

3 button up shirts. One is black with a more jeans like texture. The other 2 are white, one is with a Harry Potter reference.

One shirt like thing that canâ€™t even be called a shirt but it is like a jacket but itâ€™s mostly see trough but itâ€™s black.

6 oversized t-shirts.

One school jock jacket thing that is black and white and has an Undertale design on the back.

4 flannels. One gray and white. Second is a very light blue and white. Third is a blue, white, gray and yellow. Forth is orange and white.

One sweater. Itâ€™s like the one that Yuri had from DDLC.


One crop top, dark lime with white stripes on the sleeves.

In conclusion, almost half of my closet is a dark void of black clothes.
