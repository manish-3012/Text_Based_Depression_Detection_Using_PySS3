Iâ€™m kinda upset by how underrated megamind is Itâ€™s so good, and the story is so different than other animated movies (especially princess related movies, no harsh feelings I still very much *love* Pixar and disney) 

I think the movie was shadowed (?) by a Disney film but omG if you havenâ€™t watched before... please check it out :,)
