Damm dude i feel like shit So hereâ€™s another rant but I feel like shit I wonder why everyday I go really cares about me for instance why do I even workout itâ€™s not like anyone notices I still look like the skinny frail kid everyone picks on. Why shouldnâ€™t I just go disappear itâ€™s not like I have any friends or anyone that cares
