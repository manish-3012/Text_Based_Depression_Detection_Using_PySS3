I had a dream that there was an assassin in my room and she was there to kill me I then woke up crying because it's the closest I'll get to having a girl in my room. Why is it so hard for me to cope with this. If you're going to comment "it'll be better" or shit like that don't. I don't want pity I just want to be liked romantically by a girl. Unless you can magically fix that go away.
