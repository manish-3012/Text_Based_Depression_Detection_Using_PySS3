DAE get hit hard by all these posts of y'all talented AF motherfuckers :( Like that guy singing opera (u/Baharnaz I think) like WTF how he so good? I'm older than him and I can't do anything nearly as good. And it seems (dunno if it's only an illusion) that everyone on this sub (and irl) is super good at something or the other (debate, writing, acting. music, theatre even friggin' yoga), but me? I'm just painfully average (looks and talent) and lazy AF.

I've accepted that, what gets me is that if every-fucking one is so good, is being average really the average anymore? Or am I near the bottom now? (Or am I just overthinking it?)

Whatever it is, something I really feel can help us all be less insecure would be if all us average people came together, like a discord server or a subreddit or something, a space where all us lazy fucks can get together and be free of humble-brags, one-upmanship, people showcasing their crazy amazing talents, or their super unique qualities. A place for us all to be worthless. Together.

P.S. no hate to all the amazing people out there, y'all are great and Earth would probably fall to shit if average people were in control. Some of us just need a break from that rn.

Sorry for this incoherent, random sad rant lol
