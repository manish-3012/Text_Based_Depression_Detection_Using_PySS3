adachi to shimamura is great, I can relate to both the main characters, and there both cute Lesbian anime is great, with straight anime itâ€™s really hard to relate to the girl cuz I canâ€™t relate to being attracted to a guy and the guy isnâ€™t cute so who gives a shit 

2 cute anime girls falling in love is cute and doesnâ€™t confuse me

To be clear if you like guys thatâ€™s fine I donâ€™t care, Iâ€™ll just never understand
