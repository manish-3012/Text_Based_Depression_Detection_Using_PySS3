My life was saved by dog sick Yesterday me my sister and her  carer went out and since we were gonna be a while and my mum wasn't going to be home we took my dog adroa cause we were gonna be gone most of the day and night and on the way back she was sick so we pulled into a gas station and cleaned up and I can hand shit i can handle extremely gory shit but sick is my one weakness and had to take a minute or 2 outside so I didn't throw up and on the route we were supposed to take there was a really bad car crash there were 3 cars that were destroyed, one on its side on up right and one upside down with the metal melted into the upright car and if we were 1 minute faster we'd we of been in that crash
