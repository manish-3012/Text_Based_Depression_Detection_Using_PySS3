Is it possible for me to love again? I fell for this girl that really hurt me (saying she loves me and then the next day she dates my best friend) and j know I should get over her and start again.

We were never together btw. But Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™ll never find love again and that was my only shot at loving someone. 

Iâ€™m 14 btw. Is it possible to fall deeply in love with a new girl?
