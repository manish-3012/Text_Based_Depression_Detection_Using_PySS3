My teacher reported me to the principal for plagiarizing myself? Ok I know it sounds crazy, but let me explain. In both my history and religion class, we were studying WW2. I used a segment from one of my essays in another essay because I felt both essays were talking about similar things and I didn't want to be repetitive. I was also really proud of that sentence. All the teachers at my school communicate and so the religion teacher was able to realize while she was in the history teacher's classroom, I had used the same sentence. She told me I had plagiarized myself which was a form of cheating and I got sent to the principal. Um.. what?? I didn't even know plagiarizing yourself was a thing. It came from my own brain.
