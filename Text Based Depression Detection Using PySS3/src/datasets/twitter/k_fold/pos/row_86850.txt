I didn't notice I didn't have a history class until the end of the grading period Pretty much the title

It's funny because this is just the effect of school. I am asked to blindly show up to a classroom, sit, and then leave. Why would I question anything? What do you guys think will happen? I live in Texas by the way

Fuck all teachers
