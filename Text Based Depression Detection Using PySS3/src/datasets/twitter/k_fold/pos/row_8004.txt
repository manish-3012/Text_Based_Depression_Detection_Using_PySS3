How are scenes like this even the slightest bit appropriate in movies for little children?

How is this not sexual violence, humiliation and domination? How is this not hateful of males, especially fetishizing this as "girlpower"? Why the fuck is shit like this in movies for little children?

Don't even say "it's just a movie" - Yeah? So it's just as ok to show male characters exploit and attack the genitals of female ones, but them in so much pain they collapse to the floor, humiliate them, just for "boypower"? And never, ever the other way around? Just a movie, right? Bullshit.
