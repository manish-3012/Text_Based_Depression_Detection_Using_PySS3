Grow the Fuck up. If youâ€™re offended by the title and the reality check Iâ€™m about to give you, Most kindly grow the fuck up.

Thanks.

Oh no, whatâ€™s that? Your being bullied and the school isnâ€™t doing anything about it? That must sooo hard, wanna know whatâ€™s harder? Life. Life will kick you in the balls and the nose AS HARD AS POSSIBLE and tell you suck it up.

Watcha gonna do then? Cry? Go to mommy? I have a better idea, why donâ€™t you grow a sack, and stop whining on social media like a little bitch and Fight back? Yeah sure, youâ€™ll get hurt. But itâ€™s worth it.

Iâ€™m seeing Boys get turned into sissies every Fucking Day in this generation and Iâ€™m losing hope.

Boys wearing dresses? Câ€™mon, might as well get the gender Transplant. Yes it is Unmanly.


Grow the fuck up and stop expecting everything to be handed to you on a Silver platter.

Nobody owes you Nothing, not even your parents.

Your not some precious Snowflake.
