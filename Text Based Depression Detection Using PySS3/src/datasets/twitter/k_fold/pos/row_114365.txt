i hate the girl who goes after their friends ex boyfriends right after they break up like have some respect?? why do you have to go after them so fast without even asking your friend if theyâ€™re okay with it first? 

donâ€™t say â€œoh weâ€™re just matesâ€... we all know whatâ€™s going on. 

like do what you want, but donâ€™t be surprised if you lose friends because of it.
