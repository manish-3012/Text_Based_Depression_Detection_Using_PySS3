I need your help getting revenge So my ex-friend, lets call him D, has started to bully me. He invited me over to his house, next thing I know he starts to insult my weight (which Iâ€™m really self conscious about) and just being an overall jerk to me. 

Now we both have YouTube channels, and he recently hit 100 subscribers and just would not leave me alone about it.(I have 66) Then he started disliking my videos no matter what they were about because he always had to be better than me. (Not just with YouTube, other things too) And Iâ€™m completely sick of it. Would you guys mind subscribing to my YouTube channel

I know itâ€™s a lot to ask but heâ€™s gotten on my last nerve. If you donâ€™t want to itâ€™s completely fine because I know itâ€™s a lot to do but it would be much appreciated. Thank you guys
