Are sticky bras comfortable? I am not thinking of wearing them because I am a dude but I just learned bout their existence and it got me thinking. Like, it doesn't seem like it's comfortable and I don't really see many reasons why women, especially women with big boobs would wear it.

What are your opinion on the matter?
