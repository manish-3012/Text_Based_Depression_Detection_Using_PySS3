Iâ€™m disappointed with myself I was gonna ask out a girl today and I almost did it but then I didnâ€™t. I canâ€™t believe I just froze up like that. To be honest Iâ€™m pretty mad at myself, it was the perfect opportunity and all I could think is â€œwhat if she says noâ€ or â€œwhat if sheâ€™s already dating someoneâ€. I shouldâ€™ve just gone for it. Itâ€™s not like I canâ€™t do it again but itâ€™s the principle. I couldâ€™ve done it but I didnâ€™t. Now Iâ€™m just gonna have to wait a week for probably the same result to what would have happened if I just asked today.

So all Iâ€™m here to say is fuck you anxiousness, your a bitch. 

Also this is a declaration, I WILL ask out that girl next Thursday and if I donâ€™t Iâ€™m gonna do 1000 push-ups.
