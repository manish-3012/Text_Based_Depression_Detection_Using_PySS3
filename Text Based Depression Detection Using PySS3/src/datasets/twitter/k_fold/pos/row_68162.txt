I need help, does anyone know whats going on with my 3DS? This problem started a few years ago, but it wasn't as bad as it is now. It used to be when I open my 3DS it sometimes completely shuts off, resets the date and time, and turns back on just fine. But now, I just have to lift my finger off the back and it shuts off (literally, just happened), resets date and time, and has a hard time turning back on. I have to press and hold the power button multiple times for it to turn back on. Does anyone else have this problem, and does anyone know how to get it fixed? 

(30 min ago)I just now noticed that the battery light isn't accurate anymore, it was red but switched back to blue even though I didn't plug it up.

(Just now): I didn't even touch it, and it shut off on its own. It had a blue light for the battery as well.
