So I went to go visit my sister today And well when we where there I was one of the only people there wearing boots and a flannel 

I just felt out of place tbh 

Around where I live theres not alot but there's quite a bit of people that where the same stuff I do 

And I don't always wear flannels but it's what I was wearing at the time
