How do I achieve my dreams of becoming a racing car driver? Hello, I am currently 14 years old and have had an intrest of cars since i was a kid but recently that interest has resparked, something about racing makes me feel amazing inside and I really want to be able to do it but there are alot of things I need some help with, for starters I live in an area where there is no kart tracks or racing courses at all, another thing is that I never had the opertunity to do a karting series as a kid because of my circumstances of those I will not get into. I also live in the US so driving schools and tracks are more hard to come by, my only saving grace is that my stepdad lives near Indianapolis, I can drop everything and move their but it is very risky because I dont even know if i could succeed in this motorsports world, I would have to drop everything I built for myself in my hometown and start fresh. I can save up around 3k for a one day driving school or some karting races because of my job. The only other good thing I have is sim racing but that wont help me. I think i am screwed here but I really need your help. this may sound corney but ever since I stepped in a gokart for the first time I decided that this is what I want to do in life.
