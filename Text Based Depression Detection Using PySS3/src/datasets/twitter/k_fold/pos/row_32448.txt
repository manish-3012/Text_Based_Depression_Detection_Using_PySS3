I have a question for all you fellow teenagers! When I was little I used to think the girls were gross (like all 5 year old would) and I made sure I was completely different from them.

Now I'm 16 year old boy and I think that alot of aspects of my personality are more like a females. Its not that I like similar things to girls or like to go girly shopping (or any of the seriotypical things that are said about girls). Its just some things. For instance (now I know that this is common for me not to like this but I'll say it anyway) boys like to 'play fight' when they meet each other, me on the other hand stay away from it as much as I can (not a good example, I know).

Its not that I'm transgender or homosexual or anything. I'm straight but I just have this personality thing.

Maybe I have always had it but not noticed till now or maybe I have only just got it with puberty? Maybe I have been influenced by it as some people mistake me as a girl (because some think I look like a girl)

Another thing alot of boys talk about how 'hot' some women are and some women talk about how 'hot' some guy is but I cant see how attractive someone is. I just can't see it! (I know im not asexual)

Basically I know I dont have a personality like a man's. Its more like a mix between a girls personality and something... else... (maybe its 45% girl and 55% weird thing).

Anyway, my question is: has anyone else got this?

If you do has it ever gone away or kinda just stuck around because personally i don't mind it. But if it went as well I don't think I would care.

Anyway thanks. Also if you don't know what to say you can comment any random thing you like (e.g. "hippo").
