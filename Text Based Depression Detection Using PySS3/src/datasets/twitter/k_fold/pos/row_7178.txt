Anyone else have friends like this? Heâ€™s really cool and Iâ€™m super lucky and glad I have him as a friend. But one day each week he gets drunk with some other kids, and he calls and texts saying to me how much I mean to him and he loves me and that he wants to do all these things in life together. 

Idk man it just feels... sort of... fake. Like I know on some level itâ€™s probably true but he really only says these things when heâ€™s drunk. Each time he calls while drunk I kinda pretend to be happy for him, telling him to enjoy and agree with whatever he says to not bring his mood down. I wonâ€™t tell him any of this.
