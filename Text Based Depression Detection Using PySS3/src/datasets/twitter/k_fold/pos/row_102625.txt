Just curious of how yâ€™all would react so.... Alright so letâ€™s say that you know someone that was assaulted, they told you and only you, and they tell you to not tell anyone and that theyâ€™re stressed enough as it is that they have vains popping. You know you can beat up the guy who assaulted or bring him to justice by telling others, but by inflicting pain to him, or telling others, you would lose your friends trust and most likely lose your friend. What do you do and why would you do that?
