my recent unhealthy behaviors 

So recently at my school , I saw someone who reminds me of  SOMEBODY THAT I USED TO KNOW... I donâ€™t itâ€™s a crush thing but Ive bit obsessive over them. I donâ€™t talk to them, nor do I know them. I donâ€™t even know what grade theyâ€™re in , I just saw them at lunch one day. Then I just felt weird feeling . I watch them from a far. I feel like my behavior is borderline stalkerish... I just want to protect them.  Theyâ€™ve started to appear  in my dreams, nothing sexual or Romantic... their there in the background.
Tbh I donâ€™t even know what gender theyâ€™re are, I never been close enough to tell. All I see is theyâ€™re midish length blonde hair and glasses, plus theyâ€™re decent height... But I think their male. But I might just want them to be male because the person they reminded me of is male.

I donâ€™t think this is normal, maybe Iâ€™m developing crush...idk I havenâ€™t really liked anyone.
