It's time for the spooky month! Spooktober is a very eventful month for me and my family. 3 birthdays, 2 holidays, and 1 Ultimate spooky boi! I'm going to play VR after my birthday with my best friend for 2 hours, then do some other shit cause why not! I'm going to make sure I improve myself this last part of the year and next year! I'm doing pretty good at the moment and I wanna keep it going. Happy spooktober everyone!
