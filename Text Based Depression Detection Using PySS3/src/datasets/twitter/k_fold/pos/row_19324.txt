I can't take it anymore I want to quit. I will quit.

I'm done sacrificing my mental and physical health for a huge paycheck.

The only reason I came to work here is to learn and I did learn 3 things.

I love this job. 

A lot of people are fucking ass holes. 

My parents are fucking awesome 

Tomorrow I'm telling my boss I quit. I'm finally gonna go home and idc if they talk shit about me anymore. 


I don't want to waste money and time getting drunk everyday just so I can fall asleep
