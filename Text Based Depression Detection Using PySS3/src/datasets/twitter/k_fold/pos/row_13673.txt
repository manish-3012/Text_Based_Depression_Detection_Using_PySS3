I just want to end it I've been feeling like a strain to my family, my mom only talks to me to tell me to to chores and shit, my dad is too busy with work, and my brother, it feels like that he hates me, and I'm only hindering him. He got into a high teir university, and im not accedemically smart at all. Now that I'm the only person going to school in person I don't want to put them at risk. I feel like that it would have been better if I just didn't exist, I feel like it would be a relief if I just removed myself. I don't want to see the coucellor at my school because they should tell my parents about it, and I don't want them to find out I'm weak. As for my friends, I feel they are only going to be the people I would truely miss, but I'm not sure if they would feel the same. I just feel so depressed and I feel that everything I do just goes to waste. All of my cousins have plans for their futures, but I have no clue what I'm going to do. I know this sub is notorious for fake posts, but if there is anyone who knows how I can make this go away, please help. I have already tried talking to my friends but that only helps short term, and seeing a therapist, I would need parental consent. Even if I didn't they would find out.
