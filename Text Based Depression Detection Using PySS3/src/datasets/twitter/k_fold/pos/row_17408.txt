Does flirting count as cheating? Iâ€™ve been cheated on. Twice so far. But thatâ€™s in the past nothing to worry about but my last relationship (I donâ€™t think I was cheated on then) was pretty shitty in the end and now that I think about it, I think my SO had flirted with a couple people while dating me so, does that count as cheating? Or a form of cheating? If not, what does it count as?
