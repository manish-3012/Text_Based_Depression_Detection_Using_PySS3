What kind of measures does your school take against Covid-19? I'm curious to see what do schools in the US or other countries do to prevent contamination. For mine, they test our temperature at the entrance, then they tell us to use the disinfectant that you dispense with your foot. Having a mask is mandatory too.

They also divided our class (21 students) into two groups, e.g, my group is called 1st Bac/D, and it's divided into D1 (11 students) and D2 (10 students), when D1 is at school from 8:30 to 12:30, D2 is online, and in the evening from 3:00 to 5:00, they switch. The next day, the group that was online in the evening stays online, and it goes on... This is a method that all private schools here use, public schools don't even care lol (btw don't mind the weird schedule we have, Morocco doesn't make sense).

As for when someone has Covid-19, which happened in my class, we have to stay online for 10 days, and can only enter school after that period if you did a test and brought the results. They told me to go back home because I didn't have it lmao.
