I find myself always asking if antidepressants would help The amount Iâ€™ve been contemplating starting taking them recently because of how low Iâ€™ve been is sad. Iâ€™ve got a prescription for Prozac I believe Iâ€™ve just gotta ask for it. But honestly I donâ€™t know anymore. I have no fucking clue if I should start taking them or if itâ€™s even worth it. To those taking them what are your thoughts?
