Has anyone else never had a crush? I've never had a crush on anyone. Like ever. I have a friend who hasn't really either. And when i learned that about her I realized I wasn't completely weird. All my other friends have all liked someone or like someone currently. My mom doesn't believe me when I say I have never liked anyone. Is there anyone in this sub who's never liked anyone or had a crush?
