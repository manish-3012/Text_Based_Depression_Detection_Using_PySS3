I miss my friends i used to be in this group of around 5 friends and i miss them. two moved away and ghosted me, one of them i wasn't particularly close with so we drifted away, another one's made other friends, and i only talk to this one girl from the group, but our conversations are just meaningless memes. i miss having heart-to-heart conversations between all of us. i miss them so much.
