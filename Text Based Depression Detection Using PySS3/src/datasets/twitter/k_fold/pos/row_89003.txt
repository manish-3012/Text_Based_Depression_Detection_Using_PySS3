If I ever get a kid Iâ€™m not having a gender reveal party I mean, it wonâ€™t happen. But I donâ€™t want to know the gender of the baby beforehand. It needs to be a surprise and if you â€˜planâ€™ what their name is gonna be, then it wonâ€™t really be their name, it will be a label. But if you look at the baby and then make up a name (by make up I mean choose) a name on the spot, then that is their name.

This is just me personally but tell me if Iâ€™m wrong.
