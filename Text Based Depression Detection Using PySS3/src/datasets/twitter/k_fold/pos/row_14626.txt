Random thought #10 Religon is a funny thing. I believe in God, Mary, Jesus all that Christian stuff. But there isn't really any proof of any of it. It's all faith. Clearly this bible is mostly false, I have beliefs that follow christianity but not most of the bible. I think he exists. Listening to everyone's prayers, granting them in small ways. 

Maybe the life we live is a simulation, or I'm in a coma and outside of this simulation or coma God does exist, maybe there is proof of Adam and eve. I don't know, I'm saying completely random things now. 

But continuing with those random things, maybe this is a coma, and no matter what anyone comments on this post is all just made up by my brain.  Like if someone commented "Well I know you're not in a coma because I know I'm conscious, and if anything I'm in a coma reading this haha" well that could be my brain making that up too. It's weird, really weird to think about.
