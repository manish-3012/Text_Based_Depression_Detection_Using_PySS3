I can't help but miss him Hey you, it's been a while... Things are pretty boring over here, since u left. My memories of u painfully remind me of before, when everything was still just a big laugh, and things were still fun... Ugh, you know, u could have said good bye, u could have a least left a letter! Instead of just leaving, to where ever the hell u went! Its just, I miss you, I can't help but miss you... Do you miss me? I hope u do, and you know, if I'm being truthfully honest, I hope your life has turned into hell, just like mine has.

This is just a short story thing btw definitely not based off a jerk I liked who left school and never came back.
