I wrote a poem Clarity.

That brief moment between games when the loading screen goes dark

You look at your reflection on the screen. You see a face stare back that you can't even recognize.

The face of someone who has no direction in life. 

The face of someone who has unimaginable pain locked deep within them

Supressed

You realize you have no one. In that moment, you are alone. There is no one with you. No one to help you. No one to talk to.

Then your phone rings. You get a small rush of adrenaline and a spark in your eyes hoping someone was interested in talking to you. But that fades away quickly after you realize it's just your phone battery at 5%. It's going to die soon

Lucky bastard.

You look at the controller in your hands and the drugs on your table. 

None of these things make you happy.

They are merely tools to distract yourself. To numb and supress your pain.

You get a deep sinking feeling, knowing that this won't change. That you're going to go through the same cycle again, tomorrow, and the day after that and after that, just as you did yesterday. 

Lame.

But those thoughts all fade away quickly once the screen goes bright again and you load into your game.

This is just my life I guess.
