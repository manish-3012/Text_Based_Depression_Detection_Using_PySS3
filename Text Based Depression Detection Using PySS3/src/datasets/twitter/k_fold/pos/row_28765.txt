Playing a non-Minecraft Minecraft shouldnâ€™t make you unpopular. Weird, right? Itâ€™s because of my parents. Itâ€™s not that they donâ€™t want me playing video games. I do that all the time. But for some reason, my parents have this burning demonic hatred for Minecraft that I canâ€™t explain in words here. When I bought some Minecraft books at a book fair a few years back, I was threatened with my parents taking away all of my pocket money and going to timeout for an hour (maybe 2). I was extra sad because Minecraft is literally my favorite game of all time. Even my parents know Iâ€™m mega creative. The first time my parentsâ€™ hatred of Minecraft shown through, I was honestly scarred. Iâ€™ve always been terrified of my parents, but here, it reached a breaking point. I just wanted to be alone forever, away from the horror of my parents, where I could be free to do the things I wanted.
I didnâ€™t leave them, though. I just tuned them out whenever I could, because at this point, I knew me and my parents would collide on a fundamental point of my entire childhood starting from age 8. Iâ€™ve never gotten any of the mainstream minecraft editions since. Itâ€™s been 5 entire painful years of rejection, punishment, and abject misery.
But when I was about 11, I discovered a beacon of hope. While searching for ways to get Minecraft for free, without my parents noticing, I stumbled upon Minecraft: Education Edition. It had all of the features I knew and loved. It was free. I could use it myself. It was perfect.
So for the past 2 years, Iâ€™v basically been hanging off a cliff. The only thing keeping me from falling into the abyss is Minecraft Education. Itâ€™s been keeping me entertained and happy in the same way that you others might say about mainstream Minecraft, Pokemon, or Mario, none of which I have. Itâ€™s just Minecraft Education thatâ€™s served as the only light in an infinite darkness, trapped by the restrictions my parents place on me.
But even then, I couldnâ€™t find real joy. People at my school looked at me and laughed, laughed at the Chinese nerdy boy who played Minecraft Education Edition. I bet he spends his free time doing math. What a loser! Letâ€™s go beat him up emotionally and make him cry into a pillow at night for the next 3 months! Of course Iâ€™m exaggerating this, but I was definitely bullied during this time for playing an unknown version of Minecraft.
Some of you might feel the same. I just want to say that what people do for fun does nothing to tell you what theyâ€™re actually like on the inside. I would know, since I experienced it firsthand. Maybe everybody will ignore this. Maybe everybody will dismiss this as some sort of copypasta meant to boost up karma points. But I wrote this. My own fingers typed each and every paragraph as I remembered the past, and how utterly black and faded it was. So I legitimately hope youâ€™ll read this, and look into the past of someone maybe not too different from you.
