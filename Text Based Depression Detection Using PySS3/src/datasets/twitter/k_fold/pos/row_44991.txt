The subreddit has gone bad Literally every post is "I asked my crush out" "she said yes" "she said no" I mean the subreddit should be called r/crushaskouts . Like I can't remember when I last saw A GOOD POST. Its to the point where I might leave. Its just the same story with occasional edgy joke about toddlers.
