I think i love this girl Everyone says teens are too young to be in love but i genuinely do believe that this girl is the one for me. I cannot stop thinking about her, and haven't been able to for at least 6 months.

I am too afraid to talk to her or do anything about it but I know that I won't be able to move on until I do. The only problem is that we haven't spoken in almost 4 years. We used to be close but i have no idea if she will feel the same way as I do.

I genuinely want this to go well but I also don't think that I could handle it if it went south. So I probably won't do anything. 

Man my feelings for this girl are so strong I kind of don't believe. I have never felt this way about anyone ever.
