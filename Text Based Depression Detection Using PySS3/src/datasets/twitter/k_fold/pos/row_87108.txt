Anyone else having an identity crisis? I can't tell whether I'm straight or bi, and I can't tell if I'm a guy, fluid, or nonbinary. Is this a normal thing, or is it puberty, or is it internet culture, or is it something else? Am I normal? Can you help me out?

&gt;!Also this is besides the point but the word "titty" is kinda funny!&lt;
