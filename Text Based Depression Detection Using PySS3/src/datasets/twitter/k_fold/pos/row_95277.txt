Well guys, itâ€™s that time of year. Today, my friends, is my birthday. I would like to say a few words before we begin the celebration.

First of all, I would like to apologize. For the last few months, I have been deceiving you. Until today, I was not truly 14. I was 13. I did this because I thought Iâ€™d be taken more seriously if I was 14. Was I right? Probably not. But now you all know.

Second, if like to thank all of you. The last few months have been (mostly) great. I maintained my grades, hung out with friends, had some great conversations with you guys, and managed to do the one thing redditors dream of: I got a girlfriend.

So cheers, to the last year, and to all the years to come. To all of the years that I may not be here for. To each and every one of you. You have all supported me, and I plan to do the same for you. Thank you.
