My dad slapped me for not knowing how to drive on the first day of drivers ed I'm 15 male and I went to drivers ed where they show you a video and the other stuff right. So when I leave my dad takes me to my grandpas ranch and tells me to drive. I tell him that I didn't know how. He proceeds to go on a rant that he paid money for nothing. I told him that the first day they show you a video and the other things. He slaps me across the face then saying that when he was 8 he already knew how to drive. I told him that I'm not him and I can't do everything like him. What should I do?
