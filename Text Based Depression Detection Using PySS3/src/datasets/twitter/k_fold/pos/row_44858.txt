Why do teens want love so bad A lot of you have to realize we still have a lot of time to come and shouldn't have to be worrying about love. Also the thing is, a lot of us in this age group love the idea of love but don't know what it actually means to be, almost all of the time these teenage relationships are just infatuation. We most likely won't find our partners later till life, so be patient and wait. I trip out on how these girls on social media are sad over guys and be talking about how they need a man to be happy, like you're not gonna fill the bucket of water if there's a hole at the bottom !
