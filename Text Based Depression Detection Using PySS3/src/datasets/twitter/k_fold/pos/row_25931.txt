Being lonely kinda sucks I'm only human, and I wish I had a close friend I could talk to (not that I'm looking for one here) I suppose it is just life but I have yet to become familiar with the pain of having things being constantly built up and knocked down every few years as a military child. Normally this wouldn't be such a problem, but it never occurred to me that all those friends I had made online would go too, and now I have nothing left from my past. This is the loneliness I've felt in a long time, and I have been suicidal previously. But it's weird, this isn't like that, maybe it's growth, but it almost hurts more at the expense of some sadness. Sometimes I wish I could just be an ignorant fool and enjoy this time I have, and I try, but I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to escape the dissapointment of realizing I'll just lose everything, again, and again.
