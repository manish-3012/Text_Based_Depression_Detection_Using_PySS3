The Ten Commandments of r/teenagers These are the Ten Commandmants that you must follow while on this subreddit. If you break these Commandments, and do not repent, you shall be banished to the Nether for all eternity. Original credit goes to my man Jesus who came up with this idea first

1. Thou shalt not be a simp
2. Thou shalt not ask for any time of actions or rewards to be given to your post
3. Thou shalt not use the name of Notch, the Creator of Minecraft, in vain.
4. Remember the self post weekend, to keep it image free
5. Thou shalt not kill baby animals or pet dogs/cats in Minecraft
6. Thou shalt not put Fortnite before Minecraft
7. Thou shalt not put Instagram or TikTok before Reddit
8. Thou shalt not swear while discussing Minecraft
9. Thou shalt follow the subreddit rules
10. Thou shalt not say that pedophilia is a sexuality, because itâ€™s not.

If you have broken any of these commandments, and feel that you need to repent, hereâ€™s what to do. Go into a Minecraft single player world, built a diamond throne, and say â€œDear Notch,â€ in chat, followed by your repentance. Also, if you think there should be more commandments, feel free to leave them in the comments. Have a nice day!
