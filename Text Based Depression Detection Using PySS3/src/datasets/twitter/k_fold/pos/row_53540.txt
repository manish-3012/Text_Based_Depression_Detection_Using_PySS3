GOD I feel like absolute shit I feel like a worthless piece of shit, why the fuck am I even here? I haven't had an effect on people's lives and if I have it's usually for the worse, and nobody fucking cares about my existence, I'm literally only a space filler.

I fucking want shit, but I know very well that I don't deserve it, I don't do anything, if I do it's absolute shit and I always lie to people, I'm a terrible friend, brother and child, I should be fucking put down for the sake of my family.

And even after all of the shit I do wrong, I still believe I have the right to be feel sad and stressed, I shouldn't be, I'm 14 and never have done anything that helps people around me so why the fuck do I feel bad for my sorry ass?

Sorry for ruining your day with this shitty ass vent, I just wanna scream my problems out to the world and act as if that's helpful to me.
