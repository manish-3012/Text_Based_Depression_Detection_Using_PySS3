What's currently the hardest thing about being a teenager that adults don't understand? I'm a licensed mental health therapist who specializes in trauma and the developing teenage brain. Time and time again I've noticed that teens don't seem to feel heard or taken seriously by the adults in their lives and this seems to fuel potentially dangerous behavior as adolescents are left to explore their world on their own without the help, support or guidance of their parents/elders. What is currently the hardest part about being a teenager that adults don't seem to listen to or take seriously?
