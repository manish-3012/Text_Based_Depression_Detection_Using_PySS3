I have mild autism and moderate social anxiety So my impulsive behavior is somewhat counteracted by my anxiety, so whenever someone finds out I have asd they are usually very surprised, only my very close friends werenâ€™t surprised cuz Iâ€™m less anxious around them so

I also have adhd and probably have mild ocd and generalized anxiety (and death anxiety), my life is fun
