Turned in 11:59... marked late ðŸ˜” So I had to write a research paper for a science fair.
It was assigned a week ago.
I started it 11:30pm. (Bad idea)
Iâ€™ve never typed so fast in my life.
I turned it in 11:59, but nooo google said it was **turned in late**.
Also I FORGOT TO ADD A TITLE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, IT SAYS â€œDescriptive Titleâ€ AT THE TOP
