A question that all of us have. Why the hell do we have learn history? APWH is so fucking tough, and in the end it doesnâ€™t even matter. Like out of 10 people who is gonna become a historian? Yeah I know, no one. I get it, it helps you improve ur essay righting skills. Bitch we have English class for that. Itâ€™s a fun class, sometimes. But I still donâ€™t know why this subject is mandatory. Fuck school
