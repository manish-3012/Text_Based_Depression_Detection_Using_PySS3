My Parents gave my brother (age 12) a pocket knife, and I don't feel comfortable with this Here's the thing. My brother has anger issues, and a couple of weeks ago we got into a fight. No hands were thrown, however out of nowhere my brother grabbed a kitchen knife, and proceeded to stab a chair, he then pointed the knife threateningly at me, but wasn't holding on strong enough so I just grabbed it. It's worrisome cause he's done shit like this before, and I feel like giving him A FUCKING KNIFE, that gonna be IN HIS FUCKING ROOM would only reinforce such behavior. Anyways, idk if this is just my anxiety trying to protect me, or if I should actually hide the knife or throw it out. Any thoughts would be of help :)

Have a good day ya'll
