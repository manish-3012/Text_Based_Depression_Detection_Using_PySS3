I finally asked a question in class I absolutely never have asked questions in class and deny having questions when anyone asks when all I have are questions. But today in math I finally asked the teacher a question on one of the problems and I am so proud of myself I was very anxious and nervous people would be like oh you donâ€™t understand this you must be stupid but I finally finally did it.
