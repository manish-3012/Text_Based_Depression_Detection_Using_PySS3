I hate being the ugly black girl I know that a lot of people on Reddit are white or lacking empathy but being the ugly black girl is TERRIBLE, people do not TREAT the ugly black girl well and it starts when you're young.  I would just much rather be dead honestly, no one understands how BAD it is people are always making comments and white boys are so FUCKING EVIL.  My life sucks
