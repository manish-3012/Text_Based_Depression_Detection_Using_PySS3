my first real crush lives across the atlantic So, I have never really had any serious crushes in my life, I get over them in like a month and it's usually cuz they're hot and not because I like them for who they are. Regardless I also had no success with girls probably because I just don't try. This was until I met this one girl on omegle. We hit it off well and we talk everyday for hours and hours, and well after awhile she said she likes me, and well I like her too. And what separates her from all the other girls is that I genuinely enjoy talking to her and I don't like her just because she's hot, but because of her personality. We've gotten so close that we're basically sexting. But what really fucking sucks is that she's all the way across the Atlantic in the UK, and the only time I can actually visit her is the two weeks in June when my mother goes to London for work reasons :(. Ergo I just ask to whatever potential deity exists, why is the one girl who I like so much is also so far from me?
