Playing with someone thats fun to play with but is dogshit is much better than playing with a try hard Im talking games and out of my friend group, I am most def the try hard. Im just really competitive, in games, sports and just anything that there is. I like to win, but playing along side another try hard and just getting dubs and talking shit, its just not fun after a while. I have a friend, she's absolute dog shit at the game, has no Clue on any call outs and we rarely ever win unless I carry. BUT MAN, is it fun to play games with her cuz we just be dying of laughter and shit yk? 

Yeah getting wins is fun, but making memories is way better. ^(Also please play COD with me, ik barely anyone plays COD here but im bored)
