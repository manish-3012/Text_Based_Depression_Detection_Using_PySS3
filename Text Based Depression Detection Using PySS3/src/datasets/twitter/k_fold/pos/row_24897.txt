Daddy chil, where'd you go? I was playing Among Us and quickly became friends with Lime. His name is Daddy chil. First he was imposter, but I didn't know that. We stuck together and when white killed me, lime was there. At first I thought he had betrayed me and danced on my dead body. But it turns out, he was crying over it.
Next round, I was imposter but lime didn't know. I went the whole round with him. I didn't wanna hurt my buddy though. I won and he found out who I was.
Next round we had decided to reveal who we are. If one of us is imposter, so is the other, no matter what.
But before the game could even really begin, lime left the game.
Where'd you go, lime? I thought we were pals?
If anyone could help me find my buddy, Daddy chil, please help. I want to reunite with him.
My Among Us name is big Rona. Daddy chil, if you're out there, find me.
