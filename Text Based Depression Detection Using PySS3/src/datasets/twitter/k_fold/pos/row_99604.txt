i cant to this anymore honest to god being a teen is so fucking hard. itâ€™s so hard socially and mentally. i just wanna give up. i feel as though all my friends hate me, my best friend couldnâ€™t hang out today so now i am convinced she hates me. i donâ€™t have any other friends to hang out with. and i hate the weekend bc i have to be around my mom and dad. i donâ€™t mind my dad bc heâ€™s pretty chill but my mom makes me wanna gouge my eyes out. iâ€™m so lonely. i canâ€™t wait another week to hang out i canâ€™t even guarantee iâ€™ll be alive. i need someone to laugh with, make me feel alright and distract me from the urge to stan myself in the stomach. i donâ€™t wanna do this anymore, it was fun for a few weeks but itâ€™s not fun anymore.
