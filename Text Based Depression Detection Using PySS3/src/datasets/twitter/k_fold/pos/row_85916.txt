Letâ€™s play teenage adventures #1 (read post) You are on the other side of a island, the island is Surrounded by lava, there is 20 lava blocks to the island, you do not have enough resources to create a bucket and there is no water around you, however there is a very small plains biome with one tree with 4 wood logs with it, you donâ€™t have a crafting table, you can dig up dirt but it would sink to the bottom, how would you cross the lava, comment to play
