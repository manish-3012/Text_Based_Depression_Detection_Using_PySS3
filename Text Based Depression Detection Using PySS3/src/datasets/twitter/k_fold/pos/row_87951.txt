A survey on teenagers' sleep Hi, I'm conducting a google forms survey: [the average teenager's sleep](https://forms.gle/mTUWYH9nme6HTEEB6) for my class. This survey is concerned with the average time most teenagers sleep, how much sleep they get every night, and what factors may affect their sleep. If you can find the time to fill-out the form, it would be greatly appreciated.

The responses will be used only for academic purposes and you can answer anonymously. I'll gladly share the findings of this survey back to this sub, if I get enough responses to make a decent conclusion. Thank you.
