I feel like a robot set to have a certain number of things to do every day Every day is the same except for weekends. I can predict right now how tomorrow is going to go, and I have a 99% chance to be right. Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to get up, eat breakfast, do schoolwork, eat lunch, do schoolwork, eat dinner, work on schoolwork for multiple hours after dinner to the point where my mom makes me go to be because itâ€™s like midnight or something, then do more work after going to bed. All of this while hating every second of it other than the eating part, thatâ€™s fun.
