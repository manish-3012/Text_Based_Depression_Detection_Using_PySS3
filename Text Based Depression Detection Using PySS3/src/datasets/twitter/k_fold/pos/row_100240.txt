OK so my cousin has been complaining to anyone that will listen that her boyfriend isnâ€™t helping to take care of the baby because he doesnâ€™t want to carry around her neon pink diaper bag any time he takes the kid anywhere. So my younger sister Bought them a â€œ Tactical diaper bagâ€ &amp;#x200B;

Basically itâ€™s a diaper bag but in camo. Colors. And I canâ€™t stop laughing at how insecure this motherfucker must be to not be able to carry around a bag for his kid No one freaking gives a shit if youâ€™re carrying around a pastel pink bag and you have a toddler with you

Your a dad Not a bad ass on a secret mission. Just do what you need to do. My dad had a baby carrier a papoose kind of thing for my younger brother when we were all really young. The thing was a really light purple with balloons on it. And my old Man a Marine Corps officer that was a stereotypical walking personification of badass at the time Used it without complaint because he wanted to be able to walk the dog and carry around my brother at the same time.

So yeah The family as a whole is Of the consensus Charlie either needs to man up or shut up and help Brooklyn take care of little Ignatius. For the record everyoneâ€™s been calling him iggy, Because no one wants to call him by his middle name Benjamin.
