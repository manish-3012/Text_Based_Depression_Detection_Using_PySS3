I just got called a turtle by a homohobe Yes this guy was being homophobic to my friend(shes bi) and I stood up for her and got called a fucking turtle as an insult... A FUCKING TURTLE! Can anyone explain this? Am I missing something or is this serious? I dont think he was joking as it got serious to the point where we were nearly fighting, I was in a group of 4-5 and they were a group of 10 or something. I'm so confused on why the fuck he called me a fucking turtle.
