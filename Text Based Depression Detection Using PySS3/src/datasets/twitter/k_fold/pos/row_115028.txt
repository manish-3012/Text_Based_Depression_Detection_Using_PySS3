At my home I sometimes feel like I'm in a room full of idiots. Now this isn't me saying I'm better than everyone, cause I'm definitely not. But my god, my parents and siblings logic is really fucking flawed. 

My mom will make any situation, even if it's like a personal one to me, about her. 

My dad just don't fucking listen to anyone and will interrupt, but apparently I can't do the same. 

I'm the oldest, but I got 3 sisters. 

The oldest of the sister just won't fucking listen to anyone. And even if I give good proof, she'll get mad at me for going against her. I take the side that seem more reasonable, I'm not always gonna be on your side. 

And the second oldest is just so fucking obnoxious. Yeah she does make good points sometimes but holy hell is she annoying. But I also kinda feel bad for her cause the older sister treats her like shit. And so do my parents kinda. 

And well my other is 6 so she dont count

Anyways rant over.

(Oh yeah I also tried to vent to them about my problems, they don't fucking listen to any shit or they just make it about themselves)
