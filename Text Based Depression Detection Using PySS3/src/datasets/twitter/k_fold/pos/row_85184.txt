I wrote a poem recently and just wanted to share it with you all. I might delete it later! I wake up every morning and think about my day

I need to let things go and make my way 

"You seem stressed!" Said my therapist 

"Why wouldn't I be, with all the fun I missed" 

I think about my past, how confident I was

But the things I feel now, I don't even know the cause 

Staring at a wall, thinking about my fears 

1 hour later, breaking into tears. 

My mom figured everything out and asked if something was wrong

How could I tell her that I don't feel strong 

She hugged me and said I need to get over this phase 

I obsess over things, I have this stupid craze 

She tried to motivate me, but it made things worse

I don't know how to describe it, maybe it's a curse. 

I need the confidence to meet my friends

I miss the time we together spent 

I see my friends playing football and shouting "goal" in unison

I want to meet them, but my brain wouldn't give me permission 



Sometimes I feel like a failure, sometimes worthless 

If someone asks me something, I'm literally wordless

What if things got worse and lead me to self harm

Would it feel bad, or would it be warm? 

Slept at 5am, nightmares kept me awake

They kept me awake, they made me shake

My alarm rang at 7am, but I needed to sleep before I waked. 

People with mental illnesses are my true inspiration 

They give me hope to defeat anxiety and depression 

One day, you'll see me get out of this

You'll see my anxiety getting dismissed 

If someone asks me what have I achieved 

I can proudly say "i defeated GAD!"
