iTâ€™S tIMe tO StOP. Fellas, is having problems sexist?

I was in English class and at some point, I made a remark saying, â€œIf women can have problems, so can men.â€

Immediately the class feminists go freaking CRAZY talking about how is the most sexist thing theyâ€™ve heard. I thought Iâ€™d hafta listen to some entitled Karens say I donâ€™t know my place, but immediately after they start screaming their bullcrap, every single other student nearby, even ones in the DAMN HALLWAY began siding with me saying what I said should be acknowledged.

Needless to say, the bois (and some of the girls) were there to support us when we said that.

Letâ€™s normalize the fact that men should be equal to women, and vice verse. If women can have problems, so can men. Iâ€™m saying this here because Reddit can sympathize... right?
