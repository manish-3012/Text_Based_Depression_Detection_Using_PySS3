how do i communicate my feelings so last night my boyfriend and i were supposed to sleep together like we do every night, but he ended up â€œfalling asleep earlyâ€ and i understood ofc so i let him be. but then i wake up in the middle of the night and go to instagram and see heâ€™s posted something on his story. 

iâ€™ve been very paranoid of him talking to other girls only because i have past experiences that make me paranoid about these type of things, but he calls me this morning and weâ€™re just talking and then an awkward silence occurs and i hang up because i was overwhelmed and canâ€™t stand to think iâ€™m on the phone with him when he is talking to other females.

so after an hour or so i send him the pictures i took of myself earlier yesterday, because he had asked for them before, and he complements me and tells me i look way too good. i was expecting a â€œgood wow baby you look gorgeousâ€, just so i could forget about about my paranoia. i reply â€œthanksâ€and he says â€œnot that dry ass thanksâ€

i just said thanks, because i felt like i needed to treat him how he treats me, but now i donâ€™t know how to tell him that i think heâ€™s not in love with me. iâ€™m thinking of apologizing but i always say sorry for such stupid shit.

anyways what do you guys think i should say in response to â€œnot that dry ass thanksâ€; something that can allow me to talk about how i feel (bc iâ€™m bad at that)
