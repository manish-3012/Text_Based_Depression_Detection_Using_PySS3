Parents need to stop blaming pUbeRtY for everything. Iâ€™m just trying to enjoy my soup, but out of nowhere my mom starts filming me. Thatâ€™s just awkward af so I tell her to stop. She doesnâ€™t so I walk away and she yells pUberTy. Sheâ€™s been blaming puberty a lot today actually. 

Just because weâ€™re teenagers and have our own fucking opinion or feelings doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not actually what we mean and itâ€™s always just puberty. 

Besides, if thereâ€™s one way to annoy and offend someone, is blame puberty and act like it means nothing. 
Iâ€™m just trying to peacefully have lunch, nobody will care about a video of me consuming soup later.
