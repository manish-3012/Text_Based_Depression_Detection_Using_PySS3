Me Vs my girlfriend when planning our 6 month anniversary... Me: We could do something nice? There's a new cafe  open in the next town over, the menu looks quite nice?

Her: Oh, why don't we get forks, by like one of those birthday cakes in the supermarket, and just eat it between the two of us?

I love her so damn much.
