Need some advice There's this girl in my class who i have a crush on and i'm pretty sure she knows about it because two of my friends allegedly told her about it. But then, pretty much outta nowhere, she starts looking at me from a distance, or moving to spots closer to me. 

So i need advice. What should i do?
