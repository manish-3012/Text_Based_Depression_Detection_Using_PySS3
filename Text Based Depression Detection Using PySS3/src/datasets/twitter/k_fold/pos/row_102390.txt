Dealing with my first breakup, donâ€™t feel anything anymore My gf of like six months. in the last three months of our relationship i started to feel emotionless and i shared this with her but she couldnâ€™t help. donâ€™t get me wrong, she was a great person to date, i just stopped feeling emotions beside sadness and anger. 

pm me, spam the comments, idc anymore
