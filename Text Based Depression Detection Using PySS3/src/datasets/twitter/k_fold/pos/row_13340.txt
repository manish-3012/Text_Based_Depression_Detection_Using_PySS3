how do you kindly tell someone who takes hours to respond to stop talking to me My  little sisters best friend found my snapchat and she texts me first and i respond as soon as i see the notification and mid conversation she wont even day brb or anything she will respond after a few hours or the next day like bruh if you are gonna take that long to go you dont have to keep on texting me. its mot like shes busy or anything because if she were i wouldnt be mad but she 14 and even if she was busy atleast say something before leaving because its so annoying and i cant ignore her because she lives right next to me
