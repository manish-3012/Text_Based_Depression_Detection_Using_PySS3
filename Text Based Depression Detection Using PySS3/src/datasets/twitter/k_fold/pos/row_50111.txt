Can someone help me out who knows a bit about microsoft word?  So I had an essay for chemistry, no big deal. I did the essay, and submitted it. The problem is that it repeated the first two pages at the end, making it five pages instead of five. So I went back in, was able to select one of the pages and delete it, but the other page wouldn't delete. I looked it up and the Microsoft support page said to do ctrl+shift+8 and put the paragraph marker at 01 pt font. Now there are paragraph markers all over my essay and dots every where too. The page is even still there. Is there a way to un-fuck my essay? I'm new to word so sorry if there is an easy fix!
