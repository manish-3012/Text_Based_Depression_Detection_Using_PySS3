My teacher gave my a B+ in math by 0.8% My math teacher gave me a 83.2% in math and a A- is 84%. When I emailed her to see if I can do some extra credit, she said sure, and when I did that extra credit she wouldnâ€™t accept it because I didnâ€™t show my work. All of the freaking work was supposed to be done on a calculator. So now Iâ€™m here with a b+ and my gpu is barely off from what I need it to be so I can get an engineering scholarship.
