I'm not too well versed in sexual orientations and gender identity So my partner is non binary and they said that if I identified as straight them they would be a girl. I don't want them to feel like that so I need some help. I really don't know how I feel about my orientation so I was thinking, how about I identify as nothing, not straight, gay, or anything else. Is there a term for this or.... can someone explain?
