I think my dad died in front of my mom and I Today, as every Saturday, the three of us were watching a movie, suddenly my dad asked for a bowl. We had all been diagnosed with Coronavirus earlier this week, so we were isolated. We were watching the movie, and he asked for a bowl because he thought he was going to vomit. We gave him the bowl, and he almost immediately dropped it. His face turned purple and his eyes rolled back into his head and his tongue stuck out. He had stopped breathing. He sat like this for a few seconds before waking up to us yelling at him to wake up. He has returned to â€œnormalâ€ and we sent him to the hospital to get proper treatment. This is the most scared Iâ€™ve felt in a long time, and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m more worried about him than anything else. Any advice would be appreciated.
