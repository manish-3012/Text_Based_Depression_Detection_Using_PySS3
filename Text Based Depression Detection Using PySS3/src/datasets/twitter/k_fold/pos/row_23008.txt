I think I know why 2020 is soo cursed I believe that 2020 is bad because it's a leap year, don't believe me? Let's look at some other leap years.

2016: we all know how bad 2016 was

2012: when the world was supposed to end

2008: great financial crisis

2000: Y2K

1992: Soviet Union collapsed

It's the curse of leap years
