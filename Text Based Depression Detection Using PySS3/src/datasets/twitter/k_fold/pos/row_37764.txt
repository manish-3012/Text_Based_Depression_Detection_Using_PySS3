He is watching. He is always watching Now you should run. Evilness is upon. Very dreadful stuff. Eery silence. Random stuff. Ghouls. Owl doing whatever noises they make. Nightfall is upon us. Nighttime is scary. All should be afraid. Goblins will be out. Igloos are your only safety. Very creepy. Eagles for whatever reason surrounding you. Yelps for help in the distance. Obey the voice you hear. Ukeleles playing in the distance. Umbrella is protecting you from the rain. People burning the forest around you 

(No hidden message here folks. What am I doing with my life?)
