My mum was a Super Villain when she was a child So we were having dinner as usual same old same old, then I thought I do pretty stupid things at this age I wonder what my parents did. So i asked my parents what stupid things did u do as a child my dad did not have much to say but my mom ohh she's a different breed 

I quote "I fed children my age dragon flys" my jaw legit dropped and my reaction is wtf. I ask how she said she caught them wrapped them in paper and placed them in a fire until the paper was cahred of and she would remove the bits of remaining paper. She would make them in to bits and when she gave them to her friends she told them it was a cute to night urine I call it. Basically stops u peeing in bed. AND THEY KNEW IT WAS DRAGON FLY. She says no one has died.

I'm scared guys
