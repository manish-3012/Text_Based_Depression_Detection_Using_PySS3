Anyone else prefer to have friends of the other sex but not in a romantic/sexual way? I've always preferred to have girl-friends rather than dude's. It's not for a sexual or romantic reason (unless we like each other) but I just find them easier to talk to and I vibe with them a lot more than (most) dudes. Any girls prefer being friends with dudes or vice versa?
