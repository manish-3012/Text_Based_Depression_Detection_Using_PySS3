National Academy of Future Physicians and Medical Scientists Hey, I'm kinda just looking for some people. The title was an event that is available to a select few US students (including Puerto Rico from what I can tell).

The hosts disabled the chat before we were able to make a discord together. Just wanted to see if zo can reach out to them. I don't wanna send the link just in case some people aren't actually apart of it, just wanted to see if I could find some of you guys.
