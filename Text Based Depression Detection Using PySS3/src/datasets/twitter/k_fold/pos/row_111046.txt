Bruh I just said bye to my best friend because Iâ€™m leaving for college tomorrow Holy shit saying goodbye really hurts 

Plus, she revealed that her mom said to â€œnot come home for thanksgiving,â€ meaning I will not be seeing my best friend during fall break. Iâ€™ll most likely not see her until spring break. Like damn Iâ€™m so fucking sad.
