Fortnite isnâ€™t a bad game I feel like this has to be said, because I see SO many karma farmers posting memes that include the word â€œFortniteâ€ and associate it with something bad. Fortnite is not a bad game at all. Iâ€™ve played it a few times, and itâ€™s actually pretty fun. The problem is the fanbase. The reason Fortnite became so hated is because of the thousands, heck, probably even MILLIONS of kids in the fanbase worldwide that are toxic, curse in every single sentence, and are NEVER satisfied with anything. In fact, Iâ€™m gonna say it. If I had a decent computer that could run Fortniteâ€™s graphics, I would probably play it quite often and run solos only.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
