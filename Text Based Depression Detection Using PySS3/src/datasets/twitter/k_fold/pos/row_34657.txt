Iâ€™m not a furry anymore Before yâ€™all start with the â€œgoodâ€ or some other stupid â€œthey boysâ€ comments just shut your mouth for 4 seconds. I will still admire the fandom from afar and still enjoy my favorite furry tubers. I just wonâ€™t be active anymore. 

Itâ€™s not because of the hate, I already get more hate for some other things. Iâ€™ve just met some toxic people within the fandom and had some interesting interactions. As a (former) Deer, i would have wolfs talking about hunting me, that kinda scared me. 

Besides that, Iâ€™ve just grown apart from it. I wonâ€™t forget that good times I had and all the support Iâ€™ve gotten. When my siblings were in the hospital almost at their last breath the community made me smile when I thought I couldnâ€™t.

Thank you, and goodbye (to the furries on this sub)
