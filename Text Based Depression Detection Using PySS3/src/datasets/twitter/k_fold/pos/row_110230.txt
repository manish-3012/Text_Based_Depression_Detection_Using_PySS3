i am so pissed at myself so my gf started college today. All fine and good, i woke up early to try and say good morning to her before she left (through text, she lives far away from me). I woke up and put deodorant on, washed my face, all that morning stuff. I hope on discord at 5:45 cuz that's where we always text, and she's literally left 2 minutes before i could get on.

Her fucking mom is always so early for everything and made her leave the house an hour and 15 fucking minutes before class starts. So it was a complete fucking waste for me to get up. Why the fuck do i even try. 

Now i won't be able to text her til probably 5 this afternoon cuz she's loaded with stuff at the college and i'm loaded with stuff at home. Somebody kill me, pls.
