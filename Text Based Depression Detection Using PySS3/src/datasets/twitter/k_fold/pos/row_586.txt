The whole girls looking for another girl to date but settling for a depressed gamer boy meme is painfully true and it just makes me feel like a second option Every girl Iâ€™ve(19m) talked to recently has usually been a bisexual who was mainly looking for a girlfriend but settled for talking with me. One of them even said this themselves. Itâ€™s a pretty big meme too and Iâ€™ve noticed thereâ€™s loads of it on TikTok too

I hate it. Because it literally just makes me feel like another option to people. As if the girls Iâ€™ve talked to have only liked me because Iâ€™m available and give them attention while they wait for someone better, preferably a girl, to show up.
