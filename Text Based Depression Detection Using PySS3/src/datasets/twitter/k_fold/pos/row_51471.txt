My school was doing fun dip like cocaine About a year ago my friend asked one of his friends out as a joke, he used candy, she thought he was serious and said no without taking the candy, so he had some left over. At lunch he passed it out to our table. Everyone getting a fun dip and a skittles. So my good friends, lets call him Tom, decided to snort the fun dip through his nose. Note: The fun dip looks like blue or red cocaine.  He coughed hysterically. For some reason, everyone at the table followed suit. It was a cough fest. Now, Tom decided to take the stick part and crush it, making it look like actual cocaine. And of course, he snorted it. After that he felt light headed and went to the nurse. Now our table looked like coke heads den. None of us wanted to clean it up and somehow, I was force to clean it up and get rid of it. so i put the fun dip fragments on a lunch tray, walk to the trash can, right next to the lunch monitor and PRINCIPLE, and get rid of the white dust covered tray. Then, my heart stopped, my lunch monitor started talking to me. I dropped the tray in the trash can, said i had a headache, went to the nurse and went home. I WAS FREE. I met Tom at the nurse and he was fine, he went home but was back the next day. Moral of the story, DON'T ~~FUCK~~ING SNORT FUN DIP.
