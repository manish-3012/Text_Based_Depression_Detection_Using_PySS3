Just wanna talk about something unimportant I had a gamecube once when I was younger. I had some games for it, most sucked, but it got me through the time where the next most interesting thing for me to do was "fish" for necklaces that I had on the floor, using some plastic hangers. 

There was one game that I really liked though, SSX Tricky. I sometimes still get the urge to play it.

When I moved away from that area, my mom convinced me to give away my gamecube in the move. 

I'm not sure how to feel about that to this day. I sorta wish that I kept it, but the person who got it probably enjoyed it more than I did, or would have if I kept it?

It's strange to me, being bothered about something like that, from so far in the past.
