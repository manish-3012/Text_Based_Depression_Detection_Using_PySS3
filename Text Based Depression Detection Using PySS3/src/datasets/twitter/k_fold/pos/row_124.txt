If you like reading manga, I started a Manga/Lightnovel reading club on Discord. Would anyone like to join?  Hi, I had an idea to start a server for teens like me who enjoy reading manga or lightnovels. My idea is, we vote on manga to read, and we read and discuss the series together. I also have various discussion channels ranging from manga, light novels, manwhas, gaming, anime, etc. If you would like to join or want to know more details, just shoot me a message. (Only teenagers)
