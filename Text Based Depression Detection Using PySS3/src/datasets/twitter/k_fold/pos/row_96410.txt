Stop posting about someoneâ€™s death. 
I know this might be a little controversial and I might get downvoted to oblivion. 

Almost every day, I see a post about the death of a very close person to someone. There are people who just do it for karma and awards, and others who just fake it. But for those who actually may experience that, please stop. 

Not only are there edgy teens in this sub, whoâ€™ll make you feel bad by giving you certain awards like the â€œIâ€™m Deceasedâ€ award or the â€œWholesomeâ€ award. Some people take it to the next level in the comments. 

Secondly, why canâ€™t you have a little bit of discretion for that person who has died? I think itâ€™s a little bit of disrespectful to let thousands of people know about someoneâ€™s death. I personally wouldnâ€™t like anyone to post anything about my death. 

By the way, Iâ€™m not shaming on anyone who has done it. If you are seriously looking for people to talk to when having a hard time after someoneâ€™s death, go ahead, post about it. But if you deep inside your heart know that it might be for awards and karma, then please donâ€™t do it.
