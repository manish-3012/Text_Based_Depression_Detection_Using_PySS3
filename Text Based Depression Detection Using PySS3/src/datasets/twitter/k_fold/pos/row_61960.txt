Today was good Today I woke up at 10:00 AM, ate pancakes for dinner and planned out a rear suspension technique for my Silverado moc. After that lunch came around and I watched a car show with my dad for a bit then I played Forza for an hour. After that I had an ortho appointment, I was expecting to finally get my braces off but no a son of a bitch gap appeared and now I have two power thingys. After that my dad and siblings picked me up, I saw a Maserati Ghilibi on the road today and later I learned my family saw a newer ACURA NSX on the road, to bad there was no picture. We later got home and I took my Camry for a spin, itâ€™s been sitting in the garage for two weeks until today. I pulled it out and cleaned the seats, then I found some sticky shit Iâ€™ve never seen before in the back seat cup holders. This pissed me off because Iâ€™ve never broughten any candy or sweets in my car EVER, so I spent 15 minutes cleaning that mess. After that I drove my baby with the moon roof down the neighborhood twice. My second lap around I think I pissed off a Karen because this lady was looking at me pissed off. I later got back home and ate dinner. I ate chicken soup because my braces were starting to hurt then I studied some more for my math exam tomorrow and then worked out. I did a 5 minute warm up, 20 minute total body and 10 minute upper body work out video. I also did 20 pull ups and 50 pushups today. After all that I showered and watched some top gear then went to bed. Now I wake up an hour later feeling VERY hot and then I try to go back to bed but have no success. 

So how was your day?
