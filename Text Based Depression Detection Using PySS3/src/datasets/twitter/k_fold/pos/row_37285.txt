Hey guys I need some help here Guys I know it's long but please read it


So I really liked this girl and I finally got the courage to ask her out. She said yes so I told one of my best friends. So even he started talking to her just like that and guess what he started liking her.

So what that asshole did is stated telling her that I wanted to break up cause she was taking to much of my time but I was so happy with her.

So she broke up with me. At first I didn't understand wat happened so I made a fake account to talk to get as a friend and she said how much she hated me because of what my best friend told her.

I was so fucking losers and angry I confronted my friend and he and I aren't friend anymore.

But she still hates me so much and I liked her soo much and I was so happy
I don't know what to do
