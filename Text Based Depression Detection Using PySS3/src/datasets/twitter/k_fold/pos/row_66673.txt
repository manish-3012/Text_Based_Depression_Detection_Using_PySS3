Thereâ€™s this girl I like At my high school thereâ€™s this girl I like.  Sheâ€™s really nice and I love her personality and everyday I try and make her laugh. When she laughs it makes my day. I really want to ask her out but Iâ€™m scared that she will not want to be friends with me if she says no. Any advice?
