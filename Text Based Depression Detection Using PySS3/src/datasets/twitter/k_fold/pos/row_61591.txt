I can't go to sleep at night without drugs to take me there. I hate myself. I hate every inch of every fibre of my being, and I'm the only one to blame for it. I take 20-30mg or more of valium alongside alcohol so I can go to sleep at night. If I don't I stay awake all night unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling.

Don't get involved with drugs to get you to sleep, these fuckers are the devil in a blue dress.
