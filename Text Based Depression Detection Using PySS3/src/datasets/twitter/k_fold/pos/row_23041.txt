I think there will be a Democrat and Republican civil war. Let me explain yesterday by the time of this posting yesterday a huge group of trump supporters broke into the Capitol building and wrecked the inside of it. And of course they were easily able to get through to the Capitol building protesting and doing everything a protester one but that makes me wonder will there be a civil war and I think there will be because if Trump were to win the election the Democrats would be doing the same thing.
