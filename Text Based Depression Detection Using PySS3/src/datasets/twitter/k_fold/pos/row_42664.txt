It's such a small, small world. Alright this all starts back in january, someone messaged me on a minecraft server i was playing on and we started to voice call on discord. He was pretty chill to hang out with and frankly he was super friendly too. We talked for 8 months every other day for about 2 or 3 hours each time. Our record call time was i think 14 hours overnight. I enjoyed his company and hopefully the other way around too. For 8 months we talked without ever even knowing each others names until we got to talking about how shitty our schools are. Little did i know, he only lives less than 3 hours away from me. I thought that was pretty cool but we decided to show each other our schools on google maps and such and he points out that he feels like hes been to my school before. His dad got called in and he confirmed that they had been to my town. Note: my town is by no means a sight to be seen at all its a very small town of less than 5k people with no real reason to be known. Turns out his aunt is a teacher at my school and he visits this place every couple years or so. I didn't have her as a teacher but i definitely knew who she was. Fast forward when we were talking about his school, as crazy as it is, i have been to his town too (it was a little bigger of about 40k people but still not a crazy place). My family went on vacation there about 3 years ago so thats pretty cool. Its just so crazy to think that on a complete worldwide minecraft server of 2000 people, this one guy lives very close to me and visits my town every so often. Its such a small world.
