Should a high schooler have device restrictions? My mother set up some family thing from Apple that forces me to send requests when I want to download apps. In addition to this, she set up screen time, which shuts down all my apps so that I have to send a request to use them. Furthermore, she turns off my wifi at 10pm. 
 
Do you think this is reasonable? 
  
Yes, I am a studious person, Iâ€™m just bad with time management. Hereâ€™s the thing, I know when I have to work and I complete it. 

I know I sound like a whiny baby, but itâ€™s So. Damn. Annoying. 

Anyways, what are your thoughts? Do you think sheâ€™s right?
