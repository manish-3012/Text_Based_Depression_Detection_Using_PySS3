This is a follow-up post. So earlier today my crush came, we work for some time on the project *(for those who were asking it's about the yellow jacket protest in France)* , once we finished we had a drink and talked, I asked her to the movies, she smiled and said: "I'll think about it". 
We then continued to talked, so does this means yes, is this a polite way of saying no, I'm confused.
