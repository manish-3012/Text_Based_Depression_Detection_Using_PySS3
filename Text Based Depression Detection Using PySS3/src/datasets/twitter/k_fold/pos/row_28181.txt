Coming out to my parents AKA the most awkward moment of my life So, a while ago I made the mistake of telling my parents that I'm bisexual. HUGE mistake on my part.

First for context, I gave them a little test a few years prior when I started to realize I was also attracted to the same sex. I asked both on separate occasions; "Would you still love me if I were gay?"

To her credit, my mother seemed kinda surprised but smiled and told me that of course she would still love me. My dad on the other hand answered "I would still love you if you had cancer, wouldn't I?" For what it's worth, I think what he meant to say was that he would love me even for something that was out of my control.

When I actually told them a while ago that I was bisexual and seeing a guy, they kinda lost it. Before I knew it I was getting asked questions like "How many guys have you had sex with?", "You mean you're gay?", "Have you never slept with a girl?", "What do you think *turned* you bisexual?" and "But you don't know *for sure, right?*" ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸

At one point my dad even laughed cause he assumed that I was joking. My mother also insinuated that I was just going through a phase. 

When I took it a step further and told them that I was seeing someone, from that point onward they only ever referred to him as "my friend". They continuously said that I should "trust them" and that I would "grow out of it"

To this day I make it a point of avoiding any discussion that involves my sexuality with them like the plague.
