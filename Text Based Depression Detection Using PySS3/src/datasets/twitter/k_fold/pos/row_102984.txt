Well it's been a while since i was last here and let me tell you all what stories i have to tell Well since i don't like letting you all wait im gonna start with the most interesting thing. My Depression got worse again and well... does anyone of you remember the study which stated that people can die from just being sad? I proofed that... kinda. Ok so i didnt die (duh) but it was very very close. Basically i was having a really shit night and thought "If noone knows what happens after someone dies then there's just as much a chance of me being isekaid than there's of just nothing happening other than me not existing anymore, so dying is even more chill than i thought". Realizing that, my body and brain got together and were like "yeah that's a good enough reason to die" and i promptly stopped breathing, yeah, until i fell unconscious. I awoke a little while later (still night) i still couldn't breathe and after almost falling unconscious again i got a good load of puke out of my body and from there i could breath again. Ironically me almost dying wasn't the part that annoyed me but rather that it for some reason gave me stomach aches. Like, really bad ones. That's also why i missed school this week.

Ok... what else. Ah yes, the 2 other attempts of taking my life this month left me in a pretty weak state. On a bad day it's even pretty hard just to walk. Not because my legs are broken or anything, but because my body has to use all of its energy regenerating me and trying not to fucking die of sadness again (atleast thats what i think).

The rest of the last month either falls into the above two categories or is me helping my friend in terms of love, but for his sake i won't tell those stories.

So yeah know it's your turn. What's up? What did i miss?

Oh btw i had to rewrite this text 4 times now because the automod sees me dying as an insult.
