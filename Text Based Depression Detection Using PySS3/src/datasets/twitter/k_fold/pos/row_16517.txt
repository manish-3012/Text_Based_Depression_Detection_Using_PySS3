advice on my boyfriend from a guys perspective? i havenâ€™t seen my boyfriend for 2 weeks now because heâ€™s having issues with him mum. he spends the weekends at his dads house he gets pissed off with her and stuff like that. 

for the whole week i was planning to see him, and i thought that he felt the same and wanted to see me too because we didnâ€™t see eachother last weekend (we normally see eachother every weekend) but only today he told me â€œwe probably canâ€™tâ€ because only now has he decided to go over to his dads because he got mad at his mum again. 

i bet if his friend came over for a sleepover at his house itâ€™d be completely different, even if he was mad at his mum. 

also please donâ€™t comment â€œWeLl Iâ€™m In QuArAnTiNe i havenâ€™t seen my s/o in months!!!â€ because yes i know itâ€™s difficult, but if you were in my situation iâ€™m sure youâ€™d at least be a bit sad.
