Current vibe: Getting a video game youve lowkey wanted for about 8 months but couldn't get til now and then you play a few rounds, find out you are lowkey awful at the game, even in the noobs category of play, but still will continue to play the game because you've wanted this for 8 months and you ain't giving up after 30 minutes of play.

Also lowkey your friends thinking you wouldn't like the game but you're too scared to say that you've actually wanted to play for a while and if you play with them, just act like you're just playing for fun.
