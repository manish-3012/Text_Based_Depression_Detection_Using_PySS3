I canâ€™t live like this anymore I feel awful, I almost always feel awful. I have diagnosed body dysmorphia (BDD) and itâ€™s breaking me down and slowly killing me. Iâ€™m trying to hold on so much but I just canâ€™t anymore, I hate everything about myself and Iâ€™ve done everything I can to stop the feelings from coming through but they are overwhelming. On top of this, my mother doesnâ€™t help the situation. She knows about my body dysmorphia but she doesnâ€™t understand how to make it better. I think sheâ€™s trying but she just doesnâ€™t get it. Whenever Iâ€™m feeling particularly down about myself and it shows, she gets extremely annoyed with me. Eventually if I donâ€™t suck it up sheâ€™ll get really angry and half shout at me. She calls me selfish and narcissistic for obsessing about how I look but itâ€™s out of my control. I need help but she wonâ€™t get me it. The worst part is Iâ€™m starting to believe what she says, which is what pushes me to my breaking point. Adding â€œnarcissistâ€ to the list of things I hate about myself worsens my self confidence even further. Iâ€™m scared things are going to get even worse, I donâ€™t want to make a habit of self-harm but when I went upstairs to my room today I was so frustrated I dug my nails into my neck and now Iâ€™m bleeding. I barely regret doing it.
