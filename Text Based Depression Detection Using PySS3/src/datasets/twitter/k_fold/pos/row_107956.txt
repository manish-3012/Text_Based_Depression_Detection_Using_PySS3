Is there really a need to care much about politics when youâ€™re not old enough to vote? So this question is more geared towards Americans due to the extreme polarization of the country right now. 

My parents seem to almost be offended that I didnâ€™t really care when they told me who Biden chose as his VP. I said that I really donâ€™t have much of a need to know the details right now, especially considering that I wonâ€™t even be able to vote by the time the election comes around. I get that itâ€™s important, but especially right now when you literally cannot get away from politics no matter where you go, Iâ€™m really just not interested. While my parents and I both hope Biden wins, I donâ€™t really know what they want me to do. Post a picture of him on my Snapchat story to show all of my other friends that canâ€™t vote that I support him? 

I really just want to know if this is common for American teens, my parents seem to think otherwise.
