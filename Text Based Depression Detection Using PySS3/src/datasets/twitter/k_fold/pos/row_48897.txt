Friend need therapy but Mom says sheâ€™s faking Hey guys so my friend is going through a lot of hard stuff right now, and she needs help, I know she needs help, I really just want whatâ€™s best for her but she has unhealthy ways of coping with the stuff sheâ€™s going through (mainly alcohol use) we are both teenagers and when I told her to talk to someone she can trust about it or talk to a therapist as a healthier way of dealing with it she said her mom said sheâ€™s faking it and wonâ€™t let her talk to one, Iâ€™m genuinely lost and have no idea how to help her. Will someone help me help her?
