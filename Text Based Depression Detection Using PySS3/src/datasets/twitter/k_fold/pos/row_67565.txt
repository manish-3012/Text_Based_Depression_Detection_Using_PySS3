I just found out that one of the local grocery stores near me sells croissants for literally 35 cents a piece And theyâ€™re good croissants too. The also sell ham and cheese ones for like 70 cents Which is still hella cheap

Why did i not find out about this earlier?  I can actually get 10 croissants for 3.50â‚¬ and i havenâ€™t been doing that? Wasted opportunities smh.

And yes i did buy lots of croissants Upon finding this out.
