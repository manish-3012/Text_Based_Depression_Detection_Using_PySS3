My mom hates me for being quiet Today she asked me why Iâ€™m being so quiet lately (Iâ€™ve just rly been stressed and spring break just started so Iâ€™m getting some time to myself to take care of mental health) and I just said I donâ€™t know - Iâ€™m just tired. 

Then she started to say how Iâ€™m selfish and barely talk to her about anything. I told her all she cares about is my studying (she rly knows nothing abt my other side of life) 

Is it normal to not be talking to my parents for a while?? Iâ€™m just so tired and idk what to do bcz sheâ€™s mad at me now
