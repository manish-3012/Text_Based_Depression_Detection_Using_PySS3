Things are getting better! Ive been feeling like shit since the summer and to sumarize it, im having a existencial crisis and some times I even felt kind off suicidal. But I think I've found my reason to live. A girl, a girl very different, yet very similar to me. Shes funny and harsh and I really like that about her. She makes me forget what I constantly feel and she's what makes me happy. The thing is, I'm scared to blow it when we meet up, because we still only talk throw text and voice messages. I'm a very shy guy and shes a very extroverted person.
