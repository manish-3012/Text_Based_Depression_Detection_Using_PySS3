Starting tomorrow, I will try my hardest to lose weight I am 15 and need to lose weight fast because my life is literally on the line. Everyday, Iâ€™m gonna take a picture and check the progress over time. Obesity has been a problem since I was young (7-8?). I am going to control how much I eat, when I eat, what I eat, etc. I may walk depending on the weather.
