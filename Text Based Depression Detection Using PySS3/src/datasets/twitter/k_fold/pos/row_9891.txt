I'm gonna need some help figuring out where to get the TLSAE Course/Permit Exam in Florida. Looked on Florida's official DMV website really want to get my permit. Would hate to do the test in person honestly I just have social anxiety. I really don't want to pay 40$ to take the test and drug course either. Can anybody help me with this that has received their permit. I'm 16 years old and I have been in and out of rehab's for 6 monthes. I haven't taken the permit exam as I was actively abusing drugs for a very long time. I have done research as to the requirements in my state. 

I just need a valid and reasonably priced provider of such exam/course to get my TLSAE Course and the Online Permit Exam that is a valid certification to the Standards Of The Florida DMV. 

My main intentions are getting my license before the age of 18 year's old. I will appreciate any help provided.
