Godforsaken heck house full of baboons badly mimicking what parents may be like I hate my parents. My living situation isn't that bad compared to others that I've seen. My mom and dad are drunk right now and when my mom gets drunk she gets more cocky.
     Just now she tried picking a fight with me, her 13 year old child. Im abt to cry cuz she literally called me fat and went to the bathroom, I was in the way and when I went to move I slightly touched her elbow with my hand. She had a heavy jacket on so if I were to hit or push her it wouldn't have done much. After I did that, she turned to me and asked if I wanted to fight. Then when she returned she proceeded to tell me that I was the one who is supposed to teach her and my younger brother. IM 13!! As she left for the garage she called me a moron.
     My family is ducked cuz of my parents and we have no outlets for our emotions(ex. no venting). We are never affectionate and my dad makes me EXTREMELY uncomfortable bcuz when I was younger(9-11) he used to walk by slap me in an inappropriate area(a#s). I always asked him to stop but it took him a very long time to, he did the same to my older sister when she was younger too. My mom is just rlly mean cuz she yells at me whenever I have a panic attack or sensory overload. My older is autistic and also has a lot of panic attacks and sensory overload too and she does the same thing but with my dad who will hit him sometimes. I have 3 siblings and only one MAY turn out okay-ish (younger brother) and if I were ever to tell anybody abt this idrk what they would do. Cuz if they found out I fear they might scream and hit me like when I was younger. 

    What do I do?!?
