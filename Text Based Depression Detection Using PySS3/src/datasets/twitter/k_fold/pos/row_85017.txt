Should I text her? Hello people of this subreddit, I need help. The reason I'm asking the ''internet people'' and not my friends is because I don't have many of them. Everyone has crush on someone and so do I, but last time I texted my crush, well, it was a long time ago and it was something I regret a lot. I am worried about our relationship, but I have not enough courage to text her right now, because my ego is practically non-existing and she has crush on my best friend. They are almost best friends, but I am trying to be positive, but as I told you already, I haven't enough courage to text her or call her and I'm not in the best mood these days. I'm not asking for support, but for some good tips how to start a good conversation or something. 

P.S. I know noone cares about my bad mood, but that is not the point of this post. sometimes this post doesn't make sence, so sorry abot that.  Also sorry for my bad grammar xd
