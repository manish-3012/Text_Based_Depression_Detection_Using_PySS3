I just want to kill myselg My physco mom is a bitch I HATE HER. All the time it's someone elses fault never hers there is always an excuse all the time every time and today i have had it. I get home from school today and i imeadtly go to my room and spend time with MY DOG shadow not her dog MY FUCKING DOG. So i begin playing minecraft trying to stop stressing and i decide I decide to play fortnite on the ipad my DAD bought me not her. I was at 123 ping and my data runs out fair enough (I have been using my data this hole month whenever i want to play fortnite as to not inconviece anyone, even though we have turns on the internet (i get 2 hours my sister does and Matthew we have this dumb rule where Grandpa and my mom can be on the internet whenever but my sister Hannah abuses this all the time with the aid of my mom). I. ask them to please finish up that episode of netfix as this is the first time i have ever been on this low ping, calls me an asshole and thay I'M LOOKING FOR A FIGHT. What ever the episode is 30 min left so i say please just get off and i get yelled at INFRONT OF MY DAMN DOG WITCH I SAY NEVER TO DO. SO I go to my room and block her on Whatsapp then she tells me to go to my grandpa (Who is very hard and at 79 still has a job witch is more than I can say for my mom) (bear in mind the only reason i haven't moved out is becuase i want to be with hime becuase I LOVE HIMAND DON'T want him to die but I have had it at this point so i pack my bags and take all the stuff my DAD BOUGHT and head to leave with my dog Shadow, not appeartnly it's her dog (I have never had my own dog before btw and also they took the ipad that my dad bought away from me so I'm pissed my mom always fights with me and i want to just kill myself before and I have tried before but I saved myself last minute becuase i thought about shadow i already cut my arm now and i want to end it all but I love my grandpa and my dog Shadow i dont know what to do my plan is to take shadow for a walk and not come back but I don't know
