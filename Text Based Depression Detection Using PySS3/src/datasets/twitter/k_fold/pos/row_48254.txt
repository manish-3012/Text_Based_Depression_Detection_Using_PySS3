I have this really shitty skin condition Iâ€™ve gone to the hospital and everything. When I start sweating or when itâ€™s hot or Iâ€™m stressed I get this prickly stingy feeling all over my body. Iâ€™ve gone most of my life thinking this was normal. 

It makes my day to day life pretty miserable tbh. I sort of feel like chuck from better call Saul (not the same symptoms or anything) and I think Iâ€™m going insane. Is my disease actually just a mental disorder? Am I overreacting? 

I even stayed in the hospital for a couple of days but all they found was that I was a little allergic to something in my blood. They gave me medicine thatâ€™s used for people with pollen allergy but the corona thing made it so I couldnâ€™t go back to the hospital since and I havenâ€™t tried the medicine yet either because my mom says I should wait until Iâ€™m active again. 

I donâ€™t want to go outside itching every part of my body. This is mostly a rant and Iâ€™m not expecting anyone to diagnose me or anything but Iâ€™m making this post so I can look back at it.
