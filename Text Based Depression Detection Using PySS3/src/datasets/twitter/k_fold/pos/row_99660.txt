Running shoes are a thing? Boys can you confirm/explain this? My school just sent out a message saying I need to bring running g shoes tomorrow. And yesterday, I saw a guy claim he left his so called " running shoes at home" 
Wtf? Just run,walk, sprint,, jump,, fly,, stab, kill (younglings) in your shoes that you were everyday, and attend weddings and crap in your fancy brown or black shoes??????????
