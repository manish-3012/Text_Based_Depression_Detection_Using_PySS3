*bangs head on wall* my new rat is showing signs of a respiratory 
infection, common in rats, and makes a weird sound when she breathes sometimes. iâ€™m scared to introduce her to my other rats, and if i take her to the vet my dad will find out i got another rat. i donâ€™t think heâ€™d care but i think heâ€™d care i didnâ€™t tell/ask him.
