A poem i made in class, kinda bad, im a little proud, but will accept criticism I walk alone through the city streets early in the morning

 I have this feeling, that is mourning

I stop a while to think to myself

About all my feelings I put upon a shelf

These things I feel make no sense

I guess I am much just too dense

The pain I feel is quite immense

So I ask you ignore me, Ladies and Gents.
