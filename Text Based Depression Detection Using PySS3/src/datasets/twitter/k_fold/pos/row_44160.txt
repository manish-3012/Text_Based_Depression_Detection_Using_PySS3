Just got into my first relationship, feeling like I'm about to have an mental breakdown I've been having a crush on this girl for over a year now, and about six months ago we started talking regularly. It was pretty calm at the start but as time passed we started to grow closer and closer. Today I was at her place and we were cuddling when I made the move to kiss her, which she accepted, and we kissed. Afterwards she asked me to be her boyfriend, which I obviously said yes to. At the time I was as happy as could be but now, about 5 hours later, I'm feeling panicked, stressed and generally absolutely shit. I don't know what to do, I'm genuinely overwhelmed and this relationship thing feels wrong. I don't know why, after all I've been fantasizing about this for ages, and should be happy, no?
I really need some advice from you guys, if you have the time.
Thanks in advance
