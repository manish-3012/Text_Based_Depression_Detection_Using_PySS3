Crush posted on her story but hadnâ€™t responded to my text Not sure if this is even serious or anything but ima just say it anyways.

My crush just posted a picture other and her friends and a boy (probably gay) on her story going on a canal down the river, but sheâ€™s left me on delivered. This might be an F for me and sheâ€™s ignoring me or sheâ€™s just outside and canâ€™t respond, I honestly donâ€™t mind which outcome it it tbh but do you guys think sheâ€™s ignoring me or not?
