story of my love life. =) i met her a couple of years ago at a family event, and we got to know each other. she is the most understanding, wise, and caring person I've ever met in my life. we shared our phone numbers, used to talk about our lives all day. i could feel the connection here, and SHE, one day asked me out. i was dumbstruck at first but deep down i too had something for her soi decided to give it a try. it was a bad decision.
