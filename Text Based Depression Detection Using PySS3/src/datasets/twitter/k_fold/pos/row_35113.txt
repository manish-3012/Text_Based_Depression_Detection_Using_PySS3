I was looking through my gallery the other day and remembered about a certain someone that used to be in my life and got some inspiration to write a song. I hope you all enjoy! Iâ€™m feeling stuck,
My freedom is gone again,
Iâ€™m stuck in this cage,
Filled of constant fear,

My day is starting to end,
But another shall begin,
And the cycle will just repeat,
And as the sun falls and the moon rises,
I see you standing there with the keys,

Now your trying to raise me,
To be your little pawn,
To be able to achieve what you could not,
And to be your punching bag during your drunken rage,

That's why the second you let your guard down,
The second you leave the keys in the door,
I am going to run,
I will run far away,

I will start anew,
A life without fear,
A life without hatred,
A life without you,

And when you lay alone,
And you reach out to me,
To fill the emptiness in your life,
After everyone has left,

I will follow the crowd,
And leave you behind,
In a dark past,
And will follow a new light,

I will have escaped your grasp,
And now with nothing in my way,
I will create my own path,
And I will create my own light
