The depths of the friend zone. Background: I am a straight boy and Iâ€™ve had a HUGE crush on a girl whoâ€™s also straight. I bullied her in preschool but because of my dyslexia I switched to a different school. She ended up going to me new school many years later. Iâ€™ve basically had a crush on her for 5 years. Iâ€™m too young too fully grasp what love is but this is the closest Iâ€™ll get for a bit. 

Onto the point, I texted her after we stopped talking for over a year. This was about 11 months ago. Since then I told her I liked her but then she said she didnâ€™t like me back. She later said she liked me too but thought I was messing with her and she said the ship has already sailed for the time being. I pretended like I also didnâ€™t like her anymore and even said I was kinda joking around but I didnâ€™t say that I never liked her. She now considers me one of her best friends and she tells me about everything. She is such a sweet and tender person. She is unfortunately really depressed and often suicidal. I donâ€™t have the heart to mess up my friendship with her. I hate just being in the friend zone and staring when sheâ€™s in a bra on FT because (ooh did I mention) SHE THINKS IM GAY! I donâ€™t want to ruin my friendship with her but I donâ€™t think my feelings will go away and itâ€™s effecting my mental health. Im looking for advice here. She talks about other boys to be and calls me bro so trust me she isnâ€™t secretly hiding feelings.
