Why do you friends always pick the worst time to call/text me? I'm doing math homework and I get a call, I pick it up and my friend goes "hello there wanna play rocket league?" I'm pooping I get a text from my female friend (who isn't my girlfriend) "hii wanna do some animal crossing?" I'm about to call it a day and then BAM! a party invite.

I can never do anything and I'm starting to think they think I don't like them cause we never do stuff together. I wish they could just know that I'm not making excuses and that I really care about them.

anyway thanks for coming to my rant
