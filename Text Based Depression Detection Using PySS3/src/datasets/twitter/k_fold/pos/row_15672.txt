Im scared i might get sued So a few days i recorded a conversation from a guy which is extremely rude, racist and homophobic. I recorded him saying the n word and other rude stuff. I made a smaller version of the video which u can tell the "real him" and well it did go well (it was unlisted and i only showed to people i know could trust) Everyone tried to tell him hes wrong and stuff and he denied being wrong. 

So the social worker said i could get sued cus of recording with no permission. I understand but i wanted him to change as a person and just talking wouldnt help. He would just say we are wrong. I took it down of course and hopefully i dont get sued cus im 14 and got no money. He knows hes wrong and cried to his parents. Lets hope he actually changes


I meant no harm to him of course just wanted him to be a better person or at least a decent human being which respects people the way they are. 


I do know recording with no permission is illegal but i didnt mean it in a bad way i just wanted to change the way he is.

Do you think i still can get sued even if im in another country as him?
