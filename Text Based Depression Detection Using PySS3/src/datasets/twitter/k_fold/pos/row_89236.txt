Scrolling through memes makes me happier and less depressed. I am feeling very sad lately, but everytime I open Reddit and scroll through memes I smile and get happier.
 
Memes make my depression fade away, make me feel more at ease and relaxed, they make me less anxious and things like that.
 
Maybe it's thanks to Reddit in general, but I really have to thank memes and Reddit for existing. They make me feel better (and so your posts do guys â¤).
 
p.s.: This is my first post here.
