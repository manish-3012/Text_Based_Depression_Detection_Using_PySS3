How do you guys ask strict parents to buy something for you/get permission to buy something? For instance, my birthday is coming up. I want to buy a gift for myself, a thing that i craved for a long time now - i have enough money to buy it myself, saved it up. Its just that my parents are so strict that they dont even let me buy stuff that i want with my own money that i earned. How do you guys politely ask for it?
