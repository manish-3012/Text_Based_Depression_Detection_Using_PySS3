Donâ€™t ever, I repeat, donâ€™t EVER fuck with those school vape/alcohol businesses Maybe I just live in a bad part of town and other schools donâ€™t have these, but I have a friend whoâ€™s a plug. Basically just vapes, cigs, and alcohol in dirty Gatorade bottles. So, the other day Iâ€™m at a spot where some of my friends meet up. He comes in all bruised up. Basically, he was walking home and got jumped by a gang of guys. He wonâ€™t tell us exactly what happened that led this to happen, but he told us it was business related. Stay safe, stay sober. It hurts to see this good kid caught in this mess
