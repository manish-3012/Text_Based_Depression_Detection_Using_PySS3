Best ways to ask someone out? So, long story short, theres this one girl I like and weâ€™re hoping to start hanging out in March, since our parents will have been vaccinated by then.

Iâ€™ve liked her for a bit and would like to try to make a move when we start hanging out again. And thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m stuck.

Iâ€™ve heard a lot of different things, and donâ€™t know what to do. So I though where else would be better than here to get advice.
