Why is life so weird Itâ€™s kinda strange.In my opinion but idk if anyone cares about that and if anyone cares about the words Iâ€™m writing.But if you do care even though you donâ€™t know me donâ€™t know what I have done where I have messed up.Then there is still hope not only for me but for everyone on this planet.Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
