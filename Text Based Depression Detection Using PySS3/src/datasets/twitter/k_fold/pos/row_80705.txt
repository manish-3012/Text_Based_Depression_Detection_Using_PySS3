Guys and girls, how do I know if a guy has a crush on me? So, I think a guy in my class has a crush on me cause someone told me that he did, and we are pretty close friends I'd say. What is the ultimate test by which I can surely tell if this guy has a crush on me?

My friend suggested that when he is offline , I'd text him 'heyy' and if he replies RIGHT AWAY , then he has a crush on me. I tried this and he replied after 2 minutes, what does this mean? I don't wanna embarass myself. I kinda low-key like him, I need advice ASAP
