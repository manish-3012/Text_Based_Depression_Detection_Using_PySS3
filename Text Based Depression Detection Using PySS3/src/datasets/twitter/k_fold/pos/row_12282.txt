I need to vent Today on Reddit somebody posted a poll asking if they should get gta 5 or Minecraft. Someone argued that gta 5 is only filled with microcransactions, and I brought up that it has a good single player too. This person then told me that I had the maturity of a five year old for correcting them. Maybe Iâ€™m overreacting, but I really donâ€™t like being talked down to, especially when I think I handled the situation respectfully.
