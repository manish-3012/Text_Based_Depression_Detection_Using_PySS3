Why is my teacher acting like a passive aggressive middle schooler? Okay so I have my teacher on WhatsApp and WhatsApp has a thingy where you can put a status (it's like an Instagram story, it disappears after 24 hours) and she put the status "when you think you're important to some people" which is classic early teenage years behaviour for when you direct something at a specific someone cos you're in  some sorta feud IDEK
