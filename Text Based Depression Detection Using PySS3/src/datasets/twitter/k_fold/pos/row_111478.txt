Am I the only one? I am so frustrated with myself because I get ridiculously interested in someone (whether it be crocheting, polymer clay, butterfly knives, anything...) then like a week or two later I completely drop it as if it never existed.

Itâ€™s so annoying because I want to get a bass and play it a bunch but Iâ€™m worried that if I spend like $300 on a bass that Iâ€™ll just get bored in like two weeks.

Iâ€™ve thought about getting into hobbies but decided not to because Iâ€™ll wonâ€™t like it in just a little while?

Is there reasoning behind this? Is my brain just stupid and doesnâ€™t understand that just because I know how to make one little fricking thing out of polymer clay that Iâ€™m not the next michelangelo?
