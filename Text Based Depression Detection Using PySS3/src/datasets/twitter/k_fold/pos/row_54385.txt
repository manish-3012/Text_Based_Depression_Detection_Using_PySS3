My boyfriend promised to call me today. Itâ€™s now super late and he hasnâ€™t called me. (And probably wonâ€™t) I donâ€™t even know why I get my hopes up anymore. Iâ€™ve been checking my phone obsessively and have gotten nothing. 

This happens a lot. But rn he canâ€™t even text so calling was more important. I guess he doesnâ€™t want to talk or is too busy for me. I donâ€™t even know why I care.
