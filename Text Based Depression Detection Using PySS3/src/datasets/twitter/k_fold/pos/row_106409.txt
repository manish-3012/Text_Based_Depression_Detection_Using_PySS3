how are my elective choices? required: bible, college writing, honors precalc, health, spanish

electives: ap stats, ap micro+macro, ap chem + lab, band (pass/fail)

so if i stick with this plan, i'll have zero study hall sessions. im debating whether to keep or drop ap stats. though if i drop it, then i'd have 2 study hall sessions and maybe that's a bit excessive?
