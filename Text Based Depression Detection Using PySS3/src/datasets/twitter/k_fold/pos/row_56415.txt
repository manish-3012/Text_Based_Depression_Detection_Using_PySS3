Do You Use a Case on Your Devices? 
I always found myself using a case with my devices. I used to have one for my phone. I have one my iPad. 

I have not used them in about a week, and I have to say that I prefer the experience. 

I needed some filler so the post would not get taken down. 

Do you use a case with your device? Why or why not?
