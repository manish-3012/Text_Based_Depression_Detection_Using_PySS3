Can someone help me find this game I used to play? It was a mobile top down zombie game, just a generic survival. You started out in a city and had to scavenge for stuff. The graphics were just simple shapes. Waves of zombies would come at you in the night. Thatâ€™s about everything I remember from it. Anyone know the name of it?

Sorry for the shitty writing and formatting, on mobile with 2 hours of sleep.
