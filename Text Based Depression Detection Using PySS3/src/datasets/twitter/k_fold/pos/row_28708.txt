ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¶There's some chores in this house,

There's some chores in this house,

There's some chores in this house,

There's some chores in this house

I said, Certified neat

Seven days a week,

Get glass goody

Get out all of those STREAKS!

woo!

Wash it up, then cut the yard,

There's barnacles all on the barge,

Put some soap up on your plates,

Wipe your nose if there's discharge,

Grab the mop, the spill almost dried,

Make sure the beagles inside,

Theres no play with cleaning supplies,

I want you to CLEAN. UP. ALL. THIS. STUFF.

Then go and clean the garage,

Make it clean then make it gleam,

Out in public we're all a team,

Cuz we cook, cuz we clean,

Let me show some good hygieneðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¶
