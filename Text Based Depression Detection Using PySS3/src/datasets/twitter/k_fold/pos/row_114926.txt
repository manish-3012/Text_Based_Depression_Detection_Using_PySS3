I SWEAR IF YOU...  

write ANYTHING on your computer, YOU NEED TO GET GRAMMARLY. I write pretty much ALL DAY *every day* and GRAMMARLY makes my writing better. As a student I like that it's **FREE** It actually is... **correcting** everything as I'm writing it. Grammar errors spelling errors... IT EVEN helps me find the right words to use!! SO I can say what I want to say!! It catches all those *embarrassing* little mistakes BEFORE I HIT SEND!!! I download GRAMMARLY around my freshman year becuase I was just... ï¼¨ ï¼¯ ï¼² ï¼² ï¼© ï¼¢ ï¼¬ ï¼¥... at typing! Grammarly is like my secret weapon for writing papers. It's just the PERFECT tool for your resume, you know you don't want ANY errors when it's your first impression. I use GRAMMARLY for important emails, social media posts (which there are a L O T of.) I've used EVERY TOOL OUT THERE!! And Grammarly is by far the ï¼¢ï¼¥ï¼³ï¼´ for improving your writing. GRAMMARLY is making me a better writer. AND it's free... I would recommend GRAMMARLY if you're a student, my family, my peers, my colleagues, It's like having YOUR OWN personal proof-reader for free.
