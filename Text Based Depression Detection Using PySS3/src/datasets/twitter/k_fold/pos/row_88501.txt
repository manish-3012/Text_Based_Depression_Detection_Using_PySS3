Ugh I tried to use a throw away acc but reddit said it had to low of karma So first off this will be filled with grammar and misspelling and will look like a 8 year old wrote it but Iâ€™m typing on mobile and I tend to type fast but make a TON of mistakes so hereâ€™s my story

So me and this girl dated and it was so amazing we hung all the time and it was just so wonderful but Covid came and we began to self quarantine and then we called and texted but we eventually grew apart ig and I just kept forgetting to text her back each time. And I just kept thinking oh I donâ€™t have to worry Iâ€™m sure Covid will be over soon and then we can hangout all the time . But Covid didnâ€™t go away and then while I was taking a shit I got a text â€œhey we need to talkâ€ so I cleaned up and called her and I got dumped because 

Quarantine kinda made us not so close 
*then the typical breakup lines* 

But yea I was just like oh ok ðŸ‘Œ and then we hung up after the whole ok so do you want me to return the gifts 

*I said keep em cuz idrc*

But I was just like it is what it is when people ask me hey are you ok but in truth I wasnâ€™t to ok ðŸ‘Œ I did get upset *not mad* and I felt a lot of pain in my chest. I messed up in my relationship and it costed me big idk why Iâ€™m just getting so emotional rn  and idk if Iâ€™m a heartless person because thatâ€™s what my mom called me when I didnâ€™t cry or seem to bothered by getting dumped like am I heartless? I didnâ€™t cry or seem to worried on the outside but in the inside I was devastated I felt so idk how to describe it.
and I have gotten better but every now and then she will just pop up back into my mind and Iâ€™m just like damn bruh shits whack 

But this is my story and hereâ€™s my question 

What can I do to make this chest pain go away like what is it? 

Am I heartless because I didnâ€™t seem to show much emotion on the matter on the outside?
