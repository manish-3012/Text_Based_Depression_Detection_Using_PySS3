Controversial post: People born before 2008 understand all of the 2000s stuff. People born after 2008 do not get it. Like, hear me out, Anyone born between 1997 and 2008 understand and get flip phones, the Wii, those bulky laptops, iPods, Wii Sports, and a bunch of other stuff. But, anyone born in or after 2008 just doesn't get it. They were born when smartphones were picking up on popularity, and now, they play Fortnite (haha a reddit moment). 

I mean, anyone over the age of 13 currently understands the 2000s. We understand American Idiot. We understand Move Along. 

Anyone born in or after 2008 just doesn't get it.
