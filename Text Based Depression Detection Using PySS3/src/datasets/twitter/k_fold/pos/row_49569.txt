Fandom review: Episode 8 the star wars fandom (f) Note: NO LONGER LISTING EPISODES AS OF 2/23 CHECK OUT THE REST AT MY PROFILEfandom reviews belongs to u/sincyd06you can share but NOT steal my reviews

thank you!

part 1: star whores: the revenge of the sluts (if your in the r/teenagers discord then u might get this ref)

the 1977 movie star wars was a big hit in america causing sequels to be made and also made companys such as Mattel rich and popular because of there star war's toys.

did the fandom ever succeed just like the movies??

part 2: the pain.

reylo/relo/rayload shippers. one of the most toxic ship since fucking steve x creeper

its just...why?

I get you like them together but YOU DONT NEED TO ATTACK ME FOR NOT LIKING IT???&gt;!star wars r34 ashoka fucking exists !&lt;

the star wars fandom is pretty fucking stupid. agree? the toxic shield around the fandom ruins what star wars was to me. I loved the movies but I couldn't get into a conversation without some dumbass talking about how he ships reylo (whatever they call it gaylol) and it was that set of people that made me stop being hyped for star wars movies

currently as of this post. disney will ruin star wars. Not even joking with ya. They will fucking ruin star wars  


I could boast about how EA ruined it but   
THERE RIGHTS GOT TAKEN AWAY HAHAHA NO MORE STAR WARS GAMES YEEEEAAAAA  


until another shitty company takes it of course.  


part 3: conclusions  


is the star wars community good? not really but im still a big fan of the movies, Hell maybe you think the same as me.   


the end  


what fandom i can review next
