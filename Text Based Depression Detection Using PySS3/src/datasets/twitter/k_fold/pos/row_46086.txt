My glasses broke about a week ago and my parents refuse to get me new ones I have really bad vision. Anything over 2 feet away is extremely blurry and I can't see shit without them. My brother broke my glasses last week, and my parents want me to wait til December to get them.

I can't wait that long. I can't see anything, and I'm getting headaches. I was helping my dad in the yard a few days ago, and I twisted my ankles because I couldn't see a brick on the ground. He told me it wasn't that bad, even though I couldn't put weight on my foot, and told me to stop being a girl and help him. 

I have to go to school in a little under a month. Its all virtual, but I cant work if I cant see the screen. I have to do a shit ton of chores and clean stuff, but I can't do that if I can't see the ground when I sweep, or the stains on the dishes, etc. Then I get in trouble for not doing it right.

They want a free pair, so I have to wait til December to get one. I can't wait that long. Money is not an issue, because my mom is in the process of buying hundreds of dollars worth of furniture for the backyard. 

I can't fucking deal with them anymore, but there's nothing I can do about it.
