I had an interesting morning and it wasn't good So my dog is on the road to recovery after a surgery for a torn ACL and recently she had an allergic reaction. She is on a lot of meds and as a result has to go to the bathroom a lot. So around 2-3am my dad opens my door and lets my dog in the bedroom I was half asleep and only heard that he was letting the dog sleep in my room. I woke up at around 6:30 to the sound of my dog peeing on the floor and not just the floor but all over my shoes as well and she also pee'd on my bed. at the time I'm posting this it is 7am and I'm on my sheetless pee stained bed with a plastic bag full of piss napkins on my floor and I'm not taking it out to the trash because I think there is a bear outside. I'm not even mad at my dog I'm just kind of mad at my dad.
