Should I stop talking to my crush if she leaves me on opened? I've been attempting to make friends with my crush and such to get closer to her, but she leaves me on opened. (probably due to me being dry asf) I'm not sure if I should keep trying to talk to her and double text her or whatever or if she's just trying to show that she's not interested.
