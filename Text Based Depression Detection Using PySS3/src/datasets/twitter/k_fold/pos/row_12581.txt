It happened So I liked this girl and she was really cute. Me and her were really good friends for awhile. I was gaining courage to ask her out and i was going to on Friday. Then she ASKED ME OUT!!! It was honestly awesome. Of course I said yes. Now as many of you can probably compare to is that I finally feel happy after awhile.

Sorry for the bad grammar is any.
