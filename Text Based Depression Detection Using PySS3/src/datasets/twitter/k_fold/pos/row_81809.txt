People who call themselves part of the boys Most of this stuff was found on TikTok. The boys are an extremely toxic community and I donâ€™t want to be associated with them. (This does not apply to all boys) Here are many reasons why:

- They will be blatantly racist and homophobic and say â€œitâ€™s dark humorâ€ or will call you a snowflakeâ€
- They mocked Breonna Taylorâ€™s death by playing â€œVibin in the Ritz Carâ€ over a audio that was supposed to commemorate her death. Many comments on the video say things like â€œletâ€™s ask Breonna what she thinks about thisðŸŽ™âš°ï¸
- However when people DANCE to a Juice WRLD song they get all angry because itâ€™s disrespectful despite what commented about Breonna Taylor
- Many of â€œthe boysâ€ have usernames like â€œkill.all.gaysâ€ and â€œgays.have.no.rightsâ€, profile pictures of pride flags crossed out and several comments saying â€œhomophobic and proudâ€
- They openly admit to being misogynistic and sexualize women all the time. They find videos of women showing off their fancy clothes and say â€œfor the boys: pause here.â€ They take pictures of girls and edit the photo just so you can see their boobs. 
- They act like itâ€™s such a terrible thing to support the LGBT community but think itâ€™s normal to be an incel
- They make fun of women being brave enough to share their rape stories
- Whenever a man is accused of rape they immediately point out how itâ€™s probably false. Even though the accusation is made by a girl under 18 who has no benefit of doing so, false accusations are very unlikely, and it would be better to have a potential rapist in jail than a potential liar.
- When women bring up equal rights, the first they jump to is â€œequal rights, equal rights.â€ Like why is that the first thing you think of? I get you should be able to hit a girl back, but they just want to be treated equally and all you want to do is punch them in the face?
- â€œI like gay people I just hate when they make it their entire personalityâ€ Some people have to hide who they are for over 20 years and when they can finally be themselves they get criticized for it? How is that fair?
- If there is a trans woman in the video, someone nice will comment: â€œshe looks so pretty!â€ but all the replies will be the boys saying  â€œhe*â€


There is a new group forming of boys who disagree with most of the issues called the men. I hope many people here realize how toxic the boys have become and how they are not how they used to be.


TL;DR: The boys are a toxic group. Misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and transphobic actions have been witnessed many times by the boys. This does not apply to all boys.
