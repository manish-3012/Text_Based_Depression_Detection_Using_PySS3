I know its late to announce,but Its NNN, the hardest challenge every man must overcome. 
Once a year, 30 days, no Nut. Some say that NNN was cancelled this year, due to all the challanges that 2020 has lobbed our way, and you know what I tell those people...
they are weak, they dont have what it takes to reach purity, they choose the easy path like the cowards they are.
You know, My father told me stories of what happened when you complete NNN succssfully that you transcend for a short while, and within that short while you see the human embodyments of purity and masculinity walk into the sunset, They say its a sight so beautiful that when you think of it it gives you The power to do anything.
And so bois, purity Is the key, se must remain pure and resist the temptations of the female gender although the temptations may be calling you by the name you must stand strong.
Once you complete NNN you will see the face of God and jesus will give you his touch and everything will feel amazing.
So I remind you again my compadres, dont fail this, and we will remain purÃ© together and then in december, with the first snowfall will come The first nut. Goodluck and may God be with Is all.
