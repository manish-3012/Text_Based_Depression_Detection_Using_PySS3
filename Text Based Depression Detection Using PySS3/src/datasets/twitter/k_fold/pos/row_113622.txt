I wrote what I think a person who wants to be a YouTuber must do. Feel free to share your opinions in the comments. # My rules for NewTubers (new Youtubers)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Rules of YT:-**

NO CLICKBAIT

NO CRINGE

NO CRINGY 3AM VIDEOS (seriously, who wants to watch that).

TRY TO BE FACTUAL (don't cheat)

DON'T BE TOO SHOCKED IF YOU HAVE HATERS TRYING TO EXPOSE YOU (as long as you're truthful, you'll be fine).

APOLOGY VIDEOS, IF ANY, MUST NOT BE CRINGY AND OVERLY EMOTIONAL.

TRY TO REPECT YT'S GUIDELINES AND RULES

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

\~Beginner (below 100k)\~

&amp;#x200B;

1. Good mic

2. Good cam

3. Quality content

4. Entertaining personality

5. If Let's Play video, try to also check out not-so frequently played games and also try out games you haven't played.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Considerably Okay (100k-500k)\~

1. If gaming content, try also including other content more than previous(reviews/shorts/anything else) and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Learn what your viewers like more.

&amp;#x200B;

\~Gaining Attention (500k-1M)\~

1. Try to get merch if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Try to make a 'special' video thanking people for 500k subs and maybe add something more to that video.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Try to raise money for charity through different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

\~I'm so proud of you (1M subs and above)\~

1. Congrats, 1M subs. You could create a Subreddit for your viewers and fans and make Reddit review videos from now on (but all of this at your own risk).

&amp;#x200B;

2. If a sponsorship opportunity looks good, grab it.

&amp;#x200B;

3. If you can, invite other YouTubers to appear in your videos (but you must respect their right to not be in your video if they don't want to).

&amp;#x200B;

4. Just don't be a creep.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Don't be too controversial.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you manage to reach Markiplier-level popularity, remember the following:-

&amp;#x200B;

a. There might be people who try to capture your every move; so even if you are alone somewhere, act natural or else things that you don't want to happen might happen.

&amp;#x200B;

b. If you are out in public, try not to do anything controversial. Be smart and natural.

&amp;#x200B;

c. If you can, do comply to anyone who asks for your autograph.

&amp;#x200B;

d. Be friendly.

&amp;#x200B;

e. Don't be surprised if people make memes out of you. All major YouTubers go through that.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck.
