Do yâ€™all ever just wanna go back to being a kid? Itâ€™s my birthday in a few days and my grandpa shows up with an early birthday present (nice card with some cash and baby pictures of me). Before I opened it I talked to him for a couple of minutes, then after he left I opened it then saw the pictures. My first reaction was to cry. That and I had the feeling of I miss being a kid. Anyone one else get this feeling or is just me?
