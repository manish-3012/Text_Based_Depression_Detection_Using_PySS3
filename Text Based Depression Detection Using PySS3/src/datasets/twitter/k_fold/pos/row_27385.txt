My dad doesnâ€™t trust me part 2 So I have diagnosed ADHD. And I take two pills in the morning. But lately Iâ€™ve been taking them out throwing them in the trash before my breakfast. And so when he looks in the garbage can to find them he canâ€™t cause itâ€™s underneath a bunch of garbage. So when I went downstairs this morning to take my medication, and when I opened the garbage can to throw out my medication i open it to see that he lined the garbage can with paper towels so that he could see I did it. I honestly donâ€™t know what to think.
