Dear MegaThiccc, how on earth do you do this? EVERY post on r/teenagers has you comment either "F" or "Ok" or anything else on it. I literally see it all the time. Do you not attend school? Do you not go outside? Do you not sleep? Do you not go to the bathroom? How do you do this? Are you some sort of god or something? Like, I don't even need to mention you for you to see this!

Love,
