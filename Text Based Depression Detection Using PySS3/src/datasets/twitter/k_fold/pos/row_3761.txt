I honestly hate my brother. I hate him. I only think my parents put up with his shit because heâ€™s like 10. I have never shown any love towards him nor have I ever shown how furious I am. I will start this list because these past years with him and now the quarantine situation have been really aggravating.

First off, heâ€™s the reason I have to bust my ass working for a new Ps4 controller. He broke both analog sticks, the circle and triangle buttons donâ€™t work. And the L2 and R1 doesnâ€™t work anymore. 

Secondly, I have to constantly remind him whenever to do chores, when to take showers, brush his teeth, and when to eat. I am held responsible whenever he misses one. And I am always singled out whenever family arguements concerning me and I get blamed for. 

I think itâ€™s cool to have someone to be with throughout your younger stages but doing everything in your power to ruin my life is cruel.

He doesnâ€™t care whenever he breaks something, and pits me for the blame. Almost everyone in my family blames me for breaking the computer because my brother plays shady flash games and clicks on links. I hate it. I have been banned from using that computer and I have never been angrier.

I am sick of him.
