I got lucky and blew up on TikTok but I'm honestly not I'm inexperienced. What should I do to be successful? Preface: yeah okay "tiktok cringe" but be honest most of you guys use the app. Also, I know this isn't really the right subreddit but there wasn't a tiktok subreddit so I figured this was the next best thing.

I've never really been a content creator/influencer type, but I feel like this opportunity kinda fell into my lap and I could even make some money so I wanna at least give it a little bit more effort lol.

I have nearly 10,000 followers so I think I can do pretty well, but in the meantime while I'm getting the hang of things, what are some tips/tricks that the larger creators use to keep their views and engagement and such up?

for example like, what tf am I supposed to do on a live??

Thanks guys please don't make fun of me :)
