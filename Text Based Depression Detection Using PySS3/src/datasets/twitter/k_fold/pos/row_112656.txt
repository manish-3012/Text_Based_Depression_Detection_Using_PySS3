My ipad mini is ruined and it's stressing me out so bad Context: Ive had it for about 2 years and i use it for all my digital art because I can't afford anything else. About 2 months ago a shelf fell on it and destroyed half the screen and caused some internal damage. The screen still worked but wifi on it was competely unresponsive so i couldn't share or communicate with anyone on the platforms I was posting on. Cut to today, the screen just turned black with no hope of coming back on... 
Now i can't do anything digital art wise and it's really bumming me out. There's nothing i can really do about it but i don't really have anyone to share trivial stuff in my life like this with so i thought someone here could relate.
