We are all different people. Some of us are white. Some of us are black. Some of us are asian. Some of us are african. Some of us are middle eastern. Some of us are in college. Some of us are in high school. Some of us are in middle school. Some of us have different opinions than others. But there is one thing that unites us, one thing we have in common, one thing that brings us together.
