I just wanna be a kid again I am a child but I wanna go back to being like I was. I wanna go back to being care free and not knowing about all the shit I know about. I wanna go back to not having done all the shit Iâ€™ve done. I wanna go back to believing the nice shit people said to me. I wanna go back to being innocent. I wanna go back to when I didnâ€™t even say â€œbad words.â€ I wanna go back to when I didnâ€™t know certain people. I wanna go back so bad. I didnâ€™t take advantage of it. How could I have? I didnâ€™t know all this would happen.
