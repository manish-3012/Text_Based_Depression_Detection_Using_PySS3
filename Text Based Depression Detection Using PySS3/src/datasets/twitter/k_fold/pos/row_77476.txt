i am really dead inside after years of dealing with abuse and aftermath of rape trauma and harassment from men and losing friends and shit parents and suffering with too many mental disorders im losing my feelings for everything. i am considered 'psychotic' 'crazy' etc. the final straw was the person who i thought was my best friend leaving me and after i poured my heart out to them (which took a lot of swallowing my pride to do) he gave me a cold ass response. i treated him good i thought. whatever. i lost three best friends this year. i dont care for anything. i feel already dead. people try to offer 'help' on here i dont care enough to respond.
