I love the introduction scenes of Doctor Strange (Spoiler!) They are done so perfectly well. The focus is always on his hands. Heâ€™s a neuro surgeon, the first seconds of him is washing his hands, the first minutes are him shaving and pulling a bullet out of someoneâ€™s head like a literal god. All of his job depends on his hands. 

And then? A car crash. BOOM and his hands are practically GONE. They are ruined and he canâ€™t really use them anymore. Such great scenes.
