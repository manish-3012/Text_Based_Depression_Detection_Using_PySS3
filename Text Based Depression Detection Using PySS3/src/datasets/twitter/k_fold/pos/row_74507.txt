Still havenâ€™t chosen a college Background: 16 male, just finished year 11 do I need to find a 6th form or College to go to. 

So results day is coming up for my school in 20 days so most people will still be in the school and chatting about their choice. But my problem is that even though Iâ€™ve looked and looked I havenâ€™t been able to find a single thing that interests me. And as such I havenâ€™t even sent off an email application. My parents are also extremely strict so I know I couldnâ€™t just bunk off this year and only work. And I really need some advice on how to choose,  how to type out the email and how to format it.
