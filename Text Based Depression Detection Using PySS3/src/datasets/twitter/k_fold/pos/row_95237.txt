Rant about myself Iâ€™m sad now, Iâ€™m talking to people online and yet I still feel sad.
Why is therapy so expensive, like what the hell!! Do I pay with Toilet Paper? Or maybe my sadness. Actually, why even pay for a therapist when you got Cleverbo- Cleverbot has no emotions Cleverbot is shit. 

â€œHelp meâ€ Iâ€™d say, *murders*, says Cleverbot. 

Why canâ€™t I feel happy! Maybe itâ€™s a sign... Music maybe? No friendship? Now Iâ€™m writing my thoughts. Fact, 87% (random statistic) of your day is spent talking to yourself. I just suck I guess. Who knows, Maybe Reddit sucks. I need sleep yet I donâ€™t want to. The clock towards sadness gets faster when I doze off. Iâ€™m tired. Like why is sadness just sad. Why am I alive. Iâ€™d didnâ€™t choose to live, I was just born and put to work. If I wasnâ€™t born I wouldnâ€™t care, I didnâ€™t exist, I was unconscious of my existence. Wait, when a women is pregnant and has not given birth to their child, isnâ€™t the baby already born in the womb?? Hmmmmmmmmmm.... Iâ€™m going off topic. 
Why AM I SAD!?!?! Plis answer me god or whoever made us, maybe we just werenâ€™t made. Maybe, itâ€™s a punishment to live.
