Itâ€™s been half a year since my last self harm Around half a year ago I was in a dark place. I cut because I wanted to pay for when I messed up, every mistake I made I would cut. My girlfriend noticed the cuts and I saw how sad and worried she was about me, ever since I saw that look on her face I stopped. Thanks for reading some of my story.
