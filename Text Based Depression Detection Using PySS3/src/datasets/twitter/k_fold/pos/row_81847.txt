Inappropriate and misogynistic YouTube ads Just a reminder that you can report YouTube ads by clicking the information button under the video. It's a small grey circle with an 'i' in the centre.

It will say 'Why this ad?'. The option to report is hidden behind this where you can now click 'report this ad'. 

If the ad has sexual, abusive, drug involving etc content then tick the option  'An ad violates other Google Ads policies' it's pretty straightforward from then on.

Felt like I needed to post this since YouTube is advertising content that clearly is not appropriate for any (especially younger) audiences and is doing not much about it.
