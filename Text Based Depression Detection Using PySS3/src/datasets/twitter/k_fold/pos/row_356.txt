I might just give up. Hey itâ€™s really hard to live. I didnâ€™t think this could happen but all it took was a predator to break my world. Iâ€™ve talked to tons of people and some of them were wise and helpful. But right now, I think it doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s really great in the future, right now it is really really hard. I donâ€™t think it could be worth it. The things that usually inspire me to keep going arenâ€™t working anymore. Itâ€™s strange but everyone that is usually smart and makes me feel better seems ignorant and just unhelpful. Throughout my life Iâ€™ve always been told that you have to try and hope. But I just donâ€™t care to anymore. I donâ€™t care if I let the predators win by dying. I donâ€™t care if people think it was dumb of me to give up. Iâ€™m not strong enough. Iâ€™ll try to talk to my friends in person but if that doesnâ€™t help uh well I donâ€™t what Iâ€™ll do but Iâ€™m really thinking about killing myself so yeah.
