Life Update I felt like sharing So I'm in grade 12, from South Africa, and today would have been my matric ball (for Americans, it's our dance or whatever you call it).
I probably would've been at it right now if a guy in China didn't eat bat soup. 
Anyway, but instead of it being that I'm in the middle of exams and I wrote like the worst physics paper ever today. But some of us in the grade decided to still kinda dress up for the occasion. That included my crush... And my god she looked amazing. And the best/worst part is she's also my best friend so i got to take a picture with her and I got to wrap my arm around her and as a sad teenage boy who uses Reddit to vent, that felt amazing.

Thanks for coming to my life update.
