Merry Christmas you wonderful fuckers! Y'know even for a group of continually depressed somewhat lost and nihilistic young fellows, there's gotta be some days where we can just sit and be happy for a bit. Christmas might as well be that day, don't you say? Even the fuckin' war stopped on Christmas in WWII, supposedly. Or was it new years? Man, am I bad at history.

Merry Christmas folks!
