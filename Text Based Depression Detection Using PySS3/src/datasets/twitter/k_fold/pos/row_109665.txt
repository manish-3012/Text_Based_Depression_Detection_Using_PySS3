TIFU by accidently getting myself rejected by my crush. Be me, a teenager (surprise surprise) chilling on a Saturday night, unaware of the slightly depressing course of events that are about to play out over the next 20 minutes. Now there's this girl, a friend of mine, of whom I have a particularly *high opinion* of: she's smart, funny, and pretty, and I'm *at least* interested in her.

Now, as all of you probably are acutely aware of, current conditions mean that leaving the house apart from going to school is out of the question, (my city is experiencing a second wave), and I haven't had a chance to hang out with her, but we had been talking pretty regularly. I'd like to think, that if the events of this post hadn't happened, might have had a *slight* chance with her.

Yet

Alas!

Alack!

Unto here lies the fuck up:

We've set the stage, the scene in clear in your mind, apart from one final detail: I hadn't had a good wank in about a week. For those of you reading not endowed with a schlong, or do not understand the significance of this, I hadn't experienced that sweet, post-nut clarity for some time now. Now I don't know about you guys, but most of my really ***deep*** thinking comes during post nut clarity, and having not having experienced it for some time now, my vision was clouded by a thin veil of...being a horny 16 year old.

Now, having seen a post about flirting just recently on this here subreddit, I decided to give it a go - what's the worst that could happen? Surely if it went wrong, I could just laugh it off - how wrong I was...

After some irrelevant background information, I receive this message:

(Not verbatim obviously, snapchat deletes chats after 24 hours and the whole conversation isn't included here for the sake of brevity)

Her: "Gahahaha I don't know if Iâ€™ll ever get a boyfriend"

Me: *(Boldly I guess)* "Nawww ahaha I could be your boyfriend"

At this point in the story, dear readers, is where the ***TRUE*** fuck up begins, as I think to myself "now would be a great time for a wank". And if you didn't know, when a thought like that crosses your mind, it doesn't leave easily. I lock my phone and throw it to the side, apparently uncaring about the effects of my jokingly flirtatious advances, and get down to business. And, as the great, symphonic crescendo subsides, it arrives: the unique, the limited -post nut clarity-.

A realisation dawns on me and my heart jumps slightly. If an academy-award winning cinematographer filmed this, you might see a closeup of my pupils dilating, a sharp intake of breath:

*What if she took it seriously?*

Ill spare you the suspense: She had.

"UltraSimpak, I'm really sorry but I don't think I want to have a relationship, you're really sweet and nice and funny, but I don't think I can."

'Tis truly a tale of woe: this poor, poor girl, whom I have never even been on a date with, thought I was asking for a relationship.

I backpedal more furiously than that one kid in your physical education class who thought it would be funny to go backwards on an elliptical machine as fast as he could, but I check myself: Surely I couldn't just say "Gahahah nooo it was just a joke" - That would come off as just trying to save face, and I'm no coward - I face my failures with no fear of falling - so I don't send that. It's become clear to me now that a chain of inevitable events have been set in motion: She's rejected me now, dashing my hopes of anything happening in the future, every time we meet up will be "just as friends", ill be kicking myself for maybe the next four days or so.

"Gahahahahaha thats ok I understand"

There were a thousand other things I could have said that could have saved the situations, but there is sat like a stunned mullet, like a dear in headlights, like a particularly stupid political commentator who won't accept defeat in a debate: I couldn't think of anything more at the time to say, and she was awkwardly leaving me on delivered anyway.

And as such, we reach the conclusion of the story, her friends have told me how sorry they are that she rejected me, despite my advances being accidental, and I've spend the last few days being a bit bummed out about what could have been. The girl in question and I are undoubtedly still good friends (notwithstanding a healthy serving of slight awkward tension which I can only hope will fade over time) and I decided to type out this story to give you this advice:

\-Wanking/jilling really can be beneficial sometimes.

\-You might see all this advice of just "shooting your shot" or "going for it", but please be sensible: obviously do not do it in the slightly abrupt and non-prepared way I "did"

\-Rejection really isn't that bad for those wondering I feel like me and this girl will be able to laugh it off and well be pretty good friends anyway.

TLDR: Blew my chanced with my crush, after blowing my load I realised that my flirting did not in fact blow her mind, but instead blew up the progress I had made with her, effectively erasing all possibility that she'd blow me in the future
