I hate my vagina, I hate being physically female. Any advice. Hey, I'm an 18yo agender (afab). I've recently been struggling with a lot of dysphoria surrounding my genitals. 

I'm looking to have them removed soon, but even at its soonest that'll be in like a month. I don't want any genitals, and if the surgery goes well I'll have nothing but a smooth crotch like a doll (with a hole for urine).

Currently I've been struggling with dysphoria a lot. I feel like I'm deformed, or like I'm constantly forced to dress up like a girl. Its like I have an open wound between my legs. 

Seriously, it's super hard functioning right now. It's often distressing having to masturbate, change, use the toilet, or shower with genitals on my body. 

The other day I was on the subway and I bacame acutely aware of the fact that i had genitals and I was very aware of how it felt (I wasn't wearing underwear so this could just be the fault of my pants), it was incredibly painful and I couldn't even Express it because there were other people on the subway. And this is just one of many examples. 

It's weird, I get turned on if I see a girl's vagina but I'm distressed by my own. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with it? There's very few ways I'm able to cope with my genitals right now.
