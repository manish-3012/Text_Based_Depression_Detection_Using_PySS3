i don't know where else to post this so i'm posting it here i'm sending a envelope from canada to the us and it has a small letter, 2 small crochet appliques, and and one of those really light mini glass jars. basically i only have a stamp and i don't wanna go to the post office again to get it weighed and whatever, so do you think if i send the envelope they wont notice?
