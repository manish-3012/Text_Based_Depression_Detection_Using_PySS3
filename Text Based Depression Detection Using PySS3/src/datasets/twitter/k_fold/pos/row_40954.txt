The office really wasn't that great of a show to have won countless awards. I really don't understand. Micheal Scott isn't some hero, he was just a funny character. Thats it. Watching The Office isn't a personality trait, get it off your profile. It doesn't make you quirky to watch the office. I loke the office, its a good show. But the I don't think it lives up to the hype. It wasn't amazing, so inspiring it deserves an award, it was just a show that was funny. In comparison, Adventure time was a better show in my opinion. But back to the office, it had a great A plot but the B plot was ALWAYS more in your face. The A plot was Jim and Pam's relationship and how it transformed through the show. The B plot was whatever Micheal was doing, and when Micheal Scott wasn't in the show, it kinda died. Again this is just my opinion so do with this what you want.
