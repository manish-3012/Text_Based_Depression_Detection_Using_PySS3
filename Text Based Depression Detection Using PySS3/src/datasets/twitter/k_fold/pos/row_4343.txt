Never had a gf 

Im 15 never had a gf not from lack of trying tho, ive asked out 2 girls and been rejected by both im not sure why im not particularly ugly apparently,atleast thats what my friend who is girl says and i am known in my year for being â€œrippedâ€ i dont think i am but thats what people say,im not popular but not unpopular it just sucks and im to scared to ask another girl out as the first time i was constantly being made fun of for getting rejected, everyone kept pissing me off about it, and the second time it just hurt, all im saying is, is it weird ive never had a gf or kissed a girl. I really want one just so i got someone to talk to properly and hug
