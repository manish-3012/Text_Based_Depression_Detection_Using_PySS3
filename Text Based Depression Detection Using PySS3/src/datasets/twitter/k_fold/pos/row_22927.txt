Can someone help? Hi idk where to put this or who to talk to irl for advice so I thought Iâ€™d put it here.

So I was with my friends and we were playing truth or dare and I went out the room for a sec and when I get back this guy had been dared to kiss me (Iâ€™m a girl btw and I had never kissed anyone ever before) and he didnâ€™t really know what to do so he asked me if I was fine with it and I was like um ok but we passed it anyway cos I think he got too nervous, but I donâ€™t really know why.

When it comes back round to me I get dared to kiss him, and I looked at him and mouthed â€œr u okâ€ and he nodded and I asked if he was fine with that etc. So I did. It was just like a peck on the lips or whatever really but I donâ€™t know what to think at all. 

We havenâ€™t spoken since then cos he had to go to a different place and we were tired in the morning but I feel like I really need to talk about it with someone even if it is just a random stranger
