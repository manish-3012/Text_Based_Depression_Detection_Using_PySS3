Stuck in life and not able to snap out of it So I'm a 17 y.o math student at 12th grade. Haven't studied the last two years and now we're only a few months away from some really important exams and I'm panicking. I've lost all hope. Doing literally anything is a huge struggle. I really want to study and make up for it and I know I could make up for all the lost time but I just can't seem to start. Days seem to fly by and no one else other than me cares about what's gonna happen.
Any advice or help would be appreciated.
Tldr: unable to study need help to do it
