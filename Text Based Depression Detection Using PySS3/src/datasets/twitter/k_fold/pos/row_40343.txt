RIP Eddie Van Halen Unfortunately, it was announced that Eddie Van Halen, guitarist and co founder of the hard rock band Van Halen has passed away from cancer. I don't know how many of you here know who Van Halen is (or was), but they're one of the biggest hard rock bands of the late 70s and 80s. Eddie's playing completely changed how the guitar was played, perhaps more so than any other guitarist before him. As a guitar player, I felt bad that I never learned to play many Van Halen songs on guitar, so a couple of weeks ago I started learning some of their stuff. And of course now today I saw that Eddie passed away. Though he wasn't as much of a direct influence on my guitar playing, all of the guitar players who I was directly influenced by were directly influenced by Eddie Van Halen. 

He changed everything about rock and metal guitar playing after the late 70s, and was one of the best if not the best hard rock guitarist ever. You will be missed, rock in peace
