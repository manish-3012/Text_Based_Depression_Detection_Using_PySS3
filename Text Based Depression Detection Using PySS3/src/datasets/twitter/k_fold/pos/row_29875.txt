Hey there guys , I am a (2000) Rated Chess Player. Looking for interested people who would like to learn how to play or improve their game,

Times are hard and I was hoping to make some quick bucks before 23rd Dec 2020 as to pay off some stuff and buy some essentials.
$50 for a month , 2-3 classes a week.  
By the time we're done you'll have a firm grasp on the game and could beat your friends/family.

Hopefully looking forward to some interested people,

Cheers !!!
