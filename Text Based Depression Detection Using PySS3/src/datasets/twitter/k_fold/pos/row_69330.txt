My 'friends' suck I'm moving to a different state on Friday so earlier this week I set up a get together with my friends. I was supposed to go over to a friend's house at 1:00 and they just cancelled the get together. Honestly I have no idea how I didn't see this coming they never actually liked me anyways, just thought they would like to see me before I'm gone forever from their lives. I'm just really sad rn because I actually thought they cared about me just a tiny bit.
