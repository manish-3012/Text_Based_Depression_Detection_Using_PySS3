Questions for guys I'm too scared to ask irl; part 13 Opinion on the "rape all women" thing they're talking about on tiktok?

Basically for those of you who don't know some girls started saying "kill all men" (KAM) and some guys responded to this not by saying kill all women but by saying "rape all women" (Aka RAW)

Personally I hate both. What about you?
