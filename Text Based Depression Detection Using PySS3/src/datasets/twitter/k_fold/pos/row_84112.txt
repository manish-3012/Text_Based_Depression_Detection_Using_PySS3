Yâ€™all i met a girl in a mental ward that i low key just like fell in love with and have absolutely no clue where she is or how sheâ€™s doing. i donâ€™t cry much anymore but i did in that ward and it was honestly nice to talk out what in the world is happening in my world. she would write me letters and slip em under my door. idek iâ€™m rambling like a mofo but honestly i guess iâ€™ve always been in relationships that were a mix of affection and abandonment and i refused any straight affection but she just had something so pure about her. i thought about looking for her but honestly i have nothing to offer and she probably only was interested in me because we were stuck together for a week straight. iâ€™ll probably delete this but yâ€™all talk to me in da comments. iâ€™m putting this in serious incase yâ€™all ask ab the ward
