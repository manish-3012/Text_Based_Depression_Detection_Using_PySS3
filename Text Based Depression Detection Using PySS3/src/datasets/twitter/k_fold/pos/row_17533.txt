A kid had a seizure next to me in class and died Im a freshmen and my second semester started Jan 15. My first day back in person this semester i was in my first hour class and the kid sitting to my left started to look around the class really weirdly he was looking at the ceiling and waved his arms. He then started mumbling and shortly after he started seizing and dropped to the floor. I turned him onto his side and held his head up because he was hitting it against the floor. Paramedics got there and gave him some kind of injection and brought him to a hospital and later that day the school announced he died. I dont want to make this about me because he is the one who lost his life and his family lost someone they loved to death but i feel like shit. I feel like i could have done something different and i feel bad because i dont really have feelings about it. I should be feeling something right? I mean i should feel bad for him or be sad or something but i just dont feel anything. Is there anything i can do?
