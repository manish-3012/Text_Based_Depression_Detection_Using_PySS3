Day 39 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. â™ƒ: Well we're all stuck together whatever we are. For the rest of the week.

â™†: We could just go now.

â™†: We could run away right now and never come back and never have to know what happened here.

â™†: The highway isn't even a mile away.

â™†: ...just kidding. I know you'd never go for that.

â™ƒ: ...you say 'just kidding' after a lot of...pretty huge things.

â™ƒ: Would you go for it?

â™†: No, it's stupid. Summer scouts is almost over anyway. Some things you just bear with and then it's over.

â™ƒ: Haha, that is really thoughtful.

â™ƒ: You don't bear anything quietly though.

â™†: No why the HELL should I, this place is ruining my entire summer and no one deserves to forget it.

â™ƒ: God, yeah.

â™ƒ: This place...really is the worst.

â™ƒ: I'm glad you don't give me a chance to say yes to any of your bad ideas, haha.
