[discussion] I havenâ€™t seen nearly enough people talking about this, the trump administration finalized the removal of LGBT health protections. They first started the process to do this, not only during pride month, but on the anniversary of the Orlando massacre. It was finalized this Friday. 

Transgender health protections were made to be included with sex discrimination by the obama administration. Before then 1 in 5 trans people were rejected medical care just for being trans, and 28% dealt with harassment in medical settings. 

Now, Trump is reversing these changes that protected transgender people. This will make it legal once again for:

-Health care providers to refuse to help anyone they believe to have a sexuality or gender identity they donâ€™t like.

-Health care companies to ban all transition related parts of health care (ex. hormone therapy)

-Hospitals to house transgender people with their birth sex, instead of the gender they identify as. 

-Health care providers to refuse HIV and STI prevention.

-Not recognize someoneâ€™s marriage to the same sex as valid. 

-(please let me know if i missed anything here) 


They can even discriminate if theyâ€™re receiving GOVERNMENT FUNDING. And donâ€™t forget he also made it legal for homeless shelters to reject them, even though LGBT people are more likely to become homeless. 

NOT ONLY is he taking away medical protections, but heâ€™s doing it during a PANDEMIC.
