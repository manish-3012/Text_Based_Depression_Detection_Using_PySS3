A good childhood memory for once Anyone else remember when McDonaldâ€™s had beanie babies? I had so many of those little shits, registered them all to the website so I could play the game. I probably had 60+ of them, my mom would get me a happy meal then buy like 4 more of the toys. (They sold them separate for around $1) Me and my mom would play for hours gaining money and decorating everyoneâ€™s rooms. Her old computer couldnâ€™t handle it too well but that didnâ€™t stop us. Through the uncontrollable lag and random crashes we had fun. Also had a webkinz cat, an orange tabby. I was a special kind so we got a free gift upon register in the game, a cute little swing. I also had a Siamese cat that had a smaller Siamese cat that came with it, no idea where they have went to. For some reason I just canâ€™t let my childhood stuffed animals go. They sit in the spare rooms closet collecting dust, guess itâ€™s the good memories keeping them there.
