Existential Crisis at 19.9999 years So I've never really been on r/teenagers before, but I'm turning 20 in about half an hour, and at the edge of the end, my time as a teenager suddenly feels very precious.


In half an hour, my teens will be over, and I can never get them back. They cannot be changed, relived, revisited, or anything. When I'm 80 years old, my teens will still be the same as they will be in 30 minutes. It is a chapter of my life that will be locked forever.

There are so many things I'd want to change; things I haven't done that I should've, and things that I did but shouldn't have. Many regrets, but also many fond memories.

It's all too late now. My teens are over, and there is nothing I can do to stop it. 

Anyway, I'm going to spend the last few precious minutes in this decade the same way I spent the first; in a deep, rewarding sleep.

Tomorrow is a new day. Tomorrow is a new decade.

Bye.
