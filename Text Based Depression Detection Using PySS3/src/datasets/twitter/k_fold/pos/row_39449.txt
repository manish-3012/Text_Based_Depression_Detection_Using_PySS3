Letting it out 

Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m a fucking loser, Iâ€™m 5â€™11â€ at 160 so Iâ€™m fat as fuck. I canâ€™t do anything right. I can never ducking sleep, I canâ€™t wake up because I cant fucking sleep, I canâ€™t lose weight, I canâ€™t do shit. Everyone ducking hates me because Iâ€™m a fatass bitch with no fucking life. I just want to fucking die someone kill me. My mom took $200 of my fucking money that I fucking earned because my closet wasnâ€™t clean enough, like ffs my fucking closet wasnâ€™t clean enough, thereâ€™s a fucking reason I asked for shelfâ€™s. My â€œfriendsâ€ constantly berate me and keep telling me that IM the annoying one, like holy shit, they call me 24/7 I tell them Iâ€™m busy so they fucking blow up my phone to try and get me to talk to them for them to fucking laugh at me. Iâ€™m going to fucking kms is this shit doesnâ€™t fucking change right the fuck now. Iâ€™m tired of everything. Now everythingâ€™s on the fucking table.
