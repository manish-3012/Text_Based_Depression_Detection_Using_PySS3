Question for you all. Hi! I have a question for you all since you would all be more likely to understand instead of AITA.

I have severe anxiety, like REALLY BAD. Depression, anxiety, you name it. Recently, met a girl who I've absolutely adored. She's perfect in every way. But, due to my anxiety and all that, I constantly overthink everything. I confront her constantly (yes we're dating) about cheating ETC. Recently, she said she has social anxiety and thats why she never wants to hang out with anyone, and then she told me she recently hung out with 5 other guys. Like what? Am I just overthinking or is something actually happening, because my dead mind can't tell.
