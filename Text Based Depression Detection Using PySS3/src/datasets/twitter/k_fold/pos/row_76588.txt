This happen to anybody else? I had a good day looking back, talked to my friends, easy classes, and I even watched a damn movie in one class. But for whatever reason even though I look back and think â€œhey this was a series of good things that happenedâ€ I feel like absolute shit. Just want to know if Iâ€™m just weird as hell or if other people feel like this.
