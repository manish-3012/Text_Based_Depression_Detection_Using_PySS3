Unhappy, being threatened by school due to zoom lessons I was repeatedly removed from my zoom lessons because my camera wasn't on immediately. Now, I'm forced to go to school physically to attend more zoom lessons using their awful computers. Their laptops don't display the work properly and are slow, but my computer at home works fine - in school work isn't displaying properly, my video sometimes disappears for them, audio cuts out randomly and video on my end vanishes or becomes corrupt (Displays inverted colour of my face instead of teacher's worksheet). They've told me that if I miss a single other lesson for the next 6 months then they WILL give me a grade 0 in every subject for 'lack of participation', even though my average grades are very strong. They are the only school in the local area doing a centre assessed grade, while all others are doing exams. I have 65 homeworks (and rising) to still finish, I've completed 7 in the past 24 hours completely. This is starting to make me incredibly stressed and angry, I don't know what to do. If I keep attending, I won't be able to finish my work. If I stay at home, I will be threatened. What do I do?
