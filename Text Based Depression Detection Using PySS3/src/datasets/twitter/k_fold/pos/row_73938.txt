it finally came its been a year im using reddit and it really changed me alot. i found new friends, talked to people and got at least a little better at english. i spent 90% of my time in this sub because it was the best subreddit i have ever joined. i was a lonely ass, and now i have a girlfriend. i had a lack of confidence, and was insecure, but thanks to yall i got rid of them. words cant express how much i love yall, i mean, i would hug each of you, because you really helped me. thanks everyone again for making my first year here amazing. you can have a piece from my cake. youre welcome.
