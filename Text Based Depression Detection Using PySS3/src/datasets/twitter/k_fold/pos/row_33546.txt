Itâ€™s National Suicide Prevention Month. According to the World Health Orginization, one person takes their own life every 40 seconds. This also results in approximately 800,000 people committing suicide every year.

If you feel mentally unstable, here are a few things I want you to know.

1. You have purpose in life
2. You have family and friends to guide and support you
3. You contribute to society
4. You are loved
5. You are not alone.

If you or someone you love is considering suicide, get help immediately. Itâ€™s the only way out.
