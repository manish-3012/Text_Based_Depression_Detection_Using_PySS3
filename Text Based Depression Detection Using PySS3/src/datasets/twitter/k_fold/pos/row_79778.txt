fear of loosing someone? Hey dudes,

Iâ€™ve never really posted anything like this before but I really need some advice.

Quite recently I rediscovered my fear of loosing someone ? More specifically my significant other/close friend. 

Why I developed this is because a little over a year now, I was in a relationship and my parents decided to separate us because of their homophobia. It was incredibly traumatic for me and basically I was all alone, all the time. 

Itâ€™s been a long time since that relationship, but I realized I still have this fear of loosing someone installed in me.

I met someone recently and I really like him and I donâ€™t want to blow it. I am afraid that something similar might happen. Is my fear valid? Is there anything I can do to help myself get over it? Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way, I want to be strong. 

Thanks,
