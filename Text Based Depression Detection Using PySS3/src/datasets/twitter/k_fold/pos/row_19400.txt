Please cherish your time in school! Hello! I am a college student, in my second year, which means that i am probably a little older than most of you inside this subreddit. If i were to give you any advice, it would be to treasure every moment of your school life, even the not so happy ones, because trust me, you cannot rewind time and certainly there's no place that is quite like school, where you can be in a class and from there on, build your school life, college is very different remember that. So make sure you enjoy every second of your school life! 


P. S: i feel like i am getting older and quite frankly i wrote this because damn nostalgia hits hard :-P
