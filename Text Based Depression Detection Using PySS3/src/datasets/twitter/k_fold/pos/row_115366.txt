I found most difficult to sing song (according to me) I found this Indian song from 1990's, this song is almost wholly  sung in one breath. Imagine singing 

a song in one breath. Really good song but only thing is that it is in Hindi but  that doesn't matter 

as, the singer is very talented.  The name of the song is "Breathless" and the name is understandable after watching the video.

The link of video is    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0NuYmAbec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0NuYmAbec)

Please check out this is a really good song.

I am not sharing this for promotion ,just sharing because I think that this song is really underrated and should get more recognition.
