I seriously need to get this off my back. Recently Iâ€™ve been struggling with internalized feelings. Iâ€™m not even comfortable sharing thoughts about anxiety and depression with my mother, who I trust everything to. Anxiety, depression, internalization of your most burdening thoughts is normal, but itâ€™s not good. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD, and the idea that I canâ€™t focus and learn as well as everyone else can, is seriously causing some bad anxiety for me. I wonder if Iâ€™m normal, or good enough for the rest of people my age, and itâ€™s seriously taking a toll on my mental health to compare myself to other people. And when I cant find someone to tell my feelings to, it gets worse. The anxiety is creating physical side affects, nausea, headaches, lack of focus and interest in things I once loved, and itâ€™s making me feel horrible. I just want to feel like thereâ€™s something and someone there for me, a new hobby, a friend who can listen and understand me to the fullest. And what makes it worse is I always end up invalidating my own thoughts, wondering if Iâ€™m actually sad, or if Iâ€™m just trying to gain attention or pity from it, and itâ€™s a flurry of thoughts I donâ€™t know how to comprehend. I just wanted to put it out there. If anyone is struggling with the same things, feel free to rant in the comments or something, Iâ€™m here for you guys. Have a good night, and remember youâ€™re loved.
