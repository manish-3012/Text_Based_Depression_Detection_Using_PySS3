My mom yells at me for everything now I hate everything Every time  I have come back from my girlfriend's house and I'm in a good mood my mom just starts yelling at me for no reason. Like before she yelled at because I did not get an assignment that was never actually assigned. This time she yelled at me because she did not know what I was writing about in the common app and how she would have written it completely differently.

Like I came back from feeling really happy and then I was just slammed down. I get that she is stressed about work but then she just yells at us for literally anything. I just needed to rant about this because I am not feeling very well right now.

Edit: now she is talking about how I cant ever accomplish anything properly. I fucking hate myself  and everything so much right now.
