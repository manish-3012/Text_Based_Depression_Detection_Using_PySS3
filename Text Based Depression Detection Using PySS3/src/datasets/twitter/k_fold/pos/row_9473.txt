Hopefully Something Different If you frequent this subreddit then Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve seen all of the posts about people asking their crushes out and them accepting and going on a date. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with those posts of course, in fact Iâ€™m happy for those people, but it occurred to me that there arenâ€™t a lot of stories where people fail. I just wanted to let you all in on something thatâ€™s helped me out pretty recently. Rejection isnâ€™t failure. Just because someone doesnâ€™t feel the same way about you doesnâ€™t mean that youâ€™re not awesome. I struggled with this for a long time until I finally came to this realization, so I just wanted to share with you all. Have a nice day (or night depending where you are).
