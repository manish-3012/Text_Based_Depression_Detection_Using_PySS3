â€œyouâ€™re hiding somethingâ€ HE SNATCHED MY PHONE AND WHEN I REACTED NEGATIVELY iâ€™m apparently hiding something. why is he so nosy. has to look at my screen the minute he walks in my room. I DONT DO ANYTHING BAD. IM NOT HIDING ANYTHING. steals my remote for my TV, hides it for two weeks costs me friendships I tell my parents he stole it and they donâ€™t believe me. He gave it back today. I was right. Whatâ€™s the polite way of saying I hate you to family? Always framing me, insulting me, tells me to kms. god i hate him. plus he keeps physically assaulting me
