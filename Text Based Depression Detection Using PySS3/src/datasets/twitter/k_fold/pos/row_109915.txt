There is this girl in my class that i really like but we don't know each other at all. How to i get to know her / become friends? There is this girl i have a crush on but i don't want to ask her out randomly and i feel that i will have a higher chance of her saying yes if we become kinda friends first. We don't sit next to each other in any lessons (but she still is in some classes)  and i can't really talk to her at break as she is always with lots of friends. How do i get close with her?
