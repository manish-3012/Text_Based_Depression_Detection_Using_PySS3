My parents keep shaming me for being myself. Whenever I try out something new, from wearing a necklace to making a new friend of the opposite gender, they always shame me for it. Ever since I was young, you have established this character for me - shy and tomboy-ish. But I've grown out of that. I'm not like that anymore. I enjoy wearing dresses and painting my nails. I hate how I have to be judged for liking things. Not just that, but you always make fun of me and make jokes about things I do. I just want to be myself - I just want to be comfortable being myself.

You've reached your goal, Mom and Dad. Your daughter is ashamed of being a human being. I'm being made fun of by trying to be true to you. I feel like I have to hide my hobbies and feelings from you. I'm a teenager and have never painted my nails because I was afraid to be attacked by my own parents.
