I feel like my mom misses the old me. ever since I (14M) turned thirteen and started to grow up, i feel like my mum just wants me to be a chubby-cheeked cuddle monster for the rest of my life. I get it, but frankly i don't want to grow up either, i miss all the hugs that she seems to think i don't want anymore,  and until i can drive there is basically no perk to adulthood. I don't have any independence to go out and do things like other people in my class but i don't get any of the affection i miss from 'childhood'. I'm stuck in this lonely transition and all i'm getting is more school work and chores.
