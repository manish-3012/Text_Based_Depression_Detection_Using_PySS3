I'd like to make friends from Scandinavia. I can teach Russian (16/m) I know it's a very unrelevant sub but I'm a bit curious about Scandinavian cultures and currently learning Norwegian and Finnish (could do Swedish but I have PTSD from my gazlighting and toxic friends, long story) :) so yeah, here's my introduction:

I'm 16 and gay from former USSR. 

I speak Russian and English but also currently attending high school where I have to take German lessons (I regret doing so), however I think to do some Dutch on my own. I'm a bit into languages so hours of stupid stories are guaranteed. 

I'm doing some coding and by that I mean that I learn JS and Python but soon I'm going to start learning different sort of frameworks, C++ and stuff. 

I'm a bit friendly, chill and open-minded so yeah hit me up! 

If somehow you're reading it but you're not from Scandinavia, however you're eager to talk with me, just DM me.
