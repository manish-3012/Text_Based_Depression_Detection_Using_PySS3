I think 0/0 is "countable" infinity. If my understanding of "countable infinity" is correct (it is a "real" number), I believe that zero divided by zero is countable infinity. My reasoning is such: Anything divided by zero is infinity, as zero fits infinite times into any number. Plus, if aÃ·b=c, ac=b and bc=a. Therefore, countable infinity times zero is zero and so 0/0=countable infinity.
