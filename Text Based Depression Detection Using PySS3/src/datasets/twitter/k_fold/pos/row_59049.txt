I feel like shit (idk if this is serious enough to mark as serious) I saw a meme about men sharing their feelings and I was like fuck imma do that for once in my fucking life to see if anyone actually gives a damn
To start off my parents are divorced and and my dad can be an asshole, right off to an amazing start, my self-image is awful and idk how to improve it so my self esteem is nonexistent, because my esteem is low I donâ€™t feel confident to actually talk to a girl and get someone in my life that will give me hugs or something so that just leaves me lonely and depressed and stressed from going back and forth from my momâ€™s and my dadâ€™s. 
Ps. I also donâ€™t deal with death well and lost both of my grandparents on my dadâ€™s side that I loved a lot to cancer so that doesnâ€™t help at all 

I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore I hurt and thatâ€™s basically it, plus a few things that I donâ€™t really feel like sharing to a subreddit sorry if this ruined your mood
