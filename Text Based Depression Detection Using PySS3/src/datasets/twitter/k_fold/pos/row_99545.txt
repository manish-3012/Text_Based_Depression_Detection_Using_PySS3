I think my parents are going too far I feel like my parents are being too strict with my home life. It may not be as bad as a lot of people, but I still don't think it's right.

Firstly, when I charge my phone for the night, they make me keep it in my room, and they demand the password to it to be able to search it once every week.

Secondly, they set up a router that can, among other things, easily block certain devices from the internet and can see everything any device uses the internet for.
Every night, my dad looks at what we're doing. 

My bedtime is 9:30, but they want me to get ready at 9:00 (even though I can get ready way faster). So to enforce this, they turn off the internet at 9:00.

The only time I feel safe to do even minorly suspicious stuff like pirating and sketchy websites is when  I get to sleep over at my grandparents, but their internet is fucking terrible (3mbps max).

They won't even let me install our family movie and tv show streaming service because there's xx rated stuff. What kind of fucking idiot watches porn on a big monitor when anyone could come up behind you? Like honestly I'm 14 ffs, more than half of the 14 year olds surveyed in a survey admitted to having jacked off.

This just makes me more secretive and better at hiding shit. 

Finally, every Sunday, it's a "no electronics day". I'm fine with that, having a day to relax from videogames is good for me, but they don't even let me listen to music, or chat with my friends on Discord, which is my only means of talking with my friends, because of the virus.

To be honest, they're really nice people that I really love, but they're just really strict with electronics.

Yeah, that's it. If you've read this far (the end), please tell me what you think about my situation.
