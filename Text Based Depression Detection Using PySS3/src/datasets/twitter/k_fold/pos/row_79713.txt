Seriously, my parents want me to join a THIRD school They said I have to do my other two schools (primary and religious) as well as this or theyâ€™re not going to feed me or take care of me. (This is another religious school). I got mad because Iâ€™ve been so stressed and pushed around a lot that my mom wanted to cry and say Iâ€™m a shit child and â€œfine, donâ€™t do anything anymore I donâ€™t care about youâ€. Seriously.

And I canâ€™t join it anyways because itâ€™s an all girls school! (Iâ€™m a guy)! 

I just donâ€™t fucking care anymore. From tomorrow, I guess Iâ€™ll start being a robot to live up to my parents expectations and never have fun like playing games or talk to my friends because that is â€œwasting timeâ€ even though I already cut most of my social life off and try to focus more on satisfying my parents, if not, my whole family. 

You know how hard online is? Iâ€™m working my ass off for it. So hard I have all As and a B and I would get a yelling for a B. I hate my damn life.
