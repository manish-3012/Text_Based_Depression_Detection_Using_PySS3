The good ol' super nintendo... I get to the brink of tears whenever I hear the Super Mario World soundtrack, because of the overwhelming nostalgia from my earliest childhood memories. I have a really good photographic memory, so remembering something verbally is incredibly rare for me. I remember being around 4-7, my older brother being about 6-9 playing super mario world every day. We would sit on our bunk beds, with the super nintendo hooked up to one of those old box like TV's. I remember him defeating the og Bowser, and how he dodged his attacks. I remember seeing yoshi eat the apples off the bushes. I sorta remember him playing the legend of zelda, but not much. I do remember our uncle showing him how to play it though. Once in a while my older brother gets out the old super nintendo and hooks it up to our modern tv to play mortal combat with our dad. 

Ah well, this had turned into a story sorry about that. What's your nostalgia with the super nintendo?
