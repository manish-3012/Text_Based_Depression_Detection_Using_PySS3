WTF MY SISTER AND HER FRIEND ARE FUCKED IN THE HEAD So my sisterâ€™s best friend comes over (Weâ€™ll just call her B), like any normal day that she comes over. We start doing our homework (I am mostly, theyâ€™re over there just fucking around. Weâ€™re all the same age btw). My sister asks if B wants oatmeal. A little strange, but about par for the course.

About five minutes into their oatmeal, B says, â€œOh! I have Parkinsonâ€™s!â€ and her hand starts shaking and the oatmeal starts sloshing everywhere. My sister starts cracking up during this and neither of them can stop laughing. I tell them to stop and that itâ€™s disrespectful to people that have Parkinsonâ€™s. Then B has the fucking nerve to flip my ass off and call me a no-fun-having son of a bitch, along with my sister. Like wtf? Youâ€™re making fun of a very serious illness that families have to see their loved ones slowly die because of it. Ik this probably isnâ€™t the place to post this but I just need to vent and this is the first place I thought of.
