The most unexpected shit just happened So just a couple of hours ago i was talking to my friends over in discord , we were talking about some siege shit and eventually played together so were still talking but since I wasnâ€™t in my home country they wanted to know how I was doing. after a while Some of them friends left and then 3 of them were left we were talking about some cool shit we did in Titanfall 2 then one of my friends who was in the call left (he needed to help his mom with some shit) when theres one person left he told me how he felt about the time he got swatted by the Spanish Inquisition
