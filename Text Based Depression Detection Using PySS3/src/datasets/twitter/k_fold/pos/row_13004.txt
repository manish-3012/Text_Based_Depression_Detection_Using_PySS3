Seeing my mother slowly deteriorate is heart breaking My mother has been going through variety of treatments due to her cancer. She is such a wonderful women but seeing her mentally decline in front of me is heartbreaking.

She'll ask me the same question 4-5 times a day completely forgetting my original answer. But anytime I need help with cooking she'll always know how to help. She is so kind and I can't imagine losing her. 

Sorry if I don't respond right away ill be a bit busy.
