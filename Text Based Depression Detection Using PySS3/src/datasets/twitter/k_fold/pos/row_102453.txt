Anyone else just barely hanging on all the time Iâ€™m clinging to memories of better times constantly, they are the only thing keeping me going 

Iâ€™ve developed extremely strong bonds with inanimate things such as my car and tv characters, to take place of the massive whole of joy that is missing from my life 

Idk what this is. I fear Iâ€™m going to have a breakdown in front of someone soon and itâ€™s all gonna come out, which will only make it worse 

Give me the strength to keep it in, and dig an ever growing whole to push it down into
