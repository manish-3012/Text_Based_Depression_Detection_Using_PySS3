fun fact about people who are shadowbanned when a user is shadowbanned it's like they're banned but they don't actually know they're banned, and all their posts are sent straight to the sub's spam section and only mods can see their comments.

so anyway sometimes ill see a comment from a shadowbanned user who doesn't know they're shadowbanned and like i kinda wanna tell them but on the other hand if they're shadowbanned then they probably did something super sketchy so idk.

im very bored, hi how are you
