Is it just me... ...or is it so difficult to be happy? Don't get me wrong - I'm not depressed or anything - but I just think that life is a bit grey...if you know what I mean. Nothing really makes sense, school's not fun, friends just go and the family...yeah it's there, but you don't really have fun with them anymore...only sometimes.
I just wanna get friends again - especially after my last real friend died. Do most of the people still know what real friends are tho? Somehow everyone has gotten so fake...
I'm kinda sad right now...the kind of sad, where you quietly cry at night and when u wake up, everything seems ok again...until u realize that every day it's the same.
Whatever... I don't really know what I wanna achive with this text... I really just wanna know, if I'm the only one with such thoughts
