Some shit is going on  Reposted it as I felt a need for paragraph division, as well as some edits and additions. Also, factual errors were corrected.

So basically, there is this girl in my class, she has a very nice personality, but she is a 3 in terms of complexion (however idgaf about that, and her face compensates for that). We were going home once, and since we live on the same line just a couple of stations away, and were going from the same place, we had a chance to chat. And, she has pretty much the same problems as me, as in she thinks nobody likes her, is very concerned about her body shape and stuff like that,Â however, she did have relationships before, so, hey, she isn't as worthless as me!

What she told me, after my shitass attempt at flirting softly, that she liked me somewhat towards the end of April-May, and that, due to her internal problems, she sees me as a choice to date in ca. 3 months! To say I was extremely suprised would be an understatement! But, of course, I wanted to rush it, so I just decided to stay happy and not to let out any desperation.

However, here is the catch: when we go away from school for the day, she hugs everyone, except you guessed who. This continued even after our conversation, in which I talked about it briefly. Also, I have noticed her talking to another guy a lot (although I might just be jealous that she might be dating my bestfriend, ant that she lied to me).

The thing is: I have grown to really like her! It does seem like I blush every time I see her, and when we pass the vapes around in class, I always strive to get her one, as she usually chooses the best flavours (or maybe I'm just blinded by love, which most likely seems to be unrequited)

So let's get to the gist of this wall of text: I think she dislikes me even though she claims to be willing to date me! I don't know what to do! This is my first chance in ca. 2,5 years, and it is going away, and it will!
