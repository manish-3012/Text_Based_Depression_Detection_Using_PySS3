Your opinion on online classes and this system of the education? My isn't currently so positive, so just asking We literally had every online class meeting today (that is why I am so negative), which isn't so good cause we usually have half homework that we need to send and half meets, today it was like horribly annoying just sitting and being "I have no idea what is going on now".
