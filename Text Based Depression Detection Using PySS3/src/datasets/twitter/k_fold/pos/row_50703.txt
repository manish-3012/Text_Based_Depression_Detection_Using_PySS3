i donâ€™t use tik tok but iâ€™m mad at the government restricting it whatever happened to â€œfree speech?â€ or does that only apply when the government allows it? also, it makes a lot of people happy whether you like the app or not. the government takes far too long to (poorly) handle way more important issues like racial inequality and covid but as soon as â€œthe chinese are spying on us,â€ theyâ€™re all too quick to do something about it. itâ€™s such bullshit in my opinion
