Anti-sad/bloated ego post, everyday #5 Comment what you are feeling and I will gladly either help you feel better or kick your ego in the balls, whatever you prefer!

This is meant to be serious as I mean for it to be a place where people can throw what theyâ€™re feeling through to me and Iâ€™ll give them a pat on the back, a nudge, a compliment, anything!

Being a teenager sucks arse and I want to make your days a little, teensy bit better 

(If the mods donâ€™t like me posting this, feel free to tell me not to continue making these posts)
