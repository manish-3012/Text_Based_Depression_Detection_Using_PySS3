online school is actually harder than irl school and it fucking sucks i got to choose if i wanted to go to school or do it online. and i chose online cause i thought it would be easier and bc i hate school with passion. anyways iâ€™ve been only doing it for 3 days and iâ€™ve literally learnt nothing from it. i get 6 classes everyday and as i said i learnt nothing from them. the guy in the video just reads off of the books and think that weâ€™d understand everything (the teachers send us videos and the homeworks bc we donâ€™t have zoom classes). the classes that i canâ€™t understand a thing from them are arabic, science and math. but for english, IS and SS theyâ€™re easy. but still i fucking hate them and want to die. i just started my first lesson and itâ€™s arabic. even tho itâ€™s my mother tongue i still canâ€™t understand shit from it. anyways thx for coming to my rant and have a good day. iâ€™m sorry in advance if this doesnâ€™t make sense. iâ€™m too lazy to read it again. ok bye now
