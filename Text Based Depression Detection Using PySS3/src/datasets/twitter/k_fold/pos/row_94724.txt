Rant about my parents Do yâ€™all ever feel like youâ€™re so scared (idk the word Iâ€™m too tired) of your parents that you just donâ€™t wanna talk to them. Like ever time you talk to them they just say itâ€™s disrespectful and then you get a 2 hour lecture. Like for example my family just got a new puppy and my mom isnâ€™t doing shit to help our with him but she just goes around telling me and my sister what to do like sheâ€™s the expert. And I just donâ€™t even wanna tell her that she isnâ€™t doing anything and that I probably know more that her because itâ€™s just gonna come of as disrespectful to her. Literally nothing I say will come off as respectful and will make it so we have a normal conversation rather than a lecture. Another thing is that whenever Iâ€™m sitting in my room actually busy she calls from downstairs to get her something or to plug in her phone for her when she is literally 5 feet away. Like I would have to go downstairs just to do something for her that would take her 5 seconds. But whenever I do that or even just ask her to grab something for me when she is right next to it she just say get it yourself. Itâ€™s just kinda annoying and Iâ€™m too scared (again donâ€™t know the word) to get a lecture or something to even try and have a conversations. 

End rant
