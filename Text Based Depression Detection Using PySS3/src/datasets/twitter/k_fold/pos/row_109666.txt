Dubstep is one of the best music genres. Change my mind It takes something you already know and love (and sometimes even hate) , blend it up, jam pack it full of energy like a fucking protein shake with Red Bull, making it X100 better than the original

Life is somewhat comparable too. It makes order from chaos, to make something beautiful and exciting
