The small awards are now practically useless Redditâ€™s manufactured inflation really has rapidly deteriorated the value of these awards and what it means to get it.

Donâ€™t get me wrong, an award is an award and Iâ€™m very grateful when I get them, but now the only rewards that really improve my mood is a gold or something like that.

Sorry if Iâ€™m coming off as a choosing beggar, I appreciate your kind awarding and choosing my post to be given an award, I just wanted to rant.
