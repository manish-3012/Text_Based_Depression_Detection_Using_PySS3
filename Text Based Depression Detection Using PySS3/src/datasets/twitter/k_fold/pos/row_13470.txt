I finally found someone :) I think I found someone, sheâ€™s 17 and Iâ€™m 15 which is a big difference as sheâ€™s getting ready for college and Iâ€™m gonna be a sophomore but I care about her, I met her Wednesday night, tonight(Friday) she talked to me about some really personal stuff and I didnâ€™t realize how much I grew to care about her over the last three days. I feel like a mom, telling her to take deep breaths and everything will be ok. But I think Iâ€™m gonna simp boys.

Now I just hope she feels the same
