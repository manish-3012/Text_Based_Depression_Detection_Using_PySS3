A little experiment of mine. I recently made some posts of "true stories." One was a lie about "friends" ( that I do not have) giving me tons of the same award, and the other was a fake story with a rickroll in it. This was a test to see how guillable the average teenager is. No one gave me gold, and only three people clicked the link. One person even figured out the story was fake. The result is, the average teenager is not  guilable. I deleted both posts because of toxic and hateful comments. If you have stopped, taken the time and read this, thank you for reading.
