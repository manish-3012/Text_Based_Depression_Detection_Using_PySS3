Should I skip 3rd period? Classes are 30 minutes. 3rd period requires we be on camera, calls on you randomly to share what you wrote on the homework (entire paragraphs, sometimes entire essays)

I had a terrible week, didn't do any of the readings or homework. I can't play the afk card because I'll be on camera and would die of shame if I have to say that I simply didn't do the work... if I turn my camera off, my grade will be worse than if I didn't attend.

BUT, I've already attended period 1 and 2, and plan to attend 4-7, so he'd *know*
