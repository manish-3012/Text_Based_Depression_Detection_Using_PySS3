I'm just tired I'm sick and tired of everything going on in my life at the moment.

 I got into a good high school, but I'm still struggling to complete most of my assingments. And while I do get good grades, I don't really feel I've earned them.

 I've been trying to lose weight, but breaking my leg caused me to gain all of the weight I lost back. 

My friends are all arguing with themselves, I have nobody to really talk to. I remember when we all used to do stuff together, but that has long passed.

Even the things I enjoyed doing are suddenly unbearable. As much as I love cooking, nothing ever comes out the way I want it. I love drawing, but I'm absolutely shit at it. I was starting to get alright, but due to covid I had to abandon my lessons, and my passion started to slowly fade.

Even my most recent hobby - playing the piano is starting to tire me.

 No one ever compliments me on anything I do (this isn't even an overstatement). I argue with my parents due to my brother trying his hardest to fuck me up whenever he can. It saddens me to see my parents, which I have loved the entirety of my life judge me unfairly just because of my brother's lies.

I have been saving money for about 6-7 years now, just to be able to buy myself a pc. I wasn't given money most of the time, I helped my neighbors which would give me a couple of bucks. And now, when I finally managed to get enough my dad suddenly changes his mind and tells me that as long as he is alive he will not let me buy a pc. He has no good reason to say that - as far as I see.

I'm just generally sick of the entirety of my life - I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, a goal. Please, don't take this as some angsty teen angry at everyone for no reason.
