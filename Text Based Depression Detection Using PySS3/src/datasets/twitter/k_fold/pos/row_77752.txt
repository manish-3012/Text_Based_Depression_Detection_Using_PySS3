Normal school is underated af So recently I had to start going to regular offline school again after about a year's worth of online school and to be completely honest I consider this a complete victory. Like yes, the risk for corona may be higher but... I get to meet friends, goof around during breaks, pay attention during classes cause they no longer are just listening to a teacher ramble on... and most of all it feels so much more natural participate in offline class rather than turning my mic on in online classes. This shit is wayyyy better than online school(especially cause they forced us to keep our cameras on).
