â€œWhen Marnie was thereâ€ is a ghibli film, itâ€™s obviously great But Anna had an entire glass of wine and it took her like an hour and a half to pass out, thatâ€™s unrealistic, sheâ€™s probably like 12 and is definitely no more than 120lbs, Iâ€™m more than twice that weight and when I have one beer I barely stayed awake for that long, and thatâ€™s less alcohol, I know everyone reacts to alcohol differently but thatâ€™s bullshit
