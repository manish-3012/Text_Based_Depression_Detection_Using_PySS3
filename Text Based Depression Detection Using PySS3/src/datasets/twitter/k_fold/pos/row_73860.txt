I just came up with this poem haha "recklessly poised butterflies fluttering amidst the gaps and brushing past my lips 

as letters of adoration mark my teeth 

fullness weighing delightfully heavy in that chasm that is the twisting, interlocking crypt bearing the once boreal corpse 

ripped apart and lit with a singular spark

blazing with both the tenderness and fervent smudge of your inclinations towards me

and i exist alongside you

both content and electrified with being nothing and 

everything at once"
