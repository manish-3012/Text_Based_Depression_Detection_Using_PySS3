Does anyone ever had this experience? So like you try to do something (letâ€™s say lose weight) and you give it a reasoning why you need to do that (for example â€œif I donâ€™t get in shape girls wonâ€™t date meâ€) and then it happens without completing the main task. And you are happy and annoyed that it happened. Anyone? No? Ok have a nice day.
