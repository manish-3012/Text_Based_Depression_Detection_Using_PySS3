Alright you know what, fuck people who responded to my dodgers post on r/dodgers I like the dodgers and all, but seriously why are people on that sub Reddit so mean. If you want to know what Iâ€™m talking about just look at my recent post there. I thought people who liked the dodgers weâ€™re supposed to be cool people and all I wanted to know was who was in the photo and instead of them helping me, 25 fucking people decided to make fun of me. Not one single mother fucker could give a straight answer except a very nice lady who direct messaged me. Everyone else can go fuck themselves, why couldnâ€™t they just answer a simple question. They went out of their way to make fun of a fan who just wanted to know who the person was, and someone even insulted me on my taste in hairstyles. I feel sorry for those fucking losers who call themselves fans. You guys are a bunch of fucking jerks.
