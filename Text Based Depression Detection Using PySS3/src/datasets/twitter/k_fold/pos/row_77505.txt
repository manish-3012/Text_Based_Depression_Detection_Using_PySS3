Thoughts on having a young girlfriend? I'm 17 and I have a "girlfriend" who just turned 14 now. This got started because she asked me out first. For obvious reasons, I didn't take it seriously and said come back when you are older if you really like me. This started around last June and finally, she asked me again after her birthday turning 14. 

I reluctantly accepted it because she seemed almost desperate but I don't even know what I should be doing. To be perfectly honest, she is cute but a bit young for me. Even more so, because I knew her for a while as a family friend, what I feel towards her is more of a little sister kind of attraction, not romantic. Most I've gone is a kiss in the cheek so far.

I don't want this to grow into an awkward relationship and end up breaking up in a bad way. However, I don't want to proceed onwards with this because I really can't imagine doing "stuff" with her. Is it even legal in the first place? Idk but I have gotten some questionable looks from other people when they find out about our relationship. I guess I should just keep it a light relationship for now and maybe consider a more intimate one whe she gets older? Or I should just break up? Either will make our relationship really awkward and definitely our parents' as well.
