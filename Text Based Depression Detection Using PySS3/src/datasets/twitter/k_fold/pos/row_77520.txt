Cloth masks In the UK school is starting relatively soon and idk if it is mandatory to wear masks but either way I wanna stay safe. Does anyone know where I can get some good quality cloth masks in the UK? Rn I'm trying to find some that fit me off of Etsy but to no prevail. Any links would be nice :). I'm 14 m if that matters at all which I don't think it does.
