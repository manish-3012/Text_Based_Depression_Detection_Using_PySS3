Pseudo-Catholicism As far as I know this is Not a real religion and is completely fictional , itâ€™s meant for the world of Willian Noah 

Pseudo-Catholicism is a branch of Christianity that was a part of the Catholic Church , however after the Pope declared controversial statements that contradicted many beliefs of Churchgoers , a large group of people separated from the main head of the Church . The Pope called these groups Pseudo-Catholics , but to his disappointment they happily accepted the name and it stuck with the newfound sub-religion . 

Now there are different kinds of Pseudo-Catholics , but for the most part they follow the same rituals and practices as the main Church , but decline the autocracy of the Pope and believe the head Church to be a desecration of the Scriptures.
