Tips for not sending everything to hell with a girl. I tell you, I have been talking to a girl for a long time through social networks and calls, I think I have seen her only 2 times, this girl is the sister of one of my best friends (This is not a problem since I talk to him and not has a problem), the thing is that we like each other, the thing is that tomorrow I'm going to go to my friend's house and I'm going to see her, and at this moment is when my nerves and self-esteem began to kill me and I began to wonder What if you don't like me like that? What if you are not interested in me? The truth is that these types of questions eat me little by little, what advice would they give me to not screw it up?
