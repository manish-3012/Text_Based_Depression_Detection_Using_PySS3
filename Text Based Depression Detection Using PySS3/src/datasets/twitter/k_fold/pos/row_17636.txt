I'm getting hate for not being efficient in life I rlly screwed my life up. I am 14 and I don't know what I'm doing with my life.I try my hardest to study and still can't perform well regardless of countless hours of putting work into it... Lately,the teachers hate me for not scoring well and this year's syllabus is hard and I'm trying....My classmates just ignore me and whenever I speak to them they just deeply sigh.This rlly makes me upset.I cannot find anything I'm good at ....not even sports

But for the time being I'm gonna enjoy my life regardless of all the hate in school and enjoy the present.I love this community keeping distracted from life problems and I soon hope I can get my life back on track.
