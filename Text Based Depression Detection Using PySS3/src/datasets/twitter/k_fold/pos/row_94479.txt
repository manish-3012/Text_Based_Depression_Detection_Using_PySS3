This may be the stupidest or the most genius idea! I may be a genius but here is the ultimate competition idea. Read to the end tho. Take lets say 3 people have them get in like speedo underwear and cover them in oil, crisco, butter, etc. Then have ten people chasing them. If the ten people catch them in a set time they all win a prize however if any of the oiled up runners makes it out uncaught they win. Put a massive prize for the winners and get everybody really drunk. And then you have the pinnacle of entertainment.
