The Problem With Movies Today      So I've just recently realised why most movies and TV shows are so bad rn, too many movies and shows are focusing way too much on delivering a "message", to support gay people and gender equality. Im not saying homosexuality and feminism is bad, they are just focusing to much on that, and not on the actual story and film and the the quality of it.

     Quentin Tarantinos movies, such as reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, inglorious bastards, and once upon a time in Hollywood, are great examples of good movies. I've realised they put all the work in script writing, acting, and just story telling in general, and don't try to shove this woke culture down your throat. That's why the best movies come from up until the 2010s, though there definitely are some genuinely great movies still being made. 

     This also applies to TV shows, and is probably why shows from years ago that were the best made their decline in the past few years, again shoving woke culture down our throats. Sorry for this.

Thank you for coming to me TED talk.
