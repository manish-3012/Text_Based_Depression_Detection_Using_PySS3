Acting like someone else because you worry about what people think of you is a dumb ass way to live Rant  

I see a lot of people around me worrying about what their friends and people around them think of them. They do things others want them to and act like someone else to impress them without thinking of what they want.

And that makes me really pissed because thatâ€™s a dumb ass way to act. If youâ€™re acting like someone youâ€™re not youâ€™ll never experience the freedom of not giving a fuck about what people think of you.

I have this freedom and I love it. I am 15 years old and I still buy Lego sets and you canâ€™t do shit about it.If someone tries to insult me I think itâ€™s the funniest shit ever, because I donâ€™t care what they think.

For people who care about others opinions abot you: why do you care? Are you afraid that your friends arenâ€™t going to want to be with you because you enjoy (for example) building Lego. Well if they donâ€™t, theyâ€™re a bunch of cunts but chances are that theyâ€™ll just shrug it of and things will continue like normal. And clothes, why the fuck does everyone care about others clothes?! If you want to wear comfy clothes or nice clothes do that, no one it yourself is stopping you. (Well maybe your mom or school)

Loosen up a little start considering what you want, be with people who accept you for who you are, donâ€™t let others opinions change who you are, but most importantly, nice cock bro.

When you truly donâ€™t care what anyone thinks of you, youâ€™ve reached a dangerous level of freedom. -Jim Carrey
