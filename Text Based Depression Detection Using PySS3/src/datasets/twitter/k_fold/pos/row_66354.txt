God dammit it finally happened to me So I was just hanging out with this girl late at night. We were just watching a movie or something, I don't remember which one but that's not important. The thing is I'm just lying in the sofa, while she's like at the other end. All of a sudden she just decides to sit like really close to me, and I just reach up and hug her. I hug her so tight like she's the best friend I ever had, and I felt a euphoria I'd never felt before. She took it really well too, and I figure we both kinda agreed that that was nice and we should like, hang out more.

Eventually I had to go though. Since it was late, my parents wouldn't get me so I had some friends pick me up. We just start driving home until we reach a corona checkpoint. We're just talking about whatever until I realise;

I hugged that girl in my own home, and was going home from my own house. My friends were picking me up at a time where they'd all be sleeping. There was an almost border control-like corona checkpoint.

It was a fucking dream. I'm so fucking dissapointed and sad at the same time. I wish I could hug her, but she's literally abroad right now and might not even come back. I guess one time has to be the first, sadly.
