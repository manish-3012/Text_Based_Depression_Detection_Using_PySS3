Anyone else notice the "born in the wrong generation" comments are always on the most basic songs Like on Bohemian Rhapsody you have these "nO dRuGS 100% TalEnT" types but on deep cuts it's just chill people discussing the song. Same with classical music. I saw people on Joan Jett and The Blackhearts "We Like Rock and Roll" saying they miss this kind of music but honestly who listens to that band lma0. Just a funny observation
