I almost did an oopsy I woke up, got ready and my eyes were still really sore and dry. 

So I grabbed my eye drops and almost put them in my eyes.

They were not my eye drops, it was my eye drop sized bottle of reds speed cream for longboarding...it was scary. I started the drop and saw red on the bottle that triggered a "hey, wait a minute" moment
