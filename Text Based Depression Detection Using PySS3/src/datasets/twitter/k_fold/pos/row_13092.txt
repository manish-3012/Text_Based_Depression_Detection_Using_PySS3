I spent half the night making an app instead of doing homework that is due tomorrow. Iâ€™d say it was somewhat worth it but Iâ€™m kinda screwed since I have to make a website and revise an essay by tomorrow. Or I guess today since its 1:21 am as Iâ€™m typing this. Anyways, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll pull an all nighter to get this stuff done because I canâ€™t use Wix for the life of me.
