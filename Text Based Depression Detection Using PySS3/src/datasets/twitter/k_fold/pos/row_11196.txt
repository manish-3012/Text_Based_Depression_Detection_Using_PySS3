That time I tricked a couple kids into griefing their own Minecraft world because they thought I was a mojan employee Now you might be thinking. Wow, what a dick, thatâ€™s a huge dick move. And youâ€™re correct. But at the time I thought it was ingenious and I couldnâ€™t believe I had gotten away with it. 

Okay so basically I met these guys on cod, I was pretty young at the time. I couldnâ€™t have been older than like 12. So I meet these guys, ask if they play Minecraft. They do, they invite me to their world with this big ass mansion, and I get this great idea. Fool proof idea. Iâ€™m going to pose as a mojang employee. A little twelve year old girl with a squeaky ass voice. And it fucking worked! 

Iâ€™m like, yeah weâ€™re hosting a little competition over at mojang. You have to build the coolest mansion... and then blow it up. This kid gets super excited. I act like Iâ€™m setting up my camera, he starts showing me around the place, Iâ€™m like, â€œoh yeah, Jimmy will really like this, and Carla really likes the color the blue, this is sure to win,â€ acting like I have so many coworkers. So then I help him basically cover the place in tnt, we blow it up, and I tell him to save because it doesnâ€™t count if he doesnâ€™t save. At this point his friend had caught on and was basically begging him not to save. But he saved anyways. I have no idea why.

It was super stupid, and I do feel bad, but it was so obvious that I was some stupid little kid pulling a prank that I just... donâ€™t feel *that* bad. So if that poor kid is reading this like seven years later... Sorry, but... not sorry.
