My dad really knows how to ruin everyone's day ðŸ˜Ž I woke up this morning, I was shirtless because I was on my way to the garage to cut my hair (I have a buzz cut so I cut it myself, it's getting a lil longer than i'd like). So I walk over to the garage from my room, greet them and as im going in the garage he goes "put on a shirt, it's cold out there". I just said "it's ok I'm just cutting my hair" (who tf wears a shirt when they're cutting their own hair it gets all itchy). To him, me just saying that was a "disrespectful rebuttal". As I walk away to go get a shirt him and my step mom are arguing over it and the morning is ruined because they're all pissed off at each other, and I'm just confused.
