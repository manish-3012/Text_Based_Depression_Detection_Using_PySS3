This is for everyone going through rough times right now. Hey, you stopped by for some wholesome stuff. Well here it is.

Have a hug, you need it.

It all gets better. 
Dont worry about the past, you cant change that. 
Dont worry about the future, that's not now.
The only thing you have to worry about is the present. What is happening NOW that you can change? The only thing you can change is the present.

And also have another hug. You need it now more than ever.
