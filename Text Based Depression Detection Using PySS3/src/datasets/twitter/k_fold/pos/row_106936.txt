I deleted TikTok off my brothers iPad Yesterday I walked into the living room where I found my little brother (7) watching girls shake their asses on the iPad screen. I immediately shut of the iPad and scolded my brother, I trusted that he would be safe on the app. A few hours later when my brother was asleep I took the family iPad and quickly deleted the app, my brother was not happy with me, and would not talk to me for the next couple of days. Did I do the right thing?
