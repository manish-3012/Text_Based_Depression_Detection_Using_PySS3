People who live in the US are yâ€™all wearing masks? i just saw a whole tiktok comment section that was against wearing a mask because theyâ€™re â€œagainst your rightsâ€ and donâ€™t save you from covid. thought we all knew that? masks are so you donâ€™t spread your germs and infect other people, especially anyone who has a high risk family member at home. donâ€™t know why itâ€™s suddenly a bragging right to come up with a fake excuse and walk around w/out a mask. they were mostly from the southern states where i guess itâ€™s not mandatory to wear one
