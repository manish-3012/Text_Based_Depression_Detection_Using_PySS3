section 1: costumes

a great suggestion would be wearing costumes where a mask would be part of the costume, like a doctor, patient, etc. so you can wear a surgical mask.

another way of doing things is finding a mask that will fit your costume (ie if you're being a catgirl for halloween, a mask with the kitty mouth would work)

if you are wearing a costume that requires a helmet or mask (ie fictional characters with distinct faces) you can wear a mask under it

and to be safe, if your costume has any kind of gloves, wear protective gloves underneath (wear gloves regardless but still)!

my costume has both a character mask and little fuckin lego gloves, so I'm safe!

section 2: passing candy

do not touch the candy! keep the candy in the bag containing it before you put it in a bowl, if you're not wearing a costume, keep the mask and gloves anyway! And this might seem like the best idea but DO NOT LEAVE THE BOWL UNATTENDED, assholes could steal all the candy if you do that!

section 3: trick or treating

refrain from travelling in groups unless absolutely necessary, DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE FEELING SICK OR HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS, it is HIGHLY SUGGESTED to get tested before Halloween just to be safe.
