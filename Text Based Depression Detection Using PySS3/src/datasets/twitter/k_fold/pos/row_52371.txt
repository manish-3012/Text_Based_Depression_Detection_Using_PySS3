This community is pretty special. I've loved hanging out with this messed up community for one year. What really makes this community special is the posts that die in new here... The good hearted people and the bad who feel sorry. The people who give real emotions, not the fake trending clickbait posts just so they can get recognition.

What I'm trying to say is that the more posts that rise to the top on this sub are purely just how clickbait the post is, not how real or legitimate the people behind it are. 

That's what makes new special here; it's not just clickbait; It's the real deal. Happy, ugly and emotional as it may be, it's the real deal. And I value the real deal a whole lot more than "She said yes to a date!".

Be real, redditors. There's no reason to be you're not on reddit. Nobody knows who you are, but if it's good enough, REAL enough, people will listen.

Or at least I will.
