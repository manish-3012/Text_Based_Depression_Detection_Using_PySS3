Just wanted to get this off of my chest. I am currently 2 hours away from competing in a speech competition, that I never signed up for. My teachers submitted my name to the competition without my consent. Apparently, they had no time to contact me in person, or online. Well, I checked the letters and gathered info regarding the contest, and guess what? They had 10 days to inform me; they never did.

I don't know which subreddit to post this on. I figure this is the right one, cuz I'm a teenager and most of you should be teenagers.

Well, wish me luck. I might provide an update later.
