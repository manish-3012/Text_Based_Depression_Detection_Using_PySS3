My crush announced on her private spam account that she got a date 2 days before I had a chance to ask her and I feel worse than when Iâ€™ve been rejected by other people previously because I never even got the chance Iâ€™ve been slowly getting closer to this girl I met at the beginning of this school year, building up the confidence to finally ask her out. I was never super excited about my chances since Iâ€™m below average in the look department and sheâ€™s about a year older than me, but I figured I had an ok shot since we have similar tastes in anime, music tastes, we both are in band, we watch similar movies, weâ€™re both gamers, and we even shared playlists a few times. 

Today, after a band practice, I was feeling really good about her since we hung out and joked together the entire time. With that and the new medication I was put on for my mental health issues, I was finely confident enough to do it. After I got home I sat down and made a plan to ask her out for coffee and to go to a local place near us to hang out as a date. 

Thatâ€™s when things went wrong. 

I checked my Instagram since I was messaging a friend. I see a post from her private spam account. Someone asked her out and she said yes. 

I feel... crushed. A type of emotional drain I havenâ€™t felt in years. Iâ€™ve been rejected a couple times by various girls for various reasons, and none have compared to what Iâ€™m feeling right now. I didnâ€™t get rejected, my chance got taken away. I had an opportunity and I was too scared to take it because I was a coward who was scared to lose the one person who has brought him a sliver of happiness in more than a year. I canâ€™t stop thinking of her. I have a project due in the morning Iâ€™ve been staring at for thirty minutes because I can only think of her and the opportunity I refused to take. 

But anyways, howâ€™s your guysâ€™ day been?
