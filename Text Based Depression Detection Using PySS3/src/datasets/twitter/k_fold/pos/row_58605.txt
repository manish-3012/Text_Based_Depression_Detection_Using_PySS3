how i lost 50kg hi i am dan i am 14 and was always a fat kid is was around 130kg last year and i felt very tired of people telling me i am fat and i cant move properly so i have realised that i have to lose weight before i have diabetes. I am very dedicated to losing weight i eat less junk food and soda i started eating vegetable and once i am down to 90kg I started to exercise like running. It was very difficult at first but once you get onto it, it feels very good afterwards. i keep losing weight and now i am only 80kg!
