I did a prank on my parents So, basically, I made a fake gmail account of my online school teacher, and I sent this email to both my mom and dad, and the gist of it was basically I was not paying attention in class and that I was distracted. I sent it and then I could hear my dad reading it out to my mom because for whatever reason he got the email first. This prank was gonna be extra spicy because we're an asian family, of course they're gonna go ballistic. So my dad called me into his room, and I just couldn't stop laughing, so I spilled the tea and they seemed pretty worried still. They said because I opened a fake email in my teachers name, something that can be a crime. Now, I'm not sure if it's a crime but I did make sure to delete the email account. Luckily enough, my parent's admitted defeat and they were actually cool with the prank. Idk i just needed to tell someone because it'd be weird to tell my friends this story lol. Wait, you guys are also my friends though...... ah who cares
