I have the best indie anime pitch the world was ever seen. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have since retired from ending worlds, and are now aimless highschoolers who must make their indie rock band successful before the end of their senior year. To fund their band, they have taken jobs at the same Burger King. 

Famine is the chef

War is the cashier

Death runs the drive-thru

And Disease is the janitor

Reddit, give me episode pitches.
