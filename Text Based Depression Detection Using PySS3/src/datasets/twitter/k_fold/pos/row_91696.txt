Calling people a simp for simply trying to be nice to another person is not funny and just annoying 
Iâ€™ve constantly seen so many jokes and people calling other people simps for being nice to a girl. Itâ€™s gotten to the point the the definition has changed, when at first it meant being obsessed with the person and being â€œnice to themâ€ when they in reality donâ€™t care, but now it has changed where if you now treat the other gender with any sort of respect or kindness they call you a simp, or even now where even if you speak to a girl you get called a simp. Itâ€™s not funny anymore hand Iâ€™m sick of it. I wish that we could all learn to treat others with respect without getting made fun of.
