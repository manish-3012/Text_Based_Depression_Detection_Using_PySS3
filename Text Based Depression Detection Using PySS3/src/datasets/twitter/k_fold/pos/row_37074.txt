I don't know if I can go on living this way anymore... I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.

The only thing that gives me joy is buy chocolate from friendly door-to-door chocolate salesmen.

Save me from this insufferable existence.
