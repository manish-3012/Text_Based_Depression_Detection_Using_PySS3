Honestly, seeing all the others on here have happy relationships is kinda depressing Like damn broe, am I the only one here who is never gonna be loved? Hell man, it's a little unfair... man, if I weren't so fucking ugly and awkward, maybe I'd be loved but.... never gonna happen. 
~~damn son, I kinda sound like a whiny little bitch~~
