my case for u/MiddleEarthFellow context: [https://imgur.com/a/IzVbcCb](https://imgur.com/a/IzVbcCb)

alr so i know this person. we've been talking for a while, and i think it's safe to call ourselves friends. she's told me about desperate reddit boys from this sub telling her they love her, while she clearly says she doesn't want any part of it. she's blocked them because it was just weird to her.

please don't listen to random people on the internet without any context or proof. she's a nice person, but a note to all guys and girls: don't go professing your love for people on the internet that you barely know

peace out gamers
