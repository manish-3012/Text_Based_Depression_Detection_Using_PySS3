edgy kid too lazy to go out; cries damn looking at all these people with active social lives makes me so sad. like when they post these dumb thanks 4 the year edits on insta i wanna rip my eyes out because this will never happen to me. I'm so quirky and so emo, jealous all the time for no reason when i could just finally PUT EFFORT INTO SOMETHING FOR ONCE.
