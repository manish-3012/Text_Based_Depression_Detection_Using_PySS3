I went from a ton of stress to being in a really bad situation, to being in a really good situation in the last 24 hours Ok so I'm applying for this big art/high school that I live near (it's like a 20-30 minute drive from where I live) and so for the past month I've been working on an application thingy (idk what you call it) and so  I finished the application and it submitted it to the school last night (today; as I'm writing this is the final day to submit the application for the school) and so this morning I come and I see that the school sent me an email asking me to resubmit the application because one of the files in my portfolio became corrupted, so for about an hour or so my dad and I were freaking tf out because the file kept on corrupting and we didn't know why, (we eventually fixed it, it was a device difference thingy) so after we were able to submit it we send an email asking them if they were able to see the file then; about 45 minutes later the school replies and tells us that they can view it, so now I'm scheduled for a school interview thingy in a few weeks.
