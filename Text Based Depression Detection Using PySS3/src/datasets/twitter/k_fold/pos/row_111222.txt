how do police catch ppl with child p*rn? i was reading an artcile and it had this

"Police said Wednesday the investigation began in September, after they received information about suspected child pornography being shared by a local Internet user.

The investigation led police to identify a suspect, and officers searched a residential address in the 500 block of Leslie Avenue just before 7:45 a.m. Tuesday."

i always wonder how do they catch them? anyone know? And why does it take months to catch them?
