I need some advice. I have a crush on a girl in a lower grade. Iâ€™m in the same grade as her brother, and her brother is one of the â€œpopular kidsâ€. Iâ€™m debating whether itâ€™s worth it to risk my sanity and reputation and try to ask out this girl. Iâ€™m obviously not going to straight up ask her out in the next week. I would have to give it time. But besides that, is it worth it? Btw, Iâ€™m pretty much an outcast, but she is kinda nice to me. 

Tl:dr-Iâ€™m debating on whether to ask out a girl in the grade below because of her mean brother.
