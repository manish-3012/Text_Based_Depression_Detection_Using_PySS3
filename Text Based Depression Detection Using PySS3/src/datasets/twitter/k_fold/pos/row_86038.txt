Iâ€™m sorry for disappearing everybody Iâ€™m back Soo I sorta freaked myself out and was sort of bad mental health for a couple days and didnâ€™t look at reddit but I had messages from people asking about me 

And it just made me cry 

I was really surprised and just shocked that I guess people would even have thought of me or cared enough to check up on me 

Tearing up right now but yes thank you all so much for knowing me or even caring about me I am absolutely taken aback and i appreciate everybody so much more than you know
