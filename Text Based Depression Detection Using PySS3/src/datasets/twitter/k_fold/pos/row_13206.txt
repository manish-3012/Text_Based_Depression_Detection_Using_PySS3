Things about having a short mom that just make sense For record, Iâ€™m like 5â€™8 and sheâ€™s 4â€™11.

-Bending down to hug her
-When she screams â€œTALL GIRLâ€ and thatâ€™s when I know she needs help grabbing something from the tall shelf 
-Her telling me to slow down when we walk together because she practically runs with my average steps
-Adjusting the seats in the car after she sat in it
-If I am able to jump over a puddle, she is not.
-Accidentally kicking her legs when I sit down because mine are LONG
-When she asks to borrow my pants and theyâ€™re super long over her legs
-I canâ€™t take a bath unless Iâ€™m cramped and sheâ€™s like â€œitâ€™s EZYâ€
