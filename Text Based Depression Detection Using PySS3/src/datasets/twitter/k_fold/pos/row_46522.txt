Ok who reported me to u/redditcareresource? I got a message from reddit care resource 20 minutes ago about that i apparently deserve help with whatever I'm going through and that kind of stuff, but i don't see why i would get reported to them now of all times. And i've been going through my latest posts and it must be someone on here. But I haven't mentioned stuff in my life for quite a while now so whoever reported me must have gone through my latests posts and comments. So thanks but no thanks i guess?
