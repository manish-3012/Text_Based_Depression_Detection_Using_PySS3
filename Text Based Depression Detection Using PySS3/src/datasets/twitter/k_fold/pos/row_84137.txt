My crush said YES Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueirism the unwise? I thought not. It's not a story the reposters would tell you. Darth Plagueirism was a dark karmawhore of the reposters, so greedy and so unwise that he could use his phone to influence the Reddit to steal... posts. He had such knowledge of the Reddit that he could even hope that commenters wouldn't notice. The dark side of the karma is a pathway to many posts some consider to be pathetic. He became so karmaholic that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his karma which, eventually, of course, he did. Fortunately, the commenters noticed his reposts, and killed him with OC. Ironic - he could inspire OC in others, but not himself.
