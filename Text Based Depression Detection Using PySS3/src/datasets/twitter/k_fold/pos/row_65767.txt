so iâ€™m a bit of a situation here and any advice helps so I have a friend (13f) and iâ€™m 14m and so I have my 8th grade prom this year. iâ€™m kinda out of options. my feelings toward this girl is kinda weird cause itâ€™s one of those situations where if she asked me out or sum iâ€™d gladly except but if I asked it wouldnâ€™t destroy me or anything. so for all I know iâ€™m already friendzoned even tho I met her like three months ago. we were hanging out and playing among us and she put her head on my shoulder and we were just chilling together but idk if thatâ€™s as a friend or what. I feel like I should tell her but she always talks about this other guy whoâ€™s around my age and sheâ€™s a little sad that the other guy probably doesnâ€™t even know what sheâ€™s like. Iâ€™ve been slowly getting into her DMs and iâ€™ve been ft her but idk if I should tell her. I guess the real question and the question everyone here asks is what should I do?
