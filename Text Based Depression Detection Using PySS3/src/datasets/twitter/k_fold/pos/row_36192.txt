I'm honestly a little scared that not enough people are gonna get the COVID vaccine If you go onto any video about vaccination, a solid 30% of the comments are anti-vax. And I feel like a lot of people have become anti-vax over this pandemic. And shoot I know people myself who are anti-vax. 

Honestly businesses might have to require their employees to get vaccinated if we want a chance of having everyone get vaccinated.
