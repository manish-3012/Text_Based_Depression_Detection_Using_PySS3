Why do anti-theists seem to lack empathy for religious groups? I mean I will admit I went through a phase like this before and do really regret it as I not only hurt lots of people but also myself. When I saw people on here who are theistic I made reactionary responses youâ€™d expect someone like an Incel to make and tried to de-convert people from there religion. Sometimes I even gloated that I have de-converted over 100 people from Christianity to atheism despite me not being an atheist but rather an agnostic/skeptic. Ever since I broke free of this toxic lifestyle Iâ€™ve begun to wonder why anti-theists seem to lack empathy towards religious people and bluntly tell them edgy and sometimes downright offensive things to them? I mean I donâ€™t like lots of religious institutions myself because of the actions they have committed throughout history and have criticized individuals for certain beliefs they hold that are homophobic or racist. Also I civilly debate theists now rather then lash out in a reactionary manner. Where as lots of anti-theists (especially on Reddit) seem to lack empathy to theists. Some even gloat about churches closing over the pandemic and compare theistic people to people with actual serious mental illnesses despite religion not scientifically being a mental illness. Why do you think they are like this?
