I just had someone dm me death threats over me being trans (this is the fourth time this week) and I just want to talk/rant about it I don't really know if this is the right place for this, but here goes

1. I did not choose to be born this way. I would have loved to be born cisgender, but I wasn't, so get over it.

2. Why are people upset about this? I am just living my own life, not hurting anyone else. I just want to be happy, but some people are doing their best to prevent that.

3. Don't you have anything better to do than to dm death threats? Seriously, it's tax season, so please do those rather than sending death threats to me.

4. It's exhausting seeing the sheer amount of shit that's thrown my way. I get this type of thing probably around 2-5 times a week. It never goes anywhere, I always send a few articles about why being trans is natural and how trans people's brains match their gender identities, then I block and report them. You aren't doing anything that hasn't been done before.

Please, I'm sick of this happening. If you're the type of person to send that type of shit, kindly fuck off with your outdated prejudices
