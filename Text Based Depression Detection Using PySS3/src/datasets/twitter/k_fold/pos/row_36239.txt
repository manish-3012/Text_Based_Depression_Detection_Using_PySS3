Do teachers get annoyed at kids who easily get confused? So Iâ€™m doing zoom classes and I keep joining the wrong class due to the whole confusion of thinking it was fourth period since usually my classes go from A, B, A, B onward though it was fourth period and im in class A which confused me and the teacher mentioned this to me many times and I do try in that class,

Though do teachers not like students that are like this, I apologize to much since I get confused very easily.
