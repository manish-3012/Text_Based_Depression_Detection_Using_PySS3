I need some tips on my 5000 word essay Me and my friend constantly ask our teacher if we can have a marshmallow fight in his classroom and he typically says no, but today? Today was different. He told us that if we make a 5000 word essay on why we should have a marshmallow fight, he would take it into consideration. Any suggestions?
