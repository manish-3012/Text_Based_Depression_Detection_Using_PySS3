Iâ€™m getting so sick of Covid My dad lives abroad and Iâ€™m visiting him right now. Iâ€™m leaving tomorrow but I wonâ€™t be able to visit for god knows how long. I already got so lucky I was allowed to fly over this time. With this new version of Covid who knows what will be happening in the coming weeks/months. I just want to give my family a hug, see my friends and to just go back to normal life. Itâ€™s hard for everyone, I know. I just felt the need to vent my sadness I guess.
