Personally, can I say I've seeing people getting confused about my relationship. "You have a girlfriend?"
"Nope"
"Boyfriend?"
"Not exactly "
"So your not dating somebody?"
"I am dating somebody "
It takes them like 15 minutes to guess I'm dating a non binary person. It's hilarious to watch there pain.
