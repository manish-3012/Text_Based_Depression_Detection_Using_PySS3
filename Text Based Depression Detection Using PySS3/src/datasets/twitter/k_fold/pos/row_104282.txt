if i wanted to i could find a way to maximize the odds of getting on hot the post will ideally either be 
1. a meme related to school or joking about being single 
2. a story about something sad that happened to you
3. a story about something funny that happened to you
4. cool art (rarely)

or

5. repost from r/memes 

occasionally  a post will have nothing to do with these categories and tbh those are the best ones
