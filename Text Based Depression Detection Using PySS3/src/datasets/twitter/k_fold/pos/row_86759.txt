My school does temperature checks every morning but the thermometers are never correct so it's just this fake sense of security Every morning you get your temp checked before you're allowed in the school, but also every morning every single person that lines up never had a temperature above like 97, which is already hypothermia levels and not accurate at all. Twice now I've gotten a temperature of 95, and the teachers just act like it's perfectly normal. The temperature checks are a nice idea but with the forehead ones they just don't work at all. It's like the TSA is working at my school like it only exists to make people think they're safe smh
