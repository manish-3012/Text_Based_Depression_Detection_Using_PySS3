I hate my voice in a horrid way, like, abnormally. I got assigned a project for school where I have to talk a lot and edit and stuff and I cN't bear hearing myself, it sucks so much, most people hate it as well, but my hatred for it goes further, like I really can't stand it, it kind of triggers me even.
