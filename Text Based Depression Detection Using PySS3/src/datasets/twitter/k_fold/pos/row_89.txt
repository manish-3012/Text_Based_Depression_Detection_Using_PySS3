Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast/presence? Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television?

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. Iâ€™m sharing an observation and this isnâ€™t an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and thatâ€™s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldnâ€™t usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. Iâ€™ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are â€œnormalâ€ (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 

Maybe Iâ€™m reading too far into it but itâ€™s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. Itâ€™s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when itâ€™s convenient to show that you support an agenda.
