I just told a girl that I liked her and she thought that I was joking.           So texted this girl and told her that I liked her and her the first thing she said was â€œIâ€™m sorry but was that a joke?â€ 

         
          I told her that it was indeed not a joke, and she said she didnâ€™t feel the same way but she applauded the courage it took for me to ask her. 

          
          She told me to have a good rest of of my summer. But she also said â€œ(I still think this is a joke a little bit)â€ at the end.

    
          Now Iâ€™m just sitting here and Iâ€™m not quite sure how to feel.
