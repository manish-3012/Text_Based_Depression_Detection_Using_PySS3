My friends (m) invited me (f) to go camping with them. Now Iâ€™m a little worried. Some of my friends are making plans to go camping or something similar after the lockdowns. Today one of them asked me if I want to join them too. 

The thing is, theyâ€™re all guys and Iâ€™m a girl. The guy who invited me said they werenâ€™t sure if theyâ€™d ask me, because they thought I might get uncomfortable. 
I really donâ€™t care. I trust them and theyâ€™re all very nice people. They said theyâ€™d make sure Iâ€™d have my own room/tent, but I really donâ€™t want that. Iâ€™ve feel pretty excluded sometimes, so I would hate to have to be alone while theyâ€™re all together. 

I donâ€™t want to be excluded, but how do I make it clear Iâ€™m totally fine with sharing a room or something without it sounding weird? Theyâ€™re my friends and I just want to spend time together.
