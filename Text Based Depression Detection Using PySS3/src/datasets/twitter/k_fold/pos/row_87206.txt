Recently the world has been so depressing since there's so little to smile about. But what makes you happy? &amp;#x200B;

[A swing my mom got. She swung on it, sipped her coffee, kissed me, and told me her dream was complete. ](https://preview.redd.it/eol61721m6q61.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eaa609ed5dce7dcfa54388f44387521cc2de2fc)

[We got 15 assorted asiatic liliesÂ \(white, yellow, orange, pink\), 8 bright red asiatic lillies, 3 rainbow dahlias, 40 Dutch Irises, 4 Black-Purple Asiatic lilies,4 tiger lilies, 2 maroon dahlia bulbs, 3 pastel pink dahlia bulbs. All the previous flowers were bulbs. We got an awesome purple pink rose that is kind of different compared to the otherÂ pink and red knockout roses you get. For veggies, we got 3 tomatoÂ plants, 2 strawberry, 2 basil, 2 chives, and 2 sweet mint. We also got a really small house plant. All of these plants \(except the veggies\) are perennials so they'll grow back. From last season, we have 4 purple clematis plants. We got a LOT of flowers since last year we got way too many plant pots.](https://preview.redd.it/lmrzq467m6q61.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a608c01431d1701ca502c1667ce8ccb8402359a3)
