3/12/21 You dont love me

Nobody does

Winged tears of sorrow

Isles of doves

I long for your touch

I long for your praise

But all your words

Create a thick haze

I don't understand you

Or what you want from me

My vision is black and blue

Consciousness drifted out to sea 

Distorted and wrong

Something that doesn't belong

Is floating in my psyche

Throw out the red key

Lock it up

Tighten the chains

Declare respect

And the  kingdom youâ€™ll reign

But youâ€™ll never gain trust

And your mask will fade

Your sinful lust 

Will rise again
