Letâ€™s do a challenge! The SCP Foundation has taken you into custody. You must spend one continuous hour in a sealed room with an SCP of your choice. 

Your selection will not breach containment. Itâ€™s just you and it for 60 straight minutes. No leaving.  

Neutralized SCPs act as they did before being neutralized. Joke SCPs (any with a -J at the end) are not canon and cannot be chosen.

You may not select an SCP already chosen in the comments. 

If you do not know what an SCP is, just comment a random number between 1 and 5000. Iâ€™ll let you know what you are facing.
