Why are girls so mean? All the girls that went to my school would talk crap behind each other's backs. There were only 3 girls that seemed to genuenly get along (my GF and her 2 besties).

The rest of the girls were so fake and ratchet. There would always be a fight between the girls that were friends just the other day. After they would "make up" after the fight, they'd still talk crap behind each other's back. There were so many times where they'd talk all class about how their "friend" is a total bitch or whatever.

The girls would also bully me. I tried to mind my own business, but they would pick on me. My crush didn't bully me though :). She gave me a stick of gum after I asked for it and then I stuck the gum wrapper in my mouth. She touched the gum wrapper. I'm getting all excited just thinking about her dna all over that gum. I wish she gave me her chewed up gum. I should've gotten something more. I threw it away like an idiot. I could've kep it but I mess up as always. I hope I can track her down and ask her out
