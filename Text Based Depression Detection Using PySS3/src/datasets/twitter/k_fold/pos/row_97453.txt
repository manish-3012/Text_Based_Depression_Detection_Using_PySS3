Personal Narrative Essays How come my English teacher thinks that every teen has had a life changing event? We are high school freshman, all Iâ€™ve been doing these 16 years is going with the flow. I havenâ€™t had many choices to make, and definitely not one single life changing event. But apparently I have to write essays and poems about these high emotional times in my life, that I have never experienced. 

Now thereâ€™s a personal narrative due, and I have absolutely NO idea what Iâ€™m going to write it on. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for hours, and I even looked up big events that people go through. Coincidentally, Iâ€™ve never met the love of my life, or gotten married/divorced or graduated college. 

HELP!!
