Writing something positive about my day, day #296 (quarantined on my own day #6) I just wrapped up a fan project Iâ€™ve been running for a couple weeks and Iâ€™m so happy with how it turned out. I had over 100 people join and it was just really amazing 

 (The reason Iâ€™m being quarantined is because I tlaveled from another country so I can attend the boarding school Iâ€™m going to. Itâ€™s for two weeks and Iâ€™m on my own because my parents couldnâ€™t come with me.)
