started dating this guy and heâ€™s so much different now (itâ€™s good donâ€™t worry) iâ€™ve known him for 4ish years total. his personality is (funny) asshole for all iâ€™ve known and i never considered that once he dated someone heâ€™d be excessively sweet and nice and cuddly. did not expect that coming, did not prepare for this lol. itâ€™s nice to cuddle with someone though. it feels nice overall.

and heâ€™s thinking about me. he unfollowed any girl on tik tok or instagram that was a model of the sort. i never planned on talking to him about that stuff. iâ€™ve been working on my insecurities and realized it wasnâ€™t something iâ€™m terribly concerned about, i was insecure about it in other relationships, but i felt secure enough with myself enough this time to just stop caring. but he did it without me asking or saying anything which is...new to me.

and he likes calling me. a lot. a lot lot. as in, falling asleep on call (we used to do this as friends more recently too). 

and itâ€™s kinda funny cuz i feel like iâ€™m shaping him and idk how to handle it. i was doing my schoolwork on call then he saw and started doing the work he was procrastinating all weekend to do. we both ended up being productive. and then I picked up my phone and continued the facetime call in the bathroom where i was getting ready for bed, and started washing my face, and i started talking to him abt the extra skincare i have that he could use if he wanted b/c i have my own prescriptions and he wants to take care of his skin. 

i wanna help him grow as a person and it seems heâ€™s happier these days and iâ€™m so scared of fucking it up. i need to cherish it and protect it
