Is AP Lang really worth it? I'm a sophomore atm and need to decide what classes to take next year. I'm being recommended for AP Lang, however I'm not entirely sure I should take it.  It might just be the whole pandemic situation, but I'm really stressed right now with the classes I'm in already, which are all honors (except history, which I took over summer school) plus choir and Spanish.

I'm doing good in all my classes so far and I want to go to a good college, which is why I'm considering AP lang at all. But I'm scared it's going to be too hard.

Not only that, but  I plan to take AP Bio next year, which would require me to drop my favorite class, choir. Choir is really important to me and I'm very close with everyone there. I was originally planning to take English 3 over summer school, but now I'm not sure since I might take AP Lang.

I should also mention that I had an awful teacher for English in freshman year. I mean, she made me hate English and breakdown multiple times. She's also one of few AP Lang teachers.

Wow, lengthy. Sorry. Should I take English 3 over summer school for less stress and the ability to keep my favorite class, or should I drop choir and just suffer through AP Lang?

TL;DR I don't know whether I should drop choir to take AP Lang or if I should just take English 3 over summer school.
