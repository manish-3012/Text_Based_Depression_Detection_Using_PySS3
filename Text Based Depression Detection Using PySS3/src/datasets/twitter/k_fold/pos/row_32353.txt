Iâ€™m so tired of hearing words like privilege Privileged, racist, incel, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, sexist, etc. I know they have actual meaning but nowadays I hear them used for just the stupidest of reasons. They are so overused and it seriously gets annoying.

And yes I know there will be that one guy in the comments who uses all these words in a sentence. So haha in advance.
