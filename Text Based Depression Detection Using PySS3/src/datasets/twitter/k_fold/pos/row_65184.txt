So I think I fucked up So  recently found out that I accidentally uploaded some of my old documents to this website called Course Hero and I they have my name attached to them on directly on the file name. I filed a privacy complaint in order to try and get the documents taken down. I was wondering if anyone has done the same if so, how long did it take to have them get taken down once you filed the complaint.o
