My former crush likes me back 2 years later 
    Backstory: 2 years ago i had a crush on my neighbor, and I eventually told her. She just walked away without saying anything and i thought i had been rejected once again.

    Fast forward to now she has told everybody she knows that i have a crush on her (which by this time im pretty sure i dont) and keeps saying she likes me back. 2 years to late my **friend** .

    Any advice? This is really bothering me and i dont know what to do. Our parents are trying to get us together and I honestly dont know what to do anymore.
