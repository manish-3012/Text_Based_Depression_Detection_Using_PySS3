I donâ€™t now why I just suddenly got angry   I was browsing r/crushes and found a post about somebodyâ€™s cat dying and her crush just saying, Iâ€™m a dog person and crap. That reminded me of a story of my own. I went on a trip to Sudan with my family, we lived in this huge house because river there we were pretty wealthy, and if you ever went there, you now there would be multiple wild cats. 

    So there was this little cat we found in our house, it was drinking some water that we had, soon, it feel asleep under some wood. While it was asleep we took it inside our house, when it was awake it was quite scared and didnâ€™t trust us, but after we gave it some food and water, it started getting comfy with us. We kept it, vaccinated it, gave it shelter food and water, the normal stuff for pets. 

 Until my shit sister dropped my cat, she smacked it, and It didnâ€™t get back up, though after a while, I saw it in our room, on my bed sleeping next to me, though we I got up, it started running as my parents yelled at me to get it out of the house, I refused, they forcefully threw my cat out of the house, she came back running to me, they grabbed it again and closed the door quickly, I looked for her later, but she was gone. 



     And about 1 year later 



        My parents chose to show my a completely different cat, and claimed it to be my cat, I could imagine it being killed by dogs or dying somehow, but MY PARENTS COULDNT BE NORMAL AND DECIDED TO SHOW ME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CAT. 


      And what did I do? 

    I stayed quiet because my dad wouldâ€™ve yelled at me or just kept trying to say itâ€™s the same cat. 

This pissed me off, and I am in bed right now, with my pillow full with tears. 



    I just want to say to you pet owners out there, keep em safe because you wonâ€™t know how long theyâ€™ll last. Bye
