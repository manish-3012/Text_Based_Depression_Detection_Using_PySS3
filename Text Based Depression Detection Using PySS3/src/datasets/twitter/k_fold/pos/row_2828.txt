I canâ€™t wait until the Christmas season Does anyone else find the month of December to be their favorite time of year? I feel like Iâ€™m just in a positive mood for the entire month and thereâ€™s just a genuine feeling of love. The music is also fantastic and I never get tired of it. Same with the Christmas specials.

But I wonâ€™t let that ruin my Christmas
