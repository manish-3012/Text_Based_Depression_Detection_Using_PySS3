sharing homework w/ "friends" I'll keep this short, but basically among my friend group I'm seen as the "smart one" and I usually get asked to slide homework a lot. I've gotten pretty tired of it and a lot of the time I don't even feel like sharing it, but I feel like I would be letting them down if I didn't. At the same time, I feel like I'm doing myself a disservice, because while I'm doing work on time and actually working hard to do well in my classes, my friends just sit around doing whatever and can get 30 minutes worth of homework done in 10 seconds. How should I approach them when I don't feel like sliding homework?
