Anyone else feel like they're missing out on being a teenager? I've always been super introverted and stuff, so I was never one to go to a bunch of parties, and do all that "teenagery" stuff. And now, with the coronavirus, I feel like I'm losing more of my high school experience. Things probably won't be back to normal for another 2 years, but by then, I'll already be a legal adult :(
