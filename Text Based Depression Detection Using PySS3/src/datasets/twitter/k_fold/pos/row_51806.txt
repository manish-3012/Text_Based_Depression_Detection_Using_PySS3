I swear to god, my mom will never be happy, no matter what I do... So I was a bit tired from writing this book report for my English class, and I just decided to head on YouTube and take a break, read some comments, maybe listen to some music. 

Then my mom comes in, sees me relaxing (for once), and starts getting all freaked out about how I'm going to fail every class this year, and how I'm such a disappointment, and wondering why can't I be a "good girl" and study like my cousin. (Who's going to med school, btw.)

Of course, during the summer, when I spent the entire time reviewing Math concepts, annotating the crap out of my English book, reviewing civilizations of the Middle Ages, and working through my Science textbooks, all she had so say was: "Why are you studying so much? Come and spend some time downstairs with the family!"
