Guys I need help pls I got a project due in 4 days where I have to think of an invention to solve a everyday problem. It would help a bunch if you could comment any  inconveniences that happened to you.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about. One of my classmates thought of a roomba that can mow your lawn for you, someone else thought of a toaster oven in your car so you can heat up your breakfast on your way to school. 

Pls just comment an everyday problem cuz I want to be able to do most of the project by myself.

Edit: someone in another class already made toe guards so you don't stub your toes on furniture, so I can't use that problem
