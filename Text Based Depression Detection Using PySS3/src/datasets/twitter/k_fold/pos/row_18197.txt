It is storytime. So my best friend was hanging out with me. I love her and stuff. She has tik tok. that's fine. however, she may have just crossed the line. Somebody standing by us got rickrolled and she saw it and said, "Oh, that's from tiktok, they stole it and put it into a youtube video!" So that was a fun friendship.
