I've been coposing songs and I finally have my spotify artist page. Hey guys, Neri here, soooo I've been making some music for the past 6 mounths and now I got most of the songs in Spotify, the experience has been great, I know I have a lot to improve, but so far I've liked what I've done. It really be nice if you pass and like just one song if you like and tell me what do you think of them. Thanks guys and stay hydratated.
