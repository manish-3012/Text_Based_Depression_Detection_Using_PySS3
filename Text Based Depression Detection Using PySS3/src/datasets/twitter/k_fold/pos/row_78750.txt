Am I just weird or... Iâ€™m an ambivert and I can already tell that its pretty weird for me. These are all the scenarios Iâ€™ve been in and in every one either my extravert part kicks in or my introverted part does. Talking to girls Iâ€™m extraverted, talking to siblings and cousins Iâ€™m extraverted, talking to older relatives uncles and aunts etc. Iâ€™m introverted (this includes parents too). Now talking to random people Iâ€™ve never met is probably the weirdest one of them, depending on what theyâ€™re looks, age, and gender depends if Iâ€™m extraverted or introverted. Talking to friends, I can only think of two friends that I can talk to without being introverted, and I have a pretty decent amount of friends too. Is this just me or am I just weird.
