Odd question! Okay, so tonight my mom takes me out into our yard and there are so many earthworms on the surface of the ground. I'm talking like, an earth worm every 5 inches or so. The ground is dry. Does anyone know why this is? I posted here because idk teenagers have such niche intrests and also, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU ALL AWARE THAT I SAW OVER 30 EARTH WORMS IN THE SPAN OF ONE MINUTE AND THATS WAY TOO MANY.
