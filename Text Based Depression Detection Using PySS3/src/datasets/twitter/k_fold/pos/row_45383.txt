How should I ask out the girl I like? Story time: There is this girl I know her name is Kira. She's been friends with him and I for a while. Recently she ended a relationship she had. I've liked her for a while now but now is the perfect opportunity. Story time over. I've been thinking about this for thirty minutes or so and came up with: we are both in the singles club right? Well I say we peel outta this club together. Let me know what you think pls.
