TikTok is disgusting. In the past 6 months of me using TikTok Iâ€™ve seen someone whom killed themselves because people blamed them with their past mistakes then celebrated after the death of that specific person, wishing for death of someone because they did a bad acting of an anime character, witchcraft/hexes with bad intentions posted â€œaestheticallyâ€, and a person getting doxxed because they wonâ€™t post their secret coffee recipe and then getting called it cultural appropriation because they canâ€™t post the recipe even though the people of that specific culture says it isnâ€™t, over-sexualisation of children, and more horrible things.

TikTok is a great platform to create content, however it is full of toxicity and pretentious shit.
