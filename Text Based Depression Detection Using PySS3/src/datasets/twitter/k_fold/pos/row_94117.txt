Time just moves so fast Itâ€™s just unbelievable how fast my teenage years went by, I know everyone may not be able to fully relate to me but If I think about it, I actually enjoyed by teenage years. I met tons of new people in high school but most importantly I stuck with the same group of 3 friends like I had in middle school. 

It felt like yesterday that I was just starting high school and now Iâ€™m here, anxious for universities to accept my ass. Idk, the more I think about it like the more sad I feel, the group of friends that I stuck with for my whole childhood is finally splitting apart, yeah yeah thereâ€™s FaceTime and Snapchat and all that but it wouldnâ€™t be the same as seeing them in person. I would just think about the times where we all asked to use the washroom just to roam the halls at school, all those fun lunch breaks. Omg this is gonna make me tear up...

But my point to all of you guys that are whether youâ€™re in high school or going into high school. Please cherish the moments. Meet new people, be positive and live in the moment. High school can be one of the best experiences in your life but that all depends on how you make it!!!
