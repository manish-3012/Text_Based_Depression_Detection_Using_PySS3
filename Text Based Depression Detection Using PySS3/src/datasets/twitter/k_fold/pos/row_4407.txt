(TW: suicide) How to talk to my friend in a hospital after an attempt Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t know where else to ask but I need some help. 

A very close friend of mine recently went to the hospital after wanting to commit suicide, they didnâ€™t do anything thankfully and are okay and they wanted me to visit (their mom contacted me, they donâ€™t have their phone) and Iâ€™m planning on going ASAP so tomorrow however I wanted to know how I should talk to them. So I plan on being normal, positive. Planning on bringing some cookies they like, my switch to play some video games, my comp etc just some nice fun things and Iâ€™m going to try not talking about anything to dark/serious. I also made them a card just reminding them how much I love them and how much they mean to me. 

I just wanted to know if anyone has any sort of advice and if I shouldnâ€™t do something or should, maybe avoid saying certain things? Anything would be helpful because I donâ€™t want to accidentally do/ say something that could inadvertently cause harm. Thanks.
