I want to come out to my grandpa but I'm scared. I live with my grandpa, and hes amazing. I want to come out to him because I feel that it's time but I genuinely dont know how he'll react. He usually reacts positively to homosexuality and hasn't openly mentioned any hate for it, but he was raised very conservatively (as was I, though i dont act like it :P) and he might be dissapointed in me. I cannot come out to my dads side of the family because they would immediately disown me (it happened to my cousin) so Idk what to do. Help?
