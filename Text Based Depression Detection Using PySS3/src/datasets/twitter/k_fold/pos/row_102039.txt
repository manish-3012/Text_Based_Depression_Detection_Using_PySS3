I Need a Job. Iâ€™m Sixteen. 
My parents are no help. Iâ€™m sixteen. Iâ€™ll have to work. Where I live, thereâ€™s next to nothing for work. Until I drive - which my parents wonâ€™t let me - which will be eighteen, Iâ€™ll have to work to work.

Thereâ€™s a grocery store an hour away. They donâ€™t have any part-time jobs on their website. If I email them asking if they have any part time jobs that a sixteen year old can have, do you think thatâ€™ll work?
