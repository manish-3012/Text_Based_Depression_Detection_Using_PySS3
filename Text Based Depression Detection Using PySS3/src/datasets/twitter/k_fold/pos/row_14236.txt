Why do people care about harry potter so much? Like people are obsessed over it and I don't get why, it is just some book series from the 90s like c'mon smh.

and people also go crazy over J. K. Rowling too like yeah I get it they aren't the most liked but if you keep going on about it you are adding more fuel to the fire.

Only thing ik about harry potter is like the movies and that is it.
