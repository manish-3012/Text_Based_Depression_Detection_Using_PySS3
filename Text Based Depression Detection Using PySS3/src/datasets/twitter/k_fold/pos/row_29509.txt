Question from the education space Hello /r/teenagers !

With many schools moving to remote learning, I wanted to get a sense for what some teachers are implementing that's actually effective for high-school students. I'm much less interested in the teacher's perspective than the students so. Some questions I'd love to hear from you all on:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is there a particular teacher who is killing it at remote learning? What makes their process so much better than your other teachers?

\- Are there any in-class tools / software that are actually enjoyable to learn from?

\- For those teachers who are not transitioning well to remote learning - what's the main issue from your perspective?
