I'm messed up Hello people. I have a big problem and I don't know what to do with it, I have a girlfriend, she sadly lives in another country. I do love her! Two weeks ago there's a new girl comes to our class. I think I feel the same to her... And I don't know what to do now! I guess I love both of them but, I think I need to stay with the only one. The new girl seems like she likes me too. Today I chatted with her, she said that 'People say you like me' I responded with a no. I just want an advice or something, what do I do?...
