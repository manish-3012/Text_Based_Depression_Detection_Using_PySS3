My friends and teacher heard my parents arguing while in online school. I want to die So basically my computer or microsoft teams  glitched out and I wasnt muted even though it said I was. My parents don't usually argue, but when they do it's bad. So pretty much I just started recieving a lot of messages and when I looked at my phone it was in the group chat people laughing at me. To make it even worse this is my first year of high school. Now i'm fucking embarassed so much I went into the settings and completely disabled my microphone so when teachers ask me something I have to act dumb and type messages that either it's broken or that my internet is trash. I'm still in class but I'm just not following along. I wanna escape through videogames but I know at least someone from my class will be online and enter my party and I just don't feel like talking to any of them. Nobody in my house is talking and I just want to die
