i havenâ€™t been happy in months i just havenâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been getting progressively more unhappy. I tried. i thought what i needed was to talk to new people and it worked for a second, these two really nice girls seemed happy to talk to me it was fun they were new people and then they met my friends and now they both only talk to my friends instead of me. i just canâ€™t take it. i canâ€™t. i canâ€™t sit in my room and do nothing and be alone with my fucking thoughts the only thing that i ever do is get high and cut myself i canâ€™t do it. i donâ€™t know what to do because everyone i try to talk to just ends up not wanting to talk to me i donâ€™t get it and i donâ€™t have a solution. i donâ€™t enjoy video games anymore the only thing i enjoy is skating and even that i donâ€™t because i live in a city where everyone skates and theyâ€™re all better than me and iâ€™ll go outside and iâ€™ll see people i know and theyâ€™re skating and they say hi and i say hi and we talk and i just embarrass myself. this is hell. i donâ€™t know what to do i canâ€™t do any of my school work because i canâ€™t pay attention in any of my classes my parents are mad at me. every time i go outside i feel like everyone around me is watching me and they all know something that i donâ€™t and theyâ€™re laughing at me because of it, like iâ€™m out of the loop on something and everyone around me finds it funny. i only skate at night now but my parents want me back home by 11 so i donâ€™t really have much time anyways.
