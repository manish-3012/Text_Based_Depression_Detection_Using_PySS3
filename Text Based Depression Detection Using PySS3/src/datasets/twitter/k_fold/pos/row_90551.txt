About my Brotherâ€sâ€ I have two 18 year old â€œbrothersâ€(I one of them is my actual brother, the other is our really good friend whoâ€™s been staying with us since about mid March), we share a not that big room and they donâ€™t clean up after them selves so itâ€™s always a mess. I have a twin sized loft bed with a desk underneath so that I have some space in the room, they use the space cus itâ€™s a seating area kinda. They have a twin sized bunk bed that me and my brother shared before he moved in. I got a very small fan that I put in my bed because it gets kind of hot, I barely use it anymore because my brother got a larger fan for the room. Itâ€™s always running. Itâ€™s now cold every night and itâ€™s very annoying. They were supposed to find a place around where we live to rent and they said that theyâ€™d be out by April, it is now very much past April. They are both terrible at saving money. My brother had a 1970 skylark that caught on fire in a parking lot. Insurance paid him about 12000, he bought another car for 2000. It was a pretty nice bmw that he got run of the road and broke the axle and a few other things(he wasnâ€™t injured at all). He wasted all of the insurance money he got and now has little to none idk anymore. Our friend recently got a job as a host and he makes a good amount of money but he keeps spending it. I just wish theyâ€™d find a way to move out. After my brother crashed the second car he rushed to buy an new one(also a bmw, but this one was modded for drag racing) it stopped working on the drive home, and while it runs slightly right now, it is uninsured. He also bought a Saab when the 2nd bmw stopped working. That doesnâ€™t run because it needs anew radiator. Idk how to deal with it anymore, but Iâ€™m done with his bs. I just wish theyâ€™d move out already. 

Sorry for no timeline, Iâ€™m tired right now
