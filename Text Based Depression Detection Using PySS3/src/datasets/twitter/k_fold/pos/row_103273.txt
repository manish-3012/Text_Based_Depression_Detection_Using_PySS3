18 with no job, no license, still living with parents. Anyone else in my situation? I turned 18 back in November of last year, and Iâ€™ve been dreading the day when I turn 19. I feel like a manchild already, I feel less when compared to others. I take responsibility for not doing much, and itâ€™s not anyone elseâ€™s fault. 

I do have a plan to get things done like getting a job. But for some reason it feels as if I let down others because of my irresponsibility.
