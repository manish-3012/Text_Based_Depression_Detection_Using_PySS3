Am I the only one or ? like if people starts showing genuine interest in me (be it platonic or romantic) and they genuinely care for me, want to talk to me, want to spend time with me, i start to wonder why they want to do those sweet things to me lol

i'm also naturally distant to even my close friends and i don't know why...it broke a lot of friendships in the past, i'm surprised there are people who are still willing to stay
