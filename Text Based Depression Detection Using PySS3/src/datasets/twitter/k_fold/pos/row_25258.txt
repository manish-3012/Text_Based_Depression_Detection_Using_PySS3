funny thing that happend today my dad was picking me up from school he noticed a truck next to him and the road closed into one lane after the traffic robot so he said I need to pull out fast. he then went in front of the truck and said sorry truck but I pull out faster to make matters worse because we are in a Chevrolet spark he thinks it's a small car he says that's the good thing about being small. I was laughing to hard on the inside I nearly blurted OK goodbye now
