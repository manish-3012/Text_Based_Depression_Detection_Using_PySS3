Should I make a dream Journal? I mean sometimes dreams don't appear, but these last few dreams have been.......weird.

Like one of them was in a zombie apocalypse type of thing, and I saw a person getting crushed in half, coughing up blood and another person eating a severed human foot in a metro tunnel. Then it ends my **Ronald McDonald going down some apartment stairs and saying Oh McDonald's.** 

And then another one is where I'm like reliving a memory, but I know it's a dream, and I know that the place that I wake up is so horrifically bad. Like a mob taking over places and killing random people. And I don't know how to get out of it. 

But some are pretty good and wholesome...ish. This one I stopped at a shop near a train station and I saw a friend and decided to stop by, but then I saw there was someone trying to kill me. 

All of these dreams are weird. And it started happening 3 days ago, 1 for each day. First one was the apocalypse, then the train, then the mob thing. 

I don't know why I remember those dream so fondly. Maybe because I haven't had dreams in a long time, but usually there supposed to go away in 10 seconds or something after waking up. 

Anyway should I make one or nah?
