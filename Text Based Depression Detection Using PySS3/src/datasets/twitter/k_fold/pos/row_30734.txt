I'm trying to become rich and successful To be precise, a rich and successful rapper. I've been slacking a bit on my grind past few months, but I'm trying to pick myself up again. I may not be grinding as much as I want because of school, but I have to still grind more. I practice music everyday, I mix things, I freestyle (i need to do that more), I go to discord and give people reviews on my music, I use positive affirmations etc. I'm doing this in hopes that I'm living my dream life by the time I'm 19. 19 is the perfect age for me to have my life the way I want it, but I'll keep grinding even if I don't make it by 19. But yeah just wanted to make this post. If you wanna check out my music, ask in the comments
