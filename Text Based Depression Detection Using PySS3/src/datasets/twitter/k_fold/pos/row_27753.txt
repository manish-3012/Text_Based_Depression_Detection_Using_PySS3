Ukrainian here. I canâ€™t explain how much it embarrasses me and hurts me to have to explain to privileged Americans why communism is bad. I was born in Ukraine and was there for 4 years. I have faint memories there, but those that I do have were awful. Family was poor, government was corrupt, food shortages everywhere, 20 years after the fall of the soviet Union. If that doesnâ€™t say anything to you about communism, idk what does. Please drop the communist ideology.
