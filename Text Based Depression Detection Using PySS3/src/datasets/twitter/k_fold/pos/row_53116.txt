I can't do it anymore. I'm so close to completely giving up (academic) I don't know how many of you take the british cambridge system, but here goes. In OLevels I got pretty good grades, I worked hard but not way too much. Now I'm finally in college/grade 12/ALevels, and all my tests have gone badly, and I'm averaging Cs everywhere. I feel worthless. I don't know if I can even come back from this by the end of my semester. I have a multitude of possible reasons of why I might've done so bad, but I always come to the same conclusion: in the end it's my fault, because how are others coping w the pandemic and everything being online and I'm not.

I can't do this. I'm so tired. I spent 2 weeks losing sleep and eating less studying my ass off for my last test week and I just got my results and I got terrible. I don't know anything I just know I can't do ALevels. I'm so tired. 

Sorry for ranting here, just had to get it out somewhere. I'm angry but I don't have any energy to be angry. If I miss one fucking day I'm at least 3 days worth of work behind (no joke). Every day we get way too many and lengthy assignments which aren't even possible to complete in one day unless you dedicate the ENTIRE day to it. I've got about 21 more maths questions left but I think I'm just gonna go lie down and possibly fall asleep. I'm so tired.
