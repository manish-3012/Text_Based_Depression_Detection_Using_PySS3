My band director just obliterated this kid For context, we had bell covers and this kid was a trumpet player. He had his mask on, but he was wearing it above his mouth to play. He had the mask on his nose and very close to his eyes. When we finished a song, the band director looked at him and deadass said â€œI like your mask, itâ€™s a big improvementâ€ and this 5 foot 8, 160 pound trumpet player just started crying and ran out of the room.

The director just stood there like â€œdid I just do thatâ€ as everyone just stared at him. One of the trombone players left the room and tried to find him. About two minutes go by and both of them walked back in like nothing happened. We just started playing again.
