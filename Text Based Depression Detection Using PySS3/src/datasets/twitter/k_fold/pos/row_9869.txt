Does anyone else feel like theyâ€™ve been told all their life to try harder and that only if they werenâ€™t lazy But then you feel like you legitimately try and no one believes you? 

I feel like Iâ€™m always told â€œIf only you werenâ€™t lazyâ€

â€œyou just need try harderâ€

â€œYou just need to pay attentionâ€

â€œitâ€™s the damn phone youâ€™re on all the time and thatâ€™s why you canâ€™t sleepâ€ (mind you my internet turns off and I have screentime on my phone)

â€œyou donâ€™t want to be better because if you did you would beâ€

I feel so tired and so stressed all of the time with no way out except that â€œIâ€™m not pushing myself hard enoughâ€ or â€œIâ€™ll always be a failureâ€ 

Idk Iâ€™m supposed to be getting therapy soon for anxiety/depression. Itâ€™s gonna be awhile before I can talk to a professional but I just hope whatever happens my mom and stepdad will be more supportive than they have been so far
