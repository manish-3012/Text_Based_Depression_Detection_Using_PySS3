Just wanted to spill semi-emotional stuff in front of random strangers about a friend I had for 2 years. Being that socially anxious, quiet kid in the class isn't pretty easy, especially in a class full of TikTok girls and chad-ish Fifa boys, when most of them didn't like me at all, and I not them.
I just wanted to say thank you, for showing me I actually have a friendly face in that weird school, where I pretended to be friendly with some people just to not get on the bad side of them, and I had nothing to do at home except playing video-games.
And when I finally left that school, that region, to start a new page, I thought you would stay with me, that we would keep talking like we used to, you making me mad with Hollow Knight, converting my name to emojis on purpose (which was VERY weird btw), and especially all that okbr shit, but thank you anyway Ethan.
I didn't tell you in a PM because you would just brush me off again and make me feel a bit bad again, or come up with a fucking excuse of "I'm busy."
So, if you will somehow see this, Thanks Pointy-Chin.
