How to make time for myself while living with my parents!! Basically I have this issue with my parents where they make me do literally everything in the house, even though I have a sister that is fully capable of doing the same things as well. I have to help my brother with school even though he is as well fully capable of doing so. The reason they ask me to do/search/fix/make/etc everything is because they now I really to to figure things out when problems are presented to me, contrary to my siblings or mother, where they are like â€œI donâ€™t know how to do thisâ€ when they havenâ€™t even tried to do so. Since I was younger Iâ€™ve liked to try to do everything myself. I want to start to do something with my life to not waste my time but I literally canâ€™t because I get interrupted every 10 minutes. I want to move out but I donâ€™t really have money to do that. I was thinking about pretending to have online classes for X university so my parents know that Iâ€™m busy and they are forced to not bother me. Of course this would be fake and I would use that time to do what I like to do without interruptions. Is this a good idea?
