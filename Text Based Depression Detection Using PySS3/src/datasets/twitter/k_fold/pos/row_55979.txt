Emotional Intelligence Survey Hello r/teenagers! I am a fellow teen doing a school project study to determine whether emotional intelligence varies between introverts and extroverts. 

For the study if you could first fill out a consent form alongside your parent/guardian to approve this study, then start the actual study by taking the introversion/extroversion survey to determine which group you fall into, then follow by taking the emotional intelligence survey. Both of them are around 30 â€“ 40 questions long I believe, and all results for the surveys will remain anonymous to both me, and everyone else viewing the study. 

Regarding the introversion/extroversion survey it says that you will need to pay 6.00 something dollars for the full answer, however I can get everything I need from the free snapshot it gives you lmbo, to know your results 0 â€“ 49 means introverted, and 51 â€“ 100 is extroverted (50 is ampiverted). 

For the second survey there will be more detail in the description of the survey, but the questions will be in the form of statements, and you will answer them by ranking from 1 â€“ 7 based on how much you agree with said statement (low being disagree, and high being agree). Of course if you have any questions, concerns, or want to leave the study just comment below and Iâ€™ll respond as soon as possible.

Thanks for the help, and I understand however if you donâ€™t wanna participate.

Here are the links for the surveys and consent form:
