I might get downvoted for this but i want to share my opinion... I actually hate doggos, well i mean, I don't hate them like : ,,kill them all" or something like this,
I just... Don't like them, for me they aren't really cute etc. I mostly hate them because I am scared of them. Why? When I was like 4-5 years old, there was a guy in our town that always let his dog run to people etc. Even to kids like me,
Then, this dog was like 3 times taller than me, so thats why I hate dogs... I am just really scared of them.
hope i don t get downvoted :)
