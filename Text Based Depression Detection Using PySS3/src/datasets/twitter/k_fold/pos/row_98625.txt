I (M18) am in love with my best friend (F19), what should I do? So I have my best friend, she ticks all the boxes and is basically the perfect girl for me, but she said that she takes a long time to develop feelings and truly trust someone, I am her best friend though so she does trust me a lot (she has had a rough past so I understand why she does take a long time to do so, because she trusts me she told me about said rough past and it's stuff she hasn't told anyone else outside her fam). But I'm a person who needs that affection, so I've been patient for a while now and it's really starting to get to me. I just need some advice on what to do. Thank you

Btw yes she's 19 and I'm 18 but she was born in December of 2002 and I was born in January of 2003 so we're not far apart age wise, and we're both at a similar maturity

TL;DR: I have a best friend, she is the perfect girl for me, my best friend can't develop feelings quickly, I'm a person who needs affection, what should I do? Thank you
