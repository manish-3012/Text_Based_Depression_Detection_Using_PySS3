Anyone else automatically feel sorry for a fellow redditor whenever they state they're female? The amount of times I see female redditors talking about how they constantly get harassed in dm's whenever they make a post that includes the fact they're female is shocking. In fact its gotten to a point now that whenever I see someone say they're female in a post I automatically feel sorry for the amount of creepy dm's they get, and I was just wondering if anyone feels the same?
