If a white person describes something as "ghetto" are they probably racist? I'm well aware that most people on Reddit are white lmao and probs on this subreddit in particular as well, but I'd like to know what you guys think - if a white person describes a school as "ghetto" is it likely that they happen to be racist?  What are your thoughts on this topic in general?  Let me know, I rlly want to know
