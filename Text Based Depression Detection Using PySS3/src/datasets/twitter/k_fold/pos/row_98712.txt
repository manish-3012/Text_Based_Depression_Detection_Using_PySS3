How to spot a fake apology (most of the time) Hello there r/teenagers today I want to share some wisdom. How to spot a fake apology. Now these donâ€™t always apply but most of the time they do, I mainly want to share this so that you know when people are genuinely trying to apologize to you.



1.Where they do it. If they are apologizing in a group chat with all your friends, it might be a fake apology. Usually it should be done in private. Doing it in a group chat is basically saying â€œhey guys look I apologized you can all stop being madâ€ like I said it wonâ€™t always apply, for instance if they tried to apologize in private but you wouldnâ€™t let them.



2.if they try to shift the blame a little. This one I feel is like itâ€™s hit or miss. Some people just naturally talk this way without intending to be rude. If they say things like â€œwell YOU didâ€ or â€œWell you kindaâ€ they are trying to shift the blame onto you so that it seems like what they did was justified or so you feel like you should forgive them because hey maybe it was your fault, but it wasnâ€™t



3.The reason theyâ€™re doing it, if theyâ€™re apologizing so they can be let back into the friend group or so they can be reinvited somewhere, it might be a fake apology. If they really wanted to stay in the friend group they wouldnâ€™t have done that thing to you, and if they are let back in that just gives them the chance to do it again. If they did something and you uninvite
Them somewhere like your birthday or your wedding and they apologize to get back in are they doing it so they can spend time with you? Or so they can enjoy lazar tag?



Here are just some things you can spot, like I said if they do 1 of these itâ€™s not guaranteed that their apology was fake, but if they do all 3 or 2 of them it could mean that. I just want to people to learn to spot these so that they donâ€™t get stuck with toxic people
