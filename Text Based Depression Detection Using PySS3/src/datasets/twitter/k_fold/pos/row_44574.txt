Vote For Pedro! Student Council started at my school this week and as a prank I started to hang up posters on our schools walls that say â€œVote For Pedroâ€. This is a reference from the movie *Napoleon Dynamite.* Most people knew I was the one putting those posters up. Lots of people kept saying â€œVote For Pedroâ€. Now I genuinely think that I will be voted even though Iâ€™m not even running for student council.

TL;DR I put up posters referencing a movie and now I might get voted for student council president.
