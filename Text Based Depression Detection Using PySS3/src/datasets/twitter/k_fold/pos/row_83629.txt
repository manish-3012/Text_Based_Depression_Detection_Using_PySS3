[TRIGGER WARNING] What are your panic attacks like? I get this feeling if I stand too long or if Iâ€™m in crowded places that I might fall. Itâ€™s not dizziness but more of an imbalance. 

Aside from that chest discomfort and just feeling like I cant take a deep breath. 

I always feel like my health isnâ€™t good even though the doctors have checked me and gave me a clean bill of health. There always a feeling that something is wrong.
