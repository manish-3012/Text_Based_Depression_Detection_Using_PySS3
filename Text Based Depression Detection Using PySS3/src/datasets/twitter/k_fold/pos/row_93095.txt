Survey on the Experiences of Social Media of Teenagers (Please Read fully) Good Day dear subbredditors,

I'm a student and am currently writing on one of my final papers I have to submit to graduate from school before going to university. I am writing on the topic of "**Social Networks and their influence on Generation Z**" and wanted to do a survey, asking teenagers about their experiences with social media. And my first thought was to collect data from people on this subreddit, since there are (hopefully) only people belonging to the age group I'm targeting (not older than 25) and I expect everyone on here to use some form of social media (since you all use Reddit).

The Survey itself has been **approved by the moderators** and takes not more than **5-10 minutes** of your time. There are **only multiple choice questions**, meaning you don't have to write anything. The data itself can't be tracked back to any individual, since **I won't be asking for any form of identification** (Name, Username, etc.). I am only asking for age, gender and continent you live on, since I need to present the results and I need to know how many percent were female or male, and how old. (Again, all of this can't be traced back to any individual, it is for statistical purpose only).

I am hoping to get enough responses on here so that I can actually use this survey in my work, and I believe that this community can give enough responses if this gains enough traction. From previous experience I have seen more girls participate in these surveys, so **I am also urging boys to do this, since I am aiming for approximately a 50/50 distribution.**

**Again, I want to thank everyone who will take their time to participate in it, and I want to thank the moderators for approving this and giving me the opportunity to do this.**

Have a great day,

A Fellow Teenager
