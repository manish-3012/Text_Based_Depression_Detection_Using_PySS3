Since you guys enjoy anything After an 8 hour shift at Wendyâ€™s I got to take home all the nuggets after closing and try all the sauces, ranked from best to worst

1- bbq sauce, sweet and not to tangy, right amount of smokiness and not too much brown sugar, great with anything we have 10/10 would recommend 

2- ranch, I mean, you canâ€™t really go wrong with ranch. 9/10 would recommend 

3- honey mustard, very interesting this one, more mustard than it is honey, so truly a sweet mustard with some tang, 8/10 would recommend 

4- creamy sriracha, a little too much of lasting spice that doesnâ€™t balance well with the sweetness but good substitute for buffalo sauce, 6/10 would recommend 

5- sweet and sour, eh, not much to say except like, why? We donâ€™t even have anything that goes well with it? And much too sweet, taste like syrup with some critic acid 4/10 would recommend

6- side of sâ€™awesome, no. Disgusting. Taste like a bottle of mayo hate fucked a bottle of ketchup and then had an affair with some ranch. 1/10 would recommend
