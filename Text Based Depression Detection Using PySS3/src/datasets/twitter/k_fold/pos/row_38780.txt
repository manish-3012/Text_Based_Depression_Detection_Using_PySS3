What is wrong with you You know the guy that edits himself into memes? Heâ€™s done. He got tired of getting messages telling him to kill himself, and messages asking for nudes. He got tired of idiots completely disrespecting him, and I donâ€™t blame him. He pushed through a lot of it, more than I ever could. 

You know, he brought a lot of joy to my mornings. Seeing someone I admire every day have a good time and make people happy. 

But that wasnâ€™t quite it. Every time he posted, some dummy would ask him to send nudes, or tell him to kill himself. It didnâ€™t make him happy at all. 

Reddit, why are you this way? Why are some of you assholes who canâ€™t bear to withstand joy? Why are some of you perverts who ask for nudes from teenage boys? 

I ask of anyone here right now who has experienced it, to not be afraid. To stand up for yourself. I ask anyone here who is a pervert, or a terrorist by asking kids to die, to find help. Find help, because what youâ€™re doing is disgusting, and it needs to stop.
