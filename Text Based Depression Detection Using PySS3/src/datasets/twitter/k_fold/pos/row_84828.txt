This article is actually really interesting about political views &amp; college education [https://www.npr.org/2016/04/30/475794063/why-are-highly-educated-americans-getting-more-liberal](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/30/475794063/why-are-highly-educated-americans-getting-more-liberal)

What I find most interesting, is that besides the massive liberal skewing specifically in recent years of people who get college degrees, but rather the consistency of conservatives between college educated levels. The in-the-middle mixed people nowadays become liberal and the liberals become megaliberal, but the people who answered as either conservative or very conservative, between the different levels, it stays roughly the same. And it applies for all of the different times as well, it's consistent.
