I know nobody cares but... I just hit 175 subscriber on my youtube channel! I had 16 subs half an hour ago until one of the shorts i posted went semi viral and people suddenly started subscribing! I cant believe it, especially because my content isn't even that good but I haven't felt this much excitement in a while so I thought I'd share here! 

- tip for anyone doing youtube: post shorts relating to your niche, the algorithm seems to promote them much more than normal videos for smaller channels and they can lead to lots of growth as i just learned. This was my second short to get more than 100 views and i just started youtube a few days ago.
