Iâ€™m deciding to be a better person. I will be doing everything I can to become the person I want to be, I hate the person I am so Iâ€™ll change that. Right now Iâ€™m focusing on my mental health and grades, Iâ€™m usually an all Aâ€™s student but a recently got a C but have otherwise all Aâ€™s. As for my mental health itâ€™s not good, Iâ€™m very suicidal and Iâ€™m stopping myself from self harming. Iâ€™m also trying to lose some weight, Iâ€™m currently 160 at 5â€™11â€ I was going to not eat for a month but some friends helped me figure out how stupid it was. Iâ€™m also working on accepting myself for being trans and coming to terms with it. I need to change for the better and learn to love myself. I have been depressed for the last 2-3 years now and I need to stop being such a downer. Iâ€™m trying to look at things in a more positive way to try and help improve my life. My parents are abusive but Iâ€™m not going to let it get to me, when I get beat Iâ€™m going to keep my chin up and not let it destroy me. If anyone else is in a position similar to mine I encourage you to join me and try to change yourself for the better, people can change, so can we.
