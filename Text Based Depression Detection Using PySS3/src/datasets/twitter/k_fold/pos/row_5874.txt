Before my dad left for work this morning, he asked my mom about my grades. My mom who already knows om failing a few of my classes replied "He fell behind a little bit, but he's starting to catch up." He said "...ok" and walked out the door. **I'M FINNA DIE WHEN HE GETS HOME.** It's been a nice life everyone, and just 35 days short of my 18th birthday too. ðŸ˜ª
