Does anyone know how to be honest with a teacher? So this semester Iâ€™ve had pretty bad mental health, and Iâ€™m about to fail my English class (if I donâ€™t turn in a ton of late work by 11:59 tonight, thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll pass, and I donâ€™t have time to do enough of it until then). Iâ€™ve always had trouble with procrastinating/focusing but Iâ€™ve never had a class with such a work load, so Iâ€™ve been pretty much fine until now. I used to get straight Aâ€™s, when I didnâ€™t have to do homework at my old school. I did fail a summer school semester once, but that was more of a miscommunication than anything and Iâ€™m planning on retaking it next summer.

I wouldnâ€™t call myself a bad student. When I can actually focus, and when my anxiety isnâ€™t too bad, I love participating in discussions/answering questions/etc. And quite honestly, my English teacher is the nicest human being on the planet and Iâ€™m really thankful that I had her as a teacher. Unfortunately Iâ€™ve never been able pressure myself into doing ANYTHING. When my brain says no, it means no. 

With that, I want to apologize to my English teacher for doing so poorly this semester. Iâ€™m not trying to make excuses and Iâ€™m not just trying to be lazy, but thereâ€™s a constant mental block that prevents me from doing assignments I would otherwise enjoy doing. Iâ€™m not really sure how to do this without sounding like a major AH though. â€œSorry Ms. P, I know you were kind enough to give me like 18 chances and I blew them all because I had a bad case of the Big Sadâ„¢ this entire semesterâ€ 

Any advice? I just want to let her know that I really do care about my education and Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t able to pass this semester, without giving too many personal details and being weird. I donâ€™t need her to know about all my family and mental issues but Iâ€™m not sure how to explain around them.
