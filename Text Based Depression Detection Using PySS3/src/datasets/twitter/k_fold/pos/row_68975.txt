Another song , I may send it to my crush if yâ€™all like it 
Name still in work current name :(love) Iâ€™m talking suggestions 

Please
To anyone Heraring this
To anyone reading this 
I wanna tell you 
Lately I ainâ€™t been feeling right
You know what I do when it late at night 
I just hug my pillow and I start to cry 
I imagine someone hugging me
Someone telling everything is gonna be alright
But at the same time I feel sad
Because I know I. Wonâ€™t ever reach that place
I know that I ainâ€™t ever gonna have that life 
Because people donâ€™t need me
When they donâ€™t need me ,they donâ€™t see me
They look through me,it feels like they are empty
Like if they didnâ€™t like me ,like if they were forced to talk to me
So I even when they do talk to me
I always give it up
Itâ€™s my fault I know Iâ€™m bad 
At life

But 

I just want love 
I just want love ,I just want love
I just want love ,I just want love 
I just want love 

Please 
To anyone reading this 
To anyone hearing this 
Go up to that kid
Wich sit at the back of class
And anyone never talks
Because I bet heâ€™d appreciate it
I know Iâ€™d appreciate it 
I bet even if he doesnâ€™t know it yet
We all need a little hug from time to time 
I know thats all I need
So come and hug me 

I just want love ,
I just want love ,I just want love
I just want love ,I just want love

People ask me how Iâ€™m doing i say alright
Well ainâ€™t that what we all say 
I am not fine, i really need a light
To bright up my life 
I really need you in my life
I really need you in my life
I feel like I donâ€™t do anything right
Maybe thatâ€™s why the issues keep flooding
My eyes, maybe thatâ€™s why I want you to fill my sight
