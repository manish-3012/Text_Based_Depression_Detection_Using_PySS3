My parents tried to block Reddit and other apps, but I found a bypass that might come in handy to you Verizon has an app that allows parents to see every website their kids go on and block apps with a built in VPN. This VPN blocks internet access to these apps. If you already have another VPN installed, switch to it using settings and it will temporarily disable the Verizon blocker. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
