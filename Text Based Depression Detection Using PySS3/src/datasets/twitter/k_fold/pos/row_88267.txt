so apparently my neighbors dog who killed my cat had been brought to the pound for roaming free multiple times he new that more then once his dog was over a mile away from his house, to the point the pound a town over already had his number. it was found at the school before also. yet he still would not make an effort to keep it in his yard.

FUCK THAT ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SHIT
