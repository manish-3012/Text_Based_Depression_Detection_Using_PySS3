People are being billionaires and some people are complaining about that. But here I am: Here I am being worried about if Iâ€™m gonna be able to have an good enough job in the future where Iâ€™d be considered middle class. Iâ€™m not the best student if you know what Iâ€™m trying to say but my parents got high hopes for me. So, Iâ€™m just constantly depressed trying to figure out what I want to be and if my parents will be proud of me and shit. Ahh it is just depressing.
