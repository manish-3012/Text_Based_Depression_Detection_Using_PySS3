I just finished reading a book and Iâ€™m proud of myself I donâ€™t where else to express my excitement so thisâ€™ll have to do. Iâ€™ve wanted to get into reading but Iâ€™ve never had the patience for it. However, I decided that this summer I would read a book start to finish. I read â€œMeâ€ by Elton John (cus I love him and his music) and after about a month of reading, I finally finished it. And it wasnâ€™t like finishing a book for school. I know this may seem silly but itâ€™s something Iâ€™m proud of. Ok Iâ€™m done, have a good day.
