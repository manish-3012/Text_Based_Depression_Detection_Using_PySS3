Sum Magical Shit Happened Last Night I don't usually watched tarot readings but quarantine changed me. I asked if I should chat her tonight, the answer was "infinite possibilities. Next thing I watched was what is your spirit guide telling u, it said that they're tired of telling me to wait and be patient (which further proves those previous readings that told me to wait for the right time). I gathered all of my courage to chat with her......And I failed miserably for 4-5 times (either by internet issues, chrome crashing and my messages got deleted at some point. I feel like my spirit guides are making fun of me or I just clicked a bad link.
