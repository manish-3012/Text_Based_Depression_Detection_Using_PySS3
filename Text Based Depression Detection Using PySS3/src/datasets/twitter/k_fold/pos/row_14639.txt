I'M IN COLLEGE BOIS! It's all said and done, I've been enrolled and I've done all the paperwork and I'm officially starting my freshman year of highschool in early college! I'm gonna graduate with an associate's degree and I'll be able to move straight into university. This is a huge opportunity for me and now it's becoming real! This sub is one of the reasons I'm still here and able to do this. 

I love all of you and you have helped me through so much

We don't care about all that sappy shit though, you may continue browsing memes as you were. Remember that no matter who you are, you're capable of great things and there's no shame in getting a little help every now and then to do that.
