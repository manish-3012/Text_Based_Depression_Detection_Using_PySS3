My dad told me to stop arm-slicing and I did, yet he haven't stopped smoking for years even after a lot of people told him to stop, and I've decided this is the last straw There's literally no difference between those two actions. They harm yourself for a short term gratitude, so I, an ex-arm slicer, should be in the place to tell him to stop.

I need other ideas to finally hammer the last nail in the coffin because me and my grandmother had enough of his smoking shenanigans. I will use every weapon in my arsenal to stop him, and if he doesn't stop, I'll do the very thing he didn't want me to (probably not gonna do it, unless absolutely necessary)

Should I just tell him straight up face to face, or just wait till my next psychiatric appointment and tell my doctor to tell him to stop?

Im in need of advice, /r/teen. I just want him to stop smoking, that's it.
