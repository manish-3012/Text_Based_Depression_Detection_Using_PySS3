Why is one am like this for me Whenever it hits one am Iâ€™m like woah and my brain shuts down and goes into like night mode brain where everything goes like slow but also changed and polished so well you couldnâ€™t tell it was slowed down. I looked up â€œWhy do I go into a weird headspace when it hits oneâ€ on google and I donâ€™t know why cause why would google know that. This is a shit post. Iâ€™m so tired. Why do I do this.
