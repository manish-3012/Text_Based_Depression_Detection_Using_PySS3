my left nut feels like spaghetti I suspect having a stage 3 varicocele because I've looked up the symptoms of the condition.im currently 16 and have it since 2 years. I don't want to tell my parents cuz it's embarrassing and if I do it,what's gonna happen will they cut my testis off or if they do it are they gonna give me hormones to keep my testosterone in the norm?
