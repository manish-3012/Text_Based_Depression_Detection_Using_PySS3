Am Ithe only bitch who's gonna be 17 in a month and STILL don'teven have their learner's? If I didn't feel like a failure already I sure do now. Like my family is well off enough that they could get me a nice used car. A car. A fucking car didn't motivate my dumbass enough to study for my fucking learners permant?? Like we have *dabbled* in the world of mental issues, and the woman said it's very possible that I have ADHD, depression, (also a few years later and almost a year on BC I think I have PMDS so thats cool ig just add it to the list of things) and severe anxiety but come TF on a car didn't get me? But the therapy sessions stopped when I felt like whatever I said to her, she was telling my mom when she would ask to talk to my mom by herself. My mom stopped looking for therapist and instead is trying to help me lose weight to see if that will help me with the motivation of any kind. Like at the moment I have all A's, this hasnt happened before so idk why I just can't read the fucking book. And when I say this stuff to ppl on discord or PS party they say "just do the online quizes and you'll pass" I don't want to half ass it driving is a serious thing and I want to *know* what I'm getting into but at the same time I don't? Idfk I hate myself;)
