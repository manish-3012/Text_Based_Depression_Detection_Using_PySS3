Giving away your kids game console because you thought they spend too much time on it is the most asshole thing a parent can do. I had a friend who loved playing Super Mario Galaxy on his Wii, he would always plan out the next star he was going to get in class he loved that game more then anything, one day he went home and his mom said she gave the Wii away as punishment for spending all that time on the game.

He has issues now whenever he gets something new he never uses it in fear she will give that away too.

So parents watching this, if you think your kid is spending too much time on a game don't give it away, limit their time on it to like an hour a day or something.

This story does have a happy end though, recently he moved out and is planning on going to a college WAY out of town.

And me and the boys are going to surprise him with a copy of super mario 3d all stars so he can catch up on the childhood he missed.

Also, Fuck you Ms Johnson.
