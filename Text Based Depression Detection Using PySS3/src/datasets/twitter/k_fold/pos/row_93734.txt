I forgot about this I FORGOT MY SKETCH SET AT HOME AND NOW I WONâ€™T GET IT UNTIL FRIDAY WHEN I GO BACK HOME so I canâ€™t finish what I was practicing on. So I guess now Iâ€™ll do a pog face on printer paper with a Ticonderoga pencil. Please leave suggestions of what to draw. I can draw people and household objects
