THE BLACK Chapter 1 The Figure In The Dark Chris and his family were moving to a new house in the middle of the woods,when they arrived Chrisâ€™s family went in the house and Chris was behind following them,before he went in he saw a man holding a sign sayingâ€BEWARE THE BLACKâ€
Chris looked at the sign confused and he just ignored the man and went in and took his stuff out of his bag and started designing his room in his own way.
Chris was half way through designing his room and thatâ€™s when he saw a dark figure standing outside,he then opened the window and took a look,Chris was so confused,he went down the stairsâ€Iâ€™ll go walk a little bit outside dadâ€Chris said,â€well donâ€™t be lateâ€Chrisâ€™s dad said.
Chris then went outside and didnâ€™t see the man with the sign and didnâ€™t see the dark figure that he saw from the window,Chris then decided to go into the middle of the woods,while Chris was walking he saw a trail of blood on the ground,he started thinking of going back but he had to know whatâ€™s going on so he followed the trail of blood,Chris then saw the trail of blood leading to a small little house,he opened the door and saw the man with the sign in there but he was dead and there was a hole inside him and the blood in his body was just black while the rest was red,â€what the fuck...â€Chris saidâ€this canâ€™t be happening...â€Chris then started running back to his house but he fell in a hole and hit his head hard.
When it was night Chris woke up thinking it was a dream so he got up and got out of the hole and he then took his phone out of his pocket and opened he flashlight,he then started walking back home,he suddenly felt arms holding his shoulder and he heard weird whispers behind his ear he then looked behind him with the flashlight and saw nothing so he just continued walking
he then saw blood on his shirt from the dead guy that he saw,â€so this wasnâ€™t a dream...â€Chris said and then he was back home and his parents rushed to himâ€Chris where were you!?â€Chrisâ€™s mom saidâ€we were so worried about you we were this close to calling the cops!â€Chrisâ€™s dad saidâ€itâ€™s nothing no need to worryâ€Chris said to his parents and went to his brotherâ€™s roomâ€max you need to hear this now!â€Chris said to maxâ€not now Chris I need to win this!â€max said to Chris as he was playing an online game,Chris then shut the computer and told him everythingâ€first of all nice joke second of all why the fuck would you close the PC Chris! What the hell!â€max said to Chrisâ€you have to believe me this happenedâ€Chris said to maxâ€yeah rightâ€max said sarcastically and ignored Chris,Chris went back to his room and he suddenly saw a black hand coming out of the door and it started pulling him into the door,Chris started screaming but the only one that heard him was max,max thought he was still joking so he ignored him,Chris kept screaming and max couldnâ€™t take it at all so he went out of his room,â€Chris could you please stop screaming Iâ€™m not gonna fall for thi-â€œmax said in shock as he saw Chris being pulled to the doorâ€what the hell...Chris!â€max ran to Chris and pulled him out as the black hand went away,â€so you werenâ€™t lying...â€max said to Chrisâ€I fucking told ya!â€Chris said screaming at his faceâ€ok,ok you are right...but what was that!?â€max said to Chrisâ€to be honest I donâ€™t know...â€Chris saidâ€but Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll soon find out...â€
