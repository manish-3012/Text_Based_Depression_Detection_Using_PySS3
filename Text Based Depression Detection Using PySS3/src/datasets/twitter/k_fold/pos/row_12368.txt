Do kids still Bully other kids? 
I asks because Public education was a long time ago for me. And I never saw any of it but I was an oblivious art student. So I wouldnâ€™t have noticed. However I see horrific bullying in TV shows and was wondering if that is a true representation of Americaâ€™s school system today. I have children not school age yet but if itâ€™s accurate itâ€™s troubling.
