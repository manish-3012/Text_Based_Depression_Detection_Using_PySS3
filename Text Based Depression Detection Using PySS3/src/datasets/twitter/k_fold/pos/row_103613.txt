Just tried to have a talk with my girlfriend â€œI feel like you donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s like youâ€™re always doing something elseâ€ â€œone sec Iâ€™m watching somethingâ€ just bruh. I fucking laughed hard at the irony and she didnâ€™t even notice me laughing. Who else has a girlfriend who doesnâ€™t give a shit about them
