Finally free of acne!!! I've (M16) been dealing with pretty severe acne in the last 2 years. 5 months ago my mom and I went to the doctor and they gave me acne pills i have to take in every day. And it worked!! It is so nice to be free of acne and if you have heavy acne you might consider seeing a doctor about it, it can work wonders. Having acne can really ruin selfesteem and i am so happy about it :)
