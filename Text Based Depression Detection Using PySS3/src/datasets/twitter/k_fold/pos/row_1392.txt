I think I might need to come out to my parents... (again) Tl;DR: I told my parents that I donâ€™t feel ok with my gender (m) and they... well... they didnâ€™t took it so well. I cried a lot. I had the worst time of my fucking life... this happened like a month or two ago,  they yelled at me, they insulted, they didnâ€™t wanted to accept me.

That lasted for a couple weeks.

And after that, my father thought that, by buying me stuff, I would forgive him for being an asshole I with me since I was 8,  (I wonâ€™t) and my mother didnâ€™t wanted to talk about it.

So, with that being said, what do you think they did?

Exactly! They.FUCKING.forgot about everything.

And I m here, trapped again feeling miserable living a life I donâ€™t want to live.

Fucking yikes. FUCKING YIKES.
