I'm so done with people Rant warning! Alright so I play this one game where you make and lose ships and basically there's limited ships and all. I spend hundreds of hours making a ship only for the people who, I protected and I helped save their ships, bait me. This has happened like hundreds of times and everytime I trust people it's just how I fucking am. In real life it's the same damn thing. I trust someone and they take advantage of me(most people who aren't my family). It took me way too long to realize 90% of my "friends" in the lower grades just wanted me to do their homework for them. Why is it always like this, I keep trusting people and they keep breaking my trust.
