yâ€™all music defeners need to grow up iâ€™ll admit it, i donâ€™t have the most scholarly taste in music. i listen to the most basic, teenage girl music imaginable; One Direction, Nicki Minaj, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Saweetie, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Harry Styles, to name a few. but yâ€™all got to stop acting like youâ€™re so cultured because you listen to Nirvana/Juice WRLD/any metal band. everyone has a different style of music they like and iâ€™m getting so annoyed with the growing amount of people on reddit, tiktok, twitter, or whatever who act all superior because they donâ€™t listen to a mainstream pop artist, calling pop â€œbabyishâ€ and â€œrepetitiveâ€ as if you canâ€™t say that for any other genre. like sorry i donâ€™t listen to some super obscure indie-metal-soul-swing band with 200 monthly listeners on spotify that you found in an â€œnew indie 2014 ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿â€ playlist.

iâ€™m not saying pop isnâ€™t repetitive or â€œshallowâ€ but sometimes i just want to shut my brain off and listen to a corny love song or a lady singing about shaking her ass, itâ€™s FUN. and who are you to shame me? yâ€™all are ridiculous.
