Hahahaha I've reached my breaking point I'm honestly done. I seriously am. I've had 2 friends die this year and one before my fucking birthday. and then I go on a date with a guy who said he had feelings for me just for him to say he don't like me anymore and I'm just done. I seriously just want to slip into a coma. It's so fucking hard. I don't know what to Do. I've cried all night.
