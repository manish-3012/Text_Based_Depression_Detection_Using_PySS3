I fucking hate college Just got done taking a quiz from one of those professors that does the whole thing where 2 answers are extremely similar, but only one is right. 

Well apparently finding the exact wording in the textbook and using that answer is wrong.

One of the questions didn't have a right answers (assuming it was a mistake) but I failed the test which sure isn't a big deal, but I'm a type of student that doesn't want to fail any tests, and is an overachiever, and I've failed 3 of this professors quizzes. Just in this class too. 

Luckily, the two lowest grades will get dropped. But I don't want to get anything lower than what I've got.
