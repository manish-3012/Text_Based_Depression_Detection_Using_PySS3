Sending a video you think is funny to another person - But afraid that you would get dissapointed if they think it isnt funny or just force themselves to laugh and say it's funny when they think it isn't 


Kinda feels worse than them saying it isnt funny.


and this is why I'm insecure and overthinking,worrying about such a small little thing:')
