Ok, attempt 2. I recently watched â€œThe Social Dilemmaâ€ on Netflix. Because of this, I have initiated a challenge for myself, and I encourage you to join me, and help spread this challenge, as I will not be using any forms of social media, besides the chat in snapchat (because nobody talks through text anymore; annoying, but we make do) starting at 8 am, EST, and spanning one whole week. Thus, I will not be using Reddit, not even opening the app, for that amount of time. Good luck to those of you who join me, and I encourage you all to see if you can even make it past the one week mark.
