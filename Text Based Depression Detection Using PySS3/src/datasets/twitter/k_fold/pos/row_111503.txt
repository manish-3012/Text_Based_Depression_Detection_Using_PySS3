I was in the shower earlier... ...and I was *shower thoughting.*

You know when couples call each other *"baby,"* and it's supposed to be romantic, sorta personal and cute. 

Although both the words *"baby"* and *"child"* means the same, calling your lover/partner *"child,"* immediately sounds wrong and comes off as calling them an immature person. 

If anything, calling them *"baby"* makes them off to be more immature than *"child,"*  but ironically it ***somehow isn't???***






P.S. this thought has had me up for hours.... The term Baby literally means child, and is derived from baby sounds, then how-the-fuck-clme does it mean "my love"???!!!! Etymology is weird. The link to my find: [https://www.etymonline.com/word/babe](https://youtu.be/Tt7bzxurJ1I)
