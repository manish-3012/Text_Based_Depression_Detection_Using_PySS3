Question that i cant ask anybody around me Hi people, im 14 and i just got my first girlfriend about 2 weeks ago. I really like her and she likes me a lot too. We hug a lot and kissed few times but theres one thing im really worried about all the time. I havent seen her for about 5 days now and i feel really lonely. Is that like actually normal? I cant really ask anybody around me that so thats why i post here. I appreciate each reply :)
