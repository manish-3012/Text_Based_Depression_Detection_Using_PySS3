Banned from twitter for being anti-zoophilic So I made a post last night about how much I hate zoos and woke up this morning and checked twitter. App wasnâ€™t working so I figured it was down. I come back a few hours later and it still wasnâ€™t working. I tried to go to my other accounts only to find out that they locked me out. So fix them and go back to my main, only to see that it was suspended, so I appealed and only recently found out, that I was suspended for being super anti zoo and anti pedo. So now Iâ€™m stuck trying to delete my account and I canâ€™t even do that because I was suspended and all account functionality was revoked. 

tl;dr I made an anti zoo tweet and got banned. Now I canâ€™t delete my account.
