Perusing a Friendship with an Introvert. (Female) I'm a major extrovert. I'm a twitch streamer, involved in many clubs. I'm loud, and I never stop talking. Due to the pandemic, I've turned primarily to discord for making new friends. I met one guy, and he's possibly one of the coolest people I've ever met. He works his ass off to buy parts for his computer, and loves playing retro games as much as me. I would really like to get to know him more, play games with him, and potentially have a long term friendship. The thing is, he's a total loner. He doesn't seem to be very talkative, and I find myself too nervous to stare conversations privately. We talk fine in big open public chats, but hardly ever talk in pms. I often make him artwork, using that as an excuse to start a private conversation. How can I take this to the next level, not having to bribe him with artwork of his characters to catch his attention? How do you get an introvert talking? He can be a bit awkward at times, and is often busy with his college coursework. I don't want to come off as too pushy, and I want to give him his space while still actively persuing a friendship with him. What is the best way to approach this? Do you have any tips?
