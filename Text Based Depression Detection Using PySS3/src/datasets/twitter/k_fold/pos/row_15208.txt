I got a random spark of inspiration for a song and the whole idea behind the song changed while writing. I hope y'all enjoy! As I stand here alone,
Watching over the hills,
Waiting for the on coming battle,
I stand with gun in hand,
Ready to protect the land,

The battle lines have been drawn,
And now the battle of our lives, our country,
We will stand here ready to protect the land,

And with the bark of a wolf,
And with the blood lust of a lion,
And the determination of a man,
We stand to protect our land,

We stand here,
Knowing we're the one thing,
Standing between our people,
And the oppression of our hunters,

And as we hear the shriek of the enemy,
And as we hear the ripping sound of artillery,
We stand as a pack of wolfs,
Ready to defend our lands,

Even if we are outnumbered,
Even if we are out gunned,
We will stand with guns in hand,
And defend the lands,

If this is our last stand,
We will accept it,
Knowing we went down,
With the honor,
Of protecting our land,
