Am happy yay. About a month ago I told my crush that I like her (she's like the prettiest girl in our class) but she said she didn't like me back, for which ngl I was kinda sad about but nothing I can do about that... except not give up I suppose. We've been talking for exactly one month now with the hope of the answer changing and she just said she likes me back, mostly because of the fact that we've been talking so much and that we get to know each other (we met about 2 months ago). Never been happier.
