Where to findâ€˜em I need help 

I am a at least semi attractive 5â€˜9 16yo boy that is very good at socializing and making Friends 

Therefore I have a big amount of friends,but I would really like a girlfriend but I donâ€™t want no girlfriend just for the sake of having a girlfriend 

I want love 

The problem is that all the girls at my school have such personalityâ€™s so that I donâ€™t want to even be friends with them 

So i canâ€™t get a girlfriend from my school 

And now I want to ask you 

Where are places to go if you want to meet new people(especially female ones) to get to know them better 

How I already stated I have no problems getting to know a girl, my problem is that I donâ€™t find any girls 

(This is Not supposed to be sexist or offend anyone i really just need help)
