i think i have reverted back into being a toxic human being (directed towards people who deserve it) like we used to be exceptionally rude and tell people to kill themselves, and then we grew up a little bit and said it was wrong, but now iâ€™m back to being toxic to people who treat me like shit 

i told my ex who abused me emotionally and continues to lie about me to kill himself tonight and that released a lot of anger
