I can't get over awesome people I met at school two years ago but have no contact now. I am 16 now. Two years ago I was in 10th grade and that was the best year of my life. I know there are more years to com which can be better than 2018 that but for now 2018 was the best year of my life.

In 2018 I literally had no beef with anyone everyone were in good terms with me. Teachers were less strict so class was fun. There were two sections for one class but they combined us in 2018 which allowed me to make more wonderful friends.Even my grades were pretty good in spite of having all the fun. **That was also the year I fell in love.** 

They person who I fell used to sit with me. We talked a lot. I even asked her out for a movie date which didn't workout. Anyway I didn't express my feeling 'cause if it didn't workout well it will be awkward and she might feel uncomfortable talking to me. The year went and I passed with an excellent grades.

The next year I went to a boarding school. Kids weren't  so nice there.I was also homesick. A kid even tried to bully me 'cause I am a lefty. I don't know how they are gonna handle real people in the world if they cannot accept a lefty. Some kid in my class spread fake rumors saying I didn't flush the toilet which made the bullying worse. There were other kids who were not assholes and actually were friends with me. I stayed with them. The first two months was me telling other to fuck off a lot of times(which sometimes worked). Surprisingly one of the main person who irritated me stopped to irritate and felt like he wanted to be a friend. I couldn't handle this school so I left and joined my old school.

11th grade went pretty good( not academically) in my old school. My grades dropped but I seemed to care less. When I came back most friends were gone and replaced by new ones but some where still studying there.

**From 11th grade when I sleep I can only dream(literally dream) about the girl I liked in 10th and how I used to enjoy my life with my friends in 10th. The girl I liked keeps coming back to my  dream most days. This beautiful dream is now a nightmare to me 'cause when I wake up I wish I could go back to 10th grade be with her and my old friends and realized how worse my life is in 11th and 12th grade.**

**HELP.**
