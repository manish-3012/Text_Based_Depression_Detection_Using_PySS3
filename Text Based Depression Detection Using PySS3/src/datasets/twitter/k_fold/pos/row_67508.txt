My beef with r/niceguys. So a while ago, I was messaged by a pedophile, he knew I was 13, and he was over 18.


I posted it on that subreddit.


I found out that that person contacted 3 other young girls about masturbatory habits.

The post got popular, but it was locked for showing a username.

The username of a pedophile who has contacted **4 young girls.**


I have since deleted the post because there was no point in keeping it up.


His username is u/evenios.
