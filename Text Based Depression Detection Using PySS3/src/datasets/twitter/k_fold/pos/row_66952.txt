I miss real school When I was in school I wished I could go home and be relaxed.Now,I wish it was normal because Iâ€™m at home all the time,24 hours a day,7 days a week and Iâ€™m more stressed than before.I am given Math videos where I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s even happening.I am given Piles among piles of English work like 12 page annotation with unreal finish dates .I canâ€™t carve out any time for actually doing work because I have a google meet thirty minutes after I finish one and since Iâ€™m doing hybrid learning and almost all of my friends are either virtual or do not even go to school on the same days I do.Everythingâ€™s a mess.I cannot wait until COVID is over.I wanna actually get a girl friend like for real I want someone to look at me like Iâ€™m the most interesting person alive.God I miss school.

Edit:I just needed to get this off my chest Iâ€™ve been working on a daily grade for almost 5 hours.A freakin annotation for English.I appreciate anyone who takes the time to actually read this.
