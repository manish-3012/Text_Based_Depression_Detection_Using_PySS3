I want to start talking to a girl from my school So thereâ€™s a super pretty and smart girl at my school who I really really like and have for a good while. I would like to message her but I donâ€™t know what to say because we havenâ€™t texted much before and not her either and i donâ€™t want to go too far but I also donâ€™t want to sound creepy or weird. I just donâ€™t know how to start talking to her and not ruin it. 

Thanks!
