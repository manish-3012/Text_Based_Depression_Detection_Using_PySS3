Day(?) #4 of me telling you my dreams bc I dream some crazy stuff ok??? It's 3 AM and i literally just woke up because my dream was too weird.

So i was in some sort of japanese(?) school. I was in a baseball team, but didn't actually play. I was there to go chase the balls and stuff, and was apparently well-known in the team for being good at it.

I was coaching some sort of new girl in the team. I was teaching her my techniques and stuff, she was pretty clumsy and wouldn't catch anything.

So then one of the members accidentally send a ball near the showers and stuff. So I went to pick it up. It entered the boy's showers.

I wanted to make sure no one was inside for me to enter. So I said â€œHello?â€ and to my surprise, I see my in-dream crush(????

Like I don't have an actual crush irl. But the person I was in my dream actually had one? If it even makes sense. Closest thing I can get to describe him is that he looked like irl Mamoru from Sailor Moon.

So then I freaked out and blushed, I swear I could feel my face and ears warming up. And then I apologized, for coming near the showers in the first place. I started walking back to the training place, but the guy called me.

So then the guy comes out, with a towel on his head, and tells me something like â€œYou should've enteredâ€

So then I freak out once again, and this time I can feel my heart beating so fast I start to freak out because of my own heartbeat.

And then the guy asks if I'm ok and I say no, and then he says â€œyour nose is bleeding.â€

And then I feel my nose bleed.

And then I woke up, still feeling that my nose was bleeding.

I stood like that for a few minutes because I was REALLY weirded out by all of the stuff I experienced?? 

My nose wasn't bleeding. My heart was normal, and my face was normal too. 

It really was nice. But it also was very weird.
