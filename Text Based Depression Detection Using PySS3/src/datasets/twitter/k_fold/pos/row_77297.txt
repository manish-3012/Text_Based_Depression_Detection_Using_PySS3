What's going on? It's been a wild one year on Reddit. I think the best sub I've been in is this one. There has been so many relatable things that make me think to myself "Hey I'm not a sociopath! This guy gets it!" Also the memes. Dear lord the lockdown memes related with myself and my friend. This accounts name is actually the way it is bc my friend Cj uses this for everything. I made a reddit acc before he could so I could be a dick and he couldn't use his name. Well anyway teenagers it's been a wild, depressing but fun year. Thanks for everything â£ï¸ðŸ’—ðŸ’–
