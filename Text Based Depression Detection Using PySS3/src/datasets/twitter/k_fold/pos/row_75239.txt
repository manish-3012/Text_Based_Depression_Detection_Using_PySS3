Am I over protected? Iâ€™m currently 16, a junior in high school and Iâ€™m feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my life but I think the  issue is my parents. My parents essentially control every aspect of my life. Iâ€™m not allowed to use social media, and if I do, then they want to see everything I post, like, or follow. Iâ€™m using the reddit website on my phone and I clear my history after using it each time. Parents donâ€™t even let me play multiplayer games on Xbox and Ps5, and I canâ€™t even play with my â€œfriendsâ€ without them having to sit right there and listen to what I say to them. I canâ€™t go anywhere without texting my parents where and when I arrive to the location and they also track my phone through find my iPhone. Theyâ€™ve forced me into what Iâ€™m studying, the place that I work, and the clubs that I join. I essentially donâ€™t use my own email for anything and I donâ€™t even have control of my bank account either. I have no friends, Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, and I want to kill myself. When Iâ€™m older Iâ€™m going to never speak to my parents as never visit them. Or am I the issue?
