I asked my crush out So it all started Friday after school. She asked me saying if I could help her with the homework. I said yes not just because she is my crush but also because I like to help people. 

So we make our way over to her since my house is very messy and mom doesnâ€™t like me having friends over when itâ€™s messy. 

When we are there we go into her room and begin making homework. Before I know it itâ€™s 7pm and I am hungry. So I say that it was fun and I will go home now so I can eat dinner. She says that I can eat with her since her parents will come home at 10 pm. I say that it would be nice and text my mom that I will be home 9:45pm. 

After we ate she says we should watch a movie and I agree. I watch the movie with a half eye and look at her for the rest of the time. I think she did the same thing. I begin to build up courage. 

I say that I love her and I ask her out on a date right when the movie ends. She says she loves me too and that she also wants me on a date. 

When itâ€™s time to say goodbye and for me to leave. I say to her that it has been really fun staying here and I kiss her good night. She kisses back and says good night too
