Something that happened to me yesterday, that made me very uncomfortable :| I'm absolutely positive that people here have experienced worse, but this kinda creeped me out, and for whatever reason I want to tell people, because it's also kinda funny how terrible this guy's attempt was.

So, for context, I was leaning against the wall of a store, waiting for a friend. And there was this guy (cg, for creepy guy) who I assume was in his late teens early 20s, sitting on a bench near me. 

Cg comes up to me, and asks something along the lines of "hey do you know where Philz Coffee is?". And me being relatively uncomfortable, because I'm not good at talking to strangers, responds "yeah, it's the end over there" (I also point to the direction) then he doesn't leave, and instead, he asks me "are you waiting for a ride?" And I am about 110% sure that he would have offered me a ride if I said yes, and he was getting his keys out. And me being even more uncomfortable, says "uhh, no." Then he asked if I was waiting for a friend, and I responded, telling him I was. And out of no where, he says "you're cute, can I have your number?" And me, being properly weirded out by that point, because there was a much older guy, asking me for my number, simply responds "ummm, no." Thankfully after that he left, and me, being property creeped out, and honestly a bit flattered, decided to just get as far away as I could from that spot, and meet my friend in a different area.

I find it funny how he just went straight into asking for my number, like, I bet he could have been a little more slick. But he was way older then me, and that also added a bit of a creep factor (even though he may not have known my age, as I do look older then I am) plus, I don't even like guys in that way, so, he had no chance (sorry).
