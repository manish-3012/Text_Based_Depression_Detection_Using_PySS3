Being strait isn't a personality trait. Like if you are that's great but for the love of God don't bring it up in every sentence. It makes me want to die Like honestly I'm happy for you and all but just shut up about it. You're not special. There are loads of strait people. My two closest freinds are straight and the reason I'm freinds with them is because they rarely actually bring it up unless we're joking about it. That is all. That's the whole rant.
