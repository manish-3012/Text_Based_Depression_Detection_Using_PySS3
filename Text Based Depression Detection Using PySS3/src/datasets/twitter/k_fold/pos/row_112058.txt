I think I might have a mild case of depersonalization disorder Almost every single day it happens. Let's use today as an example. I'm sitting in chemistry class, I get off of my seat and I freeze for a second, because I felt like I wasn't in control. I kept walking to the whiteboard and I felt like there was a camera in my eyes and and I'm just watching the footage. It felt like I wasn't doing anything I didn't feel like I was myself I didn't control myself it just happened. Everything just unfolded infront of my eyes. I'm currently shaking because I've just realized how often this actually happens to me, and I'm only just learning about it.
