If you are/were the shy guy of the class(? Do you ever feel like for some reason you care about what other people think about you? Even if you don't even remember their names and you almost never cross paths with them?

I've been  feeling useless and stupid all my life for remembering events that happened even years ago that i thought i was over with. and i don't know how to stop just containing them within me without worrying the people i know by expressing my thoughts. 

So idk do you think this requires a psychologist or what? I'm really looking for any type of advise here
