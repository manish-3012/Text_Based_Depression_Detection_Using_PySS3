Please DO not choke people So I was watching a Crime TV show and asked my dad â€œhow are their no bruises on strangling victimsâ€ he mentioned how there are different choke holds and how some can kill you in seconds. I wanted to see how one would feel and told my dad to do it for half a second,and holy fuck all I could think during that half a second was just nothing, my mind was just blank. For real donâ€™t choke people, i was way more scared from that than being grazed by a bullet (another story for another time) 
(Note: I love my dad from the bottom of my heart, he is former military and knows how to do these chokeholds, please do not try these on anyone)
