Me and my mom even argue about signing syllabi I organize all papers for each class for my mom to sign on the table just because the room sheâ€™s in has a whole mess of papers and I wasnâ€™t gonna undo what I organized.

So now she wonâ€™t sign any of the 9 things she needs to just because I wonâ€™t bring the papers to her. There is literally no space for her to sign them, I already have it organized over here, and I organized them this certain way so I can put the rest of my crap where it needs to go, class by class. 

Why canâ€™t she just sign the papers without all the yelling lmfao
