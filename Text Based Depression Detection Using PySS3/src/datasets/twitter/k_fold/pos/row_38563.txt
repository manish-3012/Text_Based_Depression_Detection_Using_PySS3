What to do? Ok so I canâ€™t decide, if I should graduate early or do CAPS program next year.
If I graduated early the band would go without a flute and Iâ€™d miss my senior year of band.
Or I could do CAPS and get some experience before going to college.
I really canâ€™t decide since I love band, but If I graduated early I could get a head start to college.
