YOU GOTTA STOP SCROLLING AND READ THIS! Life's hard but you can get through it. Focus on the positives .I'm really bored. Do you need a friend?My train of thought is like  that dvd sign bouncing on and off.So why are we here?Is there a purpose assigned to us or do we find our own purpose?Hard work alone doesn't get us anywhere ,you need a bit of luck too.Not a bit ,A LOT. I really need to learn to use punctuations. You get the idea. Life sucks but you gotta live through it and in the end you'll love it. FUCKING STOCKHOLM SYNDROMW.
