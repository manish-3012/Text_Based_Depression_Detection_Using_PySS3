i hate school holidays. what am i even supposed to do anymore? either i have 1 good day out of the whole week, and for the rest of it I have to take care of my shitty loud brothers while doing homework. i canâ€™t drive anywhere and have no friends houses to go to and iâ€™m just expected to go to the shops and buy everything that hasnâ€™t yet already been eaten by my brothers. 

i feel like fucking shit all the time because my life just turns into a routine and iâ€™m left seeing all of my school friends doing something exciting like every fucking day. i get genuinely depressed in the holidays because iâ€™m inside all of the time and i live in a shitty country town. 

i know iâ€™m being fussy but oh my god, i donâ€™t find the fun in anything anymore. i am literally just trapped in my tiny room all of the time because my brothers use up the lounge room because their room has no internet. 

i have nothing to eat because i donâ€™t have motivation to cook. iâ€™m practically a shitty babysitter for my brothers because I donâ€™t cook them any food and donâ€™t try to entertain them because their father and mother get paid by the fucking government to do it, but what about me? oh thatâ€™s right, I get depressed, have no money, and feel like a horrible person because I feel like I should be doing more for my brothers.
