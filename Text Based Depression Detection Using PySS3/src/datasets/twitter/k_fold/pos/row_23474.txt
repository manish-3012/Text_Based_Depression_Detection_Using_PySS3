So my mother got a package from FedEx today. It took me awhile to get to the door. When I opened the door I saw a guy holding the package but he had a regular white truck, no uniform and told to me to tell my mom to go to a certain FedEx location to pick it up.  He didnâ€™t give us a tracking number so my mom canâ€™t pick it up at the nick and mortar.  We donâ€™t know who sent it.  Now my mother is mad at me.  Is this a actual delivery man or what? How are we supposed to fix this?
