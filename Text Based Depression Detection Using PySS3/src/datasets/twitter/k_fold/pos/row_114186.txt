Is it a stupid idea to suggest to my principle that we have a broadcast team for our high school sports teams? I really love the sport balls. And I wanna become a sports commentator. And I noticed my school is broadcasting games live on YouTube. But they kinda suck. Itâ€™s like security camera footage basically from one corner of the gym. Would it be a dumb idea to suggest that we get people to commentate these games, and have a little scoreboard online for people to follow, and move the camera from the corner. And that way people who may not be able to come out due to covid can watch from home and follow along. I feel like this would be extremely inexpensive to set up. So yeah. Am I a dumbass for thinking about this, and should I email my principal proposing this?
