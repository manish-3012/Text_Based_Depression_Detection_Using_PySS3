Welp, started to use twitter once again after deleting my previous account for not being able to handle the negativity coming from BLM I hope to goddamn God himself that i will not be dragged into the clusterfuck of fire that is drama and controversy on Twitter. Honestly previous time it's grown to the point where i felt bad for not wanting to take part on the BLM action to preserve my mental health, so honestly im just gonna stop giving a fuck about anything negative or any campaing for justice on Twitter, even if people call me the devil.

"Silence is violence", fucking propaganda..leave me the fuck alone if i choose to avoid negative topics.
