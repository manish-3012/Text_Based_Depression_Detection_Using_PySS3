This is not an attempt at karma farming My dog died this morning and I just buried it and I came here to say please spend more time with your loved ones bc one day they can be there and then the next day theyâ€™re dead. It happened out of nowhere I just heard screaming this morning and my mom and dad were next to my favorite dog crying. It sucks to know something is gone forever and you cant do anything to get it back. So please if you have someone you really care abt please spend more time with them. His name is prince btw.
