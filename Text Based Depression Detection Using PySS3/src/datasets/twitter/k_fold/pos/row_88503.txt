Argument with conservative/close-minded parents - story/rant So just a couple of minutes ago I finished an argument with my dad who is apparently more homophobic than I once thought. I just couldn't deal with it anymore as I started crying a little, so I just got up and took a shower because I felt so disgusted. Now I'm writing this.

**\~\~\~STORY PART\~\~\~**

A little bit about me: I'm 19M. Asian, so you can kinda guess what "type" of conservative my dad is. I'm straight, cisgender as well. But I still strongly believe in LGBTQ+ acceptance and just acceptance overall. 

My dad started the conversation actually, bringing up how he thought that bisexual people were just people looking to "play both sides of the field". As in, bisexual people are just looking to double their pool of potential sex partners. Of course, I and many other people would have a problem with that. I challenged him on this, asking things like "do bisexual people tell you they're doing this?" or "what've you heard that makes you believe this?".

In the end, it mostly came back to his somewhat conservative upbringing and him working in a social echo chamber at work, where he gets to bounce these conservative ideas off of similar-thinking co-workers. Now I can't really argue with that --- I also associate myself with generally more liberal people, not consciously but I just like being with those people.

Then the conversation shifted to just general homophobia. I asked, **"Is there a functional difference to your life if I happen to like men instead of women?"**

And my dad's response was "yes". He talked about how LGBTQ+ relationships can have ramifications on public health, somehow LGBTQ+ couples don't pay taxes the same way, LGBTQ+ people "take advantage of the system" to date more people and use more bathrooms (wtf?). And after all this, he had the audacity to say that he isn't homophobic. Instead, he said he's "80% supportive, 20% unsure", which makes him more accepting than not. 

I guess that's how numbers work, right? 80% is greater than 20%, but I personally have a problem with that remaining 20%. That remaining 20% may not be something he talks about publicly, invalidating the identities of millions of people, but it shows up in other ways (I'll talk about that later).

Anyway, at this point, maybe like an hour in, I just gave up. Maybe I shouldn't have given up, I could've pushed harder. But I was exhausted and losing my patience. I said something like **"when people like you eventually die, we'll make this world better".**  And then my dad just laughed at me with a condescending smile, telling me that he was "happy" that I grew up so open-minded compared to him. He was so confused that I was calling out his homophobia when so many other people are homophobic too. Of course, I said, "I have a problem with those people, too". And after that, I just started crying so I left and now we're in the present.

**\~\~\~THE RANT/MY TAKE\~\~\~**

My dad has been working at this company for maybe 20-25 years now, meaning he's in a somewhat senior position, managing teams of engineers and helping hire new people. **Implicit bias there.** My dad owns a little bit of real estate and talks to potential renters/buyers. **Implicit bias there.** Now multiply it by all the co-workers who think like him, think about the millions of Americans in every occupation, perhaps billions of people across the globe that think in this 80/20 mindset, and we have a problem.

I know the official name for people supporting the LGBTQ+ movement is "Ally" (should I capitalize that?). And for my whole life, I've never taken one of those "Ally certification" courses or anything to earn that title. I don't feel like I need to. I kind of surprised myself with how emotional this conversation made me even as a cis-gendered heterosexual male.

This isn't the first time I've had this kind of argument with my dad. But I never got this angry before. Maybe it's the election coming up, maybe I'm not getting enough sleep, maybe I'm just really frustrated that I have to keep talking about this with him. **And I really just want to wait for my dad to die so that his vote doesn't affect other people, but I know that's stupid and cowardly.**

So to those young people who are dealing with the same thing, dealing with parents who just don't listen. I'm not talking about them taking away your phone or not letting you hang out with friends. **I'm talking real shit -- the stuff that your parents vote on** ***will affect you, it'll affect your friends, maybe long after they're gone.*** They will try to talk down on you for being young, being too open-minded, being too optimistic. And you'll hit a brick wall over and over again. Your parents will tell you that you're gonna grow up to be just as close-minded as them. It's all bullshit. Fight the bullshit.

Maybe I have to argue with my dad until he dies. I'll do it as long as there's a chance he'll change. Maybe I'll grow up to be just like him, arguing with my kids about morals and principles. But I'll do everything I can to make sure I stand and vote for things that make the world better for future generations, not just for my short lifetime. I hope you youngsters don't give up.

As for me, I love my dad. I always will unless he really crosses the line. But I don't like my dad. I don't like talking to him, hanging out with him, his cooking, his lectures. So maybe if you guys have better relationships with your parents, you'll have an easier time getting through to them. But I'm gonna keep pushing because I honestly have nothing better to do.

Stay safe, stay strong, stay humble.
