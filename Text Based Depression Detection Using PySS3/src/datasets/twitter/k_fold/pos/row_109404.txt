Stories from the eight grade halls by u/HeyItsMe6996 (TAKE THREE) Last year was a great year for me. This year however has been my own personal hell. To lighten the mood of 2020 I have some stories to tell from last year, 2019, my eighth grade year.

One notable story is that time I got an entire week dedicated to me for being an absolute badass. There was this Teacher that absolutely hated me. And I hated mer back. One time I was goofing off with my friends at our group table and teacher starts going off on my friend even though I did what she was yelling at him for. So she goes up to him and keeps yelling and I look her dead in the eyes and say "You sure it wasn't me?" She was PISSED lmao. I got in big trouble and was luck my parents didn't murder me.

Story 2. Also during the week dedicated to me. There was this kid everyone hated. He had eyesight problems and would use it as an excuse everytime he didn't get his way and drew the bullying card a lot. One day me and a close friend decided we had enough and formulated a plan. He was going to get the kid to chase him and I would throw my jacket in his face and make him face plant. It was meant to happen because that day we had a free period in gym. We do exactly as we had planned and it went perfectly. Kid starts chasing friend and I run in front of him and throw the jacket in his face. He face planted just like I had imagined. During my week I got into trouble every day. And it made me famous. Hence why the entire week was dedicated to me. 

Story 3. So me and my friends are joking around in the same class with the teacher that hated me and we were playing a game (this is kind of a TIFU story). Friend 1 would say a word and we said the first thing that we thought of that rhymed. Friend 1 says grape but I thought he said rape and the dumbass in me decided to say "rape". I meant to say it like a question but the damage was done. Friends 1, 2 and me lose our shit and the rest of the class is like "WTF" while we are almost folded in half laughing. 

Story 4. At one point in the year we were out in the halls for a tornado and this seventh grader decided to mess with me in a very weird way. Note: the friend from the clothesline incident is here for this. Why the girl was doing I don't have the will to talk about here but it made me very uncomfortable. And while this is happening friend 1 is laughing his ass off. Cut to a few days later and me and a group of different friends are talking about the incident. Subject goes to when she takes my jacket and one of my friends decides to make a joke. He says "what did the girl do when she got the jacket?". So I say "what?" He says *"she started masturbating with it"*. It wasn't the joke that made me laugh. It was friend 2 almost falling out of her chair saying *"WHAT"*.  We all lose our shit and I laugh for nearly 5 minutes straight. 

Story 5. We are now back to the teacher that hates me. She also hated one of my friends and he decided to make her look like a fool. So we all decided that we would put a *fucking BAG of milk* on her desk. Why? I still don't know. But it was funny as hell because she didn't realize it was there until we told her. We were all laughing in our seats and she got pissed because she didn't know what we were laughing at. When we told her she actually saw the humor in it. 


That's all the stories that I remember. I have plenty more from the rest of my middle school and 9th grade years if you want. If you do want them I will make a follow up post. If i think of any more I will update and i may show this to my 9th grade classmates because I think they might get a kick out of it. 

That is all for *"Tales from the eighth grade halls by u/HeyItsMe6996."*
