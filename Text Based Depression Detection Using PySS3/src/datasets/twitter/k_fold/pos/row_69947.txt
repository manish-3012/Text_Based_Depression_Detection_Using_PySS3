So, I guess I have a girlfriend? So basically my friend who Iâ€™ve known for 3 or 4 years was playing truth or truth with me, and she asked me who I had a crush on. Well shit, I think to myself, to buy myself time I said we could play 20 questions for it, and itâ€™s going great until she figures out itâ€™s her on question 12, and is getting more and more specific. So uh. Now she knows, I was kind of anxious but she was really cool with it, said I was cute and that she loved me, and weâ€™ve got plans for post covid. Iâ€™m honestly still having a hard time believing that this isnâ€™t a big joke or prank, even though it was two weeks ago tl;dr Iâ€™m cute and one of my best friends is now my adorable girlfriend
