My crush has killed me I was walking with my crush after school (we've been friends for like 4 years) and my friend walks up (he was sick for like 3 days) and asks "oh, are you two dating?" Immediately afterward she jumps away and goes "ewww no!" I just said "no". I cant breathe :(

Ps: he knew I liked her.
