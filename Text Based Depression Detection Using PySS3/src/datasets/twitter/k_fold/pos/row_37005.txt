Here's what I think happens after death There are two scenarios depending on your behaviour in life

If you're a good person and don't cause a lot of needless suffering: you become nothing but consciousness and senses.then you will gain the knowledge of anything and everything that has is and will ever exist. You then can choose to reincarnate as whatever or whoever you want from whenever time period. But before you are reincarnated your memories and consciousness are completely obliviated and your life is placed into whatever you choose.

If you are a bad person and cause a lot of needless suffering: your consciousness and memories are obliviated and you get reincarnated as something completely random. Your punishment is lack of choice.
