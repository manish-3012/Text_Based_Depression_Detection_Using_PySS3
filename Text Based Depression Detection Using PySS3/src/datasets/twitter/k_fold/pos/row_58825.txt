How to respond when a near stranger overhears you referring to them as a "babe" So this is actually me investigating for a story I'm writing, cuz let's be honest: if this happened irl a plea for help on Reddit would be too little too late. But I figured y'all are probably my best resource, because if it were I'd just die on the spot begging the universe to swallow me.

Basically, this girl is chilling with her bff's and they're scrolling through social media (insta, probs) and showing each other pictures. Then one of her friends shows her picture with a couple ppl she knows and some *very* attractive stranger her age, and out slips "Who's the babe?" She asks a couple questions about him, and her friend is like, "Why don't you ask him yourself? Since he's right behind you."

TLDR; Basically the dude walked up by the table when she asked who "the babe" was and she needs to respond in some way other than melting into the earth, preferably something not awkward, that doesn't necessarily shut down the idea of her finding him attractive, but also doesn't make her seem creepy. I know this community has some smooth talkers out there who can come up with the perfect response to almost anything ;)

Thanks guys!

P.S. I posted a similar thing around 3 am, but apparently that's not a good time to get feedback.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜¬
