I was talking to a girl after she said I looked cute in a mask So a few days ago, my friend sent a picture of me as a streaks to one of his friends, who happened to be a girl. She replied saying something along the lines of "oooh who's that snack". (for context I have never had a girlfriend and am pretty lonely and self-conscious about my weight etc). The picture he sent was of me in a mask so basically, half of my face was covered. So my friend like the absolute unit he is hooked us and sent her my number. 

So later on in the day, she texts me just asking what I was doing, etc. We start talking and we sort of hit it off (it's not really awkward or anything). We basically talk all afternoon and I casually mention that I am somewhat self-conscious about myself and that I appreciated her talking to me. So she goes like "why you are good looking though oop". To which my dumbass replies with "nah only when i wear a mask". So she asks for a picture of me without a mask, so I take one.
