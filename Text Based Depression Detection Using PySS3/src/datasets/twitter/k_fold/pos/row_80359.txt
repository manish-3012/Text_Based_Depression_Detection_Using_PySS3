Hereâ€™s a list of best and worst things that quarantine provided. Best:

Got my out from doing my psychology test
( I didnâ€™t pay attention in that class whatsoever, it it had been a month into the semester)

Gave me time to catch up on my other classes

Gave me time to do stuff that I have been putting off.

Made me not go to prom. (I didnâ€™t really wanna go tbh and I knew if I didnâ€™t went I would have felt like I wasted an opportunity). 

Made me get into working out. But I stopped doing that after school started and when I got a job.

Worst: 

Made me jobless for a few months. 

Negatively affect my social skills. ( like I had any to begin with lmao) 

Made my hyperfixations increase.

Not being able to do senior prank.

Made me not being able to see my friends everyday. Like literally Iâ€™ve only seen them 3 times irl since quarantine began.

Made me more depressed lmao. (Seriously, October-December of last year was probably my lowest)
