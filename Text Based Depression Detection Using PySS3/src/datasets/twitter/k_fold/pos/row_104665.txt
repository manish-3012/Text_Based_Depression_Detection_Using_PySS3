I'm 13 and my boyfriend just turned 16 Why is such an age difference considered "wrong?"
We really only have a 2.5 year age difference and that doesn't sound bad, but then when it is said as 13 and 16 it just sounds completely wrong to people. Love is love, and I'm not supporting all pedophilia. Love has limits, but is it really so wrong that he is technically 3 years older than me?

I'm mature so I really don't believe it should be so bad but everyone else shits on the relationship.

He's going to turn 18 after I turn 15 and that does scare me, but we've been together for so long I really don't think THAT kind of pedophilia is bad. People always think the word pedophilia is bad, but I think it's only bad in cases of wanting to do something the other person won't consent to. 

If a 50 year old guy loves a 15 year old girl, sure that's creepy as fuck and sounds horrible, but only because she would most likely not fully consent to that relationship. I'm legit fucking tired of people thinking it's weird and gross that I'm dating a 16 year old. I've been with him for a long time and I'm definitely not letting us be separated by dumbass opinions, and I am definitely going to follow all laws.

I do think it's messed up how people immediately assume such a "large" age gap is bad and pedophilia is immediately bad even if I completely consent or we have been together for a long while. 

Anyway, end of this shit. 
We live in a society. ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
