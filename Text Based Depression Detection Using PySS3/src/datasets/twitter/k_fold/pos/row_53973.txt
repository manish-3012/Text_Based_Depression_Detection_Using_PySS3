My Crush Likes Someone Else So, Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for about a few years and I have recently confessed to her that I would want to make a relationship with her but unfortunately she doesnâ€™t feel the same way. 

Sheâ€™s been talking about how sheâ€™s really into someone with me, telling me how good he is and stuff, and totally not acknowledging my feelings towards her, saying that heâ€™s super â€œnormalâ€. Her saying that kinda hurt me a lil cuz ig she thinks Iâ€™m weird.

She knows 100% I like her but she really only wants to be friends and starts to gets annoyed when I talk to her too much.

Other than her, I really donâ€™t have much other people to actively talk to and my ways of coping with not having any one to talk to is posting stories on my Instagram and making YouTube content, both basically just me talking to myself about my interests and whatnot.

What should I do in this situation? Iâ€™m a bit fucked up rn because I feel like a hard ass third wheel but sheâ€™s also the only person I can have active conversations with. She goes to my school. Making new friends online isnâ€™t something I like doing and itâ€™s hard to make new friends over online classes. I really need help here. Sheâ€™s one of the only people I can relate to the most. 

Thanks, your local loser who isnâ€™t good at making friends. 


**TLDR: My crush who knows very well Iâ€™m into her, is talking to me about her crush, not caring about my feelings. I donâ€™t want to completely leave her as I donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to.**
