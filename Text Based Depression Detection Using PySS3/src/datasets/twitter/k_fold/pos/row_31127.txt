17m feeling lonely and needing some new besties 17m here. Recently couple of my best friends left me. I knew them for 6 and a half years.  I need some new long term best friends. So here are some stuff about me.

I love playing video games. Mainly valorant and Minecraft java. Oh and also a bit of apex.

I'm also a programmer/game designer so yes ig that's sorta cool. Not really

I love to watch stand-up comedy. And sitcoms. Favorite sitcom atm is friends.

I'm in California so it would be nice if I can get some people from there for timezone related reasons.
I play on pc and am in the PST timezone though I just said I live on cali so that might have been rendered mute

Anyways if anybody is interested please DM me here on reddit.
Thanks
