Guy this is actually serious So my friend is very addicted to weed. Me and a bunch of friends are suggesting things to help. Tonight is the first time weâ€™ve taken it seriously enough to help this much. Weâ€™ve suggested thing such as talking to us, watching tv, drawing, etc. to distract herself when she gets the urge. Is there anything anyone can suggest to help maybe?
