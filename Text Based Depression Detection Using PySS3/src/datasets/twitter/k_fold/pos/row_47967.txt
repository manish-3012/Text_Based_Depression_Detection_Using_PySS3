so my friend and I just had a somewhat shared dream last night so basically, I had a dream where I was in my English class where I usually sit, and then my friend walks into the room. let's call him Jacob to be safe. for some reason, Jacob is just a regular female here, and my unconscious mind thought he was actually a girl. I don't remember much, other than their basic appearance as a girl. 

then I wake up, really damn confused. I have my weet bix (which is an Australian cereal for those of you who don't know) and can't stop thinking about that dream. I then decide to message Jacob about this dream because I thought it was interesting. He then responded with "huh..." and says that he also had a similar dream where I was a girl.

ok now here's the dream from his perspective: He was in last year's maths class, and he sees me in sitting at a table with about 6 other people he doesn't know. he describes the table as looking like [the Junes table from Persona 4](https://imgur.com/a/cIItvf7). anyways, he said that I was instead a trans girl, and that it "fit me better" (according to him, those are the exact words out of my mouth in his dream). 

another thing to note, dreams usually last about 10-20 minutes. (I may be wrong about that one) I woke up at my usual time of 7:15 am. he woke up at around 8 am, so that means while I was thinking about the bizarre dream I had, he was actually dreaming it.
