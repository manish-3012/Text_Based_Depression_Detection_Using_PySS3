Google Meets is pure sexual energy. 1. Google Meets only allows you to see a maximum of 16 faces at one interval, itâ€™s satisfying, yet holds this air of mystery and allure. It makes you wonder who else you havenâ€™t seenâ€” what aspects of Google Meets are hidden from you.

2. Google Meets is far superior to our program, although we are not allowed to use Google Meets unless Schoology is downâ€” therefore, the relationship with Google Meets is forbidden (unless given permission for a brief session where we will not be permitted to express our live), only making it more alluring.

3. Google Meets is often unpredictableâ€” yet unpredictable in an interesting way. You never know what will occur during class. It keeps the relationship fun and new.

4. Google Meets is constantly asking you to rate their performance. They are adamant to improve, and that drive is attractive to many.

5. Google Meets values the individual, one of the many reasons they donâ€™t have breakout roomsâ€”  Google Meets only has eyes for you.

The intrigue and devotion, the forbidden romance, the intelligence and drive... the BDE.

This is what makes Google Meets so sexy.
