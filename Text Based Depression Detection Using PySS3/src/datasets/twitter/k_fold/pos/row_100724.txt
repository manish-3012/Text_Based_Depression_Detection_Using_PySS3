NGL i think im the virgin of the group i feel kinda sad/uncomfortable when they talk about flirting and all of that. most of the girls kinda hate me. sometimes when a girl joins our group chat or pas4 they say that im the coolest the most beautiful guy but i know they are lying (cause im not anything near cool) and sometimes i just feel they are making fun of me. but just that, i wanted to say what i think to at least 1 person
