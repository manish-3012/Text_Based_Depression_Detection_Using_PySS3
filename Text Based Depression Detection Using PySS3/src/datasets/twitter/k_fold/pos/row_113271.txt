My friend needs help So, my friend lives in a very controlling household. his parents are horrible because not only do they not him have access to the internet, he can barely even leave his house. Not only that, but they also apparently beat him if he disobeys them. I would tell my parents about this, but I have near to nothing about any of this. The only person who can help me is my other friend Jake (not his real name), he is the only one with proof of all this. I have no idea what to do, I feel helpless.
