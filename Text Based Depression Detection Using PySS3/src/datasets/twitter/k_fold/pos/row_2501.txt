I got pregnant at 14. It all started one day when I was with my bf and he decided he wanted to do some stuff. Yeah, you know the stuff Iâ€™m talking about. So I took a test because I wanted to make sure nothing happened, and turns out, that I was in fact, pregnant.
I was devastated because I wasnâ€™t ready to be a parent and also surprised that your time was wasted :D hehe!
