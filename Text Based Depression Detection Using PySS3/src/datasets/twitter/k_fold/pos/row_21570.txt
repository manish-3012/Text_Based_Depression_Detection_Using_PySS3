How tf do you talk to people ??? I struggle mad hard on the idea of keeping conversations going. Like I just dont get the point in it. Texting gets so boring so fast, and I'm just too awkward to process a response to anything in person. Cause I mean I really wanna talk to people cause, ya know, lonely teen syndrome, but I just don't get how conversations works or what to even talk about. 

Plus I don't wanna be weird when I just bring something random up, cause for whatever reason that kinda off-puts others.
 
Any ways thanks for coming to my TED-Talk. If you have any ideas or solutions please, for the love of my social life, share! Thx
