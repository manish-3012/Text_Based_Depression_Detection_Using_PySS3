How do I not offend this girl who is extremely religious? Tha last time I came over to her house, she started talking about some heavy bible shit. I wasnt sure what to do, since I have never read it, so I think I kind of just sat there awkwardly. I wasnt sure what to say, so I just said "that's cool." 

She's a very nice person, and was very understanding about it. But how I live my life is wayy different then how she lives hers, and Im terrified Im going to screw up and offend her.

What do I do?
