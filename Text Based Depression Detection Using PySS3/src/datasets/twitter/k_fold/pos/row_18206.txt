Self Awareness is Vulnerabilities Strength (135) When we are vulnerable it can make us feel small, but through embracing and facing what makes us feel small, **thats when we grow into something greater than ourself.** 

Vulnerability used to be something that I used to avoid. Thinking that eventually it will "change". Learning that our truths are always going to be different than someone else truths, focusing on our own is important for happiness, peace, self love &amp; to be one with who we are. **It all takes time.**

In this moment, what is it thats making you feel anxious? What is it that is making you feel vulnerable? Sit in those emotions. Push them away. With time, **it will all come to the surface.**

**I have learned that everything comes to the surface eventually, when we are ready, but constantly reminding myself that when facing a brand new situation through vulnerability, there will always be feelings of anxiety and fear &amp; that is totally normal, we are human.**

**I love you.**
