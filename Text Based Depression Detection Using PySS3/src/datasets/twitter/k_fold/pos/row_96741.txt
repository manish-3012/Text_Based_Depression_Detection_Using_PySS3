My parents are kinda dumb Ok Iâ€™m not sure if this should go here but any way my parents keep making dumb rules that donâ€™t Benefit them or me. And whenever I ask them about these rules they just ground me for â€œquestioning there authorityâ€. Like last week I asked them if they could raise the time that they let me play my Xbox (4 hours a week and only on weekends) and they grounded me for 2 weeks for thinking that I knew better then them. And then this week when I was finally ungrounded my mom let my sick dog get in the trash and it caused my dog to throw up and for whatever reason she blamed me for it when she was the one that let my dog in the kitchen. So because of that she grounded me for another week. and I just got ungrounded yesterday. And now sheâ€™s telling me that on September 8th when school starts sheâ€™s going to take my Xbox and tv and put a desk where they are so I can do  online school. I already have a desk so I asked her why sheâ€™s doing this and she said that for whatever reason she doesnâ€™t trust me to do my school work by myself so sheâ€™s getting a new desk for me and putting it downstairs where my Xbox is so we can do the work together. And I mean itâ€™s not like she would be any help with the work any way. Sheâ€™s not the smartest so idk how she thinks sheâ€™s going to help but any way when I told her I didnâ€™t need another desk she told me that If I said any thing else about it she would ground me for 2 weeks. This is just some of the more recent bs Iâ€™ve been grounded for. She has been grounding me nonstop since this COVID outbreak started. Any way all get to the point. Does any one know how I can confront her about this and make her see how dumb it is without being grounded again.
