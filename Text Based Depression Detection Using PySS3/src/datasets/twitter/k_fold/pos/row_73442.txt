What are some high school fashion do's and don'ts? So I'm heading into grade 11 later this year after being homeschooled from grade 8 to 10. I'm feeling worried about that but mostly I don't want to be crucified for wearing an XL shirt and some shorts that make me look like my legs begin at my knee. So for all of you high school attendees, what are some fashion do's and don'ts? Thank you all very much
