I need some help I just want to start off by saying, for the love of god please donâ€™t try alcohol unsupervised. Why do I say unsupervised? Because I know yâ€™all are still going to try it no matter what anyone says, but if someone is there to help regulate how much you drink it really stops future problems.

Now that we are done with that little lecture, letâ€™s get into my trip through sobriety. I have been sober for 5 days, yippee I know. But it has been a lot harder than I thought. Iâ€™ve been drinking to run from my problems but Jesus Christ I have a lot more problems than I thought. And now I got the problem with having to stop myself from drinking on top of everything else. Do you know how hard it is to stay sober when everyone around you talks about it and uses it? When it is on every damn tv screen, tv show, even at the dinner table every damn day? It fucking sucks.

Whether or not Iâ€™ll break my sobriety tonight Iâ€™m not sure. Iâ€™ve got a lot on my mind and canâ€™t get drinking off my mind. And thinking about it, I watched a South Park episode today that I oddly really related to. Hereâ€™s the plot, Stan begins to see everything as shit and becomes a cynical asshole. His friends leave him and he gets depressed, just going through the motions. He gets sent to a treatment place where some matrix looking people make him drink to make him feel like he did before and he becomes an alcoholic. Eventually only making things worse. 

So, now for the advice part of this post. How the hell do I keep myself sober? It just feels so damn hard and I have a lot on my mind and it would really help if you guys gave me some advice.
