Is it better to film a video with good lighting or with no lighting? Which one will more accurately convey how you look? I filmed a video of myself with good lighting, and I was told that I looked good (filmed it under a lamp) but I know that I'm ugly so I'm wondering if the vid I filmed in the dark is more accurate
