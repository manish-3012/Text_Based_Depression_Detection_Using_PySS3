I am officially good at my favorite game This morning, I finally managed to pull off a three hour speedrun of Minecraft. I know it's not anywhere near the world record but im still super proud of myself. When I first got this game years ago, I assumed I would just be an average player with not a lot of skill but now I can beat the game in under a day. Anyway I didnt have a whole lot of people to tell about this so I appreciate you all for reading this :)
