Does a relationship just seem completely out of the realm of possibility for anyone else? I just feel so alone and that there is no chance of me being in a relationship for a long time. Iâ€™m not an incel or anything, and sorry if it sounds like Iâ€™m complaining, but I just need to vent. Iâ€™ve liked a few people over the last couple years and thought I genuinely had a chance with them but was rejected and now I just feel like I really
donâ€™t have any chance at a relationship for a long time. Anyone else feel this way?
