Another reason I hate school Ok hereâ€™s a background of me: I like to think Iâ€™m pretty smart , I have an iq of 144 and I generally like school , but it seems that my teachers hate me. Today we had to do this dumb assignment that took me no time so when I submitted it the teacher says â€œthere is no way you could have done that in 4 minutesâ€ and the. She says a bunch of other crap so then I ask her â€œwell did you even look it over?â€ To which she replies â€œnoâ€ so I told her to please do that before judging my work she then gave me a 5/5 and said â€œI stand correctedâ€ itâ€™s literally like a kindergartner theme or a story of â€œdonâ€™t judge a book by itâ€™s coverâ€
