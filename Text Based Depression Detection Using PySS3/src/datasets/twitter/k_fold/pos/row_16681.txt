Question for the females 17+ I just feel like itâ€™s a question better answered by an older teen, but I started going to parties with my friends and we have some girls that started hanging with us. We drink and smoke at the parties, and I even brought molly to one of the parties and one of my buddies tried it. The girls didnâ€™t seem too off set by it. However, we were talking recently and I think one of the girls likes me. I however take lsd, shrooms, coke, and things of that nature occasionally, not addicted to anything but my friends were asking me questions on it and for some reason Iâ€™m like stressed that it might have scared off the girl Iâ€™ve been talking to mostly because idk if girls find people who try that stuff unattractive or what. What do you guys think? Is it something to stress over? I just really like this girl so Iâ€™m sorta overthinking it.
