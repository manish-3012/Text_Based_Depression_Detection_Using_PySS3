My friend recently passed away.            Iâ€™m 13 years old and Iâ€™ve known this guy for quite some time. For years we shared classes and became close. Last year, I enrolled at a middle school in which he didnâ€™t. Last I spoke to him was at a debate tournament in September. We caught up in between rounds and he was just as as friendly as I remember. I hadnâ€™t talked to him since then. One day, a few weeks ago, I was browsing my Instagram when I saw that someone had put an image of my friend with a caption along the lines of, â€œR.I.P. You will be missed. Fly high.â€ I was too stunned to speak. I Googled his name, and, there it was. Plenty articles about how he died of COVID-19. Later information shows that that was bullshit. He died of a cardiac tamponade. These news sources always go straight to Coronavirus before anything else.
                   His name was, Maxx Cheng
