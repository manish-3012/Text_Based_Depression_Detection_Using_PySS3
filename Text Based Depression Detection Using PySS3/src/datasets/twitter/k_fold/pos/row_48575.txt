Short Online School Review (by u/1-STARrating) Spoiler Alert: no, it's not going to be a 1 STAR rating

Ok, so online school's been going on for about 3 weeks already and tbh, it's more exhausting than face-to-face school. There's definitely a sharp increase in homework compared to last year but the plus side to this is that I don't forget about them, so in that aspect, the online school makes it more productive for homework, especially when every single activity that you do is at home. The downside to that is the stress really starts to kick in, having headaches and added pressure onto me. One of my teachers said it's just because we haven't adjusted to this "new normal" yet, so we'll wait and see how that will work out.

Alright, let's get to the most significant of online school: the learning.

While it is more exhausting than normal school, my memory still retains these lessons the same way they did last year: by forgetting about them the next lesson only to be brought back up again for the periodical exam. Really, this is just how the education system works in my country, it's in no way the online school's fault but it contributes to it. 

Overall, online school is fine. It's not trash by any means (only if you have a decent connection), and it improves on some aspects of learning, but I still prefer normal school, because I get to formally stalk on my crush. At the end of the day, this is just one of the ways on how to deal with *"tHeSe UnPrEcEnDeNtEd TiMeS"*. This is only a band-aid solution to the large problem that we are facing today, and hopefully, we might get back to normal school in a year or two. I will demerit points to them for how much stress they've given me though, it's infuriating.
