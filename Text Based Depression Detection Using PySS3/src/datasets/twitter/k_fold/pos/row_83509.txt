Alright tell me your best theory for why people are voting for Trump. I mean it baffles me that ANY one can vote for him with a clean conscience. He has been involved in so many scandals that would've ended the career of literally any other person in the U.S. 

He has constantly and consistently advocated for violence. Has threatened the lives of pretty much everyone, and has pretty much ruined our relationships with every other country except Russia.

The video above gives a summary of why people vote for him. I found it pretty eye opening. 

But please tell what theories you have come up with.
