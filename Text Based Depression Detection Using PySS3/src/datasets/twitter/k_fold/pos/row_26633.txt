Even though my life has gotten so much better and I genuinely feel happy for the first time in my life. I donâ€™t know why I still get random sadness streaks. Over a year ago, I was almost at the point of killing myself. But I waited and then life got a lot better very quickly due to friends and getting a girlfriend. 

I used to cry myself to sleep and get random moments that would span a few minutes to house where I become paralyzingly sad. But those have really slowed down ever since my life turned around and went from happening once a week to around once a month. For the past 2-3 months, even though my life is amazing right now and Iâ€™m happy where Iâ€™m at, Iâ€™m starting to get moments of paralyzing sadness and fear more and more frequently. Irrational fears like my gf leaving me or dying occur in my head.

I talked to my mom a few months ago about talking to a therapist and she seemed to take it seriously but never went further than that and seems to have completely forgotten about it.

Can anyone give me any advice on why I feel what I feel and how I can change it for the better? I wanna change because not only does feeling sad suck but I feel bad for my amazing girlfriend having to deal with me when Iâ€™m like that.
