My friend confessed they've been in love with me for 3 years... So uhm, I'm in 9th grade. I'm female, 14, and above all, I hate being in relationships and romantic shit.

So I used to be friends with this girl. It was my ex best friend, her, and I. We were an unstoppable trio. She moved and we lost contact. I really was the person who formed the group and held it together so nothing changed other than losing her. But my ex best friend and I went through a really rough patch and we cut ties.

I moved, carried on with life, wasn't really that big of a deal that she moved. I never thought of her after that. Basically forgot about her existence. One day, I met her again online. Only she was now a he! We caught up, met in person, hung out. The typical friend things you know.

But if there is one thing I make very obvious, I'm very open about hating romance. It's something that becomes clear as day after knowing me for a little while. I've kinda always been that way. I don't like being in relationships, I don't like the whole dating thing. I get crushes and stuff, but the actual process of being with someone is disgusting. I don't care if other people date but me, myself? Nah. Fucking filthy. I can't stand being desired like that.

I DO like sex on the other hand. So does he. We fucked a couple times, agreed on a fuck buddy relationship and I explained not to get attached. He's been pretty clingy and touchy but I thought nothing of it. Since he mostly was touching my body in perverted manners. Which I didn't care too much about. He got extra clingy after a couple days though...

Now, he's sending me messages about being in love with me and how he's loved me for 3 years. How he has poems locked away and currently writing a love letter. I know that he's pushing onto me, hoping for a relationship. Ever since we screwed the for the first time it was apparent he wanted a serious relationship between us but I was adamant on keeping us at a distance. He was fine with it.

He's just a lot... This isn't the first time someone has said they were "in love" with me. This is actually the second. Both times the concessions were with people I wasn't dating, nothing serious was going on between us. Other confessions have been normal "hehe I like you" shit and I made it clear I didn't really care. They weren't a huge problem. But he's persistent. He keeps pushing onto me about it and it's really hella annoying.

Extra: If you're curious as to why I hate romantic shit and all, I can explain. It's quite simple really. Ever since I was young my mother drilled into my head that men were awful and disgusting creatures. That they only want to use me and shit. Of course I don't believe it one bit. She's so fucking hypocritical (lmao). Though, it has impacted me. When I attempt to make a relationship with someone I feel insanely guilty about it. Like I'm doing something wrong. Being lusted after I feel numb to it. Like cool, let's fuck I don't care. But the moment someone wants me more than for my body, it feels,,,, filthy. Disgusting. I can't stand it. I get paranoid and it makes no sense. Fucking gross shit man! Of course I fantasize about dating and I want to be with someone. I want a quite life where we cuddle on the couch and watch movies while sipping hot cocoa and cook together. But when it comes to actually doing it, it's horrible. I just can't do it. I'm only comfortable being in strictly sexual relationships.
