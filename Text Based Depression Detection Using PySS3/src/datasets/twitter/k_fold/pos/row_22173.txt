I remember that one time, sophomore year of high school I was walking along minding my own business when all the sudden a black mass comes flying through the air and lands on my face. I pulled it off and it was someone's hoodie. Then these two girls on either side of me start cracking up like a bunch of hyenas and one of the girls said she was trying to throw it to her friend when I walked by and it hit me



Theres my story for the day
