If you like a more laid back survival experience, we also have a protected world just for you.

Our community is growing larger every day! We are looking for buddies to play together or on your own. This is a brand new server and we are building a really nice new community. I highly recommend that you come to take a look.

We also have a Discord channel, website and a subreddit! Type /discord in the game chat to get the invitation!
