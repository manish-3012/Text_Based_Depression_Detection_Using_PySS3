my English teacher is a conspiracy theorist so today we were reading some story about that bomb that fell to Hiroshima during wwII and she talked about how humans are cruel and then she started talking that covid-19 is the same as a fucking nuclear bomb being dropped because we are forced to wear masks and other stuff. she then began talking about how the pandemic was supposed to last 6 months and that the government has created the virus to control us. I told her that the plague in medieval times lasted for years and then she told me that the government has the technology to beat the virus but they just don't want to. I wanted to told her that no sane person that works for the government is gonna create a virus that is going to destroy the economy and ruin businesses that depend on customers. I also wanted to tell her that if the government had created the virus they would have kept it a secret and WOULD NOT force us to wear masks to prevent it. I didn't say this to her because I would  probably gonna get suspended for arguing with my teacher. I also can't go to the principal to tell him that the teacher is pushing fake beliefs onto us students because he's never gonna believe me and is just gonna tell me something like "why do you care about that" or "go do things that other kids do". the worst part about this is that me and my friends that go to my class are only 13 and young people's minds can easily be shaped. but what can I do about it. it's not like I can just go and tell the principal because he is just gonna deny it because he trusts the teacher more than me
