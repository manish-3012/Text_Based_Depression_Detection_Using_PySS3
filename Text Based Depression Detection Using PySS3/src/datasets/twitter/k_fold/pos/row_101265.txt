Healthy teenage rebellion Hi, Iâ€™m 16 and donâ€™t know how to â€œrebelâ€ against my parents.

Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for a while and we think at the root of my problems is my lack of identity. Iâ€™ve always done what my parents have agreed to and taken their views as rules and now I donâ€™t know who I am or how to be my own person.

So our plan is for me to start â€œrebellingâ€ against my parents( which really isnâ€™t hard because currently their opinions donâ€™t let me go anywhere by myself).

So I come here to ask how to discover an identity???
How to rebel??? How to stay safe, especially in the pandemic, while also becoming my own person?

This probably sounds ridiculous but Iâ€™m clueless. Iâ€™m trying to start by getting a piercing but I donâ€™t really have friends so I donâ€™t really have any ideas after that...
