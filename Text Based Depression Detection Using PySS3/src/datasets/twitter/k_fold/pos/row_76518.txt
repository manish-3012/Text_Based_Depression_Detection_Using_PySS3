Dear straight people You are not homophobic if you don't support the lgbtq+ community. It is perfectly fine if you don't care what people do with their lives. What will make you homophobic is if you actually take the time out of your day to make a person feel shitty because of who they love or what they identify as. We are not asking you to be activists, we are not asking you to go to pride events, we are not asking you to praise us like gods like what people claim. All we ask is for you to be ready and be there if someone you know happens to be lgbtq+ and accept them. Whether you like them or not, we're all human and should be treated as such. We're also asking for you to not be an asshole.

Sincerely,

Your friendly neighborhood transgay
