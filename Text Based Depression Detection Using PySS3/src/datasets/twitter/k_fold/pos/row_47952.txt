*EMERGENCY MEETING* I just saw my crush in public!!! I went somewhere and i was looking for something for my mom and couldnâ€™t find it so i saw someone in uniform and i said excuse me and she turned around and it was her!!

We immediately both recognized each other and i asked her if she knew where the item was and thatâ€™s it. 

Problem is that we havenâ€™t texted in 4+ months because she ghosted me and now I wonâ€™t be able to stop thinking about her even more. Iâ€™ve had a crush on her for like 2 years!!!
