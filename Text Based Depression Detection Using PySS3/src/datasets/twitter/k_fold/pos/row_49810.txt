Uh, I need some help from some experienced folks among y'all. So I somehow managed to get someone to love me, like, actually love me. She's my gf now and I still have absolutely no clue how to do this shit. She has had some more relationships then me but is still learning so I don't disappoint her too much. But I could do better so I was hoping for some useful advice from you people.

i dont wanna lose her...
