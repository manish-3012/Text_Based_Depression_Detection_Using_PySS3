So me and my friends created a discord server during covid lockdowns in hopes of fixing our covid slumps , and well it helped. Well I made the server knowing that it won't get big and it was just something I did for fun. But , surprisingly we are like 90 people now and the server is the chillest place ever! We are always open for new friends. DM me for invites Bois and gals :D!
