Never taking my phone to the toilet again So today I went to the toilet while watching youtube on my phone, I dropped my phone and it fell inside the toilet. Fortunately, It still works, but now the audio only works if I'm using headphones. So now I have to use headphones with my phone for the rest of my days until I fix it or get a new phone, and based on my country's economy this last option would be very expensive.

(English isn't my first language so sorry if I said something wrong)
