What does it take for a dude to get some pepper spray? Iâ€™m CONSTANTLY getting harassed and catcalled. when Iâ€™m out shopping, when Iâ€™m out for runs, walking home from school, etc. this week, on the way home from school a homeless guy winked at me and told me to meet him behind the church for a surprise. Even fucking crazier than THAT-while grocery shopping w my dad I accidentally made fucking eYe cOntAct w some creepy dude and he ended up - not only following me around the whole grocery store- but also to the MALL. He literally *cAsuAllY* walked circles around me like 7x when I sat down in a chair trying to figure out what to do. And thennn, today while walking my dog another homeless man bicycled sonic fucking fast over to me and silently just slowed down and kept my pace through the whole walk, all the way to my home. Never said anything, just stared at me the whole time checking me out (not that it should matter, but I was in my running wear) . This WHOLE WEEK Iâ€™ve been consistently asking my mom to buy me some pepper spray so Iâ€™ll feel just a lil safer and for some reason she just canâ€™t afford it. Itâ€™s 10 bucks, and sheâ€™s still buying my brother $20 Fortnite skins and shit. But when I ask for sum to PROTECT MYSELF she canâ€™t afford it cus there saving rn. So I was like, u know what Iâ€™ll ask my step dad. He constantly gets on my ass abt being safe and kinda spoils me. But holey shit, itâ€™s a no for him to. He said they will try to remember it next time they go run errands. I had the shit pulled up on amazon, right in front of him. So wtf, why is it so hard to just PROTECT myself?? And now I feel bad cus I keep asking and my mom seems all exhausted and annoyed that I like... keep bothering her abt my safety??
