I honestly can't smile right now. (14 year old ranting about stuff) Let's call myself Mat, my nickname. A skinny freckled boy that's been working out for the whole Quarantine, confident for atleast 2 weeks, then that confidence fades away.. I never wake up to good morning texts, always having to be the one to engage in a conversation. My mom and pops says that there's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion.. There is something wrong with that.

I've had atleast 4 crushes. One in 7th grade last year, where the girl pretty much ghosted me and insulted me behind my back.. Probably because I was being too soft, and one this year.. Still kind of have feelings for her, since she always kinda played with my hair in 6th grade and was just fun to hang with, but now she's mostly friend-zoning me. How? Well... I think calling me "bro", "dude", "my guy" 500 times is most definitely what I see as a friend-zone... 

Now my current one? I talked to her on Instagram and she gave me her number. It was fun in Instagram, but now she's more cold in texts...

**She's in quotes and i'm outside of quotes:**

You excited for Christmas? 

"yuppp but december went by so fast"

It felt like it was Thanksgiving a week ago

It's already almost been a month

"ye it's crazy"

\---------------------------

Idk, she's cold, she's short in texting.. I guess she's in a trip rn so I'm just being insecure. Idk, I just want someone that can talk to me and make me feel special.
