I have a crush, and I don't know how will I tell her There was this girl on my class, she always get praised for being good on her studies, and her projects always gets featured every class meetings. I started to hated her in the beginning of the semester because I was jealous of the attention and praise, but not too much tho, just enough to make me wonder why she's being recognized more than me.

Okay so as the semester goes by, I still hate her but I gradually started liking her for some reason, maybe it's true that the more you hate, the more you love. And now  I really don't know how to tell her what I feel. I'm afraid that she might reject me because of my physical appearance or she might already have a boyfriend.
