The college board just decided to fuck me and all my friends by banning all their exams for a year in my country. I don't how the fuck i should react to seeing my future being destroyed like this.

3 days ago in Egypt after a week or so from August SAT trail the college board decided to cancel all the scores for the aug trail in my country for "Security and fairness concerns"
studying for like 3 month in the summer holiday and seeing the exam cancelled isn't the problem. The problem here is that they announced after it due to the leaks of the previous exam they will cancel all the exams in my country for the year 2020-2021 for all sat and sat subjects tests. Which is just complete nonsense. 

I am a grade 12 student which makes this a real boom and hit to all my future. The minister of education stepped and said the SAT will no longer be the official test recommended by them instead they will choose the ACT. The problem here is there isn't more than like 7 test centers for the whole entire country which has a population of 100M+ unlike the sat which was presented in maybe a hundred test center or so. And with such demand i could not book any test at all.

I felt like the past week was an eternity of pain for me and really dont have anything to say other than fuck my country and their education system and fuck my life with them
