I wish I could make new memories Irs 2am and I shuffled my entire music library and a whole bunch of songs came up I haven't listened to in a year. I've never really been the most socially interactive person so the only people I'd consider my best friends have been mostly through messaging.

And I'm sitting here listening to these songs that I was told about by my old friends who don't talk to me anymore and it puts into perspective how solitary I am. I've wasted my time being a teenager by being alone. I've never had a real best friend because I have zero experiences and real memories. My only valid one is smiling at my best friend whenever she got on my old bus and having her smile back. Bittersweet. But other than that my life has been a screen with no real human interaction and it sucks.

I want a real friend
