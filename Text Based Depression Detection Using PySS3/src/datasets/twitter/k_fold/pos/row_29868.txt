Funny crackhead fucked up story from my crackhead fucked up playbaby childhood (Probably when I was around 7) On my brother's computer I renamed "abc mouse" (the icon on the main screen) to "monkey monkey crap". A couple days later, my Dad cleaned files from his computer and I was freaking the fuck out because I was worried he would find it. (He didn't). I, never told him about it.
