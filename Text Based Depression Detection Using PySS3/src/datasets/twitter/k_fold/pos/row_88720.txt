Stop fucking projecting your own issues and saying porn is bad for other people. Maybe it's bad for you, but not for me, let me enjoy it without whatever you have to say about it. It doesn't warp my mind or any of that shit. I do not even care about having sex IRL, I'm very body positive and I don't think my boyfriend needs to have a super sexy body and 10 inch dick. That's just you.
