Does anyone remember that fuzzy feeling static on those old tvs? Does anyone remember those old tvs that if you touched them you could feel the static and it felt really fuzzy. I recently realized that no one will know that feeling once our generation is gone. It's so sad cause it's such a good nostalgic memory for me. It brings back a lot of great memories from when I was little.
