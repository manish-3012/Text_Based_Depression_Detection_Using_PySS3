Relationship story 2 years ago So I used to like BTS(I don't enjoy their music anymore) and all BTS fans always have one member they really like. I was obsessed over one dude from the band and my boyfriend got so jealous LOL. I never even spoke about the band in front of him but he logged into my Instagram and saw all the posts I saved and got mad at me and told all my friends about it. Ofcourse my friends knew I liked the band but they didn't tell me anything until I found out after a few weeks because they were acting weird. Just saying, don't waste your time on immature and stupid relationships when you're young and have so much more to learn and grow when you're in school
