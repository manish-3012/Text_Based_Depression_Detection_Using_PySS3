sex is unnatural The common mode of sexual intercourse is not even natural. Our genitals are not for pleasure, they are for procreation, and that occurs when two people are very much in love and wanting to reproduce. Nature takes its course when the couple is asleep, laying naked and embraced. Procreation occurs by the vagina acting as a vaccuum, drawing the flaccid penis inside to a climax, and eventually, ejaculation.
