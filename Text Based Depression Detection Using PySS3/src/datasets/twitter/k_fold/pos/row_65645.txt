Facebook creep is spamming me messages. I am planning to reverse uno card the shit out of him. So, there's this Facebook acc that is spamming me messages lately. Note: I don't know him or anything, we don't have any mutuals and he popped out of nowhere.

 (He's speaking a different dialect so these are the things that I have understood: Babe, Have you eaten already? Where are you from? and things like that). I already told him that I don't even know him but he still keeps sending messages. That is why I came up with a devious plan to send him at 12:00 am some weird-ass videos like : Begotten trailer, Yoko Ono screaming in an exhibit and anything from creepypasta. 

He's bothering me so he got what he deserves.

Wish me luck.
