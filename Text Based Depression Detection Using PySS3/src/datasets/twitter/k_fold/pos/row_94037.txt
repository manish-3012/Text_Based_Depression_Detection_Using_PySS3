Dude I am not sure about my personality anymore Like I always liked being a male but the thing is when I think about it, it seems like i always wanted to be a girl like when i was a little kid (6 or 8 y/o) I always dreamt of girls turning me into a girl and i didn't even know what trans people are. I don't know dude i am not sure about my gender right know i looked up to like girls outfit and some other spesific items and they look so cool i wanna have them but I can't . And sometimes this maybe sound so strange but sometimes just sometimes Iwhen I am home alone I pick up my mothers items her underwear and stuff and wear or use the mI am weird I know.
