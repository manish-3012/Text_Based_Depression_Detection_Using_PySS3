I love her, but I think itâ€™s best for everybody if I let her go So Iâ€™ve been with this girl for about 9 months. Weâ€™ve been together through a lot, and I really thought she was the one, but itâ€™s starting to feel like this is the end. 

She seems to be doing very good. It been like that for about 2-3 months now, and of course Iâ€™m happy for her. Thereâ€™s just another thing to this. I donâ€™t think she needs me romantically anymore, and Iâ€™ve thought that for all those months. She doesnâ€™t treat me that good after all, and I just feel like Iâ€™m something meaningless in her life. She have broken up with me twice and both times she wasnâ€™t sure of her feelings and she said it didnâ€™t feel right, but both times she told me that she was wrong a week after, and we came together again. We doesnâ€™t like when Iâ€™m affectionate to her, and we have a maybe over-the-average amount of problems. Iâ€™ve tried to solve them for months, but Iâ€™m the only one trying. I love her so unbelievably much, but I can also feel that my romantic feelings for her is fading. Iâ€™m not sure they are though, that maybe this is just a period but idk. 

I think itâ€™s best if I end it, and we just call ourselves friends, but I donâ€™t want to kill her happiness and how sheâ€™s doing. Iâ€™ll always love her and be there for her though.
