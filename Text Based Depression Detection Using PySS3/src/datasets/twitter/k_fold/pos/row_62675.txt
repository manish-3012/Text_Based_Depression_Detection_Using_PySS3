day 1 of sharing some of Uncle Irohs wisdom I finally watched the legendary show, Avatar: the last airbender and fell in love with Uncle Iroh. I realized that everyone deserves to be blessed with his wise words so every day iâ€™m going to post one of my favorite Uncle Iroh quotes on here. I hope you guys stick around :) 

â€œIf you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.â€ -Uncle Iroh
