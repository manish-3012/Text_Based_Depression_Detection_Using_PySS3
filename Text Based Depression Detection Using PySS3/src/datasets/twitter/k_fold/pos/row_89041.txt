text on insta? I just wanted to text my crush on insta, but idk what to say...today and tomorrow we have tennis (at a tennis club; I still never talked to her btw) and I wanted to say something like: "Hey, since when do you play tennis? You're pretty good...etc"...
would this be a good opener or do you have another idea?
