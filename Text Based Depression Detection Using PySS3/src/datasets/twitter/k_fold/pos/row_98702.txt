Day 13, another (possible) corona time I think I might have covid, the only thing that I have is pressure on my chest. Iâ€™m going to sleep on it and hope it gets better in the morning, but if it gets any worse, or I feel the same as today, then imma tell my parents. I donâ€™t think that I have it because thatâ€™s the only symptom I have, but itâ€™s not to the point where it makes it hard to breathe, I just feel a little pressure on my chest. I really hope I donâ€™t have it because that would just beâ€¦ sad to say the least
