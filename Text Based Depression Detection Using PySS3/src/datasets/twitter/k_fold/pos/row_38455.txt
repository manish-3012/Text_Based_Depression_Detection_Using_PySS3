People keep confusing racism as a whole with systematic racism Iâ€™m going to bed so I know this sit he worst type of post to make as of now but yeah, I canâ€™t respond until the morning, although itâ€™s be cool for everybody else to debate rather than ask me questions

Ok so the majority of people I know (and majority on social media) believe that it is absolutely impossible for any black person to be racist towards any whites person, usually because of power

Just going of the basis that the white person automatically has power over the black person is self deprecating and simply not true

And also it doesnâ€™t take into account the fact that itâ€™s only one form of racism

Yes systematic racism can exist (the extent of which it exists can be debatable) but anyway yes, someone can use their power to punish someone based on their skin colour

But even then, that doesnâ€™t mean only white people can be racist in that sense, I mean because Obama was the most powerful person in America, white people now canâ€™t be racist?

Anyway yeah, itâ€™s literally in the name, racism is racially motivated, the word isnâ€™t called whitepeopleracisttowardsblackpeopleism but itâ€™s someone of 1 race discriminating someone else because of their race

Hard times one group went through doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t (on an individual level) do that thing back and itâ€™s absurd to think they canâ€™t

If a black person came up to me and said â€œblack people are superior to white peoples, white people are vile scum, I hate the colour of their skinâ€, I think thatâ€™s racist and yet even then, many think that isnâ€™t

Also every single dictionary will give the multiple forms of racism, as there is just one form like I said

#Ok so like I said, Iâ€™m going to bed. Iâ€™d love comments on here maybe explaining why I may be wrong but itâ€™s best if questions arenâ€™t asked as Iâ€™m going to bed now lol
