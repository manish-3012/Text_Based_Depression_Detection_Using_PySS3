So about the racism apologies going on recently. I've seen a lot of people apologising and owning up to their actions about racist thing they did the the past. But you scroll through the comments of these videos and half the comments say stuff like "if you're not POC, it's not you're apology to accept" which is partially correct because white people aren't the ones taking all the heat from the racist things that the person had said before, but white people are still allowed to get angry and upset about stuff like that happening to POC, and doesn't it just create more racism to gatekeep who gets to accept an apology and who doesn't it based off of race? That's just what I think about it, but I wanna know to the people interested in this what you think about it.
