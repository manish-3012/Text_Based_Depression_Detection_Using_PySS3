If there was a fairy between Quebec and Iceland in theory you could drive to Europe If your including ferryâ€™s as driving, Iâ€™m not saying we should do that, we shouldnâ€™t it would be stupid but thereâ€™s a ferry between Iceland and Denmark so from there you could go anywhere in afro Eurasia, that would be extremely stupid you should just fly bug you would be able to drive between the most southern part of South America and the most eastern part of Siberia, it would require at least 3 ferrys and take fucking forever but it would be possible 

Also if you live in Quebec and the ferry was relatively cheap more people might go to Iceland, also Americans love road trips and some might be crazy enough and rich enough to drive to like Switzerland or something and that would be bad, you couldnâ€™t trust Americans with the ability to drive to Europe
