how do i deal with my friends i used to be buddies with two awesome people (or at least thatâ€™s what i thought back then) out of al my friends they always go out with me and have fun and we regularly go to the gym together as workout partners. they were a bit passive aggressive back then but i didnâ€™t mind, i always hit them up several times before i get a definite answer.

well some things changed and i donâ€™t get to seen them as often. our classrooms were located far from one another and we donâ€™t really hang out much after that. plus, since iâ€™ve been literally best friends with them for a whole year, their passive attitude pissed me off a couple of times. the last straw was probably the fact that my birthday party was poorly planned at the last second, whereas their birthday which is a couple months earlier than mine was awesome, i bought them cake, presents, and a whole bunch of shit that i came up with and we went to buy stuff together as well.

so, long story short, we are far from wing as familiar as we were and itâ€™s been a couple months. recently theyâ€™ve become a bit more passionate and i really donâ€™t want to reject that but iâ€™m very busy these days and a lot of things are going on, i just donâ€™t have the time to do stuff with them.
