Ask a gay teen whatever #7 A lot of people, whatever sexuality, seem to have questions. That can go beyond sexuality, including anything related to LGBT+ issues. Coming out, pronouns, legal problems/rights, how to show that you accept someone, etc. I can try to help with homework too (if it's science related). 

Or just downvote, whatever works
