I feel like giving up Right now I am hanging on by a thread, I feel tired all the time but I can't sleep, I haven't been eating anything other than lunch, I haven't gotten sleep at night for god knows how long. My mom is putting so much pressure on me to do better at math. She never stops to think that maybe I don't feel like trying something that I know I'm not good at, she blames everything on my xbox, like it's the reason I don't feel like going on anymore. If anything it's the only thing that keeps me going. I can't even remember the last time I felt happy.
