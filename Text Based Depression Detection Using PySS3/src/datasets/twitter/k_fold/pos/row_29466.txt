Day 3: Definite progress This ones for you u/Agenofterror55 I basically might just send these to you eventually (Doubt you remember this though)

The guy that I talked to yesterday started to warm up to me more. We hung out during break with another student who was in a similar situation to me. During lunch, I had to do some stuff and a lot of people were doing it with me. A guy in my form group (homeroom) was there as well, so I might be able to hang out with him but I doubt it. Though I did meet a guy and handshake him, even though I donâ€™t even remember his face. On the way home, I had to take a different than normal route, which was actually a bright side since the guy who was in a similar situation met me! We talked and found out we have quite a bit in common. Now itâ€™s just a relaxing weekend and then Monday with actual lessons. Maybe make some more friends there(?)
 
To those struggling to make friends out there, if youâ€™re reading this, good luck to you. Just remember itâ€™s only the start of the academic year, you have plenty of time. Just be yourself and try to talk, and you may find friends.

Thanks to anyone who read this and have a great day!
