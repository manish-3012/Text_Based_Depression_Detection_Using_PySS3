Well, I got banned from r/memes for eternity. I guess this is what happens when you do something thatâ€™s been going on for a long time with few people facing consequences. You are that unlucky guy who gets the perma-ban. Donâ€™t piss off the mods in any way if you want to stay in. Thatâ€™s my warning to all of you. (Setting flair to other b/c this isnâ€™t a full rant, but kinda one)
