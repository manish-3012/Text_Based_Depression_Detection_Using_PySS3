When i was in 3rd grade my sister was in 6th grade And whenever i would look at my sister i would always thing that she was a nerdy teachers pet but just a few days ago i realized that she was the popular girl in class that everyone had a crush on, i don't know how i didn't realize this sooner because every guy from her class used to ask me for her number. One of the guys in my neighborhood switched schools so he could be in the same school as my sister like WTF?
