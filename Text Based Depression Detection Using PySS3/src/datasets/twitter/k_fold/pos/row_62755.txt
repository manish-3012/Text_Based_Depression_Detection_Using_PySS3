I just hotboxed my room with bugspray No this is not a meme. I have not slept for 24 hours and I was getting extremely paranoid so I put on a facemask and just went at it spraying every single surface with bugspray, just because I saw one big bug. I'm gonna have to wait for it to be clear again so I can sleep.
