Today I woke up to a bunch of mean comments calling me weak and making fun of me for asking OP to put a tw on their self harm scars. Also self harm alternatives OP was nice about it and did put a nsfw cover on it

So I just want to say, that you aren't weak for self harming.  Everyone has unhealthy coping mechanisms and some of them are worse than others.  You are, however, weak for invalidating people because "others have had it worse." Mental illness doesn't discriminate and you don't need a reason to be depressed.  People that are rich and supposedly have happy families still struggle with depression.  You're just invalidating everyone to make you feel good about yourself i guess.

It's okay if you self harm.  It would be great if you stopped, but you're not "asking for attention" or "weak", you're trying to survive.  I am also incredibly proud of you if you stop or are trying to stop and I understand how hard it is.  I have some alternative coping mechanisms that help me.

**Rubbing ice on your wrists/putting an ice cube in your hand**
Rubbing ice on your wrists can help replicate pain without causing damage.  An alternative, putting an ice cube in your hand, is a good grounding technique to help calm you down and bring you back to the present.

**Writing on yourself**
Just doodling on yourself gives you the chance to leave marks on your skin, and you can use red ink if you want blood.

**Go for a walk**
Go kick one pebble all the way down the sidewalk.  I usually go in the woods and take some deep breaths and remind myself that there are places other than my shitty life and things will get better.  You can go to a park, or a coffee shop, or a book store.  Just something to get you more out of your head and help you feel some peace.

**Write in a journal**
Writing your feelings down can help you feel more validated and lift some weight off your chest.  It especially helps if there's nobody you feel like you can talk to.

**Listen to music**
Music is really important to me because it reminds me of something I have to live for.  It also helps you regulate your emotions and help you focus on something else.  Make different playlists of your favourite songs for depending on how you're feeling if you want.

**Meditation/guided imagery**
It can be difficult if you're stressed out but it can help get you in touch with yourself and ground you.  You can find some guided imagery videos on youtube or something if you're interested in that.
