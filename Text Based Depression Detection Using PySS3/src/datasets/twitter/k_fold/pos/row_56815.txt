How common is it that people (mainly girls for this question) take pics of guys they find cute? I'm using an alt account cus i'm afraid i might receive backlash for asking this.  
(were all 13)

So like i was watching an Instagram live of my classmates(female) there were about 5 people in their friend group(all girls). So they went to as store at one point and they spotted this guy they found that looked pretty hot and they started filming from afar. I personally find this pretty creepy streaming a vid of a guy you find hot.   


so I went to ask one of my female friends for her opinion and she says she does it too.   


Is this common? I'm a guy and never did this. Like I understand checking someone out but like this is recording, taking pics and live streaming.   


Whats your opinion?  


I personally feel that its fine to check someone out but taking pics is a bit too far.
