My dad just called a book about LGBTQ people who changed history that I got from my teacher 'garbage' and a 'waste of my time and education'. Over the summer, I joined a book club that was being organized by my teacher. One of the books that she chose was a book called Queer, There and Everywhere by Sarah Prager. (It's a really great book. I learned a lot.) However, I wasn't finished with it once the book club ended, since we'd been mostly focusing on the other book we were reading, so I decided to keep it for a little while longer so I could read it all the way through. A month or so afterwards, we got switched to full online/remote learning because of a spike in Covid cases where we live. That was a few weeks ago, and my dad just found the book.

The first thing he said when he saw it was, "What is this garbage?" Then he went on to say that   
"\[teacher's name\] is wasting my time and education" by letting me read that book. Not 'making'- 'letting'. He's angry I was given *permission* to read it. He's been yelling about it for a good while, and he's threatened to pull me out of that teacher's class, and based on when he's done this sort of thing in the past, he might make good on it, and that would be horrible for me, since that's one of the only classes I take that I enjoy. My mom's angry about it too, but she's screaming at me for other reasons.

So it's official- I'm never telling anybody that I'm bisexual.

i want to jump off a bridge.
