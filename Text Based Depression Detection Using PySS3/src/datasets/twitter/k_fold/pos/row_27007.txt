Iâ€™m kinda sad now So Iâ€™ve been binging the walking dead. This is my first time watching it. I just finished the last episode of season 9 and shi was getting juicy. Then I find out I gotta wait till the end of april at the earliest or the end of summer at the latest...... come on Netflix just release season 10 already ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜¡
