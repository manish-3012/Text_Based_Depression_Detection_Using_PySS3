My first ever valentine with someone This is also my boyfriendâ€™s first valentine with someone. I first went to his home and we ate lunch there. After that we went to the park and stayed there for a couple of hours. I saw my friend and her boyfriend in the park and decided to go to her house. Because of the weather my parents and my boyfriendâ€™s parents agreed to sleep at my friendâ€™s house. In that house me and my boyfriend lost our virginity and I slept on the same bed as him laying my head on his chest tell I feel asleep. 

I think this is one of the greatest days in my life and Iâ€™m really happy for it. Me and my boyfriend got intimate for the first time and thatâ€™s enough for it to be the best day.
