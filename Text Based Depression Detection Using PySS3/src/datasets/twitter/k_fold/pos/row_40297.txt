Why do people have to put others down? I just donâ€™t understand why some people feel the need to make others feel inferior. If youâ€™re smart, donâ€™t make others feel stupid or lesser. If youâ€™re good at sport, donâ€™t make others feel bad or inadequate. 

Iâ€™m terrible at maths, thatâ€™s fine, my strength is in art and English. Whatâ€™s not fine is someone laughing in my face because I am supposedly dumb, since they scored higher.

What is actually wrong with people? Just be kind ffs.
