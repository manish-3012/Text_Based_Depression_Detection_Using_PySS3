so there I was living life, the start of 2020, a very shitty life, then suddenly, out of the blue, the universe decides, â€˜Hmm, how can we fuck this kidâ€™s life up even more? How can we convert this human into a literal piece of shit in just a few months?â€™ 

They rubbed their hands, prepared to strike down the almighty upon me, BAMMMMMM **BAMMMMMMM in comes the pandemic, â€˜GET FUCKING FUCKED BITCH, ANY CHANCES OF RECOVERING YOUR LIFE NOW ARE GONE,â€™** ah fuck it beats me down and beats me down like a dog getting whipped by his owner, life punches, kicks, and abuses me down until I canâ€™t even crawl, and then fucking throws thunder and all nature on top of me, reducing me from a piece of shit to absolutely nothing. 

Haha, get fucked kid, your life is pretty much worthless now, and guess what it only took 10 months, for your 13 years of life on this planet to plummet down into the abyss like a bunch of dominos.
