When I was around 6 I thought that England was a country full of witches and other scary stuff So when I was around 6 years old I thought that England was a horrorcountry because on the tv I saw a trailer of a movie about creepy witches and because the movie was in English and from England. (In my language eng=scary so I thought that England stood for Scaryland) So I thought that that movie showed how there were really scary witches in 'Scaryland'. So everytime I heard 'England' I believed that witches lived there who would eat children and perform creepy rituals

I was next level stupid
