A Scary Childhood Experience  

This happened a while back so, I can vividly remember.

This is story of how I was almost raped. 

So, my parents were getting married and they wanted their family members to get to know each other that sort of thing. 

Me and my step bro where hitting rocks and trees with big sticks we thought were light sabers when his (f13) cousin pulled up and was like let's play hide and seek. After a few rounds later, it's her time to be it, and she finds me. I am out, but she starts chasing so thinking the game changed to tag, my 9 yr old instincts kicked in and I start hauling ass and she is doing the same. I can't remember how exactly but the next thing I know Iâ€™m pinned, hands against a wall and she trying to kiss me. I definitely, said I donâ€™t want to play this game anymore, but she still went ahead.Â I think I either started screaming, or punched her and she let me go. Then an older kid (f probably 14-17) says to meÂ â€œWhere did you get that lipstick mark from.â€ I canâ€™t remember if I said anything but she responded with, â€œYou better watch yourself you hearâ€. But in my head, I was like your right. I need to find a better hiding spot. I try to forget about itÂ but she's still a part of my immediate family so I get hella anxiety at family gatherings like thanksgiving and stuff.Â We are the only ones who know about this. 

It did not really affect me that much but to this day it scares me thinking about it. 

In fact sheÂ stills scares me. 

Iâ€™m probably going to have nightmares about this. 

However, Iâ€™ve decided to take this to grave. She was probably new to high school and boys or just wanted to do the â€œcool stuffâ€ like having a first kiss or a boyfriend. 

I just needed to tell this to someone who couldn't identify her.
