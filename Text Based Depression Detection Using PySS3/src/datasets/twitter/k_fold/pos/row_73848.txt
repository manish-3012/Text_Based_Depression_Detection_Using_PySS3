Fuck my lonely life Iâ€™m just really fed up and unsatisfied with life right now. 2020 has been one of the worst years of my life. I swear, my life started going downhill since the start of January. I lost 2 of my closest friends in the dumbest way ever and despite being the â€œpopular kidâ€ I just find myself wanting 1 close friends rather than a big group of not so close friends. Now that school has ended for me this year, I feel so alone at a home where everyone is glued to their devices. Iâ€™ve made a lot of plans with my not so close friends but Iâ€™m seriously missing my 2 best friends.

Letâ€™s call my best friend Hanna. Sheâ€™s my girl best friend and literally the nicest person Iâ€™ve ever met. She threw me the biggest surprise birthday party this year and it was so much fun but I think that was when I started losing her. So it was 1am and everyone had went back home, leaving Hanna and myself in the chalet she had booked. Weâ€™re all 16 so there was no drinking at the party, but Iâ€™m those type of people that gets â€œhighâ€ when Iâ€™m tired asf, so I wasnâ€™t really there at the moment and just vibing and having a good time with her. She abruptly stopped the music and basically confessed to me, but I only figured out what truly happened 6 months after. What an idiot right? So my girl best friend straight up told me â€œI like youâ€ and my reply was â€œyea i like you too! thank you so much for putting this up youâ€™re literally the best friend everâ€ and thought nothing about it until 6 months after. She became cold afterwards, giving me one liners and we stopped texting but I figured it was because of school(sheâ€™s from a diff school btw). So now that the school year have ended, I really wanted to hang out with her, only for her to reject me. I asked her what was wrong and it was only when she told me bluntly that she liked me romantically that I got the message. I am such a dumbass. A lonely dumbass
