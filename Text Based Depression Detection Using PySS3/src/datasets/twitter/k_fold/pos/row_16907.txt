I think it's dumb how they enforce gender roles in kids shows. Or any stereotypival roles, really. I mean, kids are supposed to be able to discover themselves. To figure out who they are. How're they supposed to do that when shows are shoving roles down their throats? I don't care on adult shows; adults can understand it if it's irony and if it's not, they know not to think about other people or themselves in that way. Kids don't understand that. Kids don't know what is or isn't right. Kids need to be taught. And in a lot of situations, tv is the first impression on kids and a major influence in how they see the world. If teen shows can be censored to prevent showing sex and drugs for the sake of preventing negative influences that are prevelant in that age group, kids shows should be censored to keep out the negative influences that can affect kids.
