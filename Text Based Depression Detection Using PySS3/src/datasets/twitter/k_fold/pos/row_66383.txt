A Karen tried to run me over I was riding my sisterâ€™s scooter ( Honda spree) and this lady started honking so I turned onto a street on the side of the road (it was in a neighbourhood) and she starts edging me off to the side then I had to slam my brakes cus I was gonna hit a curd face planted and then she got out and proceeds to tell me how I shouldnâ€™t ride an unregistered vehicle (it has a small enough engine that it doesnâ€™t need to be registered) and then drives away so now Iâ€™ve gotta fix my sis scooter
