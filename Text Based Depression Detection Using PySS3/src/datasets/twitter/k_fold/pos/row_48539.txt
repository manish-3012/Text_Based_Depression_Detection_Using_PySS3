i am so fucking tired of a certain fucking feeling. 



(so tired of fuckling dealing empty

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ sealing prong lopping 

sklut peeling. (           ).

). 

so fired against wired healing

careening into lamplit

dick-feeling
 

under a distant blanket

beneath the spiral

staircase where we hid

and found each other,

before you

died
