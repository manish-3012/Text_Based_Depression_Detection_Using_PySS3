Hey guys, can you recommend me some 'clout culture' podcasts? Sorry if bit of a stupid question, but I have been listening to adam22's podcasts recently, because the general drama and internet celebrities are just chill no harm fun for me to listen,  and all content related to 'the cuture' as the migos would say and just cheesy cheap celebrity drama are just fun to turn your brain off and listen to them.
meaning anything from clout chasers to jake paul and tana mongeau, just generally any podcast that has to do with current events and 'celebrities'
