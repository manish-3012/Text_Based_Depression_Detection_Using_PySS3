Ever had a teacher doubt your abilities? It's all in the title, but to give an example of what I mean:

I do French at school. It's mandatory for us to do both French and Spanish for our first three years.

I recently dropped Spanish in favour of French; a subject that I score higher on. 

One time however, my French teacher wrote â€˜don't use google translateâ€™ on an assignment I had received nearly full marks (39.5/40) on.

I make notes of vocab from my dictionary, and I read French books to get a better understanding of "natural" sentence structure, and even though it was two hears ago, it still irritates my spirit.

To out it less eloquently: I fucking do my work in your fucking class; I walk to school with that rasshole dictionary in my bag, and I answer the questions in class and ***Iâ€™m*** using google translate?

When the kids in the back and front legit pulling up GT on their iPhones and shit?????
