Bruh based customer? I deliver for dominoes and this one customer always tips me $5-10, shout to my nigga Tim J! He never tips our black delivery guy lmao. Wtf? Should I be concerned? Or is the delivery guy just shieeet at his job, heâ€™s the reason why we give almost half of our customers free breadsticks lol
