Relationship rant. I just wish he would talk to me when he has an issue with something. Like. I put in an effort to get along with his friend after they had talked things through even though he knew damn well I didnâ€™t like them because of past toxicity between the two.But when I had a friend like that, even though weâ€™ve resolved our issues, I still canâ€™t mention her name without him getting upset. When I addressed the way he reacted he said â€œWell I'm not gonna say something to just argue about it for the next 10 minutesâ€. We could talk things through if he were just rational about it. Heâ€™ll ignore something for as long as he can if it makes him upset and if giving the opinion will never address the issue. This is how problems start. This is why we have communication issues because we canâ€™t talk to each other. FUCK.
