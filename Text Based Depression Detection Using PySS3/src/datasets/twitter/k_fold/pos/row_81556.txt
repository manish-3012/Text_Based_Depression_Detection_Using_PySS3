Update on my stupid worthless life Grandpa died... it's been what? A week, maybe a few days more, what a way to begin 2021, specially since we spend all the holidays watching him agonize, and you know what? I've never felt more like a monster, I talked about him before, long story short, he did many good things, enough so everyone forgot about the bad and questionable things which were borderline abuse, and just typing that hurts, cause now I'm the asshole talking ill o the de dead. I didn't cry, I couldn't cry even when I tried and I was back with my refular life in less than a day, I feel so guilty, am I the bad guy? I couldn't cry an I hate myself for it, am I really that emotionless? I mourned my grandmother like any normal person would but I couldn't mourn him and my only worry that day was to sleep. 

I been waking up to my mother whailing each day and I'm tired of being the adult and having to act like the most mature of the two, she worries me, it's getting bad, she's just obsessed with him, she didn't treat her own mother like that but she's doing it for the man who gave her so much trauma, acting like he was better and a saint, even after death he still has control over her and now she's acting like I'm the bad guy, I've heard her talking on how I'm senseless, how I'm a brat, how this doesn't hurt me, it does, and being told I'm a monster doesn't help, "he wasn't your father" HE WAS, despite all the messed up stuff he did he raised me more than the deadbeat mess that got her pregnant, I'm being constantly reminded how much of a bad person I am and when I'm finally showing emotion I'm all of the sudden a brat, I'm tired of acting like the adult, I'm just 17 and I can't remember any day of my teenage years when I acted like a regular teen without having the adults tell me that I'm the spoiled one.

I literally have been the mature one trying to be as logical as possible and be as less of a burde for everyone, I've pushed my own health behind just so nobody got annoyed at me needing help or anything and I just hoped that now that we are just two people I could have a chance to ask for help yet instead I'm being the one avoiding my mom from doing something stupid...
