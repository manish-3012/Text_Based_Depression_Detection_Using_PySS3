Before October Take me back to October last year. Before everything. I want you gone, because you caused so much heartache. But I want you here, because the memories will be all I have left of you. Youâ€™re the only person that havenâ€™t grown tired of my somber melodies. Good night sweet prince, you will be king one day. Sweet dreams.
