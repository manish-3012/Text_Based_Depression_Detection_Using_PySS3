What do y'all use to study/ learn math besides Khan Academy? If it helps, I'm a freshman in college and plan on trying to take either Intermediate Algebra or Elementary Statistics (I'm an Environmental Science major)

I need to brush up on my math skills for a math class placement test for school, but I plan on doing a lot of it at work and I can't play videos due to me having to pause it every five minutes to help customers.

Idk where else to ask, probably will go to the r/YoungAdults sub too. Any help would be appreciated
