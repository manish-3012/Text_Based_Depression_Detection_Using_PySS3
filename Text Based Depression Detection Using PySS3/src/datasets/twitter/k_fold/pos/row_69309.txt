Friend is going out with my ex My friend told me a few days ago he's been going out with my ex-girlfriend and kept it behind my back for 6 days.

He is 17 and she is 14 soon and we've been friends for 8 years.

At first, I wanted him to choose between me or her and he said he will always choose me over her and he doesn't want to choose. His argument is that she's like no other girl and makes him happy. I asked a lot of my friends but they're just too scared to call him out or disagree with him so they all have a neutral standpoint and to just leave the relationship be.

I decided yesterday if they make each other happy then they make each other happy. But then I find out that he already made a decision and he's choosing her over me, now I'm sure I don't want to be friends with him if he'd do something so slimy. What should I do in this situation? I'm going out with him and a bunch of my other friends soon.

It's such an awkward situation to be in and it makes me disgusted and uncomfortable to be around him. They could've just been friends. I should've posted this on r/AmItheAsshole I might repost this there. I'm not good with words but I kind of want other people's perspectives on it.
