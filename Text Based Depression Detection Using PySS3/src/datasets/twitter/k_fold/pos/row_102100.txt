I decided to ignore my depression yesterday I'm not officially diagnosed, but I've done some research and I show symptoms of it but yesterday I got disgusted with the state of my room (which was rly bad) and decided to get out of bed and do something. Anything. I picked up a bunch of stuff from the floor and gave up halfway, then listened to some music while i tired to paint a koi fish underwater and failed misreably &lt;/3 and I didn't talk to anyone in my house so they wouldn't ruin my mood ðŸ˜¸ I drank some water and then I realized, _dude. I totally would be like this if I wasn't depressed._
