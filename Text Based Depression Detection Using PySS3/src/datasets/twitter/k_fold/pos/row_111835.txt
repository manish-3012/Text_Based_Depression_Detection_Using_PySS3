My mom is a psycho My sister was doing schoolwork and she went in and started yelling at her to go outside and my sister told her to be quiet and then she left for like 3 hours and came back now but now she is storming around the house and said she is not going to feed us. She wonâ€™t let me talk to her to try and calm her down. What should I do?
