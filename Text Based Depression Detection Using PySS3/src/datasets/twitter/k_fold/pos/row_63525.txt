My family is braindead. I cannot understand my family. 

We recently got a pair of birds and they donâ€™t have fucking common sense on how to treat the poor fellas. 

I would understand if my little brother did something stupid, but then you have my parents (especially my dad) who act like braindead. 

Meanwhile the birbs (spelling it like this on purpose) are sleeping, they will bring the TV volume to a really high level and talk like if they had speakers inside of them. 

They just woke them up because my parents APPROVED of my little brother shining a fucking flashlight at them. 

Luckily, birbs donâ€™t go blind when you shine a flashlight at them, at least thatâ€™s what Google said. 

Please have some fucking common sense people.
