GameStop is about to make me a teenage multimillionaire Go head over to r/gme if youâ€™re wondering how. 

Itâ€™s not too late my friends. Iâ€™ve dumped my life savings in this stock and quadrupled it already. 

Just a friendly heads up about to once in a lifetime opportunity for those whoâ€™re interested, not financial advice do ur research :)

This sounds like a scam on paper but just trying to give some people my age a heads up of whatâ€™s going on with this lol.
