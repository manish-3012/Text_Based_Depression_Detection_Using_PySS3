Just looking for a little mental help advice Yesterday was my birthday. Nothing really special happened. My dad made dinner and us, my brother and my cousin staying with us all ate and it was fun. Over dinner my cousin and brother brought up that my mom was a little angry and said it was something about me. This was demoralizing enough to know that my mom was mad at me without saying anything, but I had to go into her room to say goodnight and she kind of distractedly said happy birthday. She never even left her room to hang out with the rest of us and she has been kind of distant until now when I'm writing this. I feel awful that my mom is mad because of me and because she didn't even come out of her room to see me on my birthday. I've been arguing with myself all night and am even struggling to do school now because I'm just so scatter brained. Sorry if this is long, but I'm just so lost right now as to what I need to do.
