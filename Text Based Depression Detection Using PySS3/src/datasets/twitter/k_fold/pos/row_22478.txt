I'm tired of you people complaining about having small dicks (excluding you females unless you happen to have one) When I was three years old I had an accident involving nail clippers me in the bath and my parents not watching me and leaving the clippers on the counter in my reach. it wasn't serious or anything, just some bleeding and a bit of skin torn off (uncircumcised) and a yelling child.

So as I get older I developed scar tissue. Now the thing with scar tissue is the fact that it layers upon the healing skin making it larger. Many of you would say "Oh cool so your dick is bigger cuz of scar tissue" No, not at all

I get to age 13 where there is so much scar tissue my uncircumcised penis' skin literally was on the verge of closing over my dick, all that was left as a tiny little hole which made peeing take 15+ minutes and it HURT. So my parents take me to see a doctor who says I need surgery.

After surgery I wake up and the doctors say the operation was a success but there's a problem and some other things I needed to know.

1. They circumcised my dick meaning I won't have the scar tissue issue

2. My penis will be soft and will hurt to touch cuz it was covered by skin for 3 years

3. Because of the scar tissue, my penis hadn't grown at all

So I'm sitting there dumbfounded like "So you're telling me my thing, is the same size as it was when I was five?" He says "Yes give it time to grow but it will be smaller than average and it will take quite a long time because of how it was forced to not grow"

So to all of you who complain constantly about having 2 inches of dick or even 1.5. I've got 1 inch and it'll be like that till I'm at least 18 (I'm 15 rn)
