Giving up on what we call life Right now life seriously doesnâ€™t seem to be worth it, I started working this weekend and my mom is trying to force me to go to college even tho I donâ€™t have any interest in it and itâ€™s because countless reasons sheâ€™s keeps making up but I realized that you canâ€™t live life with stability and still have free time, and even my social life seems like a dead end, the girl I like more than likely doesnâ€™t like me back in that way â€œ(sheâ€™s my best friend of 3 years) and Iâ€™m afraid if I tell her how I feel then the friend ship will end, itâ€™s happened before and I was broken and I thought back then that was the worst and my all time low but nope, every day seems to top it
