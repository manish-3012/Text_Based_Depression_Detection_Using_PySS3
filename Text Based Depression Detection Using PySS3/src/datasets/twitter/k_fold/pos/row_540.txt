Finding the right hair style is so hard Seriously though I hate my hair I used to have a bowl cut ffs because I thought that it shouldnâ€™t be hair that matters its personality. I got bullied no surprise. So I got my hair shorter because I had a crush and now people say I have a mullet even though I donâ€™t. The thing is though I canâ€™t find a hair cut that suits me I look awful in images.
