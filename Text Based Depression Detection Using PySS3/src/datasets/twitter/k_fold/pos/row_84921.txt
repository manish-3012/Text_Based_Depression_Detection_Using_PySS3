Why do I still think about them even though we don't talk anymore? We never dated but we were really close however they ended up hurting me a lot and I no longer have romantic feelings for them anymore. I think they are moving on with their lives as well.

I start to think of them less and less however there are still times where I wonder how they have been, and the past memories we had but I'm too scared to reach out to them, even though we had small talk here and there but the conversations never last long.

Why do I still think of them when we don't talk anymore?
