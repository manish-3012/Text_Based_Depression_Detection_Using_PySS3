my uncle doesnâ€™t have much time left... My uncle is really sick and really bad and i was recently informed that he most likely wonâ€™t make it through the night.

Weâ€™re on our way now to say our goodbyes and i have no clue what to say or even do. i donâ€™t even know if i want to see him like this.
