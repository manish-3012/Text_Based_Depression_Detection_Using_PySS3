Yaâ€™ll ever hear someone vent and realize that theyâ€™re the problem? Like one girl I was talking to said â€œyeah this one guy that liked me was a such a little bitchâ€.  â€œI enjoy messing with people that like me and flirting, but when he found that out he got mad and said he didnâ€™t want to talk to me againâ€

Like bruh
