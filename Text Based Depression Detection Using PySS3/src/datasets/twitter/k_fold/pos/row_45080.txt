How do you date a set of twins? So uh Iâ€™m 15 and Iâ€™ve been searching for answers and I just discovered this sub but anyways I need advice on how to date a set of twins. Both of them are 14 and every time Iâ€™m with my cousin, I always catch a glimpse of them following us from a distance and whispering in each otherâ€™s ears, but when I walked by my self one day, they came to me and asked some personal questions and then gave me their numbers, and asked me out to go to the movies with them. Iâ€™m not really sure how to handle it since I havenâ€™t dated a lot of people let alone twins and I donâ€™t have that much experience in relationships either.

TLDR-A set of twins asked me out and I donâ€™t know what to do
