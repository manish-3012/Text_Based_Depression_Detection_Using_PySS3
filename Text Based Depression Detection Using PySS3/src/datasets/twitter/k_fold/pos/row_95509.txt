Guys my mom is gonna make me walk 1.8 miles to school. I made previous post about this about how I got suspended off the school bus. My school is 1.8 miles and my mom is gonna make me walk. I told her Iâ€™m not walking and she said I have to. Should I email my guidance counselor because I am not walking 1.8 miles to school on a busy road before the sun even rises. I was told by a fellow redditor this is illegal.
