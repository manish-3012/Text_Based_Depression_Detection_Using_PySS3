I simply am not here anymore Everyday I wake up and I wish I didn't. Everytime I go outside I see hundreds of people that I'd rather be. I just wish I could wake up and it's 2018 again, back then I was so young and innocent. I wasn't a monster back then. I'll never be able to move on, and honestly, I don't deserve to. I know that there's only one way out of this suffering, but I don't have the strength to follow through with it. I can't do that to my mother. So here I am, stuck in the echo chamber of guilt and self-hatred that is my mind, slowly gnawing away at my own soul until there is nothing left but a mere husk; a shadow of what was once a happy, content being. All I do now is sit in my bedroom, wallowing in my own selfish despair. The days all blend together; when was the last time I felt happy? I can't remember, it's all a blur. I am empty, the black hole in my heart has sucked all the meaning and fun out of life. They say "a day without laughter is a day wasted", and it's been months since I even cracked a smile. So what's the point in going on? My parents are already sad enough watching me slowly but surely slip away into the nothingness. I am no longer a person, I no longer have a life. I simply am not here anymore
