Thinking about life You ever sometimes just sit down and just think Like yep this is my life. My family must be so unique, like none of us can communicate with each other for longer than 5 minutes before total silence, feels kinda quiet and lonely. And man this year makes you realise just how many real friends you have. I canâ€™t make friends outside of school, I donâ€™t believe I can fully express myself online. Need some hobbies so I can actually have something to talk about as Iâ€™m sure talking about anime and games all day certainly will get boring.

Anyone else feeling alone rn? Idm talking, even if itâ€™s simple.
