The Americans of the Great Depression and WW2 would have ended COVID in a month! These people had discipline and patriotism. They would have shut everything down and stayed home for a month then it would be gone in 1 or 2 months. If we had FDR everyone would have an N-95 mask. If was impressive how Americans came together and make impressive sacrifices to win WW2.

Instead we have a narcissistic vapid greedy society obsessed with superhero movies and reality television. That led to a childish reality show president. 

There is nothing wrong with being pro gun and pro life but the Republicans of the past would have taken this much more seriously.
