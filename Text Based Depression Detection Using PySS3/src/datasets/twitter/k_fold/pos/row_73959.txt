What would you do if you were in my situation? At the beginning of this year, I met a lovely person, we ended up liking each other but due to some circumstances, we decided to remain as friends.

We talked everyday for the first half of this year but in that period, our friendship drastically changed - we started having disagreements, fights, misunderstandings and that person even started insulting me and calling me names, which hurt my self-esteem. I ended up blocking them but they still found ways to reach out to me, just not that often anymore.

During the second half of this year, we just drifted due to being busy with our own personal lives and we have gotten used to not talking to each other anymore.

I no longer have romantic feelings for them and I think they do not like me that way anymore but I have been thinking of whether I should reconnect with them as the year is ending but I don't know if I really should.

Every time they came back, our conversations never last long and the last time they did, they said they wanted to ignore me so ???? why would they text me anyway?

Even if I don't reconnect with them, it's fine to be honest, like I would still live my own life anyway. However, there are still times where I wonder how they have been, you know?

TLDR: Thinking about reconnecting with an old friend, who hurt me a lot in the past. Should I do it or not?
