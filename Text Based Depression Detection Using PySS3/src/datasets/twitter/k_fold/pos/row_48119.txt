Why I (a girl) wants a bf over 6ft I am 5' 9" and would feel weird in a relationship with someone noticably shorter than me

Honestly as long as they're 5'6" or taller I'd be good with that 

And if they're personality is amazing and they have all the qualitys I value in a bf then height doesn't matter.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
