Even in my dreams I suffer. I just had a dream in which a Bill Cipher like creature appeared in front of me and a group of my friends. The creature then decided to latch itself onto my head and repeat all the things I'm thinking. No way that could go wrong right?

Wrong, among the people that were there was my crush (dream crush, that is) and it somehow comes out from the mind reading ceature that I like her. Now, my brain decides to ignore this for a little bit. Then later, when the creature is gone my crush walks up to me, mentions what the creature said about me liking her and, as a direct quote from my dream, says "Hell no". 

Why must my brain cause me this kind of suffering? Why couldn't I have had just one dream where things work out and I can feel nice and wholesome? My brain just really did me dirty and I think I'm going to go make bad decisions just to spite it.

Moral of the story: my brain actually seems to enjoy causing me emotional pain.
