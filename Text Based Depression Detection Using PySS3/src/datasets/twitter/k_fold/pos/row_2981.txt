Sometimes I feel lost and alone I know Iâ€™m not bad for enjoying villains and dark premises in movies and tv shows, but I still sometimes feel lost by the people around me. I like it when characters are complexly dark, but every time I try to bring it up, that person shuts me down because of morality. Itâ€™s hard for me to figure out exactly who I am, and when something I like is something I shouldnâ€™t like.... I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m venting right now. I may sound like a crybaby, and I am, and the reason I feel lost is Iâ€™m bad at explaining why I like what I like, so they donâ€™t connect with me, I have a lack of motivation so I feel like I wonâ€™t do anything, and my emotions and anxiety are on 100%. How do I fix myself?
