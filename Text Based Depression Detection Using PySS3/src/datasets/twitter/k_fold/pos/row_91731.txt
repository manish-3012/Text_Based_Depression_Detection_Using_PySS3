Another night of crying myself to sleep So basically my mom told me and my sister than we have a older brother,but he was a still born ,and he would be 15 now,and I'm wondering why I wasnt dead instead of him,he could of been a great person,and would have had a good family,and I'm here with no plans with my life,and not attractive at all,and I wasnt told by anyone at all about him until today.and here I am crying because im basically a waste of money,time,and space,no plans,no goals,just straight useless.
