YO I JUST AM SOOO HAPPY RIGHT NOW Ok so there is this girl at my school who I had always thought was cute but never really thought any further.

A lil later on we start to talk and kinda flirt with eachother but in just the way where u kinda mess with them. Like how we used to do in elementary to the "pretty" boy/girl. 

I get her number and we start talkin. The convo starts out by us gettin to know eachother more and stuff like that. But then I asked what was her dream date...she replied with drive in movies... so I told her that was my dream date aswell ( which it is ) and then she asked if we could go some time!

I know usually the guy is supposed to make the first move but I really dont care. I am just happy!

For the 3 people that actually read this... thanks :)
