I just had the weirdest exchange with someone on Reddit just right now. I was doing some last minute checks on my assignments to see if theyâ€™re done and everything when I got a notification for a request to chat. I usually accept them because of my curiosity, but this conversation wasnâ€™t a bot or some rando. 

No, it was literally guy asking for nude photos of me. Yeah, I canâ€™t believe it either. I mean I appreciate that you find me pretty enough to go as far as to ask me for a nude, but Iâ€™m not what you call the â€œmost handsomest man in the worldâ€. 

Anyway, the account that messaged me was brand new. No posts, no comments, and only 1 karma. You can tell where this is leading. He claimed he was 15 as well and â€œwas curious to see me naked.â€ I swear Iâ€™m not kidding. After his claim, I went on with it. I shouldâ€™ve ended the conversation there and just blocked him, but I got over-excited and decided to progress further. We exchanged Discords, he asked for a dick pic and I sent him a vid of me saying â€œhey pedoâ€.

Looking back at it now, I knew I couldâ€™ve handled  the situation a lot more maturely, but it seems I acted impulsively. Still, pretty weird conversation nonetheless.
