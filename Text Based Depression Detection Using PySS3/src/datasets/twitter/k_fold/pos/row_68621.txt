Some books fell on me to make my day worse Hi guys I donâ€™t know what im doing here but Iâ€™m here. 
My day was sucky today cause I had a bunch of schoolwork to do that I procrastinated on so I crammed it in and it made me feel bad. 

Then my mom got mad at me so I felt worse so I went to my room to be away from everything. Then some books fell on me and now Iâ€™m just crying because why is this happening to me it just keeps getting worse.
