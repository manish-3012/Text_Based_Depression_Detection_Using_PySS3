I was today years old when I found out the pink marks on my stomach are actually stretch marks. HOW TF DID I ONLY FIGURE THIS OUT TODAY? 

Like I didn't know what tf they were until my fellow chubby friend took off his shirt to change and I noticed the same pink marks. Like obviously I know I'm overweight but I didn't know it created these stretch marks, I thought it was something else. What exactly, idk. 

Okay it's 12am I'm tired as frick, goodnight.
