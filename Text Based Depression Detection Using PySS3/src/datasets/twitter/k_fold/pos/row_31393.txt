People are too overly sensitive nowadays. I know that now it is like expected to always be politically correct but things have kinda gotten out of hand imo. I was meeting up With a few people and I was like â€œhey guysâ€ the two guys that were there looked at me and one of the guys said â€œthatâ€™s kinda offensive try not to use gendered languageâ€ At first I thought he was kidding so I kind of laughed. But then I realized he was being serious and he was genuinely offended that I assumed that they were guys. I was just trying to be friendly I donâ€™t know if it was genuinely offensive just my opinion lol but I think people are too overly sensitive. 

by the way I stopped using â€œguysâ€ when I was addressing them because if they did genuinely find it offensive I didnâ€™t actually wanna offend them I just thought that it was kind of weird how easily offended people are these days. I had no spiteful intentions by saying â€œhey guysâ€.
