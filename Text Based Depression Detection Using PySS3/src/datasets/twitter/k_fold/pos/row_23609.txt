I feel like shit. So me and my dad were talking about online school, and he was saying how easy it must be, and that there is probably no kids flunking their classes rn.

But im not doing so well, and under his terms, im flunking one of my classes.

It makes me feel like shit, because you know what? Most of this shit is easy, online school just made it easier than ever to be lazy and not do the work.
