Can someone motivate me to get help for depression? I'm very scared because  If I go to the doctors and they diagnose me with depression/something else, they will tell my parents and then they will tell the rest of my family and I'm very reserved and I don't want to tell anyone about my mental health problems. Also if I go there come back and after some time of taking antidepressants, I kill myself, I might make the doctor/therapist look bad.
