I think a girl likes me she has loads of friends in our class, and has only just met me. Yet she keeps wanting to be my partnered in work, I asked her why earlier and she said itâ€™s odd . Then we started to talk about life, and I said Iâ€™m bi, she looked relieved and said same. We Burst out laughing Then. She keeps looking over at me in class now, and looking away when I look at her...
