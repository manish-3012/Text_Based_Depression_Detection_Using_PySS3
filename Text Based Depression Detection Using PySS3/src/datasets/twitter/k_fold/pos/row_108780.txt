loneliness is a plague this summer everything went to hell bruh i lost all of my friends. the only time i talk to someone is when some kid needs answers for school and the worst part is that i'm afraid to say "no" bc i wanna just talk to someone. the only way i can ever talk to anyone is if i text first. no one would like to start a conversation with me. i sit around my house all day sad and no one ever checks up on me. i'm constantly checking snapchat to see if i've gotten a message from literally anyone but every time i enter the app there's nothing there. i barely even talk to my sisters who LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE AS ME. when i try and talk to someone i usually just get a laughing emoji as a reply which is a huge sign that the person ur talking to doesn't actually care abt what ur saying. i could post on all of my social medias that i'm going to kill myself and no one would care (not suicidal just trying to prove a point). on top of all of this, the same people that i try and make friends with are the same people that post "i need someone to talk to" or "new friends." ...i see people all over social media hanging out with others or just being genuinely happy and i can't relate.  all of my gaming friends got PC's and i'm stuck on console so i haven't heard from them in the longest.

i'm just tired of this shit man. why does it feel like no one notices me? i'm so alone :(
