Message to those of you who donâ€™t do anything on team projects 
Get your lazy ass off your phone, help your damn teammates, you might be thinking â€œoh its not that hard, my team mate has thisâ€ but did you think about the fact that they have to do theirs too? I spent probably 50 hours on a college team project covering for 2 people who refused to do anything. If I was paid minimum wage, I would be $600 richer. Help. Your. Team.
