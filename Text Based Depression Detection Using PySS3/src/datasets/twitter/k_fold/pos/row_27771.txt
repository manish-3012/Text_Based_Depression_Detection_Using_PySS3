Am I weird Am I weird that I think of humpty dumpty as this:
Humpty dumpty sat on a wall (humpty the dummy was close to a rebellion), humpty dumpty had a great fall( he started a rebellion), all the kings horses and all the kings men couldn't put humpty together again(couldn't teach him to be part of the kingdom and to stop rebeling regardless of torture). What I think the ryme is trying to say was: humpty was a dummy and didn't fit in, he started a rebellion that he could not win, regardless of torture he remained pure, and now his crimes he will pay for
