Need Advice for Interaction with my crush I've liked this girl for many years now, and I have no idea if she likes me back I've been way too nervous to say anything about it. We've known eachother for a long ass time and we were best friends not too long ago. I'm nervous and confused on how to pursue her. I've tried to get over her many times, thought about other ppl but for some reason my brain just won't agree with what I think would be the best interest for her. I'm also scared to text her cause we already have history, then don't wanna do something to grow apart even further since we stopped talking. Any advice fellow Redditors?
