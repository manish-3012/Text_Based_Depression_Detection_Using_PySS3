Just a little tip for you Hey, if y'all are in school right now (not currently but your doing school in person) I have a thing for you.  If your school wifi blocks game and stuff, download this [https://1.1.1.1/](https://1.1.1.1/) I assure you it is not sus and is completly safe, im using it right now. youll be able to play games/go on reddit (hence why im using it) if you have anything but a chromebook you can get this, have fun being able to do stuff :)
