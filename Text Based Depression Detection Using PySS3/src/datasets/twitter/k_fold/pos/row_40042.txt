A Poem, its romantic, so pretty cringy The girl I love is a rose, you can gaze upon her beauty for hours upon end, one cannot recklessly attempt to pluck her, as she'll prick you with her razor sharp wit. Her petals are a confident red on the outside, but a tender, gentle blue on the inside. she has the sweetest of pollen, making her quite popular among the bees, which leaves me lost in a swarm, just one of many.
