worst day at school so yesterday (wednesday) my ex was still mad at me because I broke up with her, and at second break I went to play some basketball but the hall was closed. so me and my basketball mates were just hanging around the hall for a while then we had a lockdown. we went into the hall and locked the doors. it turns out that a my friend kicked a ball into a certain persons face. they won't be named for privacy reasons. the kid who got the ball to the face will be called Joe. Joe doesn't take it very well and decides to chase him down and punch and kick him. my friend who kicked the ball will be mason. mason runs into the office and the office ladies lock the doors. Joe didn't see mason run into the office and the office ladies said to Joe "he went that way" and he kicks the glass door, shatters it and gets a glass shard in his leg. I don't know what happened after that but Joe got taken away by the police and the school got out of lockdown after 1hr and 30mins.
