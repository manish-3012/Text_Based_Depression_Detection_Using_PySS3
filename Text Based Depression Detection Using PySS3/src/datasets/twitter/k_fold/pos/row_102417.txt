I fucking can't with people anymore. I give no trust now, I have been falsely accused of rape. So this all happened at work. Me and some of my friends went to whataburger. This girl, uninvited, comes with us. So here's what happened. So we went to whataburger, I apparently was being a dick, when am I not, but I offered to get her something. Her ass, uninvited goes "you always so rude," I didn't listen passed this point, and felt my knife cut my leg, so I pulled it out to stop it from digging into my skin. She says "I'm gonna beat you up" as I pull it out to stop my leg from bleeding. I really said, oh shit. But she's like, be nice to people, I said motherfucker I offered to get you something. Now I'm a rapist. So I had my knife almost cut my leg, she says I'm gonna beat you up as I have it out of the pocket it ripped my jeans of. And now I have a death threat and rape report. I was in the car with 2 other people who said the complete opposite of her story, summing up mine, everyone believes her. I dont even know what to do at this point. I may end up losing my job for something I didn't even fucking do.
