Thinking about the past Idk why but I'm thinking a lot about the past for some reason. Fun stuff that happened. Stuff I wish I'd done. Stuff I wish I hadn't done. Things that I wish I could have done but couldn't. Those kinds of things. 

Nowadays everything just sucks. Not everything, some things are nice but overall things suck worse than normal. Life isn't as enjoyable anymore. Every day is the same and it's getting old. I can't stop thinking about how I wish my life before was more eventful but barely anything exciting ever happened. Most days I just went to school, came home, and stayed in my room because I had nothing else to do. Now it's worse because school is more or less in my room too so I really don't do much. I wish I knew more people to go out and do stuff with because rn is not a good time for me
