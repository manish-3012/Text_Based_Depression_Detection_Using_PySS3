Kinda Pissed Hi this is my first post on this subreddit, and the reason I'm here is to get an opinion on something, but first I need to tell the story of why I'm pissed.


So basically Abaut a month ago I told my best friend I had a crush, on this girl, and I would talk to him abaut her quite a bit abaut her, and when I told him abaut her I didn't think anything of it.   Then abaut a week ago he broke up with his girlfriend, and I comforted him whenever he got sad abaut it, and today I got up, and I got on the discord server for the MC server that me, my crush, and a bunch of my friends (including my best friend) play on together, then my crush joined the Vc I was in, and we played the MC server for a while. Then she told me that my best friend and her had started dating, and now had became a couple.

Now I want to know is it fine for me to be mad at him in this situation, as I am kinda mad at him.
