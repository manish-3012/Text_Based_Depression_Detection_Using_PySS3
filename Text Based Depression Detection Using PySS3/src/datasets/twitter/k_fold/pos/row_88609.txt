I need sleep/health advice quick please So I woke up really late yesterday around 1 or 2PM, and I had an energy drink at 7PM before biking 8 miles in the Florida heat. Usually I'm not sensitive to caffeine but I guess I don't have a tolerance anymore because I haven't been able to sleep at all and it's 12PM the next day right now.

I'm going to a party tonight on the beach with my friends in 6 hours and I need time to get ready, work out, eat and all that so it's either I take like a 3 hour nap which I think is impossible atm or I just stay up and deal with being sleep deprived and drunk at night on the beach with a bunch of random people. Thoughts?

access to adderall btw but I don't wanna take any cuz I'll be tweaking hard
