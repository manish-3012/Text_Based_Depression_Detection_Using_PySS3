Daily Boredom Post: Day 1 Hello and welcome all to the start of my daily postings.

Iâ€™ve been feeling rather bored the last few days so decided that Id elevate some of that by posting once a day about random things until the boredom leaves my body.

Todayâ€™s topic is just gonna be me talking about myself, so if you dislike or just donâ€™t care about this sort of thing feel free to ignore this post. I wonâ€™t mind. Honest.

Anyway letâ€™s get started here.

My name is Manahi, age 17 though pretty close to being 18 in a couple of months and Male. Iâ€™m a high school dropout who has rather severe social anxiety, hence why I rarely leave the house unless Iâ€™m forced to. My favourite colour used to be red, but decided to be edgy and cool and switched to black. Donâ€™t have many hobbies other than scrolling through Reddit for copious amounts of time throughout the day and watching YouTube. I just so happen to enjoy a little bit of writing to alleviate the boredom of boredom everyday life. Failed NNN on the very first day and decided to just roll with it. Owner of a rather stupid female Rottweiler. Iâ€™m Bi, bordering on just straight-up gay. Uhhhh. I wear glasses. Have also figured out the secret behind Santa and how he can deliver his presents. Casual gamer, as well as the owner of a couple of board games.

I think that me be it. Donâ€™t usually introduce myself so Iâ€™m not used to this sort of thing.

Anyway, nice to officially meet you all I guess and if you wanna ask me anything for any reason feel free to do so. Looking forward to seeing how long I can keep this up. Also, can somebody tell me if Iâ€™m using the right flair or not, thanks in advance. Until next time.
