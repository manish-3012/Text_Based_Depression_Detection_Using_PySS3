People of reddit, this is important I pretended I was a girl while having a chat with a creep for a little over an hour and...I'm just going to say that I don't ever want to go through that again. I think I'm on the verge of breaking down because I just feel so violated. All that are reading this and those that have to go through this every day, I hope you're doing great and being strong

Yes, I blocked and reported the person. I hope to never meet that scum of the earth irl
