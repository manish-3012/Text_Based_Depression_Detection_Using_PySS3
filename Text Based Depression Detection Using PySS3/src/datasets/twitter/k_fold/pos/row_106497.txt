I'm done with this shit I've been dealing with depression for the last few months, but I'm too stubborn to get help. For the last week everything was fine, until yesterday, I had a fight with my mother, which ended up with her cutting off my internet connection and me being unstable again, I just sat on my bed for about two hours, crying, and wanting to get out of this room, I fell asleep after that, even thou it was only like 7-8 pm. I woke up at about half past 10 pm, I noticed my internet being cut off, as of boredom I waited for my parents to go to bed, so that I could paly games offline. Today I woke up without any thoughts, I was just there doing nothing at all. The fight with my mother continued, ending up with me sitting in a Latin online class right now, and also I'm insanely angry about everything in existence right now.
I don't need anyone's opinion about this in the comments, or Up/Down votes. I just wanted to write that shit down and If you still want to say something, do it, but I probably won't answer anything.
If this post doesn't fit here delet it I don't care anymore.
