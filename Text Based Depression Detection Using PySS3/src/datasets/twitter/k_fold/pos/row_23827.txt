Living in a 3rd world religious country sucks ass. People don't get to choose who they marry.  


Hindus or christen children get bullied in school because the muslim children were told "Islam is the only true religion"  


You will be killed by your family if you come out as gay or lesbian or anyother sexuality.  


You don't get to date  


You will most likely be killed if you come out as atheist  


Your teachers constantly tell you "Atheists are bad people"  


Every law in your country is taken from a shitty 10,000 year old book.  


AND I WANNA LEAVE THIS COUNTRY!
