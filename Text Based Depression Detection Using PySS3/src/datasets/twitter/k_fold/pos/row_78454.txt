Does this happen to anyone else? I'm curious if this happens to anyone else. Im at school all day, really deppressed and lonely. The bell rings and I leave, feeling great. I walk home, hang out downtown for awhile and crash on my bed. Then the rest of the night I get really deppressed and lonely again. I only have a positive hour or so.
