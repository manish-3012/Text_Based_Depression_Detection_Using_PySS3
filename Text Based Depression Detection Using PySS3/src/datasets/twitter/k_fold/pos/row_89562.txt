I need some advice from u guys/girls So im 14 and my gf is 15 se is very shy i am tall and she is short and i like picking on her for that she is cuter when she is angry except on THE time of the month then she is just very angry at everything so getting back to my point i sometimes feel like she actually doesn't like me more than a best friend and i feel like i forced her to our relationship cause she rejected me once faking that she liked someone that didn't exist cause she was shy and paniced (thats what she told me at least) so because i almost never give up i gave it a second try and didn't fail we are together 11 months but i feel like im not the one for her cause i feel that I can't impress her with anything or just..let me make a comparison its like a goddes meets with a mortal.mortals go with mortals and goddesses with gods i feel like i am a bit stupider than everyone and can't actually be who i want to be cause i want to get accepted [btw quick note on the 11 months the 5 were wasted cause on the 2 she was trapped on the countryside and couldn't come back and on the 3 its summer she is on vacation all summer and i feel like im wasting her i feel like someone better than me would have made her happier i need someone to tell me should i break up with her so she can find someone better or should i try to find a way to make her happier btw i need suggestions if anyone has one plz tell me in the comments i need advice
