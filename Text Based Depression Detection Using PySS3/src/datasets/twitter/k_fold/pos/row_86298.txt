Is it really THAT easy to get a boyfriend? Iâ€™ve seen so many posts on this sub about how boys are so lonely and really want a girlfriend and how â€œthey just want a girl which treats them niceâ€, but I really try to do my best at understanding boys and finding common interests and stuff with them and I just... canâ€™t get in any relationship with a boy. I want you to be honest, do you really want what you say on this sub? Or you just say that to sound nice?
