Anyone else glad no one wants them as a s/o? Or that you don't have a crush on anyone yet? I dunno, I just don't think I'm ready for that yet. I'm way too awkward to be attractive for someone. I'm kind of intimidated at the idea of dating someone, cause i feel like I would just mess up and make things bad on accident. What would I even do if I was in a romantic relationship? Sure I'm nice, but that's about it. I'm not really good with flirting with people. I feel like I would be too boring for someone to actually like me that way.
