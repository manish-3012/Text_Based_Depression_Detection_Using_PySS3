I had a weird/somewhat happy dream. do any of you know what it could mean. so the only thing that made it weird was that not only I think it was ether I had a girlfriend or love, something like that. but the girl in my dream is actually someone I don't like, that goes to my school. and I think towards the end it might have been a different person but I don't know. 

it also felt so real, why more real then usual. like when she went and hugged me from behind, I could feel her arm around me. 

I sound crazy typing this out. but please comment so more people will see this. 

don't think I'm crazy ether. I also have no mental disorder/illness if that helps. have I just reached a new level of loneliness.
