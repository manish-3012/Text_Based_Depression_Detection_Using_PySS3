I don't know what to do anymore (TW // self harm/suicice) okay, I'm really trying not to sound like I'm doing this for attention, but I've been feeling a lot more depressed recently. I'm pretty sure it's because school has started and it's horrible and I cried so hard I almost threw up because of the work. But it's also because I'm falling out of a relationship with someone I really can't picture myself living without. He keeps leaving me on read after I opened up to him about some stuff and we had sex and I'm way too attached for him but whatever this isn't about him. With all of that on my mind, I've been so much closer to self-harming and I've been thinking about ways to kill myself.

I know you're probably reading this and thinking, 'jeez she needs therapy' but that's the thing, neither my mom nor dad has enough money to put me in therapy. I could do it myself, but I only have enough money for like one session, which I don't think would even help. And even if I was in therapy, I wouldn't be able to tell my therapist about my self-harm or suicidal thoughts because no one knows about it. And I've been doing that since I was 13. I haven't told any mental health experts about it. Not even my psychiatrist or normal doctor. And I'm too scared to tell them about it because I know they'll have to tell my parents and then my mom will become all emotional and protective over me and I really really really do not want that. I'm okay with being but into a mental hospital. I'd much rather that. But I just don't want my parents to find out

Thanks for reading, this was kind of therapeutic getting ~~all of it~~ most of it so that helped I guess.
