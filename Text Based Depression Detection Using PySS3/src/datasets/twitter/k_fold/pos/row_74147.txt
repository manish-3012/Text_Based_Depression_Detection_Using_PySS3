so im prolly going to louisiana saturday, lmao. the church my dad drags me to filled buckets with supplies yesterday so we could bring it to survivors from the hurricane on saturday. we would also be with another church. it would be a full day of working and, as every single person in existence knows, im on the fence about physical labor. i mean, yeah, it would be a good thing to go, but it would be a pain in my ass and my non-existent sleep schedule because we would be leaving at 6 o clock in the fucking mornin. 

yes yes yes, i know, i shouldnt c o m p l a i n but ya cant stop me. i complain about everything in a different way each time.
