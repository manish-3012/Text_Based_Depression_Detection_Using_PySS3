Fuck it So in September, my mom told me to go with her and look for a computer. I refused and stayed cos of laziness and Idk absolutely computers. So she went with my older b(r)other and went and bought it, and told me (my brother already knew it) to go later to bring it home. So whatâ€™s the problem? He monopolized it to play his shit of Tft and lol and when it was my turn he kepk on playing ( lol matches are long and he also played for like 8 hours) and then again and again, and when I complained my mom said â€˜shouldâ€™ve comed with us to buy itâ€™
and then said him to let me (it was after we ate dinner) and we had school next day, so I didnâ€™t have any time and was forced to play because I â€˜askedâ€™. ( first time using the shouldâ€™ve comed with us to buy it)
Fast forward to today, I went home first and relaxed for 2h (arrived at 2:20 because the teacher didnâ€™t come)because itâ€™s Friday. When I was going to shower he arrived, asked how many time I was going to stay and went directly to play the computer. I showered, told him I was going to use the computers I do my homework after ate lunch and he said ok. When I finished he was still there  making a stupid quiz and browsing images of genshin impact, so I waited (shouldâ€™ve directly told him) and about 6:20 I asked him I was going to do my homework ( time limit was at 23:59) so he told me he also had to do that, and we split to do it faster. He did it so wrong( didnâ€™t even read the assignment) and he wanted to use it also for me ( changing the document name) to continue using the computer so I told him I will do it myself so let me and he â€˜defendedâ€™ himself telling I had 2 hours to do it, so I called our mom, and she told him to let me (time 7:48) he said â€˜how much time do you NEEDâ€™ I said at least 30 min for an exercise I hadnâ€™t done yet at 30 min to the thing we â€˜cooperatedâ€™ to do. He said he would let me until 8:00. 
So more fast forward to 8, our mom arrived and he kept on telling me I was 30 min late and went to complain, she said let me 30 more min and told him if he could use his phone.
I finished by 8:31, clicked send and he kept saying shit like I did it in like 20 minutes or you have played games, no one needs 1h for a assignment(also he needed to finish some homework but is NOW PLAYING GAMES).

Well the important thing is when I was going to my bedroom, I told her he was only playing and she said, â€˜should came with usâ€™. I was like you only said â€˜go to look for a computerâ€™ she said (explaining why my brother could play more) in Chinese: â€˜your brother at least came with me, gave moneyâ€™ (in Chinese itâ€™s one syllable) and immediately rectified and said â€˜helpâ€™ . I said â€˜how much moneyâ€™? She said he came with her, gave help, will( idk). I said she said money, she then said â€˜5â‚¬â€™ . So I said if I put 10â‚¬ I could play x2 his time, she asked me give me the money,and when I was going to go get it she said, you both can play â€˜equallyâ€™ (Iâ€™m Spanish and Chinese, idk the translation). So I went and repeated what she said(he at least lend his help and â€˜will?â€™) basically to bother and she said, â€˜shouldâ€™ve came with us to buy itâ€™. And I replied â€˜you said weâ€™re going to look, not buyâ€™ and this continues by me replying you said â€˜we were etcâ€™, so she ended by saying who donâ€™t know that if youâ€™re going to search for a computer you buy it. It angered me that she was using her â€˜motherâ€™ authority to end it.

Notes: we went and bringer the computer together 
He downloaded Minecraft and attempted to download roblox for my little brother 

Tl;dr some shit happening disgusting a 14y, so disgusted this time that he goes to a karmawhore sub to rant.
