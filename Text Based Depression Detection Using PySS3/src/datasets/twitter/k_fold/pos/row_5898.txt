my friend is being sent to boarding school :,( i have 3 friends (i like to keep it like that) and one of them is being sent out of state to christian boarding school. she didnâ€™t do anything bad or wrong btw. now i have to send letters (no technology) and thatâ€™s gonna be annoying. i have no one to rant to besides reddit :( iâ€™m sad for her. she has to eat vegan food, canâ€™t listen to music, no books, gum, anything fun.. ðŸ˜’ 

i feel sorry for her she doesnâ€™t have a say in any of this, and sheâ€™s leaving tmr at 4 am 

sorry for any mistakes or grammatical errors i donâ€™t feel like going back and checking
