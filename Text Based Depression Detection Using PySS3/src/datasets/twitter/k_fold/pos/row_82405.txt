a message to anyone who feels lonely... I understand if you feel lonely. I understand if you feel like no one will ever be with you. But don't give up. Please. Keep trying. There's someone somewhere in the world waiting for you, even if neither of you know each other yet. 

I've been rejected a lot. I've considered just giving up on love. And I tried to give up. But I couldn't. I kept trying because I believed there was someone for me somewhere. And there was. I finally have a girlfriend now, and if I can find someone who loves me and who I love, then so can you. 

So if you think it's hopeless and no one will ever love you, stop thinking that. Because there's someone for you somewhere. Trust me.
