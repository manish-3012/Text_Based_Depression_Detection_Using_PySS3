Reddit should sell Reddit Karma Do any of you guys think that Reddit should sell Karma for real life money, or for Reddit coins. 
I think pricing should be like this 
10,000 karma $10
28,000 karma $25
75,000 karma $60
135,000 karma $100
Because for a lot of us who want Reddit karma but cannot get a popular post because of reposters like /u/gallowboob selling it is a win win because Reddit gets money and we the users can get karma without having to play the Battle Royale (no pun intended) that is posting on popular subs
