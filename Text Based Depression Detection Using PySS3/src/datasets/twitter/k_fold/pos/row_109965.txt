I'm gonna turn 20 in 3.5hrs Finally, 2 decades old. No more a teenager and a huge part of my life coming up in the next decade. I just wanted to let you guys know that out of all the subreddits i follow, i find you guys having perfect balance of wholesome and dank. I kinda regret not joining reddit earlier in my high school days (I'm in my bachelor's now) since the post's would have been more relatable and shareable but none the less, i do enjoy reading about the minds of people younger than me and recall similar moments of my pre-teen to teen life moments. First crush/gf, fights with teachers, meeting cool teachers and kids and all the other Happy Accidents. 

I just feel as if the phase 2 of my life had finally come to an end and phase 3 is just going to be more challenging as well as exciting with me searching for a job/business and earning my own money, making a life and meeting more and more people. Wish me luck!

Just wanna thank you all for a great experience on reddit and letting me know that i am not alone who thinks like that. This is my first post on this subreddit (if i dont make a mistake which will cause it to delete like other posts). Only decision i need to make will probably be that should i stay on this Sub with Old flair or just leave it for good and time to adult myself(probably will go with the former). 

Again thanks for allowing me to be a part of a huge, unbiased group and letting me enjoying all the fun moments! AdiÃ³s
