Am I too insensitive? A girl asked me out yesterday at a store where I went with a friend to buy some snacks. She told me that she wanted to ask me something for a long time and all that clichÃ© things and I couldn't interpret everything at such fast pace and out of spontaneous reaction said "uhh, no I guess". She cried and went her way saying nothing. From that time, this thing is in my mind and I wanted to bring it out. I wrote this in my diary, didn't help tho. Can I do something to make things right? Asked my friends they told to just talk to her. But I couldn't, I am too nervous and afraid tbh now.
Can anyone help me?
