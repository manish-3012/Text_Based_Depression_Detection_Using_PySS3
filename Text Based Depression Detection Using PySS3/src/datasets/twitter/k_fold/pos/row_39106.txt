Today is my 16th birthday And I've successfully fought the urge to kill myself 5 times

Almost run away from home 3 times

Broke up with my more than 1 year gf

Been dead inside and mentally unstable, but slowly getting better rn

On the process of dealing with personal issues

And going to eat a bar of matcha chocolate.

Wish me luck for the rest of the years, fellas
