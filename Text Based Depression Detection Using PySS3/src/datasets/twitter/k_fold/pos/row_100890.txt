Self-esteem I'm seriously considering getting a job for the sole reason that someone told me my money management is a bit poor.

That's how low my self-esteem is, like even if I got a couple dozen bucks from gifts and stuff, my brother gets mad every time I buy an ice cream or similar.

And I don't even buy them regularly, i'll maybe buy a soda or a chocolate bar when I feel like it, which may be once a week, can be less than that.

And the only time I get actual candy is when me and my friends have a LAN, which is 2-3 times a year.
