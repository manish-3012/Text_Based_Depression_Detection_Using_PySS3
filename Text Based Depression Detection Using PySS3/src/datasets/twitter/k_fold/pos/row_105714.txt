i know iâ€™m probably going to get hate for this, but... if youâ€™re a kid and are in a situation of domestic/family violence and youâ€™re not stood up for by your parents/adults around you, blame should partially be taken on them. iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s their fault, as they might be scared too, but still. youâ€™re free to agree or disagree. 

iâ€™m saying this because even though i was 15 at the time, i was emotionally abused by my stepfather and it was horrible. most of the time it happened behind my mums back, as he was a little bitch. 

anyways, when my mum would hear about it she would never really put her foot down. i felt as though that he was always â€œgetting away with itâ€ which made me feel even worse about the situation. sometimes i felt like she didnâ€™t care or that it wasnâ€™t as bad as i thought it was, making things much worse. 

but eventually she started to listen to me more and went to the police about it and it made me feel so much better. i knew my mum was scared to face him, as domestic violence can be a terrifying thing, but at the end of the day I was the child and she was the adult. 

at first i didnâ€™t think it was mums fault at all since she was scared of him too, which although it gave more reason for her to back down more, it didnâ€™t excuse her from downplaying what was going on.

anyway... i guess what iâ€™m trying to say is that although itâ€™s okay for parents and adults to be scared, they should be the ones protecting you. itâ€™s not your fault
