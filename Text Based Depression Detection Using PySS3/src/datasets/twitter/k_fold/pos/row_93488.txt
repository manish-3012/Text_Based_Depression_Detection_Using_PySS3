Itâ€™s stupid that we have type â€œfiller filler fillerâ€ just to be able to make a post. You need to write a larger amount to make a post here now. Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s to avoid shit posting, which is fair.

But now that everyone has to be writing â€œfiller filler fillerâ€ just to make a post, that literally turns all of our posts into shit posts. Thanks a lot, mods.
