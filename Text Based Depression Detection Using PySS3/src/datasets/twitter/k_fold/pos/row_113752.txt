Itâ€™s not just a meme... You see all those videos about kids forgetting to mute their mics but it actually happened. We had a meeting for ALL seniors. 250 kids in the google meet. (The meeting is about college apps) At the start of the meeting, this girl goes â€œughhh why do I have to do this I know this already. F*ck this, and oh look it seems [guidance counselorâ€™s name] has sum to sayâ€ or something like that. Then the guidance counselor says â€œhey guys can we please mute our mics... thanksâ€. And the entire chat for the meeting goes crazy with â€œlolâ€s and â€œripâ€s
