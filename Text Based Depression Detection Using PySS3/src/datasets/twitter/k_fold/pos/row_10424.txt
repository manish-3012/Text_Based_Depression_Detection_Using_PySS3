So I have a question So hereâ€™s my scenario:

You tell someone how you romantically feel about them, right? You do this through a wholesome meme. But, this person already knew how you felt, because youâ€™ve said so before and gave them time to think on it. And so you were just wanting to reinforce how you felt and let them know you were still there. 

But, instead of this person saying something like â€œNo, I donâ€™t feel the same way, Iâ€™m sorry,â€ they ghost you. They literally ghost you, and you know they are because theyâ€™re still active on their account.

AND THEN! They start saying stuff like â€œIâ€™m lonelyâ€.

So hereâ€™s my question: how tf do you react? Do you confront them? Do you ignore it? Like wth do you do? Iâ€™m asking to see if Iâ€™m being overly sensitive about it.
