I'm going to disappear until this disastrous semester comes to an end, bye bye and good luck Maybe I'll be back in a week. I really need to focus on school and this particular exam season, it's all I have. My school has a rule where if you fail a single class more than once, they kick you out. 

One particular class (it's physics-related, fluid dynamics) is difficult for me and I failed it last year and I'm very worried about failing it again (it still confuses the heck out of me and I'm scared of failing it again) so I'm going offline after tn until finals end.

My whole life has been school. If I were to fail this class again, there would be nothing else I could do and I would be too ashamed to keep living. I don't want this to become a s*icidal vent so I'll just end here. Anyways, good luck with your own exams, study well and take care of yourselves :) drink lots of hot lemon tea, not red bull :P
