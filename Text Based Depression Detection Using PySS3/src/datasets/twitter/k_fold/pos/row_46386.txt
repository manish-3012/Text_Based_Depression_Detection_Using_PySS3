Iâ€™m having some weird relationship problems and I really donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. Can anyone help? Okay let me clarify first. Yes, this is all real, Iâ€™m probably going to delete this soon anyway so I donâ€™t need it for karma. Also please donâ€™t try to dm me. Iâ€™ve had some bad experiences with people messaging me on Reddit, and I wonâ€™t respond if I do get a message. Leave anything in the comments and Iâ€™ll try to respond.

So I guess onto whatâ€™s happening... so Iâ€™m 14 and my partner is 13, turning 14 in less than a month. We have been dating for over a year and it has been really good for most of it, but right now things are a little weird. Recently my partner told me they didnâ€™t like me anymore but is staying with me until they find someone new. Now things are basically as they were before because Iâ€™m not making a big deal about it except we just talk a lot less. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do and I really donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about it.

I guess I should also explain that why I donâ€™t want to tell this to my partner in the first place. Thatâ€™s about they are kind of known for lying. Now to be fair it hasnâ€™t happened in a long time, it was more during the beginning of the year when there were some really bad things going on, but if I explain it Iâ€™m sure they are going to get upset, even in secret. 

I do not hate them or anything, I do love them, but I also am not going to fight them to stay. I really just want to know what to do as I really donâ€™t have anyone to ask. My person to talk to would be my partner, and itâ€™s clear why I canâ€™t do that.
