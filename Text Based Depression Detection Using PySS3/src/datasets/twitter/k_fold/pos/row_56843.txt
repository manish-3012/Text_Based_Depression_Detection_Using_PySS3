Goodbye good times. Ok so Mr. Boris has just told us about Lockdown N.3 isnâ€™t that lovely! I was already not going to see the lads and woman friends for two weeks, but now it could be two months. So like this is extra sad because as of recently I am boy and girl. So my friend was going to give me some nail polish and stuff, as well as doom 3 on cd. 

So as you can understand I am having a bad time rn, mental breakdown material. I am going to cry. I donâ€™t want to break my no sh streak but it is probably going to happen. 

Thanks for reading guys xxx
