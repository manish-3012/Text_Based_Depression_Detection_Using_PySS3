Feed me-Pumkin Eyes

When it's you
I can't help myself
No matter how I try
I can't help myself
Baby, I've been waiting
Waiting till you come around
I've been watching, I've been floating
Floating beneath the ground
Baby, I've been thinking back to the night you took me home
When you looked at me with your pumpkin eyes
And stopped me from saying no
When it's you
I can't help myself
No matter how I try
I can't help myself
When it's you
I just can't help myself
No matter how we try
I can't help myself
Baby, I've been waiting
Waiting like a nervous child
I'm surrounded, feeling caged in
Remember when we used to be wild
Baby, I've been thinking back to the streets we used to roam
When you looked at me with your pumpkin eyes
And told me you would never let go
When it's you
I can't help myself
No matter how we try
I can't help myself
When it's you
I just can't help myself
No matter how we try
I can't help myself
Baby, I've been waiting
I'm surrounded, feeling caged in
Baby, I've been thinking back to the streets we used to roam
You tell me you would never let go
When it's you
I can't help myself
No matter how we try
I can't help myself
