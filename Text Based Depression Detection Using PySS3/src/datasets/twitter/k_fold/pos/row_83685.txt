Iâ€™m writing a story, and I need some help coming up with a power. So, in this world there are different â€œtiersâ€ of special powers. Tier 1 is your base elements: water, air, fire, and earth. Tier 2 is a more refined version of Tier 1 powers. So tier 2 earth is metal, tier 2 water is ice, tier 2 air is electricity. But I donâ€™t have a tier 2 for fire. Does anyone have any ideas?
