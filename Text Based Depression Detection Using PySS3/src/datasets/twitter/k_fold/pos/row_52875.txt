My teacher just said something wrong I live in a country that the native language isn't english

So in my english class we had to say our favorite type of movie and why we liked them

I answered "horror movies..." and then I decided to answer with a joke "because I'm a man, and they don't scare me"

She started talking about how the correct way to say was "I'm not a scary man" because the adjective comes first in english

I tried explaining to her that the word "man" was the adjective, but she said something obout that I wasn't right and the adjective comes first

This is why I fucking hate english.
