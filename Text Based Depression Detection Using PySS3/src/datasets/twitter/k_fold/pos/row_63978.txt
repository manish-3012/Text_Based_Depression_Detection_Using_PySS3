I feel unworthy as a female, I compare myself to others. well I mean who donâ€™t. but anyways. I do that quite frequently. I often question my worth. 

I never got much attention from guys in the past. none really bothered with me in the past. past me was not that pretty. but I can say I look a little better now 
I often got rejected in the past, and so I changed myself 

I dyed my hair blonde, lost weight, and took better care of myself. and I thought that guys would finally like me
I changed myself completely to what a guy would want in girl. 
perhaps this isnâ€™t the case. no guy pays attention to me. or looks my way. and it just hurts. that I get up everyday and completely change myself to please others. and itâ€™s still not enough 
I hate being rejected so I never express my feelings to guys, because in my past thatâ€™s all that has ever happened. iâ€™m afraid of being rejected again 

itâ€™s just tiring knowing Iâ€™ll never be good enough
clearly.

if no guy looks my way when I wear makeup and my hair dyed and my body skinny, then theyâ€™ll not look my way when Iâ€™m myself.

It just hurts that nobody wants me at my best. 

when so many girls in my school get guys effortlessly. They are adored by guys. They donâ€™t even need to change anything because guys always crushed on them. 

I just feel worthless. and so gross and not good enough. 

I just wanna know why other girls get the attention I seek. But I donâ€™t.
