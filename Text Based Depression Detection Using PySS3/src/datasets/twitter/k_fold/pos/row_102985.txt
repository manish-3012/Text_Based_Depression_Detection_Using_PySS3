Is it wrong to be thinking about marriage when I'm 14? Context: my girlfriend is currently my favourite person in my life. We havent been together long but it feels like forever. Recently I've come to realise that this is the first time I've loved a human being outside of my family and have started thinking about the future and our possible marriage with her. Is this wrong?
