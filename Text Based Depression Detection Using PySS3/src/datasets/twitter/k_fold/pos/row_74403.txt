Picture the scene... Imagine...

You go to sleep on December 31st, 2020. You are relieved that this year is finally over and quickly fall asleep. 

When you wake up, you check your phone and the date reads â€œJuly 15th, 2014â€. You realize that the entirety of 2020 was a bad dream and quickly see texts from your best friends, telling you to log onto Minecraft because the base is almost done and they need you to help finish it. 

Life is good.
