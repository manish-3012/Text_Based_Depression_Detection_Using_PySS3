Oh god I'm attracted to a new girl to my school I mean luckily I know her cause she was my debate partner at camp back in 6th grade, but still like I don't have her number or anything so like

However of the things I know about her she likes Fall Out Boy (like me) and she complimented my Mouse Rat t shirt (fictional band fr Parks and Rec) the other day

It could be going worse
