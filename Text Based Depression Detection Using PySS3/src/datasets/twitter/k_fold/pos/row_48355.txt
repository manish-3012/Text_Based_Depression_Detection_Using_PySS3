What do I do? So during the start of corona times, I started running with my girlfriend, as we got a lot of our exercise from school, and we didnâ€™t want to be unhealthy at all, but now as we get running more and more itâ€™s clear that I am much faster than her, and she has gotten very upset with this fact, since we have both literally done the same amount of work, so what do I do to make her feel better about running?
