This week has been absolutely amazing So as the title says, this week has been going very well. 

-I've started eating healthier and in general, eating less. This has lead me to have lost 3kg in a week. I'm 171cm tall and are 70 kilos, which is normal but I wanna be thin.

- I've started doing more exercises, and got a new haircut

- I became one of 9000 people since 1952 to claim the golden golden badge for exploring the required 100 places with stamps on them (I went around and have probably went to around 500 different places since 2010 when I started doing this). The badge is kinda shit to be honest but it's ok.

- Me and my father are entering the final stages of developing a machine that could be put in restaurants to wreck glass bottles into peaces. This is great for transportation costs and recycling, as we are cutting the volume of the bottles more than 10 times.

- I conquered the tallest peak in the Balkans, Musala. It's 2925m tall and the journey was 20km.

- I started getting back into coin collecting (I collect old coins. The coolest one I have is a 100 lev Bulgarian coin from 1937, it's pure silver too). 

- As I am in a business school, I thought that since I have been interested in the markets recently, I would start trading stuff (mostly gold, real estate, land, German automobile manufacturers). I have found a few good simulators and it will be interesting to see if I make it or break it

- I finished my f1 2019 career mode as I got into the fourth season and it was really fun.

- I struck a deal so that I got GTA 5 for my playstation for like 17$

â€” That's it really, thank you for reading all the way down and I hope you have a great day
