Attention All Anime Lovers! I have come to bring your attention to a very underrated show, that is one of my favorites after watching countless anime over several years. That show is called Non Non Biyori.

Non Non Biyori is a slice of life anime, and it's probably the most wholesome and adorable thing to every grace the planet Earth. It has 2 seasons, a movie, and a new season is currently airing.

This anime can be found on Crunchyroll. Both of the first 2 seasons, and the new season can be found there, however the movie is blu-ray only I believe.

Thank you for you time. Please watch this beautiful show, as it is sure to warm the dead and cold chunk of rock that we humans call hearts.
