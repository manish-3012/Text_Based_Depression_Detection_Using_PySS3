HELP NEEDED Hi, everyone, please bear with me on this post.

alright, so, i got a new Gaming PC recently. i haven't downloaded all the games so naturally i've been leaving it on during the day and at nights to complete my downloads. unfortunately, Mother has noticed my leaving it on and has subsequently turned it off to "save energy".

This is the most annoying bs of the entire pc building process. since our wifi is so rubbish this is really the only way- i've asked her to stop, but she won't budge, and always does it in the morning before school and sometimes at night. she always knows when i've left it on because even though i bought a be quiet case with like the most subtle fans you have ever heard, she notices, and will turn on my monitor to make sure, and now she has noticed the white light on my pc case's power button. so here is my plea; does anyone have any idea on how to trick her into not turning off my pc? some way where i can turn it to standby (actual standby in windows doesn't work) so the downloads can still run?? i hope this is the right place to ask. thank you.

TL:DR; parents, keep turning off pc before night, can't finish video game downloads; help appreciated.
