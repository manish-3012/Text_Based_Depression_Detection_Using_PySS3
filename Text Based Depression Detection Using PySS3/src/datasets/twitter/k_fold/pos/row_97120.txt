Got into a fight with some jerk at school and won  Today was IRL school again so I Was sad. I was going to math class in the halls and then this other kid walked into me and said "ew you smell". It had been only a week since I showered so I got really mad at him. I told him he was a loser and that he should shut up and he said "Ok smelly boi" so I slammed by books on the floor and screamed in his face. He scurreid away quickly so I yelled back "I WON!" What a loser lol that idiot sucks. I held my head high that day feeling like I could conquer anything
