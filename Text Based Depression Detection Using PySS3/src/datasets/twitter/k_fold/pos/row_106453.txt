Does anyone else get super nervous and paranoid about the mic and camera on zoom? Like earlier today I had to use the bathroom and I decided to bring my phone with me, and I LITERALLY COULD NOT CONTINUE BECAUSE I WAS PARANOID MY CLASS WAS GOING TO SEE OR HEAR MY PLOPS!! MY CAMERA WASNâ€™T EVEN FACING ME AND I WAS STILL SO PARANOID !!
