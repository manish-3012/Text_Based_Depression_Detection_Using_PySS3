I just asked my childhood crush out and she said yes! I know there are so many posts like this here and I technically asked her out yesterday but just stick with me here. Iâ€™ve been best friends with my girlfriend since I was 10 and have always had a crush on her because she is beautiful and has such an amazing personality. After getting out of a horrible relationship in April she was the first person to come to me and try to help. That was when I realized that I really love her. I built up the courage and yesterday I confessed my feelings for her and she said she has shared the same feelings for a while. Iâ€™ve never been so happy. Itâ€™s day 2 of our relationship and weâ€™ve already played against each other on Super Smash Bros and we are also planning a Minecraft date. She is everything to me and I canâ€™t wait to see what happens in the future!
