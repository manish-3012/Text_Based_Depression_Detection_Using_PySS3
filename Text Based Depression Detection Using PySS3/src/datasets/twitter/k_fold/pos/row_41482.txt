Feeling down? So was I, until I started listening to this... Since the beginning of quarantine Iâ€™d been feeling down in the dumps. I hadnâ€™t been able to talk to my friends and family in person because of it,my school marks dropped and Iâ€™d just lay in my bed all the time. 

But one day Iâ€™d been watching random videos on YouTube and found a really good, upbeat and encouraging song. Here https://youtu.be/soWpm_R4Nsc is the link. Hope it helps you as much as it helped me!
