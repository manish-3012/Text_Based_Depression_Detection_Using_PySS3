"Do you think im selfish and make things about my self?" Backstory: I was asked that question last night from a "Close Friend". They were already drunk and I was in a bad mood because of them. 

What my answer should've been: Yes, I do think you're selfish at times. The world revolves around you.

What my answer was: I don't think you're selfish, I can't even think about an example of that.

I woke up and its really bothering me now, I want to tell her the truth but I don't want to ruin things between us. Also last night they were just being a douche to me in general. Acting way different than she normally does.
