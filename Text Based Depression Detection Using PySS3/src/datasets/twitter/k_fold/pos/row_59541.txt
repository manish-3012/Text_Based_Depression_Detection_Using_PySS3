How do you console someone whoâ€™s dealing with a death? So I have an online friend, I mean I knew them in real life but they moved very far away and now we just talk via texting. Anyway their brother has recently passed and I was wondering I guess is there anything I can do? Iâ€™m not very good at this kind of thing so Iâ€™m not sure what to say.
