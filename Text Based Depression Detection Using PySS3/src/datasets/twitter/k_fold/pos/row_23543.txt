Imma hate on English homophones for a second First, the there/their/they're thing is just annoying asf. Like I'll be typing or writing and accidentally put "there" for "their", then I have to catch myself and go and fix it. I can usually get "they're", but man those other 2 are annoying

Second, the then/than thing. I ALWAYS accidentally write then for than and then have to go and fix the then to it's better than it was. But in all seriousness it's just annoying.

Third, You're Welcome vs Your Welcome. The first is the correct but seriously if I were to write it I would probably end up with the second. I've almost never seen the phrase ever written and so the only reason I would ever know which is the correct to write is by looking it up.

Fourth, those annoying adjectives with the "u"s in weird places. I hate you sometimes.

In the end, English, I love you, you are close to my heart, and you are how I live my life, but my god can you be a little twat.
