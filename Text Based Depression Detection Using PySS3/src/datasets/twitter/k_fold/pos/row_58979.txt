I'm laughing so hard rn dudes So on twitter people draw characters that are white with black skin a lot, which I honestly don't give a shit about. But my dudes, just opened the twitter and first thing I see is black goofy... Like... They took goofy-- cartoon dog-- and made his fur brown, said it was black goofy. I'm like high off of laughter this is the best thing I've ever seen.
