My new Ouija board is keeping me from wanting to sleep tonight I shouldâ€™ve known this would be a bad idea, but I got a Ouija board and used it with my little sister at my Nanas house, nothing happened of course. But my sister didnâ€™t believe and I did.

After we forgot to say goodbye, and she left the room. And when she left the door opened wide on its own. I left the room and my sis was talking to my Nana all the way in the living room and nobody believed me when I said the door opened. But it did :(

We then said goodbye cuz I told my sis we forgot, but it wasnâ€™t very serious at all. Now Iâ€™m scared to sleep tonight or be alone. I get really freaked out by these things.
