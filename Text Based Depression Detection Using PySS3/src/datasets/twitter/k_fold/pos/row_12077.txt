My mom used my savings money to buy alcohol and hangout with her friends I'm heartbroken ,my 6 year old brother really to play animal crossing and I've planing to buy Nintendo switch lite for him 
But last night all my savings is gone and my mom came back home at 1 am drunk.


I wish she'd abort me, I really don't want a mother like her I'm in tears right now I'm so sorry my little bro I'll try harder to hide our savings money
