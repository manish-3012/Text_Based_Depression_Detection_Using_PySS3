I've been feeling bad lately I know no one cares, but I just want to vent somewhere so here I go. 

Recently, I started getting a very strange negative feeling. It's kinda like I'm sad and disappointed in myself. Only now I realized what my life has come to. It's just a boring cycle of repetitive events that continues all over again. I just sit around playing games, watching YouTube, browsing Reddit and masturbating. That's literally it. I have nothing else to do. Masturbation in particular is a big problem for me. Multiple times a day, sometimes up to 7 times, I just bust a nut to anything. Every time after it, I feel like: "What am I doing with my life?" but I still continue doing it. The feeling disappeared shortly, but now it is prolonged. Over the last few days I've been stuck with the same post-nut clarity. Only now I realized how addicted I am. I kept telling myself: "It's no problem, I will quit if I want, plus it's quarantine, so why not?", but quitting itself is just impossible. I don't know what to do, I literally don't feel happy anymore. Anything that used to cheer me up earlier now just doesn't do anything. I don't know what to do. I know that quitting is the easy answer, but I can't quit for some reason. Does anyone have any advice? I would really appreciate it as I would want to get my life back together. Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: I have an addiction to masturbation and can't quit. I don't feel happy anymore. Advice would be really appreciated.
