Should I text back my cousin who ignored my text for a year Now I'm not exaggerating about the year thing, but we did talk a bit after that, and I think, the last one I sent her was like maybe around 6 months ish, and she saw it but didn't say anything. 

I already ignored one of her message on WhatsApp like 2 months back and this is one is on snapchat. 

I feel shity for ignoring her, but she did ignore me for 1 year and never apologized or mentioned it.

She texted me 16hrs ago btw. Sorry if this is just a big mess, I'm just trying to write my thoughts and what I think is important.
