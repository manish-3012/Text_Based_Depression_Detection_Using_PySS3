Freedom of Religion for Minors I personally think that freedom of religion should be extended to teenagers. We should have the right to follow any religion or not follow any religion as we choose, instead of our parents deciding for us. Of course our parents may influence our religions, but we can choose our own religions. What are your takes on this issue?
