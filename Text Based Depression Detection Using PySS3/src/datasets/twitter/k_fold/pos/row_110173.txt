Dear friend of a year now Although much has happened and I feel like I've been a real dick lately I do still care. you won't see this but I do. I havent been telling you much and I haven't been able to be their for you especially in this hard time but I promise it will be ok. Stay safe my friend and I promise I don't mean to be cold and distant.
