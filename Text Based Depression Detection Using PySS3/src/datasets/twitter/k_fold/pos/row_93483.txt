Teenage guys, is this normal behavior? So there is this guy I know, and like he is weird (not like bad weird but quirky weird) and idk, there's like this weird atmosphere between us, it's in between friendship sarcastic joking tension, and sexual tension. And I feel as though I should just dismiss it (because there's no way a dude would ever actually like me) but like, I can't for some reason. 

examples of behavior: (for setting, I know him from martial arts) so once he bowed to me, not like a martial arts bow either but like a formal bow. (also when you enter and leave where we train you're suppose to bow, I was leaving he wasnt, and it was odd  placing for something like that)

also, I make a lot of semi violent jokes ("you better watch it or I'm gonna hit you" stuff like that but I'm not actually violent) and turns out he is Low-key a masochist. 

Am I crushing and looking too much into things, and getting hopeful what do you think.?
