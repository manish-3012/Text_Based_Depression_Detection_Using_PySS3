It was last spring when i was most compassionate as a person. (TL:DR for those who don't like to read long texts) Even though i was struggilng a lot with my depression, i didn't hesitate to focus on trying to help others on Reddit rather than trying to help myself. But now i feel as im merely a gosth of that former self, having recovered from depression a long time ago.

Just a moment ago i saw a post on r/politicalcompassmemes talking about the positives of each quadrant, and on the liberal-left one it's said that it's people are the kindest and would devote their lives on trying to save someone's life (well not that dramatic but you get the point)

And here i am, thinking that am i a really good person anymore or only was i but no longer am? Im, if anything, not capable of helping others that well, feels like all my knowledge of helping others with depression went away with my own. And honestly, if im being honest, i just can't and won't devote most of my time on trying to save others. That's why i feel like i don't deserve the love and affection i deserved back then when i was rolling out there and r/depression, r/selfharm and others..
