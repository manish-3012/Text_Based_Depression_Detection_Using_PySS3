17 male, barely and friends, never had a gf, pretty shitty huh. Anybody can relate? ***I know this is a lot to read, and reading is shit. But I'd really love to see other people helping me/giving advice/maybe even relating.***

*I turned 17 this June, when I was a child I never had many friends, and the ones I had either abandoned or turned against me. This led me to pretty much stay most of the time at home, doing a lot of studying for school, videogames and being lonely as fuck. Years later when I was 15, I pretty much had some kind of anxiety and couldn't speak to other strangers/people because of low self-esteem and never being in a situation where I met new people (except in my childhood of course!). I needed to change and basically contacted other old friends (around the beginning of 2019) I hadn't met in years, which I barely knew but I still tried. It went well, some were good and I got along pretty well and met new people. Though there was one guy, one let's say* ***"friend".*** *I got very along with him because of common interests (videogames, stupid joked etc.), he kept telling me that I'm a nobody, I'm a lazy, fat piece of garbage that will die alone because of my small social status. I believed him and destroyed my confidence even more. I ended up being pretty much not myself anymore. I wanted to change, and I did. I started working out, trying to improve myself in anyway I could, realizing that nothing in life comes through a miracle and that I have to take my destiny into my own hands.*

Though the sacrifice I had to pay in order to change for the better, was that I cut most of my negative contacts and only stayed with a few people close. Which sadly didn't last long. I barely hang out with people, I wish I could, I wish I could be outside, do some stupid stuff. Or just having a great time. I really feel as if I'm wasting my teenagehood, I'm still progressing and trying to become a better version all the time. But what's the point of being a good person when I can't share it? It's really hard at the moment to find new people, espacially during a pandemic, and at a school where pretty much everyone knows you, but don't want to deal with you.

Long story short: Anybody else feels lonely all the time, feels like they're wasting their time? Feeling scared that they will stay this way all the time? It's really tough, and I belive that most teens (whether it's true or not) feel this way aswell.
