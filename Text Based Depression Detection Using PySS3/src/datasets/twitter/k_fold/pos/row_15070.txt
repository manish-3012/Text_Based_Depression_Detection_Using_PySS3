What the hell It's a damn miracle I didn't crash

Luckily it only started on road close to home. I don't feel right. I can't really explain it, it's lightheadedness. I also having this weird thing where I'm seeing something even thought that's not what I'm doing. My brain also like, nothing happened for a few second intervals
