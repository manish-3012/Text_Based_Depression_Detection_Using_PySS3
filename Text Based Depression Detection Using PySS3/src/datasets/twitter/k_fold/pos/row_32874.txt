If this is accurate (it probably isnâ€™t) then either were fucked or nothing will change [I kinda doubt it is](https://nypost.com/2020/08/23/kim-jong-un-in-a-coma-as-his-sister-takes-control-report/amp/)

A power vacuum in North Korea could be a disaster especially if you live in North Korea, South Korea, Japan, the us, any nato member state or any nato ally, a non nato ally to the us, or China and possibly Russia, if Japan, the us or South Korea intervene that would force the us to intervene which would force nato to intervene and then China would intervene cuz they donâ€™t want American troops directly across the border (North Korea is a buffer state between South Korea and China) 

Letâ€™s hope people arenâ€™t fighting for power in Pyongyang cuz as far as we know thereâ€™s no planned successor so if he dies there will be a power vacuum that someone has to fill so probably 1 of 3 things will probably happen either A: thereâ€™s a seamless transition to someone else B: multiple people in power would try to become supreme leader and violence breaks out in Pyongyang between the people in power or C: North Korea is technically a republic maybe they would lol there not going to do that
