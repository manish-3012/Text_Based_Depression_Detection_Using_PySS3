Story time! So when we were at a hike on a hill my classmates said that there's a lake just around the hill, and I said "sure let's go swimming" 

They all looked at me like at some kind of psychopath and and told me that the lake is dangerous and that there's a lot of gravestones a people who drowned there. And I said "even better I can join them" 

Another dirty looks like I'm a psychopath. So anyway how am I supposed to tell them I'm suicidal?
