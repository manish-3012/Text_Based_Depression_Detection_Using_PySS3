Does anyone else NOT want to go to college? I am 17 years old and in about a year I will have to go to college. Truthfully I don't want to go to college. I have the grades to go to a good college, but the thought of trudging through more years of school does not excite me in the slightest. I feel genuinely apathetic about almost all areas of my life, with the exception of things like listening to music and watching movies. I find myself spending the weekends lying in bed binge watching tv shows and listening to depressing music. I gain this odd rush from partaking in those activities, and it is the only thing that makes me feel good for a time. I can't seem to pull myself out of this, and it has been like this since 8th grade. The thing is I am not entirely depressed. I can still force myself to do things, and I am still able to maintain good grades but my social life has been terrible since middle school. To make up for my lack of energy I have neglected it I guess, and the worst part is that I don't even crave social interaction anymore. I just want to be alone all of the time. It feels as though I just don't have the energy to talk to people. I have not had friends in 5years, and I am tired constantly. The thing is teachers don't care, but I am sort of happy that they don't. If you make good grades no one cares. Your parents don't care, your teachers don't care; no one cares. Because things cannot be going that bad if you have good grades, right? 

I just genuinely feel so weak, and I don't understand how I am supposed to handle college along with adulthood. I am already so exhausted. But, if I don't go to college I will be destined for a life of poorness.
