I feel bad for Gen A (To clarify, gen A are the people born in the 2010's)

Children from gen A are constantly hooked to their phones and it's really sad to see, the parents are the main issue for buying them technology and not giving restrictions

My little cousin who's like 6 or 7 spent 8-9 hours on her phone once, what the hell? Honestly these kids deserve way better parents than they have
