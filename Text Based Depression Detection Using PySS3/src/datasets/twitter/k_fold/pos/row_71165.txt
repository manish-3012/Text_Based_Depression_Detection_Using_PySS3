Happy birthday ! Exactly one year ago someone posted a post saying that it was their birthday and no one wished them a happy birthday so I thought I would wish them a happy birthday this year, because I only saw the post after 2 days it was posted or something like that...
So if you see this, random redditor, happy birthday !

I hope you all are well, redditors.
