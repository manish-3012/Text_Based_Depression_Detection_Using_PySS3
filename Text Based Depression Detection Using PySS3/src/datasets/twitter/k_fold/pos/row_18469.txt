My mum doesnâ€™t believe Iâ€™m sick Iâ€™m pretty sure I have mild hypothyroidism. I checked off symptoms online and I was crying because I finally knew what was causing me a lot of pain. (i know self diagnosis can be dodgy but all the signs are an exact description of me)

I have depression (which my parents donâ€™t get), constipation, joint pain, mild weight gain, bloating, an enlarged thyroid gland, and irregular periods. My feets and hands are also cold.

Despite this my mum thinks Iâ€™m faking it. I told her that 2 out of 100 teens have hypothyroidism and she said â€œI raised you with too much care for you to have hypothyroidism.â€ She doesnt want to go to the doctors, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve been at a hospital for checkups since I was five or so. Oh yeah, my mum has hypothyroidism too, which increases my chances. But she still wont let me get tested so I bought a test kit online. 

What the fawk do I do smh
