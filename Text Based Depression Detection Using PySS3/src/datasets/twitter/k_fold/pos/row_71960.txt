I really need advice right now... A very good friend of mine tried to commit suicide yesterday.  
She also says scary things sometimes hinting she'll try again.

I don't know why she tried to do it, but I do know she stopped.  


She's fine now but she's still talking like she'll do it again.

How can I help her? What can I do? I'm really scared
