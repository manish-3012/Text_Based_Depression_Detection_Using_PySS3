Being single sucks I like to pretend that I don't care, but my recent breakup has really got me down. I was annoyed by my (then) girlfriend because in general she was being, well, annoying. I was venting about this to a couple friends and one of them (who was trying to convince me to dump her) told her and she decided she should break up with me instead.

At first, I didn't really care. In fact, it felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. But tonight, I've been feeling really lonely.

This is a classic example of not knowing how much you want something until you have it. Not knowing what you're missing out on until it's taken away from you. What if you got $1,000,000 but the next day it was gone? That's much more devastating than never having it in the first place.

I don't really miss her. I miss having a girlfriend. I feel more confident now though, so I guess that's a good thing. Now I can confirm that some people find me attractive. Maybe that's selfish, but I don't know. All I know is I just want a partner, I feel very alone.
