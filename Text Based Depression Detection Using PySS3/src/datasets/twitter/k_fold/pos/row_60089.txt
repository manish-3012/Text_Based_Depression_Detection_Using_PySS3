Why can't you just say no? Why do you say yes when I ask you to homecoming if you're gonna say a grand total of ten words to me the entire night and then basically ditch me half way through? At the very least you could have said no when I asked you and I wouldn't go home feeling like the human equivalent of tv golf. Fuck.
