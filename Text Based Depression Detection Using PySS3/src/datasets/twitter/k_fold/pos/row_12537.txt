I Asked out my crush! So we were in class on Friday and i was talking witg my friends. I told them a whole ago that I liked the girl so that were riffing on me about it as friends do. Bell rings and we head out for Lunch, het to the cafeteria and my friends are making jokes about me liking her because she didn't sit very far from us. One of her friends overheard and comes up to ask about it. I for some reason admitted it to be true and then she told me to go for it. So now I'm under the belief my crush likes me back because her friend said to go for it. My friends hype me up and I go over to her and ask to talk with her outside. So we go outside by the stairway and I decide to go for it. I'm like "oh really like you ...(blah blah) ... would you go out with me?" She then goes ... "this story is entirely made up"
