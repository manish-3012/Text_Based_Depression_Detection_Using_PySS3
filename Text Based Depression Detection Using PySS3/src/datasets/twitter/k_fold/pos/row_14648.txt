just a rant ab my bf ig okay so this kid is my bf but like idk. thereâ€™s been a couple red flags and idk what to do. 
1. he hasnâ€™t told anyone he has a gf bc apparently he â€œdoesnâ€™t want people in his business cuz theyâ€™re annoying.â€ okayyy. whatever ig. 
2. he had his snap maps on but then TURNED THEM OFF. literally iâ€™ll be on delivered for hours but then his snap score will go up..
3. he was nicer when we were just talking. like heâ€™s not protective of me AT ALL, he used to be and he used to call me pet names and stuff when we were talking but now he kinda just acts like weâ€™re friends.
4. his bsf list on snap is all girls (ik this bc he posted it on his story for a dare or something when we were talking) iâ€™m at the top but still.

idk what to do,, i rly like him but i have trust issues from the past and if he isnâ€™t loyal then i wanna get over him. he knows this and every time he says â€œno i rly rly like youâ€ (we havenâ€™t gotten to the i love u stage btw) iâ€™m tired of getting screwed over so thatâ€™s why if heâ€™s not serious then i donâ€™t wanna talk to him. he just seems kinda off. he has medical problems so his excuse is heâ€™s always in the hospital which makes sense but also his snap score goes up while he doesnâ€™t talk to me so idk. i donâ€™t want him to jus be another guy who leads me on and stuff, and if he is i wanna get over him fast. like i have boys and girls who would love to be with me but arenâ€™t bc iâ€™m w him. i feel like a choice to him but i shouldnâ€™t be a choice, i should be the only one. ig iâ€™ll take advice? i just wanted to get this off my chest

also iâ€™ve said stuff to him multiple times for the last couple days and he gets mad and i end up being e one to apologize
