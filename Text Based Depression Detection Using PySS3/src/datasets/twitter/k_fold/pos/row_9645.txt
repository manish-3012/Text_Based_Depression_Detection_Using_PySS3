doing poems for reasons day 1: doing this for content day 1:

so after all the struggle
after all the pain 
it has been revealed that it was all in vein
what the fuck
why me
this is insanity
i wondered why
all those years ago
i could never make anything of my work
it was shown to me today
i was wrong
no peace
no darkness 
only suffering
suffering to all those cursed with being associated with me
the walkway is only as great as a relationship 
well the walkway fell 
along with my â€œfriendâ€ 
i fell too
it is a miracle i survived
a miracle from hell
disguised as a miracle
itâ€™s a curse
i seem to survive all the horrible
yet my work and my relationships fall with them
it never ends
itâ€™s a cycle of death
one does not escape
what the fuck. 
once again i fail
once again i am trapped
this misery must end soon
will it?
the unknown is scary
but it must be faced
for one to live
for me to live














woo?
