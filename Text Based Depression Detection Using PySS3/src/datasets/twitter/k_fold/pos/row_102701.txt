Was I wrong to dump my girlfriend? I was dating this girl (we were both 16) and she started getting very dry (one word responses, stopped with the love emojis, replies hours later etc) I asked her what was going on and she said "idk" like wtf. I simply said "you can talk to me baby, I'm your one, your my one. It stays confidential. This girl said "maybe you should date other girls first before saying I'm the one" who says that to their boyfriend... I said "you don't mean that do you" she said "no really, I don't mind if you date other girls" so in my mind (probably in most people's too) she found someone "better" so yea I just told her "ok if that's how you feel so be it" was I wrong?
