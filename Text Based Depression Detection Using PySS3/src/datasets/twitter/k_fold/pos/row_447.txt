I went on a full out rant in my English report writing. Basically, whenever I am asked to write an essay on a "problem", I express my true feelings and go on a full out rant, turning what was supposed to be a 200 to 300 word essay into a 500 to 1,000 word lecture. Four pages is a bit excessive, but once I start, I can't stop rant-writing. Surprisingly, these rants actually positively surprise my teachers, making me get near perfect scores, so it might be a good thing after all. Apparently, the grammar, vocabulary, and content were exactly what my teachers were looking for. Every single time I do the same thing, and each time I get the same results.
