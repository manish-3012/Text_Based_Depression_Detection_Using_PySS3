Does anybody else feel sick after being woken up? Everyone I get waken up and Iâ€™m in that half asleep half conscious phase I always end up feeling like shit. I get all nauseous and I feel like I just went through hell, it takes like an hour for it to go away and then when I wake up I feel fine, but I was wondering if anyone else has this happen to them.
