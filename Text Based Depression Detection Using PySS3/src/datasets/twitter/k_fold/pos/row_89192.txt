School Burnout Ok who else is getting incredibly burnt out from school???
Like, I wouldnâ€™t call it exhaustion because itâ€™s not about my energy, itâ€™s more like my ability to do schoolwork with resolve is getting weathered away. Iâ€™m losing my ability to focus, to care, to work hard. Iâ€™m just getting worn out, I really need another break.
