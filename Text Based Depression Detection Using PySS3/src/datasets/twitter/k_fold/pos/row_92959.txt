Iâ€™m not sure if I messed up Just saying itâ€™s midnight where I am and my mum is strict and wonâ€™t like me being on my phone.So I was just searching up some anime on safari when after I pushed in search it came up with a screen full of confetti saying I had made the 5 billionth search in a certain thing (donâ€™t remember what) and below that it had 3 gift boxes to choose from so I chose one and it said that I had chosen an iPhone 11 which I found pretty suspicious then below that it showed previous users who won stuff so I clicked to the next section and it came up with a section where I had to type in my address and email but it didnâ€™t mention anything about a password or username but I still went off the page even though it looked legit because Iâ€™m overly cautious. I know I canâ€™t ask my mum for help of advice so what does everyone else think
