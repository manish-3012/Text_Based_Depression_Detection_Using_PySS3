Despite everything the desire to ghost everyone and just live carefree until I die still lingers in my mind And itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t love my friends and family, but damn... Sometimes it feels more like a burden than a blessing, and I still believe the effort I put and the love I give is never fully given back, Iâ€™m always the one who cares more, I wanna stop that, I wanna stop caring, I wanna live free ffs
