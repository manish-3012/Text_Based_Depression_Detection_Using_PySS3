My mom baited my dad to talk to her, lied to cops and he's facing jailtime. My mom has a restraining order against my dad which is completely unwarranted (entire story i wont dive into) and he lives at my grandparents, he said he wouldn't pay her bills and she lied about him kicking the door in and threatening her (never happened)

He has a warrant out for his arrest and losing his job, he's on the run currently and I'm scared for him

Fuck you mom, go to hell bitch.
