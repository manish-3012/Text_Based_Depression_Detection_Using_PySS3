Iâ€™m not good a titles but here we go So my dad has halfway disowned me because Iâ€™m a male and wear skinny jeans, have fairly long hair, wear pink often ,and listen to punk rock/pop. No one else in my family has done this, my grandparents, mom, stepmom and pretty much everyone else say I look good in it. I know this isnâ€™t as big as some other peopleâ€™s problems no one else will listen to me.
