Reddit awards The people who give awards like the "wholesome" award or the "innocent giggle" award or even the "I'm dead" awards on post about a person DYING are fucking assholes and don't even give me the excuse of "oh it's dark humor" no its fucking not. There's always a time and place for jokes like that but being like "lol let me give that guy a I'm DEAD award on his post about his dead friends lol" you're just an asshole. An l think shouldn't have to explain myself but after seeing people defend actions like this I don't know.
