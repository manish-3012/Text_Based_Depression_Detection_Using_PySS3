Negative XP song OriginalÂ Translation

BPD and ecstasy
Conceited with low self-esteem
She's a teenage dream if you hate yourself
Bright dyed hair and obnoxious clothes
Thinks communism is the way to go
She's a whore, a hole, a dime-a-dozen Jezebel

Fluored mind and SSRIs
A thousand yard stare for all those guys
That she fucked and sucked before you came along
etarded views on politics
Likes to listen to shitty music
She drinks and smokes and tokes out of a dirty bong

She saw Ramona Flowers
And felt so empowered
By a movie made
In Hollywood
It's sad to think she's someone's daughter
Like a lamb to the slaughter
But honestly I'd still hit if I could

BPD and ecstasy
Thirty years old, but acts like she's sixteen
Likes to go to shows' cause she's so fucking cool
Bright dyed hair but dead inside
Plan-B lifetime supply
She's a whore, a hole, gave head since middle school

Only pedophiles in denial
Think she's anything worth while
Her third-eye lifestyle will drive you wild
She's an alcoholic loser bitch
That likes to listen to shitty music
She drinks and smokes and tokes and chokes on dick

She saw Ramona Flowers
And felt so empowered
By a movie made
In Hollywood
It's sad to think she's someone's daughter
Like a lamb to the slaughter
But honestly I'd still hit if I could

She saw Ramona Flowers
And felt so empowered
By a movie made
In Hollywood
It's sad to think she's someone's daughter
Like a lamb to the slaughter
But honestly I'd still hit if I could..
