3 Average Men, each with baseball bats, would destroy almost any animal Was looking at r/whowouldwin and people over there tend to overestimate how tough animals like bears, gorillas, lions etc are. The occasional post of human vs some animal will pop up and mostly everyone, including me, agrees that a large animal can take on several  unarmed people. 

But a person with a weapon is entirely different. When I read about gorillas and bears shrugging off baseball bat swings to the face, I think these people are crazy. I know a gorilla will handle a bat to the face better than I could, but it  would still lose badly. Best case scenario for the animal: first hit doesn't crack their skull and is still conscious, then 1 second later 2 more swings come in and the fight's over.
