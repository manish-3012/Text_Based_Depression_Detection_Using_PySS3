a study of gender and sexuality, open to everyone **A study of gender and sexuality**

So, Iâ€™m writing a study/research paper about how neurodivergent people may view gender differently than neurotypical people. If anyone would like to participate, let me know and please answer the following questions. (Iâ€™m working on a google doc but it keeps malfunctioning) Also, Iâ€™m only 15, and inexperienced, but I do take constructive criticism. Thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

* Are you comfortable with this 	information being included in a research essay that may or may not 	be published in the future?  
 
* Are you diagnosed as neurodivergent? If so, what form?  
 
* Do you have any diagnosed mental illnesses?    
 
* What is your sexual identity? e.g. heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, etc.  
 
* What is your romantic identity? e.g. heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, aromantic, 	etc.  
 
* What is your gender identity? 	e.g. man, woman, nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, etc.  
 
* Are you transgender or cisgender?  
 
* Do you use neopronouns?  
 
* What pronouns do you use?  
 
* How old are you? (if uncomfortable sharing publicly you can dm me, skip the question, or 	give a generalization)  
 
* Do you know anyone who is neurodivergent? If so, are they cis or trans? (note: transgender 	includes all people who are not their assigned gender at birth)  
 
* Do you know anyone who is trans and neurotypical?    
 
* If you are the gender you 	were assigned at birth, would you consider yourself to adhere 	closely to typical gendered traits or roles?    
 
* How close would you say you are to typically masculine and feminine mannerisms and dress?  
 
* How would you describe gender identity? Is it more of a solid, set in stone thing, or is it more 	of a fluid thing?  
 
* Do you experience gender dysphoria?    
 
* If you need any clarification about any of the above questions, let me know!
