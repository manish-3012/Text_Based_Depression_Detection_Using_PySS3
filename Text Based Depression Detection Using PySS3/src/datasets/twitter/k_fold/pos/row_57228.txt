Hello guys I would really like to develop a destructive cocaine addiction that will ruin my 20â€™s and maybe even my late teens. After Iâ€™m done with that I would like to find myself in a loveless marriage with at least 2 kids, after a while we will come to the conclusion that divorce is the best/only choice that we have. And then, only then I would like to re-ignite my destructive cocaine addiction that will lead to my death (I hope in my late 40s- early 50s) in some dinner in South Dakota or some shithole like that.
