I need some advice on flirting with a girl. So obviously there is a girl I like. And we are pretty friendly, enough that I have her number in my phone and we talk from time to time. 

I feel like she likes me but Im kinda nervous. The main reason for me being nervous is that she is about a year older than me, Iâ€™m 16 and sheâ€™s 17. I guess it seems like girls tend to like guys that are older than them not ones that are younger so it seems weird to me but it really shouldnâ€™t. 

Still Iâ€™m like 90% sure that she likes me. She gets really nervous around me. Me and my friends would hang out after school and whenever she went somewhere she would ask me to go with her. She would always try to sit next to me and when she did she would move her leg over so that it was touching mine. 

So she definitely likes me right?

Iâ€™m almost certain she does. 

So now that Iâ€™ve figured that out I was hit with this wave of confidence and Iâ€™m thinking that I should try to flirt with her a bit but I donâ€™t want to be too obvious. 

I would prefer that it be subtle. For example I could try to compliment her a bit or something like that. But idk. 

Iâ€™ve never done this before so I could really use some advice.
