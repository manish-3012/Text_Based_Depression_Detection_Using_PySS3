I was in a call with my friends (all dudes) and didn't realize my tits were showing You know when you're in this video call, but you're not looking at your own camera, just doing something else. I didn't realize it until two of them started laughing and messaging each other. 

They showed me the messages it was just "Dude, don't look at the boobs. Neck up! NECK UP!" and "STOP LOOKING!" to each other. 

When I realized I was so embarrassed, but props on them for at least trying not to look, so thats good. 

Someone just end me.
