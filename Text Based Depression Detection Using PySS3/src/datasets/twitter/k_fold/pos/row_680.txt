Anyone else hate it when you know the right answer but you've answered all the questions so you have to wait 5 minutes for the class to finally answer the question. This happens to me so much, especially in Spanish vlass because I already know like everything weve learned. But then I answer a bunch of questions before waiting for 5 minutes cause no one can or no one wants to anseer.
