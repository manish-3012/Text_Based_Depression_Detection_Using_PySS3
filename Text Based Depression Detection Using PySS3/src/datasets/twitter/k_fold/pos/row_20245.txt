How my sk8 sesh ended up with me and my friend on a boat with girl We were skating (we suck tho) at a new spot we were trying out, it is basically a wooden deck public view point on the edge of a cliff. Then this qt3.14 comes walking along, just having a look at the scenery, so we stop skating (its loud and disruptive to ppl checking the view we dont wanna get reported and told to go away) and she comes towards our part of the view point. Then she stops and says; "Do I know you?" (In a concerned way) I was quite surprised cos ain't no qt1.14 like her know me, and I was expecting an awkward hello as she walked by. Anyway we establish idk her and nor she me, she kind of knows my friend and she gives him a hug then asks to chill with us for a bit. We chat a bit about parties, where we stay, we all share a zol and we vibing with the music playing. We then decide it's time to go and ask her where she is headed, she says her house just down the way and she gotta do an hour of driving her boat as she is trying to get her skippers licence! We offer to walk her there and on the way she offers if we wanna come along on the boat, ofc we do. We go boating and afterwards she is going to her friends house and turns out to close to mine so she offers to drop us off on the way. We take her up on the offer and get a lift all the way home. Ye that sounded more interesting in my head, I sensierly apologise if u read this far lmao.
