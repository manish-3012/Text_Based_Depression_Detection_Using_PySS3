you ever think about a traumatic event then get stuck on it? I've had a lot of awful shit happen in my life, but this one I stay up at night thinking about.

I tried to off myself at 13. I didn't do it in a violent way, and when my mom took me to the hospital, the doctors said that i'd have to go to a mental hospital for a week, but that my mom could drive me. she was trying to console me, and i was scared. Really scared.

Then, this policeman comes in with a small pair of yellow cuffs, looks at me, and tells me "okay little girl, time to put on your jewelry." 

Of course, I start sobbing, because im confused and terrified. I've never met a policeman before, and here he was about to put me in a cop car like I was some criminal. im forced into them and I'm forced to walk all the way across the hospital to get to the cop car without saying goodbye to my mom. Hundreds of people looked at me, I felt so humiliated and upset. I couldn't stop thinking about how i wasnt violent at all, and how it wasn't fair. 

when he put me in the car, he didn't talk to me the entire time. 

I still think about that man. It makes me so mad. I wasn't some violent asshole, I was a scared little girl who lost her dad not 2 months ago. I was in pain. I felt humiliated, ashamed, scared, and it made me want to end it all more.

i wish it never happened at all. I cant wear bracelets anymore because of it. I wish he never called it "my jewelry" at least. I cant stand to wear jewelry at all now. 

sorry if this is heavy. I just. needed to get it off my chest. i thought maybe talking about it would make me feel better. have a good night.
