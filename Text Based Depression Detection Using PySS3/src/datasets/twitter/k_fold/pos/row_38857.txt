I wish I could have enjoy things when theyâ€™re going well but Iâ€™m in this constant state of worry I feel like I should have really held on to things and been in the moment when I had the chance but I was probably worrying about some dumb shit and I donâ€™t have a good memory. It isnâ€™t gonna change either, Iâ€™ve never been happy at a vacation because I was thinking about dumb shit
