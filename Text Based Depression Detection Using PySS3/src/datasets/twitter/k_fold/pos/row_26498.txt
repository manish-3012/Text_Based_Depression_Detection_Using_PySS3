Still a teen but already rethinking my life decisions I am 17 turning 18 but I feel like I'm already 40 ffs. This is starting to affect how I perform in online classes and I'm pretty sure my depression is coming back. I do not know what did I do wrong and now I'm starting to expect that it's all someone's fault.

I really think my family really trusts the school I go to even though its the reason I wanted to leave it right after elementary (same school just a different level). This school has been like a torture for me but it wasn't my choice of coming back. I don't think my family knows what I'm going through. I just wish they had seen the signs before.
