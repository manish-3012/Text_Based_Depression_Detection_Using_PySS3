I exceeded my cringe level today Guys, i just exceeded my level of crnge i could handle.  
Baically its my mom's birthday, i brought a cake from a bakery, went to buy candles at a shop  
I went to the shop, looked at the shopkeeper and said,  
"TwO bIrThDaY cAkEs PlEaSe"  
Thats when the cringe began  
He didnt even say anything, cringe doubled  
He didnt even laugh at my social awkwardness, cringe magnified  
He juststared at me with a "huh wtf?" expression, cringe reached ma level  
We both silently began questioning my existence, i fucking died due to cringe
