Got ghosted twice but they come back Iâ€™m a sophomore and got setup with two girls that were but seniors. I talked to them on Snapchat and got ghosted the following day. I got informed that I being to dry in the conversation. But now one of them came back and said they do want to talk. Do I keep going for it?
