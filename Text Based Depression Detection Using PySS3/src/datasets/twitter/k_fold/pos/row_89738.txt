I hate my subconscious and the dreams I have The only dreams I ever seem to remember are these incredibly lucid dreams I have about me and girls I like.

I wouldn't have a problem with it if it didnt feel so real. Whenever I get one, I'm always wondering if it was real when I wake up. It's awful.

The most recent one was last night. The details are a little hazy but I'll do my best to remember. I'm out with my crush and some other friends. I forget what we were doing but it isn't really important. Afterwards, we go to my house and the group disperses. It's just me and my crush waiting for her parents to come get her. She starts telling me about some medical episode she had recently and how it's highly likely she has some condition that causes death.

Basically Your Lie in April at this point.

She tells me she's scared and that she doesn't know what to do. She moves over to me (we're on a couch by the way) and put her around me and I slump over. At this point, she's basically lying on top of me. She says some stuff I don't remember and I wake up. Apparently I was just hugging myself. 

They're not usually that sad. Normally they're pretty happy and cool. Just overly realistic.

I'm not some loser who's never had a girlfriend before, or doesn't know how to talk to girls. I guess I've just felt really empty really. And with quarantine going on, not being able to see anyone or go to school hasn't helped. 

Well that's all for now. Stay safe everyone.
