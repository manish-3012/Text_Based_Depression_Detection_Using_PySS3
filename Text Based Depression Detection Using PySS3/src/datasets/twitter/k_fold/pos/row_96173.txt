My mom is getting really annoying So, I guess this starts with the beginning of COVID-19.

When all this started, she was actually very strict about the cleanliness to stop the spread of coronavirus. she wasn't a very political person, and I was being told to not touch things. we lived normally, and no conflict rose. I assumed it would stay this way.

I assumed wrong.

(disclaimer: this is nothing remotely tragic, just the woes of a hormonal thirteen-year-old) As I said, I had hoped that my mom and I would stay dutiful about protection, but over the weeks, she started dropping hints that she wasn't so sure she believed everything she was told. At first, she only complained that the media was "overembellishing" the threat, which I halfheartedly agreed with, so as to not cause trouble. Then, when Wuhan started opening up a bit, she constantly exclaimed that "iF iT's So DaNgErOuS, WhY ArE ThEy OpEnInG?" I tried to explain that the virus had run its course through the city, but she interrupted me with one stupid excuse or another, making my brain cringe so much it turned inside out.

through many arguments like this, with increasingly more heated tempers and more inhuman brain-cringing, we can fast forward to today, where she has become so brainwashed that she is calling *me* brainwashed, is showing me posts from dumbass celebrities on Facebook, and claims that this whole thing is a ruse from the democrats to unseat Trump, who months before she had been calling a bigot. and it certainly doesn't stop there. When I remind her about her mask, she mutters under her breath, "stupid fuckin' thing", and she spreads her closeminded opinion that the whole thing is "ridiculous". It hurts my head sometimes because she won't listen to logic or reason. she belittles me for being safe, and when I state my opinion, she scoffs and tells me to stop mocking her. hopefully, she won't have to experience the virus to believe it, and we can have respect people's lives by being safe again.

TL;DR: my mom is foolish for believing that COVID-19 is a ruse for the democrats to unseat trump.
