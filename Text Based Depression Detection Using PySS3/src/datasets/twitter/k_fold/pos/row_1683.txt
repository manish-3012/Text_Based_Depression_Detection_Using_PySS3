What I would change with the school system in The USA 
The time it starts, people arenâ€™t ready to learn until 10:30 am. Not 8:30 or before. So schools open at 9:00 and start at 10:00. Ends at 3:25, with no homework.

Standardized tests are now banned, they put too much stress on people and the only tests that will stay are the SAT and ACT, for college purposes.

The only required class would be Math as is used in every job. Every other class is optional and classes would last for 45 minutes each. You need 5 classes.

More language options instead of just French and Spanish, as more people have interests in different countries.

More creative based classes and classes explaining how technology works and how to fix it.
