So weâ€™re talking about racism and social justice in our Spanish Zoom class This stuff just pisses me off. Iâ€™m a hardened liberal. Iâ€™m for social justice and equality. But I donâ€™t want preaching about equality and defunding police shoved down my throat. If I wanted to learn about these things, I would research them, and trust me, I do. But if people donâ€™t really care or donâ€™t intend to learn, I just feel you shouldnâ€™t make them. And school is for learning new things, not more virtue signaling of social justice. It just upsets me. Weâ€™re listening to a video in Spanish about it so weâ€™re â€œLeArNiNg nEW wOrDsâ€ but itâ€™s really just discussing things we already hear about ad nauseam if we watch the news 5 minutes a day. Maybe Iâ€™m just being pissy, and Iâ€™m just acting like a boomer. But I feel like weâ€™ve heard enough about this, I really donâ€™t want to continue to hear about it in school. I donâ€™t not support BLM or the fight for equality, I just donâ€™t need to hear about it all the time.
