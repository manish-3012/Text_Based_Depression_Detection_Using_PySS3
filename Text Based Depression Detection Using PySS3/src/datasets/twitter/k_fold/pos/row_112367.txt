my ex is so focused on the fact i donâ€™t like him itâ€™s comical â€œhow much do you despise me?â€

i donâ€™t know. how much can you despise someone for ripping your heart out. how much can you despise someone for essentially using them for your sexual pleasure when you knew you didnâ€™t love them anymore. how much can you despise someone for getting a new gf a month later as if you didnâ€™t matter to them. how much can you despise someone for talking shit about you to strangers online and to friends, retracting every sweet and nice thing they have said about you. how much can you despise a person for deceiving you into thinking they can love you unconditionally when thatâ€™s not the case. because they only loved you when you were perfect. they didnâ€™t love you at your worst. 

i fucking despise you. and i know youâ€™re gonna read this because despite having a new gf you check my account. i fucking despise everything about you. nothing you say or do can make me change my mind. because nothing you say or do will revert the lies, the deception. it will never revert the pain you have caused me and you dared to tell me to just let it go? fuck you.
