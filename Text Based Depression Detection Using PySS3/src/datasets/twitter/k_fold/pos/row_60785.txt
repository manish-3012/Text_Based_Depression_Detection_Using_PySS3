Recently, Iâ€™ve learnt how bad my parents are at geography, so I want to do a survey If you guys could ask your parents

1. Whatâ€™s the capital of Japan

2. Whatâ€™s the capital of China

3. Whatâ€™s the capital of Italy

And then comment what they say, you will all be certified epic gamers, thank you
