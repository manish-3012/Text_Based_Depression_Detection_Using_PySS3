Here's the rest of the story:

TL;DR: I asked her out, we dated for a bit, but then she said she needed space, then she broke up with me, and now I'm depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Same guy here, but the story is over. I asked her out in mid-November. We dated for like 2 weeks, then she said she needed to take a mental break (I can understand, as it was right before midterms that I asked her out). I respected her space and didn't talk (more like "texted") to her unless she talked to me. One week ended, and I asked how she was. She said she thought we wouldn't be dating anymore. This happened literally the day before my birthday (and if you wanna know, my birthday was a shitty day). The text was as follows:

&gt; So I think that we should just be friends. Iâ€™m trying to do a lot of things and figure everything out. I really like you, and I like talking, but I canâ€™t handle a relationship right now, this year. Iâ€™m sorry. I feel like a jerk. I really hope you donâ€™t hate me for this, because I still want to be close with you. And Iâ€™m sorry for doing this so close to ur birthday, and taking forever. Iâ€™m always here to talk, I will always be here. I think I just felt a bit rushed, and I couldnâ€™t handle trying to figure out these feelings along with balancing school, and normal stress. It just didnâ€™t work. Please continue to text me, I donâ€™t want to stop being your friend, but I would understand if you did want to stop talking to me because Iâ€™m being really selfish here. Iâ€™m sorry for everything.

I replied:

&gt;I completely understand where youâ€™re coming from, and I respect your choice. I hope that maybe later, when things arenâ€™t so hectic, we maybe could try again, but this time Iâ€™ll slow down a lot more. Like Iâ€™ve said many times before, I honestly had no idea when to do things or what to do or how to do it, so Iâ€™m fully responsible for rushing it. This has been quite the learning experience for me (AKA trial by fire), and I hope that if we do maybe try again later, I might be able to do better. In the mean time, I want to be close to you too, and hope that us dating doesnâ€™t ruin our past relationship. If you want to stay friends for now, Iâ€™m perfectly fine with that, and respect your choice. If you ever wanna talk about this or something, Iâ€™m always here, and I honestly love to just talk with you in general. My feelings for you havenâ€™t (and probably wont) change, but I will have to put a hard filter on my thoughts and actions. And dont feel horrible, because I never want people to have a bad taste in their mouth when they think of me, nor do I want the reverse to be true. Again, I respect your choice and understand why you made it. Maybe later we could try again :) If you ever want to get back together, just let me know, as I will be waiting. In the mean time, lets just get to know each other better. And if you ever need someone to talk to or something, Iâ€™m always here too (assuming that my parents arenâ€™t being jerks and taking away my means of communication). Thanks for letting me know, tho. Iâ€™m one anxious boyo, so this actually helps a lot XD And remember, dont cry because itâ€™s over; smile because it happened :)

&amp;#x200B;

and so we stopped dating. 

Later on, (like end of January), I was super nervous because she wasn't responding much, so I was starting to feel like she may not like me any more. I asked her friend to find out if she doesn't like me anymore, and this is what she said:

&gt;She said she didnt want to hurt your feelings but she doesnt rlly like you

&amp;#x200B;

my heart is broken

&amp;#x200B;

I still miss her. After we broke up, she slowly became more and more distant, to the point where she never responded to my texts. One night, I was texting her cuz ya never know when she may respond, and she said: 

&gt;Hey! Hope ur doing good! I ve been really busy and I get really stressed when people text me bc I am too anxious to answer! Not personal but do you mind cutting back?

I'm assuming this is a nice way to say "Stop texting me I don't wanna talk to you", and so my heart is broken. I still love her. A lot. But she doesn't, and it hurts. I want to tell her how much I love her, but she probably doesn't wanna hear it. I don't know what to do...

Can you guys help?
