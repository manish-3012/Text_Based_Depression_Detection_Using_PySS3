Update on my date with my crush [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jzwocu/i_know_no_one_cares_but/)

So It went wellâ€¦ I guess.

  
I was at the mall early because I was doing something else then she told me she was waiting in a restaurant. I quickly went there, and she was with her dad, mom and sister. They told me to have fun and left. We ordered and started talking for about an hour. It was great until her other friends arrived. We went to another restaurant to eat dessert. When we were leaving and this guy from the group of friends paid my dates bill then she hugged him. Honestly, the date went overall great but the last part.
