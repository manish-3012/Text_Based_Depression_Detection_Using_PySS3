Do Racist Subreddits Exist? I noticed that a lot of subreddits have rules against racism and other immoral things, but is there a subreddit that is racist? I would imagine they would get taken down, even if freedom of speech allows things like that. Anyways, I was just wondering a subreddit has in their rules that they like allow and condone racism.
