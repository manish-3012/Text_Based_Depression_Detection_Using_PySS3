The results of my first month of gym &amp; dieting In the first month at the gym, keeping a strict diet (avoiding cheat day as much as possible and if I had to eat unhealthy food I would eat very little) I've lost 6kg

I was actually gonna share this yesterday but I had kinda gained 2kg again so I waited until I lost those again

February 8th I was 121kg..... very fricking overweight, today I was 115.0 

The .0 matters cuz that means tomorrow I'm gonna be 114, maybe .6 or less or more, idk, but 114 nonetheless

Anyway once I lose enough weight I'm gonna share pics
