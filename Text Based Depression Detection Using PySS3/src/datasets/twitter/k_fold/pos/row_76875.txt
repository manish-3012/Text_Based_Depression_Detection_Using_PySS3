Sooo I read a post somewhere and I wanted to ask other people's opinion on this Is lesbian sex real sex?like no offense to the gay people out there but I was just wondering,is it actually like proper sex as nothing is penetrating the vaginal entrance and breaking the hymen(if she has never had sex before)
And this is just a general question,not hating on anyone
Thanks in advance:)
