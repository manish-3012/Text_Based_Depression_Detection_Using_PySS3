Is it okay to encourage a divorce to your parents? If shit hasn't worked out for over 20 years, I don't think it'll work out in the next 10. I'm moving out soon anyway and their problems will no longer be my own anymore, but did I fuck up in encouraging them to cut the bullshit and just get a divorce?
