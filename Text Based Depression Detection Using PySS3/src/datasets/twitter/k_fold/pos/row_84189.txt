Why is listening to Minecraft music considered so uncool Or any video game music for that matter, recently I was on the bus listening to Cat https://youtu.be/9lX-hVpvN3E and a girl asked me what I was listening to. I said The Minecraft soundtrack and she replied â€œarenâ€™t you too old for thatâ€ and laughed. Which makes me wonder why listening to Minecraft music is considered uncool, maybe she thought I was listening a Minecraft parody which would may be a bit to young for me but even still you should never judge someone for what they listen to anyway
