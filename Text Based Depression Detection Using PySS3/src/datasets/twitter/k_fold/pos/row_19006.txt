Well fuck, I just found out that my ex step dad was planning to kill my mom and take me. Not really sure why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to get it off my chest and I don't want to put this on the people around me so I'm talking about it on the internet.






My mom and ex step dad were in an on and off relationship for years, practically my entire childhood, married twice, we moved states with him 3 times, stuff like that. They had a habit of getting into really nasty fights, I won't go into detail because I don't think anyone particularly cares. My ex step dad was extremely toxic, and kept my mom in his grasp for years, both my mom and I giving him chance after chance thinking that things would turn out okay.




Turns out, our third move of states with him ended in another huge fight. I ended up calling the police on them, and they got there just in time apparently. My ex step dad apparently had a fucking gun loaded and chambered on their bed, my mom had no idea since she was outside just trying to get away from him. He'd apparently been saying stuff along the lines of "she needs to die" and "my family can take care of (my name)"





Neither my mom and I knew about any of what he said nor did we know about the gun. This was around the time I was in the 5th grade, keep in mind. So for *years* we were in the dark until it was brought up when his most recent ex wife started raining hellfire on him for the awful shit he'd done and this shit all came to light.






Sorry for the long rant, like I said I just needed to get it off my chest and I don't want to accidentally scare/burden my only friend, who's extremely busy and stressed as it is.
