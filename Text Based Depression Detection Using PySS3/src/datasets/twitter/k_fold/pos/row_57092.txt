You guys lovvvvvvve to complain (me included) Every time I open Reddit I see a post saying â€œgod I hate my parents they do x and x and x theyâ€™re the worstâ€ like bro who gives a shit if theyâ€™re that bad youâ€™ll be out of the house in a few years and can never talk to them again. Be thankful for being alive and thankful for everything you have. Odds are they feed and clothe you and maybe even give you a place to stay which outweighs almost anything they can do to you (besides abuse). All Iâ€™m saying is try to view things from your parents perspective and quit bitching and moaning about how they took your phone.
