Can I tell you a story ðŸ¥º pt 1 (gonna do one every day) Itâ€™s currently 5:40 am


Sports day 2015, I had been chosen to do a sprint race  and as I get into position I hear the tearing of material but donâ€™t think nothing if it. As I start to run across the field I feel a light breeze on my arse... thatâ€™s when I realise, my shorts had ripped and my knickers were the only think that kept my 10 year old arse from being on display :) safe to say I won the race bc everyone was distracted
