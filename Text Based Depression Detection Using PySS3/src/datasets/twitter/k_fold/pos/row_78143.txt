What do I say to my parents? Ok look, i don't have a better way to say this. I'm a 13M and in the midst of puberty, my two testicles grew a bit larger. Since my old   underwear became somewhat smaller, using them would cause some discomfort and, since me and my family are quarantined, we can't go outdoors. I don't know how to ask my parents for new underwear because i'll get uncomfortable. 
What can I say to them?
