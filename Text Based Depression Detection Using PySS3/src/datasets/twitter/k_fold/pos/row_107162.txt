I am the MESSIAH So during my Geometry class I was answering some questions, when one of them was about graphing lines, so i was trying to remember what a vertical and a horizontal line were so with two fingers I pointed up to know what a vertical was. My dog who was literally laying down on the floor (not even facing my way) stood up as soon as I lifted my fingers and I felt like a god.
