Problem with friend groups As the title suggests, it just so happens that pretty much every "friend group" that I have gotten myself into always has people talking/criticizing others behind their backs. Is this just completely normal, as whenever someone doesn't hang out with the group, the discussion during the day is mainly negative topics regarding them. For example, problems that individuals have with them, and purely just things that aren't even remotely interesting. I say this as I find it quite repulsive that they even call each other friends, as sometimes people who call each other best friends will rant to me about things wrong with the other. I'm not sure if I'm just being overly observant, but it just completely bothers me and I just felt like putting it out there. Hopefully it's just that I happened to meet the wrong people.
