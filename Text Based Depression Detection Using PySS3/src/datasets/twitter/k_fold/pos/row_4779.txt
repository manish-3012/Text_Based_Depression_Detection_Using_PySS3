Homeschooling makes me want to kill myself I've been struggling with anxiety disorders, claustrophobia, depression and panic attacks since I was 15 (17 rn). I should enjoy staying at home and doing nothing else than playing video games and meeting my girlfriend, but it's the opposite. Being able to vibe alone at home is obviously cool sometimes, but all things start adding up. My father is a f-ing conspiracy theorist and turned extremely Christian during the pandemic. (Resulting in constant bombardment of theories, he calls real and from Christ and how my mother, my brother (14) and I have to start believing to be saved from hell and Satan. (sidenote: my father originally was a religion critique and made fun of it but recently made a complete U-turn and became that "wHaT hE sWoRe tO deStrOy" \*sry had to make that joke\* or rather what he was looking down on earlier. So I never had any connection with god or the like and still don't believe in it. My family even received death threats from Antifa and such because of internet controversy regarding my dad. And then there is school. A shot tun of assignments to submit in time, online conferences and shit. I just can not take it any more. My brain is going ape shit under all this pressure. I don't know if I fail this class because I already have two failed subjects and the limit is 4 or 5 idk. I really love my girlfriend and my family and I don't want to put her/them through the kind of suffering would I commit suicide. Nothing makes sense and I even thing this post sounds way too edgy to be taken seriously, but I just can't. Hope y'all doing well and positive. Have a mighty fine evening, kind stranger.
