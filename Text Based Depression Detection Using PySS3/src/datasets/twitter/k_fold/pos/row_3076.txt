random thought dump If could give technology sentience, would unplugging it be similar to death? if i unplugged and plugged it back it, would i be killing it repeatedly? wouldnit hurt them?

why are sentient robots to scary? cant we just destroy the power source? its not like it'll run on nothing, it has to recharge right? and what if its battery runs out?

what would it be like to put your mind in a machine?, would you be able to feel, or even see things? if it was like a humanoid mechanical body, how similar would using it be to using out bodies now? could you mod your body to whatever extent you wanted?

if we eventually get there, where we all can live as androids, what would happen if there was a solar flare? humanity would instantly die out, and we would be forced to wait for evolution to get back to us? could we set defences up? are we that capable?

would we be able to hack eachother? could i be in math and blast porn out of my teacher? could we control another? maybe even kill someone?

would we be immortal? would people even be able to die if their conscious is saved somewhere, somehow? would we become those planet hopping aliens, draining planet after planet for recourses?

what would be the limits? would we stop at humans, or give it to animals too? keep our cats and dogs around so we wont have to bear loosing them? bring back the dead even?

will we ever reach a post mortal society? a world where illness, poverty, any and all discrimination, criminal activity, ect. would vanish? would people still need to die, or would be stop having children overall? was i thinking about a book that explored this idea while typing this paragraph? yes.

lmk if you want more lmao
