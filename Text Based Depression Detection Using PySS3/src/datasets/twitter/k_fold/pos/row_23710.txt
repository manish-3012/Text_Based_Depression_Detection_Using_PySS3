Nobody told me high school would be this hard. I just started up my first year of high school and wow, just wow. I get more exercise running from class to class than I did getting exercise from gym classes in 5th-8th grade. I have one class where I gotta run to a WHOLE OTHER DAMN BUILDING LIKE WHAAAA?! I'm just lucky I've only gotten a few lates. I wake up at like 6am for the bus and get home by 4pm. Then is homework, showering, dinner, and maybe 1 or 2 hours of time for myself. I knew it would be a different experience, but DAYUM. I'm not 100% complaining though. I'm actually in one of the most successful high schools in my state so there's that to look forward to. I'm also getting all A's so uuuuuuh I guess I'm doing good? 

(Also if this is the wrong flair pls tell me so I can delete this and repost it cuz this is my first time here ._.)
