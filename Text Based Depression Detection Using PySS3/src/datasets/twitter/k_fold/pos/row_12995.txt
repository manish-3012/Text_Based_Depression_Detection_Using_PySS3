I'm diagnosed with OCD. For a couple of years I've suspected to have OCD but I didn't want to visit a psychiatrist and just kinda went on with it. But a few days ago I finally decided to visit a psychaitrist, so I had an appointment today and yeah, I have OCD and now I have to take antidepressants. Yaaaaayy....
