Ngl,Online School sucks Don't get me wrong, Video off and mute are basically the Garfield and lasagna to me but omfg sometimes I feel like physical school is better. (1) I don't have to worry about teachers remembering old assignments (2) I can do stuff right there instead of having the distractions of home (3) I have no friends from last year in my new school so f for my love and friend life. And (4) Online School has alot of technical difficulties.

Thank you for coming to my rant.
