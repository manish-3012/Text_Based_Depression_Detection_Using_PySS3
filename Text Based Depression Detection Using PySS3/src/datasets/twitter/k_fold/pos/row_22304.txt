There has been trolls saying shit about wanting pedosexuality to be a thing. And I get if you clarify that you don't want that to be an actual part of LGBT. But then it seems like a lot of LGBT people are also saying that all pedophiles, even gay ones, aren't allowed in the LGBT community. And that's absolutely wrong for this reason, there are pedos who are attracted to adults as well and they are gay if they are attracted to adults of the same gender. And of course we want them to be with adults so you can't just exclude them from their sexuality. 

To me it still makes sense that they're also considered gay if they like little boys, and I understand if you wouldn't want that associated with gay people. But guys who like little girls are heterosexual too, so the facts shouldn't make gay people look worse.
