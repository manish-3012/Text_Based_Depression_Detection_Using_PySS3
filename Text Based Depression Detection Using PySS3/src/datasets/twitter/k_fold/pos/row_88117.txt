i donâ€™t have anyone else to tell so i just wanted to say i finally got over this guy from the summer it feels great man. i can even listen to songs that remind me of him and feel okay. we didnâ€™t even date we just were like deep into the talking stage but damn i think it hurt more than breaking up.

thanks for listening :) means a lot
