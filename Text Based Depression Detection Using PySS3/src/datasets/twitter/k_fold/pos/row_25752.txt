Working for your mum is great! All I have to do is a bit of carrying stuff around and help out a bit of with other stuff, and then you get free time to go on reddit.

The only downside is there are a ton of little kids around as she runs a children's theatre group thing.

The pay is pretty decent considering I get Â£15-Â£20 for 4 to 5 hours, even though I really only do 1 to 2 hours of actual work!
