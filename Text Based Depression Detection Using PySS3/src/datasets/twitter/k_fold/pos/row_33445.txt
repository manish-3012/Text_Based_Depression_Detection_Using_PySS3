I completely underestimated highschool holy fuck

literally what is going on I was a straight a student last year and now I'm completely giving up on everything. I'm taking all honors for my core subjects, I'm taking ap human geography instead of world history, spanish, and biomedical science. there is so much homework and I haven't had a chance to relax since the first day of school. if anybody has any advice on how to manage my time or just get better at everything is really appreciate it. I really want to be at least a b student but right now it looks like I'm going for ds. I want to have time to myself without feeling like somebody is hitting my head with a hammer. I've just been feeling like absolute shit lately and I need help. thanks for reading this if you did and sorry to bring your mood down with my stupid problems lmao
