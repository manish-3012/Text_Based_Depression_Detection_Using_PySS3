Might shit my pants About an hour ago I was in really really bad pain and I didn't know if it was period cramps or if I was constipated. I made a milkshake with a bunch of laxatives and took some midol with it. Pain is gone but I didn't poo. I took like 3x the recommended dose for NOTHING. 


I'm in danger
