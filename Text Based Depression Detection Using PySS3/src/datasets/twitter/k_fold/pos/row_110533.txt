Covid-19 Christmas Jingles Number 2 You better watch out,
You better wear a mask,
You better not go out,
I'm telling you why,
Covid-19 is coming to Town

It's making a list,
Checking it twice,
Gonna kill all the anti-maskers and idiots
Covid-19 is coming to Town

It sees you when you're eating
It knows when you're outside,
It knows if you've been socially distant
So stay six feet apart for fuck's sake.

You better wear a mask,
You better not go out,
I'm telling you why,
Cause, Covid-19 is coming to Town

Thanks to u/drater29 for the idea
