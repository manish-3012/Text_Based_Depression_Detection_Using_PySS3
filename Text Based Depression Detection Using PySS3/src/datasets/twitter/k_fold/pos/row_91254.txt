I hate opening up to people. I hate it. I hate when people fucking take pity on me becuase I've opened up about how shit I feel. I hate the fucking sympathy becuase they all feel bad for me and so treat me better. It fucking sucks. I get I should be happy that people care for me but I hate when people defend me if someone insults or accusing me of something. It's like I'm just a walking pity machine. It fucking annoying it makes me feel horrible becuase I hate when people deal with my problems. Becuase their MY PROBLEMS. 

Honestly sorry for venting on here just gotta put this out. It helps me. And no I'm not begging for karma. Idgaf about that it's just to vent.
