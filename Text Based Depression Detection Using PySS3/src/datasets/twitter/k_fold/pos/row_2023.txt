I dunno if I should be but I'm pretty hurt rn, need some advice on this please My friend ask about my grades(I'm first in my class)  and I told her she got pretty upset and suddenly blocked me after I told her...she said she "needed some time"(I had to ask her using another number cuz I was blocked)

She's always been like maybe a little jealous but she shows it as like embarrassing me in front of other friends(as a joke ig?)

Now I feel kinda guilty but I dunno if I should cuz I worked pretty hard and studied quite a lot and I didn't like rub it in her face, she asked me herself...

I dunno what I should do or think of this, do u think she blocked me as a joke or is she mad at me, idk anymore
