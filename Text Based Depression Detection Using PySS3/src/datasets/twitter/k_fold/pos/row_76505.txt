Teacher told us a story involving nudes and jail time For some reason this memory just popped up in my head so I decided to post about it. A while ago one of my teachers told the class a story so here it is.

My teacher was always at the school early because he was the football coach and the team had early practice. After practice athletes would forget some bags or equipment or something and come back to get it. This one particular time he was chilling with the assistant coach when one of the students walked in, they paid no attention because itâ€™s a common occurrence. Some time passed and my teacher had to set up for class so he headed out, and thatâ€™s when he saw it. Dozens of printed out pictures of nudes on the walls. He had to team up with the assistant coach to take them down before the students showed up. After that Iâ€™m pretty sure they caught the dude that did it trying to leave campus, his bag was full of a bunch more pictures. His motive? His girlfriend cheated on him with one of his teammates so he printed out her nudes for everyone to see, the thing is though, he was 18 and the girl was- well not 18 so you can guess what happens.
