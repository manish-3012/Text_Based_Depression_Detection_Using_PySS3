Just added another mental disorder to the list... So I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my freshman year of high school. Last year, I got minor OCD and minor ADHD added to the list. NOW I just discovered another disorder that I have.

It's called Maladaptive Daydreaming. In the most basic terms, my brain figured out how to make really vivid and intense inner worlds and kind of zone out to escape to these places as a coping mechanism. I talk to myself a lot. I make music playlists that fit certain themes to trigger certain daydreams to start playing. I daydream for hours every day. It's basically like a movie constantly playing in my head and it distracts me from real life, homework, and just things going on around me. All day. Every day.

Didn't even know this was a mental disorder. I knew it wasn't completely normal, but I thought that most people probably did this to some degree. I was wrong.

Fun.
