I'm sad I'm in a call with my girlfriend, and she's over with her friends at a friend's house and they're laughing and talking and having fun and I'm in the call and I just can't help but think "I wish I had that". I've always had trouble making close long-term friends, maybe it's because I moved schools alot and never stayed in one school for mor than a year, maybe it's because I have shitty social skills and alot of anxiety, idk. And now I barely have any friends. I have 2 friends who I'm close with and trust, and we've known each other for over a year and a half and I've only hung out with them irl outside of school less than 10 times. 

Idk when I see my girlfriend having fun with friends, I see her happy, and that makes *me* happy, but I can't help but feel shitty compared to her, like I have no life. Outside of talking to and hanging out with her, all I ever do is procrastinate on work, watch youtube, nap, and get high like I am right now hoping that it could kill the sad for a little bit. It did ig. I am lucky as fuck to have even gotten a girlfriend as perfect as the one I have. Before her I had never dated anyone, and the only reason I'm dating her now is because she hit me up like "hey wusup, we're in the same classes and also I had a huge crush on you in 7th grade and now one year later I'm just randomly hitting you up just because lol" and we got to talking and hanging out until I eventually fell in love with her badly and asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes and now I'm here.

Anyways yeah, I wish I had good friends like she does. Just something I felt like getting off my mind.
