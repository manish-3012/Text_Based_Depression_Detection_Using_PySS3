Advice about losing weight I am not giving advice to anyone. I am just looking for advice. I have been a overweight kid ever since I was in 3rd grade. I am currently in 8th grade now. Trying to lose weight is something that I have been putting off over and over again. I am 5'6 and weigh about 150 lb. My goal is to lose at least 30 pounds. I want to make a change to my body and make myself healthier. I don't know when to start or how to start. I would like to accomplish my goal before my freshman year of high school.
