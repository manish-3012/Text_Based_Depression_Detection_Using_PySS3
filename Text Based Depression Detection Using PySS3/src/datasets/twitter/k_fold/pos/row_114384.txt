Schoolâ€™s going back fully in-person after 1 month of remote and Iâ€™m stressed. The announcement to go back in person was made yesterday, 9/29. Iâ€™m stressing over it because Covid hit my area hard, still is, and these fools of a school board want us to go back even though transmission is still very high. They changed to a more lenient gating criteria just because they want kids back in school and not to protect us from Covid. Iâ€™ve been crying at night sometimes during the day because of this. 

And I canâ€™t do optional remote learning because Iâ€™m taking AP classes and I canâ€™t do those online. If I could, I wouldnâ€™t be writing this. 

 I really need someone to assure me that itâ€™s not going to be as bad as I think it will be. Iâ€™m just scared that Iâ€™ll get Covid, miss a lot of school, get seriously ill, and be left with long term health effects if I survive. 

Can someone tell me that in person isnâ€™t a complete disaster?

TL;DR Iâ€™m stressed about going in person and I need someone to tell that itâ€™s going to be okay.
