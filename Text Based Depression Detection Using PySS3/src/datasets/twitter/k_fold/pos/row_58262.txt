I don't care that much about Christmas and I feel bad about it Christmas is okay, in my opinion. We're in good terms, I don't have anything against it. I just really don't care about it. I never felt the "Christmas spirit" or whatever, and it doesn't excite me either. Like, yay Jesus was born on December 25. I know how we celebrate that, and it's cool we do. But I just feel that Christmas is a bit... exaggerated? I don't know. Maybe it's just me and being a cringey teenager or something. I don't like Christmas shopping either; I like buying gifts for my fam but I just hate it for some reason. 

My parents told me that if I don't feel happy on Christmas, I'm not a real Catholic and they won't get me anything. I really don't care whether or not they get me something. I mean, I'd be grateful, of course. But them saying that I "wouldn't be a real Catholic" just makes me feel guilty. I like being Catholic, or at least SOMETIMES I am. There's obviously many things wrong, I believe, with the religion, but overall I'm happy with it. I don't know. I just don't really care about Christmas and I don't know if that's wrong. I just can't force myself to love it when it's my second least favorite holiday.
