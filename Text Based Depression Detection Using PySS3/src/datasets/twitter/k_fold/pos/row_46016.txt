help (advice) pls if u can ty so uhm, i'm the kind of person to always be dark to some extent (more than others) and i don't really have a problem with that, but just tonight i feel oddly darker than usual. it feels a bit more dark than the usual "existential crisis while i've been trying to sleep for hours now" to the point where i think i'm toxic, when im actually not. i feel like it would be so easy for me to say something out of internal toxicity and hurt someone. my head actually hurts rn and i'm doubting a lot of stuff.  so uhm, does someone have advice? i'd go to pray to god but i don't feel like that rn, and i wanna distance myself from my friends and family coz i feel toxic, so i guess the anonymity of reddit is a good pillar to lean on. thanks.
