my boyfriend wants a $50 pewds switch skin so our 1 year anniversary is coming up soon and he doesnâ€™t really want me to buy it for him because it costs so much. 

i kind of feel like i have to though. i was hoping on just getting him a bunch of smaller, cute gifts. but now i just kinda feel like if i donâ€™t buy him the skin he wonâ€™t be as happy
