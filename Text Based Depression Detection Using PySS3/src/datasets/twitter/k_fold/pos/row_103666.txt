daily post 3 today was ok. it was my second day of school, and it went by quickly. i feel like everyone has a clock that they follow. it changes speed day to day. today went by very fast, and i asked my classmates, and their day went by quickly too. they all agreed that yesterday went by quickly too. im still being ignored so yeah. today was a decent day. 7/10
