Mom is taking my phone away ðŸ˜ƒ Today i got a C from chemistry test. Beautiful. And my mom will take my phone away when she gets home ðŸ˜ƒ

Yes, taking my phone away will help me improve my studying. Yes, mom, when you yell i have big motivation to study.

The reason why i got a C is because last few days were literaly hell. Some family problems. And before school mom told me its okay whatever i get, she understands that i was too stressed. And now she is angry asf, she says i didnt study... i want to cry. 

Btw im a really good student, i dont have all straight A but i dont remember last time a got C. I am also good in chemistry and i love that subject but.. damn i made fking dumb mistakes. Im mad asf, i want to cry..

If anyone leaves a comment i will respond when i get my phone back or before mom arrives home. Thats it
