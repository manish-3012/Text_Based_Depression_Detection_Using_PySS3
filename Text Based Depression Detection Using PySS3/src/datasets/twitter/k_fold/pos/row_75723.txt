Honestly, Happy ASF I'm Gay The more I think about it, it's such a special thing to grow close bonds with other boys, the soft tender kind of feelings you grow are just.. Ugh. I used to kind of reject it and think I was bi or maybe just going through something but I'm happy to be able to fully embrace it now, you know?
