Hey yo doctor hereâ€™s another proper track 
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke, so you's a wanna be 'loc
And you'll get smoked and i hope that yer fans understand
When ya talk about sprayin me, the same records that ya
Makin' is payin me
Mothafuck Dre
Mothafuck Snoop
Mothafuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes me left blow
"Cause i'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season
To let the Real mothafuckin G's in, ya like a kid ya
Found a pup and now yer dapper, but tell me where the
Fuck ya find an anorexic rapper
