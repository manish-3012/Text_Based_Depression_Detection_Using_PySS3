Never been in a relationship in 18 years of my life (18M) I donâ€™t really know what I do wrong, I get told Iâ€™m nice by a lot of people, I donâ€™t believe I am ugly, iâ€™m 6â€™3 at 190 pounds with a decent body. The only major problem with me is my teeth but I feel like that can be canceled out with everything else about me. Granted I really donâ€™t have many friends only 2 that I consider friends for life, but I still post on social media and still hold contact with girls from school but like no one holds interest. So I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the way I act or talk or something but it just mind boggles me that a single girl does not want to talk to me.
