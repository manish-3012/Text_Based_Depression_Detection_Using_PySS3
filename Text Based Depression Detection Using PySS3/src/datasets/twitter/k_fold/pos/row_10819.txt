Valentines day Alright, so if you saw my previous post, I posted a picture from a photoshoot I did with a girl I have a crush on, I think if I still like her come valentines day, and she doesnâ€™t have a boyfriend, Im going to ask her to be my valentine (or gf) by saying this

Me- â€œhey remember that first photoshoot we did with the sheet, the ghost one?â€ 
Her - â€œyeah, whyâ€ 
me - â€œI was just wondering if you would be my boo againâ€ or something to that effect

Prolly gonna get high key rejected but it will be worth the try
