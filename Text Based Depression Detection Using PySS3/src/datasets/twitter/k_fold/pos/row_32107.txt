My ex got a girlfriend before I did So my (then) gf came out as pan and she wanted to split up. I understood and since we make competitions on everything we both agreed to see who can get a partner first. I thought I was in the lead because I have been talking to a girl for a while now. But she just texted me that she just got a gf. Damn....
