I didnâ€™t actually think Iâ€™d be this happy for a bit of time but here we are So basically I was having a bit of a rough time but then things decided to finally go right for me. I got an Apple Watch and then I had my first cross country meet (my goal was to beat just one person and I did it :D) then I made a Minecraft yt vid cause I was bored and someone actually commented on it and said they thought it was good. Anyways I just wanted to share cause it does get better guys, it might take a bit longer for other people or a shorter time for other people but just try and focus on the good stuff :)
