What hurts us the most? You face helplessness when you come to the reality that you are not in control of your own life or the events around you. Move through life in the most enjoyable way you can. No one should need to break their back in order to enjoy a simple moment of leisure. Meditation comes with practice and focus. You can not build muscle if you don't work out. I cannot sharpen my mind if I do not practice fluid thinking. These things can be solved over time.
