I want to cuddle with a girl. Not have sex, just cuddle. I just want to be in the company of someone who loves me, accepts me, and respects me. I want to hang out with someone who accepts me and doesn't care about my flaws, and looks at the positive side of me. I want to just lie there and cuddle with a girl I'm comfortable with, and who is comfortable with me. I'm probably going to get called a simp, but hey, this is really what I want.
