My Dad Wants To Install Family Monitoring Software On My Computer My dad asked me to join his "family" on this software. I did a little reading and found the software can do many things.

It can: limit screen time or time on certain applications. View screen time activity. View search and web history. Make purchases on my computer for me.

Some of this seems like too much. He has no reason not to trust me. I do well in school and work hard outside of school. When he gets this on my PC he will limit everything as much as he can. I know he has tried with apps he made which just broke..

I need advice. Do I accept this and be limited in screen time and lose all privacy? If I say no, how do I justify it? 

I'm pretty upset because I've worked hard in school and outside of school to make my dad proud and this makes me feel like he doesn't care.

Thanks.
