Anyone else absolutely hate doing integration and differentiation? I mean they're so unnecessarily complicated sometimes and because of my high expectations i've set for myself in math i hate not being able to do them

Differentiation is fine i guess (it still really gets on my nerves sometimes), but integration is just absolutely terrible i hate it
