I spent 300 hours coding a cleaner doc editor for my robotics team because we were all fed up with Google Doc's icky formatting. Nerdy folks on r/webdev found it neat. But the app is for you guys, so I hope you guys like it too. Take a look: [https://www.kilodoc.com/](https://www.kilodoc.com/)

A bunch of friends and even my parents said it couldn't be done. Maybe this'll prove them wrong. I stayed up late so many nights to make this project happen.

I really hope this gets some love from you all. It would be awesome if I had something to point to like the number of page visits or the number of accounts to prove to my friends/parents that I didn't just waste my entire summer. Plus, I would have an excuse to spend another 6 months working on this.

Basically, Iâ€™m trying to make the editor have just the right number of options so formatting doesn't feel like a constant worry, even when you're working with others. Please DM me or comment on this post if you have any questions. I'll try to respond quickly.

Hopefully, my server is beefy enough to not be overwhelmed with traffic.

Thanks everyone and good luck with school / college apps / whatever's happening in your life.
