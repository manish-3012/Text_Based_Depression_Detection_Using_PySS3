Iâ€™d kill to have just one more normal day of high school rant No masks, no zoom, not 6 feet apart

I miss accidentally bumping into people in the halls and being able to sit next to my friends. I miss seeing other peopleâ€™s faces. I miss that kid that used to buy 10 slices of pizza and gave them away. I miss sharing things. I miss the anxiety of being late to class. I miss having a crush on a senior as a junior. I miss 2020. I miss waking up at 5am and having 3 hours of sleep everyday. I miss having to wear our mass uniforms in 100Â°F weather. I miss holding hands during prayer. I miss playing games on my watch during apush. I miss beating everyone in kahoot. I miss the rush of being the first one done with the test. I miss hugging people. I miss all the little things, even the losers that made me want to drop out

I wish I was healthy junior year so I couldâ€™ve enjoyed it, cause I donâ€™t have a senior year. And prom, I really wish I could have gone to prom
