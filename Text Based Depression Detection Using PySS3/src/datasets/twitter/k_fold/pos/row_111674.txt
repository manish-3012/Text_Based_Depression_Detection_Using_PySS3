I feel really guilty I keep a lot of things about myself away from my parents which a lot of people do. My parents are EXTREMELY strict. Not the â€œmake sure you come back at 10 pmâ€ type but the type that has got to know who every single one of your friends are. They need to know what Iâ€™m doing at every second of the day and they monitor the things I say. Itâ€™s basically North Korea in here, send help. Uh so Iâ€™ve gotten around a lot of it bc obviously Iâ€™m posting on here but I still feel absolutely horrible about myself and Iâ€™m not even gonna try having a life until I move out
