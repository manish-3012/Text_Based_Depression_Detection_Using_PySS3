how do adults do adult things ? i want to vomit at the smell of beer, or any alcohol. Cigarettes have no good parts about them, why would u pick it up in the first place ?? How does one drink wine and how do you know the difference ?? How do you know which meat is best? How do you come up with recipes ? Why do half of them not fill out the census? or go vote? Why is anything new obsolete to them? Or too "hip"? and why is newer music, even if it's just something regular, so bad to listen to ? what's the fun in having kids? too many questions. I'm having a like quarter life crisis, IF i even live that long bc they don't know shit about maintaining a stable ecosystem or economy.
