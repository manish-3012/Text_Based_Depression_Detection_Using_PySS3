Youâ€™re in my dreams. ðŸ›ŒðŸ’­ðŸ’¤ Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone

Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will

There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in

Content with being blinded by rules and judgment

We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead

In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to

Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat

Not many people stood up against the system we all call life

But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice

A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time

A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest

This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself, but his dreams too





This is the story of the Man On The Moon
