I have no friends and it is truly destorying me This is a long story so I'll try and keep it brief. It is slowly approaching 2 months since a group of my friends decided to kick me from our group chat. "This happens to everyone" you might be thinking, well here is the kicker - this group chat was the only way I communicated with every one of my friends. Not only that, but I was one of the 4 founding members of this group chat years before any of these specific friends were invited. The reason for them getting the power to kick me is a very long story that no one needs to hear. To put it in a couple words why I was kicked - I have a sense of humor they don't agree with. Nothing too crazy just a few things they hated. The reason I am making this post is to mostly just get all of this off my chest as it has been absolutely destroying me not being able to talk to anyone for so long. This has absolutely enhanced both my anxiety and depression many times over. Also if any of you guys are somehow reading this - I am truly sorry for anything and everything I have done to hurt you. I hope we can be friends again. Thanks for reading my stupid rant &lt;3
