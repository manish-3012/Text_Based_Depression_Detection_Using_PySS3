Good teenagers, what are your favorite animated movies? (Not anime or Nightmare Before Christmas) What are your favorite animated movies? But:
1.) It has to be a movie you saw past 13 years old. No nostalgic lingering.
2.) No anime films, if i allowed it, thats all im going to hear, especially "Spirited Away".
3.) None of the recent creepy stopmotion movies in recent years, like coraline, boxtrolls, corpse bride, frankenweenie, and especially nightmare before christmas. That is also, is something that thats all im gonna hear if i allow it.
