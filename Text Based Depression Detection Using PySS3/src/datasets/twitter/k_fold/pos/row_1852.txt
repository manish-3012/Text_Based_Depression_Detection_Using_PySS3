Hi friends! Currently need advice with some emotional crisis, thanks in advance! Im a 16 year old male with a â€œproblemâ€, I think I have a broken heart! About a year ago I was in a kind of â€œrelationshipâ€ (we hold ands all the time, always be together, talk about intimate stuff), I believe that she had a crush on me at the time.

At the time I kind of step away that â€œrelationshipâ€ (so far one of my biggest regrets) and we got just friends, some time later I developed a crush on the same girl but now (as far as I know) she didnâ€™t feel the same.

In the present time she is my best friend and I am one her best friends, but the deal is, I still have feelings for her but for her we are only friends. 

As far as my knowledge is, my options are:
A) Move on and keep with our friendship (which I love)

B) have a talk with her and put out friendship at risk

What should I do?
