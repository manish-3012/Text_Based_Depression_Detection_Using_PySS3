I need to tell you something awesome that happened today. So me and mah friends were playing a game (not a video game but something you'd play outside) where you needed to collect certain things until the time is out and then we'd all go to a table and then there was a boss. So it works like this: the things we find have a "damage" value and how often it can be used. Using different items in certain a certain order would Increase the damage amount.
Then there is a person behind the table who takes a card from many, and looks how much "hp" and "boss damage" is on it. He can't tell the players of course. 
I won't explain it more because it's very complex and hard to explain so yeah here's the story.


So you can lose if you touch sun light before the time is out. Well I ducked up. If you ducked up, then you could still watch the other players but you need to go unnoticed.

So I spectated my crush and gave her hints to where she'd need to go for certain powerful items. Without her seeing or hearing me of course.
Then an idea came to my mind: there was an abandoned little hut in the near my spot, so I ran there and scribbled "I love you &lt;3" on the floor.
Then I lured her into that hut and because she assumed it was me (she spoke her thoughts out loud and probably saw me when accidentally touching the light), she said "I love you too!" And left a note to meet me later in this hut again.
The expression of hers and just everything made me feel so loved.









Well it was just a dream but damn, those emotions I had were so sick. I just want to meet her in my dreams again.
