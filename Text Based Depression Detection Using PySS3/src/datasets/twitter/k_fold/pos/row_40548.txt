My Time Has Come Gentlemen and Ladies, my time has come, my 20th birthday has come and gone and Iâ€™m no longer a teenager. I must be exiled.

This group has provided me with many laughs over the last 3/4 years, and I thank each and every one of you. 

I still feel mentally 16, as if i havenâ€™t aged since then, yet here I am and having my quarter life crisis over the fact iâ€™m 20 and almost finished college. What is life? Why must we age? God knows, all I know is it doesnâ€™t feel right, and the time for me to be expected to be an adult is here, I still have no idea whatâ€™s going on half the time, but nevertheless, thank you all, youâ€™re good lads, enjoy your teenage years and donâ€™t grow up too fast, yada yada.

I just wanna go back to when I was 15 again.
