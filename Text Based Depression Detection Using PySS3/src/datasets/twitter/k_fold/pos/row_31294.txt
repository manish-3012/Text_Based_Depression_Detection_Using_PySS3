I took my covid test today and it was very chaotic for me The night before Iâ€™m like should I eat a full box of pasta PLUS a sugary drink? Of course I did!

And the thing is, I have sugar sensitivity apparently &amp; I forget about it so when I woke up my colon practically hated me and I had my test in a few hours and time was like cutting short 

I had to miss my original appointment bc I was still feeling crappy but then I bit the bullet and took it later bc they were nice enough to

The actual test was okay, it was just uncomfortable and felt like they stuffed a little bit of carpet up my nose but it was done eventually
