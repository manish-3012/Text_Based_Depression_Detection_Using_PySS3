I don't hate people that are racist I hate racism but hating people for their (wrong) opinions won't help anyone
It will push them into a corner and only make them more extreme
We should try to get people out of being racist not hate on them

Not being nice to people we disagree with(fundamentally) will only cause them to become deviant and will make it harder to confince them not be racist

I also dislike people putting such high emphasis on not using the N word (except for parents/ idols)
Instead of focusing on such irrelevancies as words we should focus on taking action against racist
The n word isn't a nice word but I'd rather be called ten times a N****** then being beaten up
I feel that many people that put a great emphasis on not using the N Word would  not step / call the police in when they see a black person being beaten up
