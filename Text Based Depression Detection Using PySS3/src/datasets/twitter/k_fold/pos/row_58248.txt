Whats wrong with horror movies now? PT. 1 Aight, its getting too damn generic now, family, haunted house, spooky ghost, jumpscare, jumpscare. Jeez. Ok. Im gonna talk about four horror classics and analyze what I think are the scariest scenes from thise four movies. 

Im gonna start with Poltergeist (1982) and you might think of that TV scene, which, is arguably amazing, but would been so much better without the generic 80's adventure music blasting. But im not talking about the tv, no no no, im talking about the motherfucking clown. Its dead silent as the kid looks around for the clown, increasing the tension, and yea theres a 'oh its right behind you' clichÃ©, but its cuts to the little girl, waking up, realizing "aw shit somethings going down" then cut we back to the kid, who slowly getting pulled the under the bed. *Slowly*. And we dont see the clown doll anymore. Thats why the scene is so good. Its not "jumpscare, scary thing gone" in a matter of seconds. You have to *wait* this shit out, seeing this kid flailing around desprately, and all you can do is watch it happen. Thats how you scare the shit back into the audience in the matter of ten seconds. And its so realistic in its simplicity as well. No CGI, whatsoever.
