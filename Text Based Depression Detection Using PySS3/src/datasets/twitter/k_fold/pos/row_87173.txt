its 1sm in my timzone and o did a poerty (pwee h0lp me) I wake up too early,
No breakfast for me.
The road to school
Laced with the sharp morning air

I step into the prison.
We greet our wardens
Wishing them a good mourning,
Waiting for it to end.

Though we are back home,
We get no rest.
The stacks of papers fail to shrink
While our sight dims.

When we awaken,
We brace for the pain.
The monotony of school
Back at it again.
