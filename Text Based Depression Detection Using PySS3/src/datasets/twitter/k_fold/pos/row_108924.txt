Hi childhood friend if you are on Reddit Hey, childhood friend if you are reading this.

I havenâ€™t seen you around in a while. We hung out all the time when we were little until we had a fight, and never played again. I was friends with your little sister after that, and you always tormented me when I was playing at your house. Once your sister told me that you were writing me a love letter, and I was so happy, I had a crush on you for a while. Eventually she told me that you had gotten over me, and to this day I donâ€™t know if she was lying or telling the truth about you having a crush, me and her have drifted away now, so I donâ€™t get to see you anymore, even though we live next door. I heard gossip around the neighborhood, that there was some family drama, and now I hear that your family is doing something in your garage like a store or something? All I am saying is that Iâ€™ve missed you and I guess I still have a crush on you a bit. I hope your ok.
