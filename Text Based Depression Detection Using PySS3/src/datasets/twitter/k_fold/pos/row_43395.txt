Pissed off at the size of Sonic's chicken sandwich Sonic is an American fast food chain that I usually get drinks from but nothing else. Today I was feeling adventurous, was about to put my dick somewhere no cock has been before; actually order a meal from Sonic. I settled on something basic, something has simple ingredients but tastes good and is nearly impossible to fuck up, a chicken sandwich. However, in a twist of fate, in a perfect demonstration of what true American Exceptionalism means: *dey fucced it up*. Shit was fucking ***TINY***. Half an inch tall and fit in the palm of my hand, a friend embarked on this experiment with me and ordered a burger which was about four times as big as what I got. That was not a meal fit for a man, not a meal fit for a child, not a meal fit for a victim of starvation because the shit wasn't evan a fucking meal. Still, I was not dignified enough to let the antwich go to waste and ate it all in two fairly average bites that would've looked like a scene from Attack on Titan if it was scaled up to a normal sized sandwich. Overall, the conclusion I came to on this experiment is that if you order anything that isn't a drink from Sonic then you're a demented psychopath who should be locked away in Greendale Asylum.
