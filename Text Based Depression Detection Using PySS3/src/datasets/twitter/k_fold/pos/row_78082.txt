Holy shit I actually got a girlfriend So Iâ€™ve been single my whole life. I donâ€™t know how it happened, but a girl actually wants to date me. The girl is my crush of a couple years, and I havenâ€™t told her until now. When she texted back, she said that she felt the same way. So needless to say, Iâ€™m immensely happy right now.
