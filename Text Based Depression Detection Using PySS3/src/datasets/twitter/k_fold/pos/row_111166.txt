I know Greek mythology doesn't really have an offical timeline and shit but hear what I have to say. If my faulty memory is correct then all of the famous Greek heroes existed before or during the Trojan War. Which means that the most recent Greek hero is Odysseus.

There's a 99% chance of me being completely wrong about this since I'm relying purely on memory but fuck it.
