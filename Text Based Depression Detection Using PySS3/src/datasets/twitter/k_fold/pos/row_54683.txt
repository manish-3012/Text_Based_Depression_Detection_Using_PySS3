How to ask ur crush out Ok guys and girls, Iâ€™ve had some friends ask me how to ask people out, and here is my response,

First, have a phone that can record.
Second, press record on the phone.
Third, tuck it in ur pocket while itâ€™s recording,
Fourth, Ask her/him out.
Hereâ€™s the thing, if she/he says yes, you donâ€™t pull out ur phone till he/she leaves. But other than that, congrats :D.

If she/he says no, pull out your phone and say it was a prank and youâ€™ve been going around doing that to random people,
This is how I got my first gf lol. Hope it helps :D.
