I switched my cats' bowls and they didn't care, but my mom is going off ðŸ¤¨ The cat bowls are pink for the female cat Dollarama, and blue for the male cat George Bush, but I switched them because I mixed up the amounts. 

Now my mom accusing me of turning the cats gay because I gave George Bush a pink bowl and Dollarama a blue bowl. The cats obvi don't care. Like damn *you didn't know the cats were already gay smh* ðŸ¤§ðŸ¤§ðŸ³ï¸â€ðŸŒˆ
