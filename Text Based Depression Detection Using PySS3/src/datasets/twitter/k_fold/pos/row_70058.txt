I hate how my ex is sometimes She's my friend and I care alot about her and we've both gone through drug problems in sophomore year and tonight she told me how she's wanting to try real hard shit and get back into drugs since we both quit 

I know there's no stopping her if she really really wants it so I'm offering to be there and do it with her so I know she's safe I feel this is a better solution than just letting her do it and her risk a OD by herself at least if Im there I'll be there (especially since I have more experience with harder shit than her)
