Catholicism is the strangest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen... Apparently Anyone can baptize. Baptism removes all sin, including original sin. Only priests can give confession. Confession removes all sins. You can only be baptized once. You're better off being unbaptized because anyone can baptize you then having to rely on a priest to give confession or last rites. Catholicism is such a joke lol.
