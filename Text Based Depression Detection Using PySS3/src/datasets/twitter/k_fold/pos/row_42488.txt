So yeah I got no sleep. Wish me luck. I woke up at 5am yesterday to get ready for school right then went throughout my day and I haven't gone to sleep since. Now I am sitting in my second period waiting for third to start since we only have two minutes left. (I am a highschool senior with seven classes that are all Ap and college level courses). I have to go through the whole day do all my work, I have a project due in 6th period, two quizzes i have to make up for AP Statistics, and have three tests today (one for AP Psychology, one for AP Macroeconomics, and I have to make up a test for Spanish II). After school I have to work until ten and once I get off I have whatever homework I have from today along with the classwork I am unable to finish followed by the rough draft for my senior essay. Once i have finished that homework I still have about nine worksheets that I have to make up from missing all of last week after I got my wisdom teeth removed which all have to be turned in by tomorrow. If at all possible I would also like to study for my AP Environmental Science test which I take tomorrow. With me having to work until ten followed by all that homework and makeup work, I probably wont finish until around two or three in the morning only to have to wake up at five the next morning to get ready for school once again, so that means I will probably have a maximum of two hours of sleep depending on whether I'm actually able to sleep tonight. Oh and to make this even more of a challenge not only will I be doing this with no sleep making it hard to think straight, but I also have really bad ADHD and ADD making it extremely difficult to sit still and focus for extended periods of time. So yeah today is going to be fun.
