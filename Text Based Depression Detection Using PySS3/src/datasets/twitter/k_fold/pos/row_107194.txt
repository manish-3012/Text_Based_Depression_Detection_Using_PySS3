Why does everyone like light pink clothes? I donâ€™t understand this. I donâ€™t think it looks good, it probably stains easily, itâ€™s generally so minimalist that itâ€™s just a pink sweatshirt and itâ€™s everywhere for some reason. Any time I go to any youtuberâ€™s merch store itâ€™s always like half light pink. I donâ€™t understand the appeal of it. 

This goes for more than just pink, itâ€™s just the most prevalent sweet-tart color Iâ€™ve seen in clothing.
