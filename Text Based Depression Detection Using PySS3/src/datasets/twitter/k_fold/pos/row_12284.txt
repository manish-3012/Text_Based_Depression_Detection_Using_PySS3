My sister is kinda stupid. So I couldnt find my wireless headphones, so like any sane person, I try to find them. I think I last saw them in my sisters room, so I search there first.


As I walk into my sister's room (10) I get greeted with a nice "Fvck you". I'm not surprised, she's always like this. I tell her that my headphones are probably in her room and she should stop insulting me.


Like the brat she is, she doesn't accept that someone told her not to do something, and insults me again. Oh boy she got angry when I ignored her. She grabbed a book and yeeted it at me. Nice.

Of course, she misses. As we would say in Germany: GroÃŸe fresse, nix dahinter.

German lesson over.


Well the next thing that happens is just plain funny.
She hits her 200 euro monitor. Bruh
She screams for her mommy, as brats do, and tells her I walked into the room and threw a book at her monitor. Thankfully I can't lie for shit, and she believed me. 


I'm not happy about it...

Wait I am. The brat got what she deserved. Nice
