My 22 year old sister genuinely believes she has magic powers, help I guess ? She actually thinks that she can speak to the dead, 

Thinks she has healing powers for both physical and mental illness. 

She is brain washing my mother into going down the same path, which Iâ€™m worried about as I donâ€™t want my mom getting hurt from it 

Idk what to do, Iâ€™m pretty sure she does some form of drugs. Not the usual, but she always burns these weird sticks coated in oils she ships from costa rika
