Iâ€™m really upset Me and one of my best friends had an argument. I started it but she overreacted a lot and made me seem like a horrible person. She ruined my day yesterday so I texted her a message saying my side of the argument and we can apologise to each other on Monday. 

In my message I mentioned that sometimes it can be toxic, and then she said that she felt like she couldnâ€™t be herself around me. And that our friendship is most definitely toxic. I donâ€™t know it sounded like she was happy with letting our best friendship just turn to friendship. 

I didnâ€™t mean it like that and when I asked if we could both apologise she said â€œidkâ€. She hurt me and made me cry and ruined my day, I understand that I started the argument but I shouldnâ€™t get that response. Iâ€™m still blocked and she is leaving me on read and wonâ€™t answer any of my questions. I know she is upset but she is not even explaining herself and doesnâ€™t want to recognise Iâ€™m not entirely in the wrong. 

Is she a true friend or is this normal? How do I get her to answer my questions?
