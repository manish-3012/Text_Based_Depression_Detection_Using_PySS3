What the heck So my SO (theyâ€™re non binary and I will hence refer to them as my theydy friend) identified as a lesbian up until now where she is identifying as a dyke. Itâ€™s kinda a complicated word if you know much about it and itâ€™s strange and tough and I donâ€™t know how to feel.

(Iâ€™m almost sixteen btw my flair has been stuck)
