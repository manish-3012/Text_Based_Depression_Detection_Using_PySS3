Was talking to her last evening and its a relaxed feeling knowing everything is okay Yeah crush type things long story 4 years me simping we had some trouble etc

So the result is that she doesnt want me to apologise again since she forgot everything that happened during our fights, i did ask her to just leave the time i liked her behind. She doesnt want to forget and act like i never liked her, we are not really friends now but she said that shes open for it but does need to think about it. Also she said she will be kind for me
