I had a good run I guess My previous semester in school was easily my favorite one. For some stupid reason I thought that that was going to be what the rest of the year would be like. But, new semester started today and it hit me like a ton of bricks, this is gonna be a sucky last 2 and a half months of school. I had all these uppity, energetic, entertaining teachers and all of my friends were in my classes, and now I have one class with friends, and most of my teacherâ€™s personalities are equal to the color gray. Not to mention that my new art teacher is grading us on our ability to draw, so an automatic fail for me
