coming out is not simple so basically i found out i came out to people when i was black out drunk during new yearâ€™s eve last year. how did i find that out ? because i came out to them (again) while i was feeling confident while being drunk !!!

you know saying â€œwe knowâ€ after coming out is not supportive at all. at least not to me because now all i can think about is how many other people know. iâ€™m still not completely sure what i am so i donâ€™t feel like bringing up the topic of my sexuality and asking what exactly happened last year. 

but how could you keep something from me like this. like i would understand it if they did it to let me come out when iâ€™m actually ready but saying â€œwe knowâ€ just totally ruins it
