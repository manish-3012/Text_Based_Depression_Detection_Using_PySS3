I Am Making Changes I feel good. Better than Iâ€™ve felt in months. I decided to start working out because Iâ€™m tired of feeling sad about other things that have happened in my life. I have decided to make healthy changes in order to make myself better. Tonight, I just did 1000 arm curls (light weights) and 50 push ups!

To all of you fellow teens, do what you can to make yourself better. It helps both mentally and physically.

Good luck!
