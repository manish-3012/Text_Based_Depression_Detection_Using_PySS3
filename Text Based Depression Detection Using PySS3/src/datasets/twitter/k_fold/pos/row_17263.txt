this girl I'm having a thing with is mad at me and I dont know why. so me and this girl are kind of a couple but it's not official because I want to ask her in person and she lives in a different place than I do. 

so basically I was getting sentimental and I thanked her for choosing to be loyal to me even though we arent official so she technically doesnt have to. she said something like "oh? then maybe I shouldn't be"
and I said something like "no I dont want you to stop" while laughing a little because I thought she said that as a joke. then she said something  like "then stop talking about it" in a very annoyed tone. I asked her what whas making her upset, she hung up on me and told me to leave her alone or she will block me. does anyone know why she could be upset and what I should do?
