My girlfriend is always hurt/upset with me So me and her have been dating since March (around the beginning of quarantine where I live) and things were really fun and exciting at first. I still love her just the same but Iâ€™m so exhausted because thereâ€™s always something that has hurt her. Whenever we get past one problem, thereâ€™s another one and it seems like thereâ€™s no end to it. 

She doesnâ€™t notice all of the caring gestures and things I do for her, and if she does then my mistakes mean more to her. She wants me to always verbalize my emotions towards her or else she doesnâ€™t feel appreciated or cared for. Iâ€™ve never cheated, lied or done anything to intentionally hurt her. She knows this yet she still gets so insecure around me and doesnâ€™t trust me. I tell her that her feelings are valid because they are, but even though she feels so strongly about these things, a lot of the time itâ€™s not even something I would normally consider an issue.

I apologize and try my best to make up for wrong things Iâ€™ve said or for not being as responsive as I used to be, and I still continue to show my love and care for her even if itâ€™s not entirely verbal. She doesnâ€™t really care and gets upset or hurt by things weâ€™ve already discussed.. she takes out her frustration with her family out on me sometimes too and will go dry in text and sometimes wonâ€™t say â€œI love youâ€ back.

Itâ€™s really making me sad because this is the girl I wanted to marry and grow old with, and I still do want all of that. Itâ€™s just that she apologizes for things and then continues to do them. I feel under-appreciated and disrespected a lot by her actions and words sometimes, and so I get defensive even when we donâ€™t argue (which I regret). Iâ€™m trying to open up to her after a long period of depression, and even tho I told her about these feelings she didnâ€™t support me very much through it and instead took it personally.

I donâ€™t want to break up with her, I donâ€™t want to lose her. This is just so much for me and my heart and I always feel like the bad guy :( I just want to be happy with her and I canâ€™t change my past. I canâ€™t control my depressive episodes and Iâ€™m doing my best, it just isnâ€™t enough and I even sometimes get compared to others..

What do you guys think? Iâ€™m so lost and idk if Iâ€™m wrong for going through sm in my head
