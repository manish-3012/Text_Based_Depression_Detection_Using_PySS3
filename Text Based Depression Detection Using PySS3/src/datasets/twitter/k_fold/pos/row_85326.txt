Itâ€™s 12am, the happy birthday song has been playing on repeat for more than 24 hours and canâ€™t be stopped So this is what happened. A bit more than a day ago, it was my dadâ€™s and brotherâ€™s birthday and so some of my dadâ€™s friends came by to celebrate. Itâ€™s late in the afternoon, here comes the small cake they gave us. One of the friends brings out this flower candle, starts off as a blossom but blooms into a flower once all the candles are lit. It plays the happy birthday tune too. So the candle is lit, everyone sings happy birthday. My dad cuts the cake as the candle is set aside. After weâ€™ve had cake, everyone notices the candle is still going with its song on repeat. 

Nearly everyone attempts to stop it, trying to find a switch. Turns out there isnâ€™t a switch whatsoever. So we left it in another room. Itâ€™s been playing for concerning long time and is still going strong. The only method we have to stop it is to destroy it but that just seems too reckless plus I could never bring myself to it as it became our gift after the realisation it wouldnâ€™t stop. 

So Iâ€™m writing this as I hear the awful high pitched beeps of the tune on repeat, never knowing when itâ€™ll actually stop.
