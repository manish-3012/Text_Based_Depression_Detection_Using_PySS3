Why do guys take so long to respond to texts? Ok so there is this guy that I like, and weâ€™ve been talking on Snapchat for about 3 months now.
He thinks Iâ€™m â€˜cuteâ€™, but it takes like 12 hours or even days for him to respond to my texts...we both kinda like each other though..uhm idk why it takes guys so long to respond to texts.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸ˜³

Edit: He also looks at my story, but doesnâ€™t respond to my texts...maybe heâ€™s just nervous?
