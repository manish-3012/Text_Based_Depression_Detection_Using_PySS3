Am I a simp Hey fellow teenagers! So Iâ€™ve got something I want to get your opinion on. Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl and sheâ€™s great and we used to talk all the time but after we spent a week on vacation together we kinda lost our spark for a bit. She will still talk to me and still we can have good conversations but i always have to text her first. Sheâ€™s always on my mind and I always want to talk to her but should i always text her first? Am I doing something wrong? Should I just wait for her to text me? Iâ€™m just not sure what to do. If you have experience in this area: Please help!
