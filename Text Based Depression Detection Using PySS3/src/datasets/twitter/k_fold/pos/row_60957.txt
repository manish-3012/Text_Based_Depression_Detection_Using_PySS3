A rant about air fryers A rant about air fryers

A toaster is half the price, and has a completely different function. You can get the same effect as an air fryer with the oven you already have for a 5$ tray with half the upkeep.

Your air fryer is stupid, and you're stupid for thinking it was a justifiable purchase. The only excuse for having an air fryer is that someone gifted it to you, and after you cut them out of your life forever you couldn't find a pawn shop that would take it, and when you tried to throw it out in the dumpster the city fined you for dumping such an eyesore, and after you were court ordered to keep it in your home where no human being would ever see it again(because nobody who is associated with you can be considered "human").  You tried to fight the court order in a legal battle, but the public defender argued against you because after representing serial killers, child rapists, and war criminals he couldn't bring himself to represent someone so detestable as to own an air fryer. With all of that, I couldn't forgive you for owning an air fryer, but I would understand, in the same way you understand why Mao Zedong made the great leap forward which killed upwards of 40 million people. The fact that you argue in favor of it is so disgusting you should be stripped of all human rights, bound and thrown off of a boat in the middle of the arctic ocean tied to that worthless waste of metal and engineering so that it can drag you to the watery grave you deserve. I fucking hate you.
