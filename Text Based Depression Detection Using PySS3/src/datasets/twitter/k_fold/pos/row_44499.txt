Anyone else annoyed with the people saying that they wish they were never born in this generation? Hear me out here, you could have it a lot worse. You could have been born before modern medicine and died of polio or some shit that doesnâ€™t matter exist anymore. You could have been born in the 50â€™s and drafted into Vietnam and gotten killed by some dude in a tree with a Dragonov. You could have been born when the Black Death was around and died a horrible death. You could have been drafted into WW1 and got mustard gassed by the Germans. Sorry for the long rant but believe it or not you have it pretty good to the point where you can complain about the year you were born on the internet from your couch. And guess whatâ€™s even better? You probably wonâ€™t die from the Rona because itâ€™s mainly deadly to old people, unless you have a medical condition.
