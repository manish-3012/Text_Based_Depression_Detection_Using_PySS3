Carrying too much about what people think about me So its probably not a good subreddit to ask for some social advice but ill try anyways soo

so im 15 and i 3 years ago i moved to another country at first it was pretty ok cause i had a couple of friends that spoke my language but when i went to another school i couldnt find anyone and i really closed myself up cause when i was in my homeland i was a really social kid with a lot of friends but rn im the quiet kid in the corner with no friends and i know that its not anything bad but im constantly thing someone is talking behind my back about me or something like that And i cant really speak the language they speak in this country im trying my best but sometimes even when im almost 100% sure i said it good there are thoughts that they may laugh my accent out or something so ye depressed 15 yo searching for help
