So my dad found out about my first (two) hickeys before I did... And I'm currently stuck in a car with him for 3 to 4 hours... it's kinda awkward but he seems cool with it. Thing is I'm in the car to visit my mom, and as a mommas boy I'm still here "little baby" and theres no way in hell I can really hide it... yay :)
