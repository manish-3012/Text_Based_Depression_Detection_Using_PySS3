Start Today with what You Love (137) We all have many things that we love, in our own way. We have passions we want to focus on, things we want to try, goals we want to accomplish, but then **we get scared &amp; sometimes shy away? Why is that? Divine timing &amp; insecurity.** 

**We are all insecure with something.** It is all valid. When we make peace with these insecurities by even acknowledging them and allowing ourselves to feel it, thats when we can begin to untangle the tension, stress, anxiety, depression etc., that we have fed into for such a long time, or has been projected onto us. **We learn, we grow and together we thrive.** 

Through the past several years I have really begun to connect with the Universe and with the Divine that we are all connected by. Now what you believe in is up to you to decide, **God,** **Source, the Universe, Divine etc., we are all connected.** 

Allow yourself to be present with the emotions of life. The ups, the downs and everything in between, we learn, grow and heal through the **Wave Learning Growth Theory.** 

**I love you.**
