Pandemics are god angered by the way humans are treating earth and other animals And we are not learning anything from it

We are killing our own homes, we are killing our own future generations 

Please use less plastic, use biodegradable materials, use less cars reduce carbon emissions, use your fuckinf legs if u have them, kill animals with less pain and stop torturing animals in tiny cage.

We build our own future. If we don't take care of the earth, the future is darker than vantablack. Stop trying to find convenience and look at the world in a greater scale. Altho plastic uses are convenient its harming our home in a rapid pace.
