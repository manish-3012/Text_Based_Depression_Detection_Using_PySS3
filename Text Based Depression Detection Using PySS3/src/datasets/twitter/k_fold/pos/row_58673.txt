I hate how depression has become part of my personality Its fucking annoying. Like yeah, I have a personality besides that, I have friends that I hang out with on a daily basis. But that bitchass depression always comes in halfway through like "yo we sad now lmao", like ok cool thanks I was enjoying myself but sure. If Im not in VC with friends, Im numb or sad, usually numb. I just dont feel anything toward anyone.

friends involved in drama? dont give a fuck.  


beirut explosion? damn. rough.  


another mass shooting? gettin kinda old.  


another riot? neat.  


you lost something you loved? tough.  


family ran over an animal? sucks.  


  
I just dont care anymore. only my friends matter and most of the time my responses are based on what I know I should say instead of what I wanna say. usually I wanna say some fucked up joke, and then I feel like a class A piece of shit. my instinct is to make jokes of tragedies and horrible stuff going on plus the desensitization to anything related to self-harm, depression, suicide, etc.

It just sucks. I'm so used to it all and its fucked me up in a different way. I dont have PTSD or some shit, but its fucked me up in a way where it doesn't phase me, where it doesn't matter to me. You're suicidal? huh, I've heard this sob story 10 times before.

Idk, I just feel like a piece of shit.
