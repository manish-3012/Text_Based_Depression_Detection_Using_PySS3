Memes are so damn powerful Memes are so powerful, and we often don't realise it. Memes put a smile on people's faces, make them laugh, and can brighten up a dull day. Even the ones which are controversial are kinda funny. They make me smile. That is the power of memes. Any thoughts? (Haha please be nice)
