Why is girl behavior so weird? So a little over a week ago I asked out my crush and she said yes. I asked her something like did she want to grab a coffee after finals were over or something. I was extremely excited that she said yes and all that. Then, a little bit later I asked her what day she was free and she said that she'd have to check her cheer practice schedule for winter break and that she'd get back to me. I was like, ight sounds good. Then, for a week, she literally hardly acknowledged that I existed. I tried to talk to her. Nothing. Half the time she'd barely look at me. The last day of finals was this last friday and I tried talking to her twice and got nothing in response. One of my friends is telling me to have hope, another is saying that shes just playing with me, and another just said "F", saluted me, and talked away. I really just dont understand anything. Like, why would she say yes to a date and then just not talk to me. We have a class together, so it's not like shes trying to ghost me, I dont think? And we are friends, so like, she could easily just tell me shes not interested in me if that's the case and I would understand it. I just dont understand her behavior at all.
