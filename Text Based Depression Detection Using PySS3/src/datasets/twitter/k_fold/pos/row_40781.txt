Can there PLEASE just be a day where people get to relax? Everyone always talks about how you gotta be careful not to "bring work home with you" and that days where you don't work are required for a decent mental state, so why does my school give homework relative to the number of days we have off? Why more work on weekends than week days? Why more homework over breaks than weekends? Why does adult mental health matter but not student? 

If you take a single non-school day off from doing homework at my school you'll either need to pull an all nighter or take a week or so to catch up. They don't even allow you to take holidays or sick days without daily homework. 

I was BEDRIDDEN and couldn't eat for a week and they still made me create and present a ppt, do 4 tests, and the same homework as everyone else. 

(For the record, I knew what I was signing up for when I went to a prep school, but it's still frustrating)
