Snapchat has a weird â€œnavigation barâ€ and I need help making it go away. So I opened Snapchat randomly today and there was a weird black bar or â€œnavigation barâ€ on the bottom. Itâ€™s super glitchy and horrible and I want it gone. No videos or anything seem to be able to help me. Theyâ€™re all for Android and I have an iPhone XR. Please help me get it to go away, thank you.
