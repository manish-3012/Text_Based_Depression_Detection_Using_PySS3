Cuphead sucks. Cuphead is THE worst game I have ever played, it's so unoriginal and copies so many cartoons, it is also the most bullshit game ever oh you just got past the second phase? well here's another phase that's infinitely harder and why is it that every boss takes more than a minute of constant attacking but we die in like two hits? and also why are we at a casino run by the devil himself? when am I ever gonna beat up a giant dice just because I suck at poker? also the BIGGEST problem is how you move, every hard game is supposed to have bad controls but this game has easy controls. and that's a scam!!!!! /s
