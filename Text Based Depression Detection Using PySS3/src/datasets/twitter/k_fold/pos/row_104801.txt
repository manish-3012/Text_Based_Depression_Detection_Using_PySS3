I found a toxic player in among us for the first time!!! Yeah I was just playing the game right, and she kept on blaming random people and saying shit like "It's green! he vented!" and stuff like that. but every time, she was wrong. We were thinking of voting her out for repeatedly pressing the emergency meeting button and being wrong all the time, but then she started making excuses like:

"I'm a girl, you can't vote me out"

"you're being sexist if you vote me out"

"It's black! he's not saying anything!"

"guy's I'm telling you it's black!!"

Now obviously we didn't listen to her, because she was just being a dick at that point. So we voted her out, and we lost to red and cyan.

Then, in the lobby, she started telling everyone that she "told us it was red, but we were too stupid to listen to her, and boys are dumb" But she literally never blamed red for the whole round.

I kinda felt bad that we had to kick her out of the lobby because I wanted to hear more of her dumb bullshit.

Sorry for the "rant" I just needed to tell this story since it was stuck in my head.
