Looks or Confidence: Which is Better? You have person A who is a good looking person. They're very attractive BUT they lack confidence. They're extremely shy and soft-spoken. 

On the other hand, you have person B who is very confident. They're very prideful of themselves and speaks their mind. However, they're not exactly the best-looking person out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say **looks**. Here's why:

\- Better potential in the long run

\- Confidence easier to work on than looks

\--&gt; Yes, style but facial ugliness, $$$ for plastic surgery

\--&gt; Counter: Girls wear makeup

\- Looks bring people in the first place

\--&gt; Looks make it easy to approach them, ugliness, no one approaches you

BUT, regardless of what I say about ugliness, attractiveness is **subjective**, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you could have either looks or confidence, which is better?
