My dad tested positive for COVID-19 My dad got COVID. He was exposed and coughing around me but he still sent me to my moms house know everyone there might get it. My mom is a physical therapist and works with old people. He didnâ€™t even send me back as soon has he started coughing. Iâ€™m pissed at him. My mom and everyone at her house is going to hate me and want me dead because Iâ€™m going to get COVID and give it to them
