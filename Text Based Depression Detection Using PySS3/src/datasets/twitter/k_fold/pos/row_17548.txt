Iâ€™m lonely and feel like nobody around me understands the severity of my situation. Suicide is on my mind nearly everyday and everyone thinks itâ€™s a joke or not a serious issue. What a joke, this is why they say, â€œthey only care when you dieâ€ for a reason. Hate everybody and life itself, erase me from existence.
