I Think This Qualifies as a Rant Maybe..? Ok I'm a 13 year old female and I'm getting like really fed up with my past. So when I was in 5th grade one of my close guy friends choked me and then another guy in my class that already was on probation for nearly killing his cousin tried to grope me. And now, 3 years later, and my now ex boyfriend kisses me after two months of being together without consent. I can't seem to move past it. It influences my trust and Im so SICK of it controlling me. I'm talking (acquaintance) to a guy I go to school with and even though I know that would never happen again, especially from him, I can't help but think about it. Now I'm beginning to have even just a measly crush and it terrifies me. Anybody on here that has been through something similar have any advice on how to move forward?
