I wrote a short story and would like your opinions on it Blackness trickles down the walls and spills over the rug. The quickened pitter-patter of my heart aches throughout my heavy body; struggling to compensate, my lungs follow their familiar pattern, yet more exaggerated. The sensation was of concrete across my chest; weakening my bones and teasing them to break. But oh how my thoughts race! The joys of comfort I long for. Where have you gone my sweet love? Blood. Blood puddles spread through the cracks on the tiled floor. Glazed eyes gaze eternally at the mildewed shower wall and faded curtains. My security weakened, cold greets my feet. Over the obscure path I make my way to the light seeping through from under the door. I knock. â€œAre you alright?â€ I ask her. â€œOh yes! Iâ€™ll be out soon!â€ Relief. My shoulders slide down into the usual position as I- stop. Stop. Stop. I feel as if my flesh must be torn. My head droops as I stare at the never ending void. â€œI must be free. Wonâ€™t you free me? Let the pain flow and screams burst? Free me. Stop. Free me. Stop. Stop. Stop.â€ Relief. My shoulders slink down and I make my back to bed. A bottle rolls across the floor after my weak foot pushed it. The vision of my partner and I dancing around the room resurfaced. The moon smiled down on us as lust thickened in the air. The bed creaks as I sit down. Outside the window, few cars can be seen daring the night roads as snow glides to cover the cold, dead grass. The city is mostly dead at this hour, except for the unfortunate souls slaving away to provide us with our needs and keep us from the burdens they face. Soft hands drag down along my spine. I can rest easy now that my dear wife has returned to bed- No. No. No. Blood trickles down and covers all. Sorrowful ribs stick out to greet the filthy mirror. Vomit meets the yellow sink. Oh how I long for the pain of my own torture! My own demise as sweet as midnight roses in a lonesome garden. Oh lord! Free me from my suffering! -
My wife sleeps as I am eaten by my own wolves: my thoughts, my pain, my own beloved destruction. My feet once again meet the floor, they carry me to the dark hallway where I dance with my shadow and kiss the steel of a passionate blade. Oh the relief you could give me, sweet sharpness! But oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! My torment must continue on. For my sweet darling must not suffer of my fate! I would be lucky dead so as to not see her riving from pain. The price I pay now is not greater than the one she would be burdened with. My love for her is enough to rip my being apart, yet my reasons to live can be counted on one finger. My dear! My love! My pain! My joy! My comfort! Oh! Oh! Oh! How I wish to be normal once more! -
The clock ticks on as time runs, I return to bed and life carries on.
