How has your school experience with lockdown and COVID been? As March is approaching the realization that in about two weeks I will have achieved one full year of lockdown. I live in a third world country that was hit hard by COVID and frankly isn't gonna get better this year. Last year March the government temporarily shut down school as cases started popping up. So far, no schools in the city I live have resumed classes on campus. I have not seen my IRL friends since that day of school. As a lot of people have been experiencing, lack of motivation or even the desire to exist constantly building up and with the increasing pressure of college the stress load is quite high. I remember remarking that "Online school will be so easy, it'd be hard to do poorly". As fate may have it, the exact opposite turned out, for me and some of my classmates. How have your experiences been, are you back in class? Still online? Have you gotten the chance to see your friends?

tl;dr: About to hit one year of online school and lockdown. School pressure sucks. Does it suck for you?
