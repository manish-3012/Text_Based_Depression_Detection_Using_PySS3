I lost my sense of taste and smell No I donâ€™t have the corona virus but I caught the flu 3 weeks ago Iâ€™m feeling great btw anyways itâ€™s annoying not being able to smell and taste but hey if Iâ€™m in a smelly bathroom I wonâ€™t have to smell shit! Yay but not being able to taste food is sad asf I can taste stuff with a strong flavor like salt sugar and spicy stuff but itâ€™s very depressing
