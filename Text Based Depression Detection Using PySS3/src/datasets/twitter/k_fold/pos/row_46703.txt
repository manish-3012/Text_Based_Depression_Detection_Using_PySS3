wtf was Music (the Sia movie) How the hell are you going to make a movie for autistic people &amp; do whatever that disaster was??? Like bro my autistic ass could not process that shit. Quite literally offensive lol, the lighting and the colors fucked with sensory issues major time.

I'm so late to watching it but I still wish I never watched it. The representation was so bad that it really should be considered comedy. - It's like she went to the Autism Speaks site to get an idea of the character.

In the movie they actually restrained the main character, bro. **When we have meltdowns restraining us is the literally worst thing you can do.** How did she not know that?? RIP Maddie-
