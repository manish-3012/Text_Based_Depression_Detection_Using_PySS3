I cannot escape tik tok. I have to deal with it all day. I am officially sick of tik tok. At first in 2019 I had no problem with it. But know it just has ruined so many things. There were a lot of songs I used to like but then boom! Tik tok. And I have to listen to all the stupid audios and have to deal with the stupid no talent dances all day. It has driven me to the point of being insane. Anyone else with same problem? Also I donâ€™t have tik tok.
