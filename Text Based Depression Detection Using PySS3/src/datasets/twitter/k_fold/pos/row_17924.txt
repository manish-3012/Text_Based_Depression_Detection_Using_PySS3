How do I stop crying? Long story short my mom has upset me greatly and I have become incapable of stopping crying. Itâ€™s really embarrassing and when she comes back into the room it will be obvious I am crying. At this point if anyone tries to talk to me I will not be able to answer without sobbing. I canâ€™t leave the room because I have something I am supposed to be doing here. Any help?
