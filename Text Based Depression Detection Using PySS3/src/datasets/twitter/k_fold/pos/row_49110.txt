Story of how i almost got a GF........... Months ago (around July 2020) me and my Classmate (F16) chatted to know hows it going. Back in F2F we were never really close because she was kinda strict and she also had a boyfriend at the time.   


So months before we chat (around late 2019-early 2020) her boyfriend didn't see her nor chatted with her so he kinda abandoned her for unknown reasons (she never gave enough details).  


So while we were chatting she told me that she likes me and has a 'crush' on me. So i was happy and told her i kinda liked her as well. But we never called each other BF or GF (She doesn't want to. i dunno). So we were kinda like friends but we like each other. Then after a few months of chatting, she told me that she no longer has a crush on me. Not just that she also told me that her having a 'Crush' on me is not serious. I'm just her "Happy Crush". I don't know what on earth that means but i think it's just a crush for fun or something. So yeah that's it.   


  
I felt kinda numbed when that happened. I'm not happy, nor sad. It's i dunno.  


Now because of that, i simply don't care about that stuff (Crushes, GFs, etc.) anymore. I just don't care. I'm no longer even interested in having a crush or somethin.   


Thanks for reading my Post. Hope you have a Nice Day / Night.
