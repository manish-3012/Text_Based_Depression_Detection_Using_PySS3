Question: Does anyone else have this wish that there were more songs on a specific band's album rather than a new album? Like for example the album Bricks Are Heavy by L7, that album is absolutely amazing, but the album that came afterwards Hungry For Stink wasn't nearly as good, the sound is completely different and the tone is different. So does anyone have this internal wish that there was more from the first album than there being a follow up?
