About me This is not a question.. I just finally reached a state where I am happy about myself! Around 2 years ago I weighted too much, and i basically had no friends. As I am today; I got a job as a programmer a year ago (I was 13 years old at that moment), my weight is perfect, and the most important part: I have so many close friends, and Iâ€™m out with friends almost every weekend. Iâ€™m just a happy 14â€™year old boy :)
