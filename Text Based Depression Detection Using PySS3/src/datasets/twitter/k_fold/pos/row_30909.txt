I just slept through a class. I slept through my AP Computer Science class by complete accident, and im already failing that class(my only F because I'm virtual and the teachers only interaction with the kids is through the assignment) and  really worried this might be the straw that makes him force turn in all the late work I have to redo because he won't take what I have in bulk.
