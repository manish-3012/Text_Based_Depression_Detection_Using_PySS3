My dad is so pathetic. He got mad at my grandma about a burger with fucking ketchup on it. He let my little 7 year old cousin have his burger and she wanted ketchup on it, so my grandma put ketchup on it. My cousin only ate a little vitamin of the burger and the rest we left up on the counter. Then my dad comes out and calls us grandma a piece of shit, how he couldnt even eat dinner because of her when he was the one that let my cousin have the burger. He was wrongly accusing my grandma, let alone it BEING ABOUT A FUCKING BURGER.

He's been such a piece of shit the past 8 months and his actions every day just support my claims
