Is there any part of your body that you notice but no one else does? Most of the time no one notices but I have a freckle above my top lip and I notice it all.the.time. It bothers the heck out of me but at the end of the day itâ€™s really unnoticeable to someone whoâ€™s not looking for it. Just wondering if yâ€™all have something like that? Because for me itâ€™s super annoying but itâ€™s literally not a big deal. Yâ€™all can joke but Iâ€™m genuinely asking. ðŸ¤”
