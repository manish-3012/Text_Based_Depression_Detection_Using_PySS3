Y if you can see this know that you break my heart I am writing here for my friend E. Because she doesnâ€™t want her crush see this post.

So this happened a few months ago; me, my friend (m) and my crush (m) were talking in the class and there was only us. My friend suddenly asked â€œAre you gay?â€ and I said no. He said he thought that me and my best friend (f)  are couples. It is true that my best friend is gay but I am not. My crush thinks that I am gay thanks to my friend. Fuck u Y!
