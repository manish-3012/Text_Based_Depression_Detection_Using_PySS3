Carl H: The most hated man on Reddit. Originally known for being a very kind and helpful person with his own subreddit to teach coding, Carl H. had a very dark secret. He was once given the award "Redditor of the Day". And had a very positive view by everybody. His subreddit was used as a free and easy way to learn coding, which by some people would be seen as a win-win seeing how coding is one of the most difficult things to learn. Eventually, some very dark and disturbing things got leaked on the internet and the way the Reddit Community view him was turned completely upside down. (At this point I'm going to start talking about a graphic situation, proceed at your own will) During some investigating, the FBI soon found some videos and pictures of child pornography that was distributed by Carl. The child was never let out the house, and never got an education. The child was beat, abused, cut in some places, and was brutalized by Carl, and two other people who later charged with the same crimes as Charles. A total of 56 years in prison was his punishment (I feel like he should have gotten worse). But those years didn't matter because 2 years later he was found dead by hanging. Even though life was done with him, Reddit wasn't. They would go to his subreddit and say things like "How hot is it in hell?", "Hope Satan is having fun with you" and other things like that. So, that's the rise and fall of an Evil person. 

Personally, I think he got away with his evil acts. But there's not a lot we can do about a dead man.
