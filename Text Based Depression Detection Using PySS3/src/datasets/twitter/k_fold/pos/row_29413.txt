Being alone feels good. I'm not sure about you guys, but being alone for long periods of time is one of my favourite things. The idea of being by myself is one that I love and that I always have.

I do enjoy others companies, but by the time I leave them I think to myself 'yeah but i could have been practicing so and so' or, 'I could have watched so much of so and so'.

I'm not sure if others are like this, and I wouldn't consider myself 'introverted', just i prefer being alone to being with others.
