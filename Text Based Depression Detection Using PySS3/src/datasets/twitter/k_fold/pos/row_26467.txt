I finally confessed to my crush I asked her to talk privately just outside the school and then I was like shaking in my shoes so much I could barely speak or stand on my feet. Then I dropped the bomb and she was so nervous as well and she started to gesticulate and stuff. She then said she needed some time but wasnâ€™t saying no.

Iâ€™m still shaking, a solid half an hour later, but Iâ€™m feeling so relieved and as far as I can tell itâ€™s so much better once itâ€™s out. For those of you who like me didnâ€™t have the courage, trust me, itâ€™s the best choice you can do
