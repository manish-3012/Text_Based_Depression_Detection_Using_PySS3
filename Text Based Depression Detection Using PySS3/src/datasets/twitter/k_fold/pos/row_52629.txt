How else am I supposed to answer? So I was walking out of school the other day. And I couldn't be assed to walk around the car park and area where the busses park, so I just cut through it. There was a teacher who would stand around in that area.

As I start walking across (no vehicle moving) she says "why are you walking across the car park"

How else am I supposed to reply other than "becuase it's quicker" 

Well it seemed like that was the correct answer becuase she didn't say anything else and I just kept walking.
