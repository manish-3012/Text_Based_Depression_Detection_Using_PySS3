My best friend thinks I'm mentally ill and it's sooooo annoying He's telling me that I'm mentally ill and that everyone agrees when nobody has said anything to me. Literally none of my friends say that, just him and he says that because I'm insecure about my crush. Everyone has some insecurities, I do too, most people with a crush must've felt insecure atleast once. He's always making a big deal out of everything I say about anything like that and it's always so annoying. Threats like "I'll force you into therapy if you're not cured by 18" FORCED THERAPY WON'T EVEN WORK (i think) and I don't need therapy. I'm very happy with my life I just sometimes feel like the person I like wouldn't like me back and that they deserve a better partner than me THAT'S ALL. He's saying that since I think that i need therapy.
