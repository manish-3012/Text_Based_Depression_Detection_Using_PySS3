iâ€™m pretty sure my friend is lying abt something related to his exgf who committed suicide, what do? My friend who Iâ€™ve known since like Pre-K had a girlfriend like two years ago and she ended up committing suicide. fucked but like it happened two years ago and heâ€™s over it. but now his ex (who iâ€™m friends with and he is no longer) was like having eyes for one of the boys and they got into a big fight and he says that she told him that her suicide was his fault, but iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s not the case. heâ€™s had a pattern of behavior of telling lies unnecessarily and i think heâ€™s lying abt this. i asked the girl (ex iâ€™m friends with) and she said she didnâ€™t and i trust her more than my other friend. i think itâ€™s fucked up that heâ€™d lie abt his dead gf. should i call him out on it or just let it be?
