Anyone else have parents who make you keep clothes you donâ€™t even like? So even if my mom lets me somehow get new clothes itâ€™s like I canâ€™t throw away my old ones because ???? 

I have clothes I havenâ€™t worn in years and my mom tells me my drawers canâ€™t be closed and to clean it up but itâ€™s just that I have too many clothes that I donâ€™t even wear ??? 

I would donate them but my mom wonâ€™t even let me so ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸
