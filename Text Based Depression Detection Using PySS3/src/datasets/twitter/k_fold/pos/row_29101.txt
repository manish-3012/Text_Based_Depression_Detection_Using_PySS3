The date was success! We had a great time. We watched Hubie Halloween and laughed the whole time. Then, after we talked for 3 and half hours. He was too tired to keep going, so I told him to go to sleep. We were just asking each other questions for a while. I hope yâ€™all who read this have nice day or night or sleep.
