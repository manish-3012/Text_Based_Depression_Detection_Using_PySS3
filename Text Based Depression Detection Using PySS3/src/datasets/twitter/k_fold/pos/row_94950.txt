Just a rant I'm trying to improve myself, especially in the looks department. I'm looking to style my hair differently, started working out. And at first I thought I was doing it for myself, to make myself for happy with how I looked. But now I'm starting to wonder if that's really my goal. In many ways it is but I think I'm also doing it for her. Because I wasnt good enough for her in trying to make myself good enough for her. Even tho I know shes never gonna like me, I feel like part of the relationship im trying to improve myself and specifically my looks is to try and impress her, make her change her mind. Even tho ik itll never happen
