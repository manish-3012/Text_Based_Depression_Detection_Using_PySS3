I just realized how significant compliments are to guy (I am a guy btw) One of my friends (girl) came up to me in a new outfit and she was exited and I said it looked new, then she had the audacity to say â€œis that it?â€ In a monotone condescending voice. Iâ€™ve never been complimented and I just realized how men are so starved of compliments and women take them for granted
