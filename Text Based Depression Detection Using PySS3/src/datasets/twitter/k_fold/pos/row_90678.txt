What is the most filling thing to eat? I am legit tired of being hungry, spending 20 dollars on wings that can hold me for 5 hours max, and be hungry again the next day. I need something that can keep me full for a long time, I am sick of eating whatever there is in the house and reach a point where there isn't anything to feed my hunger. No, I am not dealing with an eating disorder, I just have a super-high metabolism and it's getting frustrating to reach the feeling of being full. So I come to y'all, fellow teenagers with the hunger of Matt Stonie, what do you inhale that can satisfy my high hunger as well?
