My GFs dad likes me a lot so that's really good We kinda got off on good grounds, hes worked at and owned car dealerships, and I like cars.

Also he likes green day and so do I.

Turns out its the same thing for penguins 

And we have a shared irrational affinity for the Pontiac Fiero.

And apparently he said that when he starts up his new dealership (apparently hes working on buying a dealership or something like that, cause he currently works at a dealership on the other side of the state) that I'll basically be allowed to get any job I'm qualified for, assuming me and my GF are still dating

He's also just a cool guy and nice to talk to, which isnt what you expect from your GFs dad
