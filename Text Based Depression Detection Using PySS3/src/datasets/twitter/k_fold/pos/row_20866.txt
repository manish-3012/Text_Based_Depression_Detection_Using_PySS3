3rd sleepover in a row with the same person except at her house Since our school has been canceled this entire week, my best friend slept over 2 nights in a row at my house and now i am at her house. 

Do you guys think we could do this for he rest of the week? Her parents and my parents are best friends already and my parents love her more than they love me so I'm thinking yes, this can last
