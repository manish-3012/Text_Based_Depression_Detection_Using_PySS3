Well shit Iâ€™m kinda scared My sister was kinda sick this morning so her bf came over to drop off some medicine and tea for her but while he was here he told her that his dad tested positive for it on Sunday but he hadnâ€™t been in contact with his since Sunday but even then he wasnâ€™t really close to him but still my sister is sick and has sort of a cough and my dad has diabetes so shit
