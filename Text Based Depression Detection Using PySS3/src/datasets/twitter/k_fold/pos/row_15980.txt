Why are the freshmen at my school SO FUCKING STUPID i'm talking levels of stupid that karen would be proud of. One kid decided to instigate a fight, and then he tried to hire a Sophomore as a hit-man to fight in his place. and I me he actually tried to hire the guy. for $200. $200 FUCKING dollars for a fight that he started, but didn't have the stones to follow through on it. IDIOTS
