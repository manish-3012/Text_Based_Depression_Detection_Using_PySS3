Difficult situation with friends Hi, it's been a rough year for me, at the beginning of the school year I came closer to my friends and was really close with them but then complicated stuff started happening all around me, I started feeling depressed and left out, then even more depressed and started to worry my friends when also distancing from them I've now reached a point we're Im very distanced from my good friends, I feel lonely and depressed and I'm now trying to get closer to them again, this will be difficult to achieve especially after everything that has happened to me, the corona pandemic didn't help either with the situation AND I'm now going to 10th grade and the school mixed up the entire classes sooooo it's goanna be hard. Probably going to update this as time goes by.
