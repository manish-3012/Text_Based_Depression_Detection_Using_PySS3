Schools and kids mental health This is happening at my school and I am not sure about yours so if itâ€™s only mine Iâ€™m sorry. 


Schools donâ€™t give a shit about kids mental health. If they do, itâ€™s because they are legally required to, not because they were going to anyways. Incident at my school happened about a year ago. Friend of mine attempted suicide and there was a whole thing about it. School only gave a fuck because our parents got involved. Suicide posters also went up after this incident. Flash forward to right now. All of my friend are experiencing some kind of abuse, from mental, to physical. And they donâ€™t want to go to guidance office because they donâ€™t trust them to do anything. I think that should change. Guidance counselors are supposed to be people you can trust. And if the students feel that they canâ€™t trust them than they are doing something wrong. I think this needs to change.


These were just my opinions on the subject.
