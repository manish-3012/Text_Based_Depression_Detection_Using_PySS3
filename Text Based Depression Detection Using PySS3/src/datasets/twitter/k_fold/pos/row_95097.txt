To anyone who needs it â¤ï¸ Did you know that you look amazing when you smile ðŸ¥º

I love you okay.
Please don't give up. 
Even if you think that no one loves you. 
I love you even if I don't know you.
Well, I do know that you're an amazing person whos just going through a really rough patch.
I do know that you're a caring person who puts others happiness before yours
I know that your faking being happy to make sure that no one worries about you because you're a selfless person (and if you're not faking being happy its because you've been faking for so long that you can't keep it up anymore)
I love you so much and my whole world and heaps of people that you didn't think cared about you worlds will shatter and their lives will never be the same again if you give up
So please don't give up
It will get better I promise ðŸ’ž
I have been through this time and I even thought about killing myself but I pushed through it and I am so glad I did. My life only got better and I and now that happiest I have ever been
Life may seem like its never going to get better but I promise you its will and I can promise that you are going to be so glad that you didn't give up  

Just thought I would remind you that I love you once more okay ðŸ’žâ™¡
