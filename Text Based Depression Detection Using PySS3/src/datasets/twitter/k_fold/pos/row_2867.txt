Stop acting depressed if you really arenâ€™t Iâ€™m tired of seeing the same shit of people posting about how theyâ€™re dead inside and how theyâ€™re â€˜depressedâ€™ you really need to stop and the fact is you donâ€™t know how lucky you are to live in a stable household and work in a school and you all really seem to take that for granted considering the amount of children that donâ€™t have that privilege nor right to so much as learn  how to write while you guys over here have stable lives and have the potential to do great things when you grow up but decide to bitch about how â€˜yOuR nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLsâ€™ or that
Youâ€™re â€˜DePpReSsEdâ€™ making the the people with genuine depression be overlooked just so you can get those sweet sweet internet points good on you man good on you. And to the people reading this the actually have depression and arenâ€™t faking it, you Are Loved By Somebody In This World and you might not even know who they are so for the love of god stay clinging onto that edge and donâ€™t let go because no matter how long it takes you or somebody else will pull you up
