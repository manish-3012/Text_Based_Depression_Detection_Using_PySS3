I think I am fucked So uhm we were in a zoom meeting with the whole class and the teacher had created breakout rooms which we could freely join and so me and the Bois joined one which was empty. We were kind of bored so I came up with the genius idea of joining other breakout rooms and blasting some isis music "saleel us sawarim" because I am a Pakistan Muslim living in Europe and there is a Turkish kid in my class who also finds this kind of stuff funny. So yeah we did that and the people in the different breakout rooms were surprised at first and then continued on with working(probably irritated too) and this one breakout room had an Israeli girl in it so I changed the music to "dammi falastini" and she was pissed off lol. We continued doing this in other breakout rooms until the teacher suddenly joined and saw my speaker on.... She was quite calm tho and I don't think she told this to the class mentor but we have a mentorhour tomorrow so there is a high chance that I am fucked tomorrow...
