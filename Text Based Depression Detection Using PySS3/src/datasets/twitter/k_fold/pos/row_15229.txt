Im running a D&amp;D campaign, if you want to join, see below and fill out the form :) (This is a repost from yesterday, as it got buried quite quickly) *North of the Spine of the World and West of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a frigid tundra without reprieve.*_x000D_

Hello! Soon I will be running the 5th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign â€˜Rime of the Frostmaidenâ€™, and my friend and I are looking for another 2 players, all aged 14 to 18. This campaign is relatively long, going from level 1 to level 12._x000D_
_x000D_
The sessions would be every other week on Sundays, and should start at around 7pm GMT and end at 10pm, though time and day might move at some point. The game itself will be over Roll20, but Discord will be used for voicechat. _x000D_

I'm Dan, and I am 16, and as a DM, Iâ€™m relatively experienced with both D&amp;D and Roll20, having been DMing for more than a year, though Iâ€™m not so great at voices so please excuse my terrible accents.

You can create a character in the Session 0 if you get chosen, though having an idea of the character you want to create before then would help. I will also go over information about the setting in that session and everything, but for now, you should know:_x000D_

-	Itâ€™s set in the Forgotten Realms, in an arctic tundra known as Icewind Dale_x000D_
-	The sun never fully rises, so races affected by Sunlight Sensitivity, such as drow, will not have to suffer the negative effects of it._x000D_
-	Goliaths get resistance to cold damage due to their mountainous lifestyle_x000D_
-	Only races, classes and spells from official D&amp;D books (excluding Unearthed Arcana and possibly some subclasses from Tashaâ€™s Cauldron of Everything, depending on if they are balanced or not._x000D_
-	Expect to be running away or solving things â€œdiplomaticallyâ€ relatively often, instead of being able to just kill everything all the time; thereâ€™s a lot of powerful creatures around. Overall, this game will be a bit more RP focused than combat focused._x000D_
-	Itâ€™s reaaaaaally cold in Icewind Dale_x000D_
-	Really, really cold_x000D_

The form will close in a week from now, and for anyone who looks like theyâ€™d fit well in our party, there will be an opportunity to talk a bit before you join the Discord server._x000D_
