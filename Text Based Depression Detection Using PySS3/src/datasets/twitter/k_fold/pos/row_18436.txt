Here are some lyrics to a song I wrote, what do you think of them? **Chorus (0:10)**

Students not thinking the same

They got us divided

Torn into major groups

Pushing standards,as if we havenâ€™t been trying

Bashing heads into TBs

Out out of gas they tire out

Some of them like this shit

The rest envision them dropping out

Have their own problems

This shit donâ€™t make that easier

Hard to commit to it

School take a toll on their health

Work piling down on me

Crashing down like a meteor

They instruct how to be a bot

Iâ€™ve come here to be a boss

**Verse 1**

Been taught all this useless shit

I think itâ€™s safe to admit

Iâ€™ve thrown these mental misfits

Put a risk to one's wrist

I feel no need to persist

How can I go on?

Forced to study till the crack of dawn

I feel like Iâ€™m sinking

Theyâ€™re happiness shrinking

Force you the 9-5

Work till Iâ€™m sleep deprived

Teachers not satisfied

Iâ€™m locked in these cages

Giving me minimum wages

Iâ€™m lost in this maze

I am aware that itâ€™s all a phase but

This shit getting harder 

Yet I appear as if Iâ€™m not phased

Iâ€™m told itâ€™s the only way 

I feel I am let astray 

From my potential
