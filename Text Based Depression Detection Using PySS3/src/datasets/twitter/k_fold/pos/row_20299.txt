My mom doesnâ€™t approve of my long distance relationship. This is something I need any help I can get for. So last night, I came out to my mom about being in a long distance relationship with a boy (Iâ€™m a guy btw) and my mom started crying and I then found out she was homophobic. She said some nasty things last night like â€œIâ€™m proud of itâ€ and â€œgay, lesbian whatever, itâ€™s just a sexual deviancy like pedophilesâ€. After hearing these sickening things sheâ€™s said I know that I need to get out of here as soon as I can, but for now I can only talk to my boyfriend over discord which I wonâ€™t be able to if my mom restricts my internet. Any help much appreciated, thank you for reading.

P.S my phone autocorrect â€œget outâ€ to â€œgrr eggâ€ and thatâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve laughed since yesterday morning so
