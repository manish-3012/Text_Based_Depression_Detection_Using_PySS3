Me and my amazing ideas. So we had a biology class and we had to grow peas but change something so it is not normally grown. My first idea was to test acidity so i chose  to grow it with sulfuric acid but the teacher said no so my next idea was 50% vinegar but the school had none so I did it with 5% vinegar. In religious studies I asked the teacher if jesus was just a drug dealer and his grave got robbed and we talked about it it for 45 minutes. (Sorry for bad english. Not my native language.)
