Remember in March in the beginning of Quarantine were like â€œoh shit?? 3 weeks off school?? This is gonna be awesome!â€ Then three weeks turned into 2 months, then just canceling everything all together. (Cont.) Then having prom cancelled and graduation turn into a drive by, then having your university like basically just being entirely online with little human connection. Ok Iâ€™ll shut up now cause this is me rambling.
