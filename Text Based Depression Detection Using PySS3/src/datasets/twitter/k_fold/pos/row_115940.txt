Self consciousness So Iâ€™m 15, Iâ€™ve been told my how life how pretty I am and Iâ€™ve had quite a lot of guys like me but I physically can not help but feel ugly. I look at myself especially in pictures and I will literally worry about it for days and start crying and I have this heavy feeling. Itâ€™s truly affected my life it was so bad at a point that I was scared to even go out because I didnâ€™t want people to see me and if I saw people around my age I would have trouble breathing and get really shaky and have tears in my eyes. I was doing ok for a bit but Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m falling back into that really bad hole. I know everyoneâ€™s a little self conscious but I now realize Iâ€™m a lot more than the average person and it truly has really affected my life and anytime I try to talk to people about it I get called out on fishing. I donâ€™t know what to do and I need help but I donâ€™t know if this is a legitimate problem or just something I have to deal with.
