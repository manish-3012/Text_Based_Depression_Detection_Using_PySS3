I am interested in what type of music other people my age listen to I made a collaborative Spotify playlist and I'm setting a few ground rules before I give you the link \\\\

&amp;#x200B;

\-Do not spam add the same song multiple times only once, if you try to add a song that someone else has already added and the dialog box pops up saying it is already in the playlist then don't add it.

\-Do not add meme songs unless you genuinely listen to them semi-regularly.

\-If the playlist is full (IDK if Spotify has a limit) sort by date added and delete the oldest song.

\-Do not mass delete songs, if the playlist is full only delete the number of songs you are adding.

Respect people's privacy and don't go to their account and add songs to the other collaborative playlists they follow.

Ok  I have a feeling some people will not read the rules and so straight to the link
