Help me talk to my crush! I Need help talking to a crush.

I think she likes me, and we have short conversations joking around, but how do I move on? I got her number today and we texted very very little, but Iâ€™m a terrible texter sooooo idk. Should I ask her out or is it too soon? Iâ€™ve known her for a year but it feels like weâ€™re restarting since COVID. Iâ€™ve been in an handful of relationships before but this is a new feeling. Help me guys!
