I fuckin cant bro everything is so hard i dont understand anything in my math and science classes and i used to be a really smart kid i guess and i can barely keep up anymore. i feel like im being pressured into basically picking a job and my career even though im fucking 15 years old. like bro everyones telling me about how i have to do good in school or else colleges wont like me. i dont even want to go to college and tbh all my dream jobs are probably unrealistic and unobtainable and im so stressed out from school and corona and life fucking sucks
