AN URGENT MESSAGE for all US residents (AND the REST OF THE WORLD as well!) *A quick disclaimer before I begin:* **The following post has** ***NOTHING*** **to do with politics and** ***EVERYTHING*** **to do with** ***spirituality.*** And once you read it, you WILL most certainly â€œget itâ€ here as well. Cheers.  

---  

**TL;DR:** The outcome of the ongoing US elections will affect ALL HUMANITY whether they like it or *not.* So DO join us all in the global meditation for setting up Divine Governance in the US (and everywhere else!) --- **a meditation that seeks to FORCE a** ***DIVINELY INSPIRED OUTCOME*** **for the HIGHEST BENEFIT OF** ***ALL LIVING BEINGS*** as opposed to electing some specific person or party. This **Mass Global Meditation will take place on the 29th of October, 2020, at 11:11 AM, Pacific Daylight Time** [**(CLICK HERE to quickly check the timing conversions for your local Time Zone),**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Mass+Meditation+for+establishing+Global+Divine+Governance&amp;iso=20201029T111111&amp;p1=137) though you all are **HIGHLY ADVISED TO KEEP DOING THIS** *whenever you so get the time for doing this* hereafter. Even sparing but a couple of minutes each day hereon will do WONDERS for the outcome of not just THIS election, but so much *more.* Finally, here's some [**IRREFUTABLE PROOF**](https://v.redd.it/sp7i3xwqkhu51) that **DIVINE TRANSFORMATION** on such lines is **ALREADY AFOOT** (even as you read this text), and, as such, isn't exactly a *fairy tale dream.* As also some [**IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE**](https://old.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/hgzroy/i_promised_to_show_you_all_irrefutable_evidence/) of the fact that all of this *"mass meditation stuff"* stuff truly, *really,* ***WORKS.***

**Main Message Begins...**  

While this message (in particular) is primarily intended for US citizens alone, let me assure ONE and ALL in here that **the contents of this message affect EVERY SINGLE PERSON who is incarnate upon planet Earth** right now. So EVERY SINGLE PERSON is well advised to read this, and take the appropriate ACTION that gets inspired within them as a result of this.  

This message is about the ongoing US Elections, and before anyone objects to putting such a message out in a *â€œspiritualâ€* forum such as this one, let me firstly assure you that **this message is** ***VERY MUCH related to*** **the Spiritual Life Blueprints of** ***EVERY BEING INCARNATE UPON PLANET EARTH*** **right** ***now;*** AS ALSO does it contain ZERO political messaging, side-taking, party-preferences, controversial stuff, or absolutely ANYTHING of that sort. But you ALL will have to *read it first* to *"get it!"*  

---  

**Hereâ€™s the basic gist of it:** The United States of America, for better or for worse, has for long been **THE** center of all political, military, and every other kind of imaginable and unimaginable kind of POWER for quite sometime now. Power, that has been VASTLY misused for dark and disturbing and *unspeakably* nefarious purposes, and very much so INCLUDING the suppression of spiritual people ALL ACROSS OUR PLANET. That includes you. That includes me. And that well includes *every single person* youâ€™ve ever come across within this lifetime of yours. And which is why, **the outcome of THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION (during the time of planetary ascension no less) will affect ALL PEOPLE ON PLANET EARTH** whether they ***LIKE IT or NOT.*** Which is why **YOU,** each and every single one of YOU, needs to have a SAY and a VOICE and a VOTE in the outcome of this election. No, not a political voice or vote (necessarily); but more so an ENERGETIC one of truly BENEVOLENT and DIVINE intentions and proportions that manifest the HIGHEST of outcomes for the ENTIRE PLANET at large --- all through **manifesting the HIGHEST of divine outcomes** for this particular election in question, here.  

---  

Now, Iâ€™m well aware that elections and votes are a scam, and that ALL of our true (spiritual and other) powers lie only and ONLY **WITHIN** ourselves at all times. And yet, for the MAJORITY of (the unawakened) human populace, such is so not TRUE, at least for *now.* So before they all come to the point of being entirely SELF-DEPENDENT spiritually (i.e. zero dependency upon outside leaders, governments, etc.) their COLLECTIVE ENERGIES (in the form of their *â€œvotesâ€)* WILL nevertheless get manipulated still by those of lesser-light, in order that *they too* may be able to meet their own dark and nefarious ends in here. And it is ***VERY MUCH SO*** our divine role and responsibility and HONOUR here, as spiritually *awakened* beings upon this planet right now, to so **NOT** allow that to happen here now, ***NO MATTER WHAT.*** They can censor our voices (that too, *barely);* but **how in the world will they** ***EVER*** **be able to censor** our inner **POWER?** (Hint: They simply ***CANNOT).*** 
 

---  

**Which is why Iâ€™m so NOT going to ask you to manifest the victory of** ***so-and-so political party*** **or** ***such-and-such presidential candidate*** **in here.** Instead, I am going to merely ask ONE AND ALL to **ENVISION, INTEND, VISUALIZE and MANIFEST the HIGHEST POSSIBLE** ***DIVINE*** **OUTCOME** for this election (of global impact and proportions). Or what one could call a *â€œDivinely Inspired Governmentâ€,* so to speak. Because itâ€™s NOT about WHO it is that you vote into power ultimately, but more so, WHAT ENERGIES you choose to represent as / through THEM. **Voting a party or a person is doomed to fail.** Voting an ENERGY and a SPECIFIC INTENT, that can [**NEVER, EVER,** ***EVER,*** **FAIL.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/hgzroy/i_promised_to_show_you_all_irrefutable_evidence/)  

---  

So, how do you even *go about* doing this sort of stuff? It is very, **very, simple,** really. Imagine / Visualize and INTEND that the OUTCOME of the elections leads to a government of *â€˜Divine Servantsâ€™* being installed. You can visualize these divine servants as being BEINGS OF LIGHT, or Angels, or God, or Saints, or *whatever-visualization-cue* works for you. **You could even visualize** ***yourself*** in here, **if** ***that's*** **whom you trust the** ***MOST.*** Kindly note here that the *â€œvisualsâ€,* *â€œimagesâ€*, *â€œimaginationsâ€,* or *representations* that you choose here donâ€™t really matter *ONE DAMN BIT* --- but only and ***ONLY*** the INTENT / ENERGY that those visuals of your liking convey, carry, contain and *EMBODY* do.  

---  

**Imagine / Visualize and INTEND that these beings (the** ***president*** **and the people under him) carry and contain** ***ALL*** **qualities that you associate with the** ***HIGHEST OF THE HIGH*** --- namely, **true benevolence, compassion, kindness, understanding, WISDOM, forgiveness, TRUTHFULNESS, transparency, PEACE, balance,** ***service-to-ALL*** **and, most important of them all,** ***UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.*** You can add in more such amazing qualities further if you so wish, it is ALL UPTO YOU. Because yes, folks, you are, indeed, ***THAT INCREDIBLY POWERFUL,*** here. 
 

Now, **what if you absolutely SUCK AT visualizing or imagining things?** **Worry** ***NOT.*** For the **trick to manifestation** is ***FEELING.*** And more so, ***FEELING*** **as if what youâ€™ve desired is** ***ALREADY HERE,*** right here right now right in FRONT OF YOU no less. *And repeatedly doing this as often as you possibly can throughout your days.* Visualization / Imagination is just a support wheel for you, so to speak. For **it is** ***ONLY*** **the** ***INTENTION*** **and** ***FEELING*** **that really even** ***matters*** in the end. So even if you can INTEND and FEEL as if the outcome of your choice has already HAPPENED, and then let go of it with the **FAITH** (in your own divine power) that ***IT IS SO,*** folks, youâ€™re (WAY MORE THAN!) good to go in here. Finally, **IF AT ALL you even suck at setting intentions,** ***JUST send in your PRAYERS*** to your Higher Self or God or Angels or your favourite Saint or Spiritual Guru or whoever else *works-for-you.* Remember, ***YOUR PRAYERS are INFINITELY MORE POWERFUL*** than what youâ€™d ever be led to believe. So yeah, go do just *THAT* if nothing else (works)!  

---  


**With this, you become** ***ETERNALLY FREE*** **from** ***EVER*** **having to make the tricky and confusing choices between** ***â€œgoodâ€*** **candidates and** ***â€œbadâ€*** **candidates.** Between *X political party* and *Y political party.* And between *all else* that leads to separation, confusion, anxiety and whatnot. Even if youâ€™re voting in person, do this exercise and vote for whichever candidate *â€œfeelsâ€* right to vote for (in just *that* given moment). ***THATâ€™S*** **your** ***'Divine Inspiration.'*** AKA your *intuition,* or your *gut-feeling,* or your *higher divine guidance,* so to speak. (Also, one that is ALWAYS right). And, just in case you are *not* voting or *not even* a US citizen, **THIS IS HOW** youâ€™re voting for a better world (and doing this in a *whole lot more* efficient, faster and smooth-er way) regardless. Because, as I said earlier, the spiritual fate of the ENTIRE PLANET hangs in balance now, with respect to the OUTCOME of this specific election. Not that a bad outcome will "ruin everything" or such; but that it can potentially delay a LOT of progress for an unnecessarily long time really. Which is so NOT worth it, in here.  

---  

**Also, once youâ€™re done doing this,** ***PAY ZERO HEED*** to news articles (proclaiming the (pre) supposed victory of X candidate or Y party) or (fake AF) *â€œexit pollsâ€* or *what-else-have-you!* Remember, ***YOU*** **are the WHOLE AND SOUL CREATOR of your own reality.** Everything else is but lies and deception and *propaganda.* **DO** ***NOT*** fall for it. Have FAITH in your own, divine ***SELF.*** *TRUST* in your own power to change the world. Because you have it and ***I KNOW THAT YOU VERY WELL SO DO.***  

Last (but by no means the least), ***FEEL FREE to use this EXACT SAME METHOD*** (of setting up Divine Governance) ***in your current place of stay as well,*** no matter which country or political setup youâ€™re currently living under in, at this very moment! Because **this method QUITE LITERALLY SO** ***FORCES*** **your chosen leaders** to either FIT COMPLETELY (within the DIVINE template / blueprint of working, governing, and doing things) or simply **NOT** be a part of the said governing systems and setups in question ***AT ALL.*** Because yes, this method IS indeed **THAT** powerful, dearest folks.  

---  

**Two final concluding things:** One, if anyoneâ€™s interested in setting this intention on a *COLLECTIVE LEVEL,* **PLEASE DO JOIN the Mass Meditation for this exact purpose** that has been **organized at 11:11 AM Pacific Daylight Time on the 29th of October, 2020.** [**CLICK HERE to get a time zone conversion for this for your respective place/s of residence.**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Mass+Meditation+for+establishing+Global+Divine+Governance&amp;iso=20201029T111111&amp;p1=137)

Finally, please, please, **PLEASE DO SHARE this message with everyone you know!** Through your **conversations** and your **social media.** **Through your spiritual communities, contacts, networks, forums, groups and everywhere else!** **Spread the word** ***AS FAR AND WIDE*** **as you possibly can,** because the outcome of this particular election *WILL MOST DEFINITELY* affect *EVERY PERSON LIVING ON PLANET EARTH today.* ***ZERO exaggerations.*** So yeah, letâ€™s go change the world, my people.
