I wasted my teen years Iâ€™m almost 17 and I wasted my teen years so far. I didnâ€™t cultivate a taste in music, watch much tv, play video games or sports, or party. I literally just spent my time on my phone googling random shit, and using Tiktok. The one productive thing that I tried to do was learning languages on Duolingo and Iâ€™m still shit at the languages. That was four years of my life and I didnâ€™t even spend my time with family or friends. Iâ€™m so disappointed with myself.
