WHY DON'T PARENTS UNDERSTAND WHY WE WANT TO CHILL IN OUR ROOMS When you become a teenager, everything gets weirder and weirder. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO ZONE OUT SOMETIMES AND THAT IT MIGHT ALL BE A BIT MUCH?!? Parents out there reading this, I know we all sometimes overreact, but this is a silly thing to make a deal out of. Sadly, it just is this way, that we will be weird, act strange and quite possiblly annoying for a couple years, and then it's over! So please calm DOWN!
