What do you like? Hi guys, 
I am a math teacher and I really want to connect with my students. 
The problem is that I feel like I have disconnected from you. I don't really know what do you like. What books do you read? what films are your favourites? What do you watch in your free time? 
I know what the people of my age like and how to appeal to us, and I assumed, mistakenly, that would be the same for you. But it is not. 
Some advise please? 
Thanks !
