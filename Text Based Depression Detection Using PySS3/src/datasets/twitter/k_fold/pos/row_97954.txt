Should I start working out? Iâ€™m 14 yo, 185 cm or 6â€1 to you fellas Americans . Iâ€™m pretty skinny, about 60 kg, and Iâ€™m wondering if I should start working out in the gym, at the moment Iâ€™m working out at home, seeing some progress but I really donâ€™t have any equipment, what does reddit think?
