Some quotes are glued inside my head and can be quite funny sometimes. Like whenever I'm in science and something mentions copper, I think of megamind. I also can't listen to back in black without thinking of megamind. And i was half way through a test once and my brain decided now is the best time to recall a whole scene from The Worlds End (better than hot fuzz hands down). Don't know why I wanted to say this but I did so enjoy :)
