my teacher wants us to type an essay completely in Times New Roman font in font size 12, or she gives us a zero on the essay it doesn't matter how good the essay is, if the font and font size isn't what she wants, we don't get any marks on the essay. what the fuck kind of reason for giving a zero is that?

if you're wondering why i'm so pissed off about something like this, i wanted to use my E. B. Garamond (Medium bold) font in font size 14, since everything i've typed since grade 8 has been that way.
