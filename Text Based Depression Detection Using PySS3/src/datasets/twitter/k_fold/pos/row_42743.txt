It still hurts me even a year later, that she never really cared about me All she wanted was sex. All that â€œwhat we had was realâ€ and â€œyou mean so much to meâ€ and â€œI love youâ€ meant nothing in the end. Iâ€™ve dated a couple girls since then, but itâ€™s just been me rebounding. Iâ€™m tired of thinking of her. Not a day has gone by since weâ€™ve met where I havenâ€™t thought about her.
