Fuck me I had to take a couple days off school because I have a combination of a cold (I have a sore throat and runny nose, which the school says you can't come to school if you have) and work I didn't do. So I took a couple days off to do my work and get better. But my mom just told the FUCKING school that I just didn't want to go. What the Fuck is wrong with her. I also have High-functioning Autism and hate confrontation. I'm probably gonna get yelled at to hell and back.What should I do and how should I avoid it?
