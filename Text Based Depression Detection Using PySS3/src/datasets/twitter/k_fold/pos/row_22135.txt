Just need to let off some steam real quick So my school is starting hybrid in a few weeks and their splitting us into two groups. A-M and N-Z by last name. Last week parents had a choice if they want to keep kids home or do hybrid. My mom chose to make me go. Her reasoning is I need to â€œsocializeâ€ (who needs that?). Hereâ€™s the kicker. ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE A-M AND Iâ€™M IN THE N-Z GROUP! So I canâ€™t even socialize with them.
