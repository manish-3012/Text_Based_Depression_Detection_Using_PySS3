my adhd meds are split into 4 doses a day like in what world is that a good idea like i barely remember to take ONE of them, much less FOUR
 
i lk miss my old med. like i just had one and i barely remembered to even take that one LMAO
 
but in all seriousness adhd is the worst demographic to have split doses for
