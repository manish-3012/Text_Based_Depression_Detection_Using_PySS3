Are offensive jokes okay or not? I understand why people donâ€™t like them but thereâ€™s a difference between just being offensive and an offensive joke. Or maybe â€œOffensive jokeâ€ isnâ€™t the best thing to call it. Maybe it should be called â€œA joke about an offensive topicâ€ or controversial topic or something. And thereâ€™s also the argument that the joke is not to be taken seriously because itâ€™s, you know, a joke. And also because those jokes arenâ€™t trying to make fun of that offensive thing even though it may seem like it. Whatâ€™s your opinion on this?

Also I wouldnâ€™t get offended if someone made a joke like that to me. Someone actually has and I thought it was funny. It was about a medical condition I have thatâ€™s pretty serious but I wasnâ€™t offended.
