College is so stupid Bc of COVID weâ€™re not allowed to have visitors from other dorms in our dorm. All the freshman dorms are separated by gender. Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s more pathetic. The fact that weâ€™re 18 and we have to sneak girls in, or that we are actually sneaking girls in. It feels like theyâ€™re treating us like 13 year olds at a summer camp.
