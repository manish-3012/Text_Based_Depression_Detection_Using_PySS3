I think I used to get attached too easily I try to deny this until this week something made me think I get attached way too easily I mean I used to I think when I think back like to when I was 12 even before that I often would almost do anything to keep a friend and if I loose one my fault or not I can get either overly sad or angry and now I have the opposite of getting too attached I kinda feel like if you aren't with me you aren't against me(No and that's not a star wars reference for fuckers to try to realize) most of the times I try to deny I have the mindset until I think back a lot of times I maybe have at least 13 incidents where I had this mindset in the last 2 months or so.
