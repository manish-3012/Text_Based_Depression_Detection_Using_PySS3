Why does it take my mom so long to get ready? I, a female as well, can get ready in 2 minutes. Just throw some clothes on and put my hair into a messy bun. But my mom takes 10 minutes at least. Even for a trip to the grocery store! She has to go to the bathroom (which always takes forever for no reason) then do her hair (she ties it up in a scarf the same way all the time- not for religious reasons, we are white as well) and thats about it. So why the he'll does it take so long??? She cant ever do anything quickly and its ridiculous!!!
