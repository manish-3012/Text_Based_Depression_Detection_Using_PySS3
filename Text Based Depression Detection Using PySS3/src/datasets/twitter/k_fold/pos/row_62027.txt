If you could change Instagram and other Social Medias companies, how would you change it to make it a better place? I have seen a lot of friends feeling insecure and comparing themselves to the people on Instagram. I thought it was just my friends who had this, so I was hesitant to ask about this to anyone else. 

But after watching Social Dilemma I'm convinced that all the social media platforms need to change. So how do you think should these apps change (both, for the well being of people and as a more inviting and friendlier platform) ?
