Not good with titles so I'll keep it simple, hello to all you fellow teens! I'm brand new to this subreddit (literally just found out it existed) and since I know practically nobody in the area from where I live and dont have that good of friends online, I figured this place wouldn't be too bad to try and meet some people (if that's alright??) I'm looking for just some chill people to just chat and possibly play some games with whenever I have the time, though I'll be completely honest, being friends with me comes with a big disclaimer as I've had to deal with some fucked up shit the past 5 years and am still suffering the effects of said stuff, so because of that if I happen to be in a mood or something it's most likely because I'm having a rough day which unfortunately can be pretty often for me, if you want to know anything about me just ask me any question at all and I'd be happy to answer!

Heres a couple starter things about me
