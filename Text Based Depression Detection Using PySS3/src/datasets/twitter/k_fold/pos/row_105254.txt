i thought my dad was going to hit me. iâ€™m scared and i didnâ€™t know who else to turn to besides reddit. sounds stupid but here goes,

i did something kinda dumb and iâ€™m not gonna get into detail because i know you donâ€™t care. iâ€™m also assuming that no one is gonna read this but i had to tell someone. 

my dad has always had a short fuse if you know what iâ€™m saying. he gets mad very quickly, but has never been abusive towards me, my mom, or my sisters, but heâ€™s been close with me before. 

one time a few years back, we were arguing about something and he had a book in his hand. i said something he didnâ€™t like and he raised the book in his hand and was about to strike me. thatâ€™s when my mom came in and screamed to stop. 

that day i felt scared, and his voice was different. he hasnâ€™t changed like that since then, until tonight. he called me into the room with the same voice he used a year ago. my savior, my mom, came in before he was able to do anything. 

iâ€™m scared and panicking. iâ€™ve gone a few months without self harm and iâ€™m on the verge right now. i donâ€™t know what to do or who to tell.

iâ€™m sorry if this is stupid and iâ€™m sure a bunch of people have been through worse, but i just needed to get it off my chest.
