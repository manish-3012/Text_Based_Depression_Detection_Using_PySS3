Have you ever wanted to do a game!? Well, I need your help Im developing Solo a WW2 game (FPS) in Unreal Engine and is too much work for me I'm looking for:

3D modeler and/or animator

Level designer

Please take into consideration this

I'm doing this in my free time so don't feel obligated

For now I don't have money to pay you nor me but when we are done and we release it we might open a patreon or kickstarter while the game might be free (Probably) , it will completely depend

I will open a [trello.com](https://trello.com) for a roadmap and I will open a Jamboard

Text me through reddit! I'm always open
