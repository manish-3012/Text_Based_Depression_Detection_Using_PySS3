Teachers that say â€œIâ€™ve already answered your question, you should have been listening.â€ Are the absolute worst... Your job is to educate, I sometimes get confused or just get off focus sometimes in class. I know I should have better listening skills but youâ€™re the one who legit teaches me. Why canâ€™t teachers understand this?
