Why is my gf whit me when our friend is better for her? I know this sounds super insecure from me and that's not okay from me

But like we have this one friend who is super nice to her and they have same interests and stuff and he's much closer to her


We are in a long distance relationship and the friend isn't close to her but he's super closer to her then me

She keeps talking about him and I feel really uncomfortable. I know she loves me but I feel like she would be so much happier whit him then me.

I make her sad from time to time and he doesn't.

Is it wrong for me to feel like this? 

Is it wrong for me to feel like he is the better choice for her?
