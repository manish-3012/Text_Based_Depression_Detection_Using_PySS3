i cant understand why its hurting me so much right now sometime around a year ago, i tried to get rid of myself. luckily, noone found out and i was alright, but at the time i was away with a lot of my family and noone even noticed i wasn't myself. the day after i was, as usual, sitting in my room and thinking about absolutely everything, and my stepmom just came in and started brushing my hair. i can't even fucking understand it right now, but its hurting me so much, can someone explain this to me
