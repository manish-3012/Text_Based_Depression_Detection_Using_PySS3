Driving down the road and some guy decides that itâ€™s a 2-way road instead of 1-way This dude in a pickup truck was like, one way street? Nah fam, 2-way and did a left turn in a non left turn lane, cutting across THREE LANES OF TRAFFIC. I was driving my dadâ€™s new truck (America) and this dodge black Ram 1500 goes into the only lane that (thankfully) didnâ€™t have any cars which was the right turn lane furthest from the lane he turned from. There was a cop behind us and he didnâ€™t even pull them over. But we had to stop because he had his lights on almost making everyone miss their light. Itâ€™s okay though. Everything is fine
