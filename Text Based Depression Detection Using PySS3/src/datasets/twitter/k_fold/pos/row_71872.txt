Random thought #20 Most people live boring lives. From birth they learn, and learn and learn and learn until the get a job, then they do that job for years and years. Maybe they'll find love in between but that isn't always a good thing. After you retire there isn't much to do. You'll be old and probably wouldn't understand the current technology to well, maybe you'd go back and play minecraft or something, or do a project. But in the end you're just living a boring life. 

For some people it's better though. Things may be easier, and other things harder. Being rich must be nice.
