Iâ€™m scared of talking to women I try really hard to talk to this girl but I always mess up on my end (no itâ€™s not one word responses from her) I feel like I have to be a specific type of person to talk to her, like I have to meet her expectations (but again she likes talking to me)...ok, let me rephrase that, I donâ€™t know how to keep a conversation going please help me
