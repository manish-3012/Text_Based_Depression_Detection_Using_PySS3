Listen up people. Listen up ladies and men. This is a serious topic. You have the right form your own opinion but listen to mine first. 

First topic: I am tired of people judging females for being â€œgrossâ€ or â€œunhygienicâ€ when they donâ€™t shave. This is absolutely ridiculous. A woman can do whatever she wants to her body and shouldnâ€™t be judged. You want to let your unibrow grow? Let it grow! Donâ€™t want to shave your armpits? no one is stopping you! Tired of shaving your arms and legs? Then stop. 
Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. You are not ugly, you are natural. How dare people judge women for something they want to do with their bodies. 

Topic two: [serious] no man should ever be in control of another womanâ€™s body. Yes, Iâ€™m talking about rape and abortion. How dare you judge a woman for saying sheâ€™s been raped. I fucking hate the lines â€œshe had it comingâ€ or â€œif youâ€™re dressing like that, itâ€™ll happen.â€ No matter how sheâ€™s dressed it shouldnâ€™t EVER HAPPEN. If a woman is raped and gets pregnant, how dare you try take her right to abort the clump of cells inside her. It is her body. There is rape and Incest in the world and not only that but there are girls who get pregnant from age 8-16 and that breaks my heart that people are trying to make abortion illegal. (One girl got pregnant when she was barely 5. Let that sink in.) 
 

The obvious: yes I know women fake rape allegations and itâ€™s disgusting and they should be thrown into prison. Yes I know abortion is a hard topic and thereâ€™s many mixed feelings about it. Yes I know men can be raped too and youâ€™re gonna say â€œwhat about men??â€ Let it grow baby. 

In conclusion: letâ€™s all be hairy if you want to be and respect other peopleâ€™s decisions to do whatever they want to their bodies. 

P.s: I am a feminist but Iâ€™m not a nazi-feminist that thinks all men should be killed. Men are beautiful. Love yaâ€™self.â¤ï¸
