I need help keeping friends(?) So... I'm a guy. Last year almost all of my friends graduated but I didn't, and now I'm trying my hardest to fit into nee groups. One problem, the only group that is kind of accepting me are girls, and I can safely say that I've never talked to a girl before as like a friend. So... Girls of this sub, can I get some tips on how to not fuck up?
