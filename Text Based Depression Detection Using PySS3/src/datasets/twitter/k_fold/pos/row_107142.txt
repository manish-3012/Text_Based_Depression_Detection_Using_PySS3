This is what I gonna tell a guy when he claims to convert for me I made a new must in my dating checklist, since a short time I consider being Christian as a must to date me since theist/atheist or different theist relationships don't work out in a lot of cases. 

But there are people who claim to convert, so they can get you, well I don't fall for that if someone claims to do that, I gonna sing:

"Some people go to church just to signify.
Trying make a date with a neighbours wife.
Brother let me tell you just as sure as you're born.
You better leave that woman alone.
Because one of these days you mark my words.
You think that brother is going to work.
You go work bang you knock on his door.
That's  all brother you knock no more.

You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging!
Run on, children for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down!"
