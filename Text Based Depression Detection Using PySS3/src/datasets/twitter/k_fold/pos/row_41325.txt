I hate health teachers They are so self important. Iâ€™m sorry but your class isnâ€™t life changing and it really isnâ€™t that monumental to me, youâ€™re out of touch and donâ€™t have any grounds to be teaching us honestly!! Normally I wouldnâ€™t rag on a teacher bc theyre probably having a hard time anyways but my health teacher is a trump supporter who doesnâ€™t believe in social distancing.. so :)... he actively encouraged people to go out and see movies in theaters and go to the beach, I donâ€™t feel bad. Today he spent 20 minutes calling out ppl in class for not having their cameras on and it was the most annoying shit Iâ€™ve ever had to listen to
