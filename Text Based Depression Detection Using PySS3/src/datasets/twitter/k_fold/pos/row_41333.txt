If the only thing you care about is videogames/tv/memes you are a boring person. No one wants to date someone with no interests or hobbies no one will want to be around you.

Find things you like doing.

Have experiences to remember it will make you interesting.

Thereâ€™s more to life than sitting on your ass playing video-games.
