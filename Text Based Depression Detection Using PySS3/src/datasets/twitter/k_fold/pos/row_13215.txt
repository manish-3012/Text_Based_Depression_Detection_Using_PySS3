I need help with cheering up my gi- my fr... my uhh... girlf- limbo friend? Hmm well you get it Basically so if you're stalking me you know from my recent posts i am in some kind of weird relationship with a girl where we both like each other a lot romantically and physically and we talk to each other like we're dating, but technically we're just friends

Basically, lately she's been pretty sad and anxious for unknown reason, she says she's overthinking things a lot and overall she's pretty nervous, plus the pandemic and school are making it worse for her.

I have the feeling it's probably because she's kinda scared to be in a relationship with me, even if we just talk online, and even if i'm okay with that, i would not like her to be anxious because of it, because she could be thinking i may not be interested in her if she acts in some way or another.

I'm not sure if that's a correct thought, but if that's the case i am trying to explain to her that i like her so much it would be pretty hard for me to even slightly think of not wanting to be with her.

If that's not the case, could you guys help me understand better what's happening, and maybe find out a way to help her? I really want her to be happy.
