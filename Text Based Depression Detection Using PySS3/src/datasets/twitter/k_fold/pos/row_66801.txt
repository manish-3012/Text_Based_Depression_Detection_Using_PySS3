i am proud of my self today i learnt how to do a layout back flip and a tuck backflip :D   


a few years ago i tried to do a back flip and landed on my neck. i severly hurt my neck and back but i can still walk which is good. from the point on i said to my self that i would practise easeir stuff and be good before i try it again. it has taken a while but i can now do it!  


i might post a vid later when i got it better today :D
