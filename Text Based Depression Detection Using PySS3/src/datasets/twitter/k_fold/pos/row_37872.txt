My thoughts on doritos cool ranch It recently became kosher and avalible in israel so i can finally try it here are my thoughts:

 i heard that this is one of the most popular flavors in usa 5 days ago in my first time trying it i didnt like it that much and i really didnt understand how its one of the best flavors in usa but today i tried it again because the only avalible options were that and plain and no one likes plain and i changed my mind i actually like it a lot its not what i would consider the best doritos in israel i still like the israeli flavors more (most of them cuz some of the israeli flavors are bad but most arent) if you're israeli tell me what were your thoughts.
