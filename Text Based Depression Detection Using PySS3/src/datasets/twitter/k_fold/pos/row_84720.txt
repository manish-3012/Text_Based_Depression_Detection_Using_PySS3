Everyone's screaming My dad has a hoarding problem and we *finally* convinced our mom to let us clean. Of course he doesn't like it, and everyone is really fed up with him so we all fight all the time. My siblings are older so they are doing most of the work, but hearing the constant screaming still hurts. I feel like a little kid, I just want to curl up into a ball and cry until it's over but I can't. It's my senior year so I have to so good in school. My grades dropped a lot since the start of quarantine but I just can't bring myself to try to get them back up. I feel so apathetic sometimes and I hate it.
