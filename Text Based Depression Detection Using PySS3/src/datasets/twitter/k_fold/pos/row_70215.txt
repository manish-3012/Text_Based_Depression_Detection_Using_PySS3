I feel like standard YouTube click doesnâ€™t work for anybody anymore. Like the titles that have all caps and a really heavily edited video thumbnail. Like I feel the YouTube videos that do go â€œviralâ€ are the ones that have direct titles and have either a simple thumbnail or just no thumbnail at all. Easy example I can think of is the â€œdog eats bean burrito in 1 secondâ€.
