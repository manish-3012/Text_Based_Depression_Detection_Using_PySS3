My friend flexed his Roblox items to the entire fucking class yesterday Ok so it was the end of class and people randomly starting turning on presentation mode. One person showed a second of random Minecraft footage, and one person decided it was a good idea to just randomly show his Roblox inventory and MM2 items. Everyone in the chat was like "Bruh" and "Imagine playing Roblox in 2020"

I told my whole family about this. My dad asked if I wanted to do the same lmao.

AITA for going to online classes?
