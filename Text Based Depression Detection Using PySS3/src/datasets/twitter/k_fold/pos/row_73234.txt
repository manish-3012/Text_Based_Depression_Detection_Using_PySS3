I have a GREAT start to the school year. My dad came home early from work saying he felt weird, and he's been working around guys that have COVID. My mom woke me up this morning saying she was really sorry I couldn't go to school this morning (I have this walk through thing that helps guide us through our whole school day) since my dad might have COVID and he possibly passed it to us.
