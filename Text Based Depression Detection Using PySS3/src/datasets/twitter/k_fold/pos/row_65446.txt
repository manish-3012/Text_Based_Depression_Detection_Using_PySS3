My Future is Fucked. I donâ€™t know what to do in the future. Iâ€™m 15, a sophomore, and I have no idea what I want to do once Iâ€™m done with high school. I have no happiness from doing anything other than talking to this one girl, and she needs some time off from me since I practically bombarded her with this and more. I used to love drawing, but that slowly stopped because I was working on something, but no one else has done anything for it in like 3 months.

The only other thing I even partially enjoy doing is helping other people. But being a therapist is like 12 years of college or something, pays horrible, and is a dead-end job. Iâ€™d much rather help people that want help. Iâ€™d rather help form a friendship and a bond instead of a professional helping relationship. 

Iâ€™m a disappointment of a human being, and Iâ€™ve got no clue what to do. Thanks for reading all this, since I canâ€™t summarize this with a TLDR. Youâ€™re good folks.
