the trueoffmychest post about obesity really pisses me off like, i can agree that its not ok to be obese, but its NOT ALWAYS A CHOICE

im fat. i try to lose weight. i starve myself sometimes and go out walking and running almost every day. i try to eat as healthy as possible

but i can never stay below 105kgs. no matter how hard i try, i gain weight, even if it seems IMPOSSIBLE for it to happen

yes, i have some health issues, such as PCOS and insulin-resistence, but its 100% not my fucking choice to be this way, and fuck you if you think it is

id never choose to be fat. i want to lose weight, i need to, but i fucking cant, no matter how hard i fucking try

so yeah, thats all, fuck that post, bye
