Can we just agree that both men and women face hardships? Men work harder jobs and face more job accidents, have a higher suicide rate, are more likely to get worse punishments than women for the same crime, have the court strongly biased against them in divorce cases, and are just hard working members of society

Women face more risk of getting raped, work hard to raise children and take care of families, are sometimes treated like objects, face higher rates of Depression and anxiety, and are also hard working contributing members to society.

Can we stop with this opression bullshit and just acknowledge that both genders have their own benefits and drawbacks, and then unite to try to help improve one another and the conditions we face? Let's cut the "womens rights" and "mens rights" points of view and just focus on gender equality as a whole.
