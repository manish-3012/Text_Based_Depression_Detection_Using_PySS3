MY CRUSH LIKES ME BACK!!! (For those who care, lol) So a while back I made a post rating my crushes, and the last one, (my current crush) actually confessed to me!!!

We were staying up really late on the phone, we hadnâ€™t talked in weeks because our phones were being screwy, so we started talking again and she started *gushing* about how much she missed me and how great it was to hear my voice and *ahhhhh*

We talked a bit more, and I got really excited because I got a leather jacket for Christmas that I really really like. I sent her a picture of me in it and she kinda freaked out. She told me she had been going back and forth on liking me romantically because sheâ€™s never liked a girl before. She said a mix of the fact talking to me made her so happy, and me being hot in a leather jacket (lol) is what finally convinced her. 

Sheâ€™s still not allowed to date but now at least we both know the feelings are there. Which is nice.
