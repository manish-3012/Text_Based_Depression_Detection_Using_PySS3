Is literally every single post on this sub just a â€œmy crush said yesâ€ joke these days? Okay so I used to frequent this sub â€œback in the old daysâ€ when I was like 15/16 (am now almost 19, so, yknow, getting old. Oof), and it was like... normal stuff. Like there were memes and there were text posts that were genuine. Ppl talking about their lives, asking for advice, venting, etc. and the memes were pretty good.

I realized I hadnâ€™t been on this sub in ages so I decided to come check it out since it used to be always really interesting. And every single post is just one of those â€œmy crush said yesâ€ jokes or totally fake stories for karma. 

Do I just need to sort by new? Like... Iâ€™m genuinely concerned, did this sub really go that far downhill ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸? 


Sorry I probably come off as bitter or whatever, I donâ€™t mean it that way. More just like- Iâ€™m concerned!! Are there any like, normal posts on here anymore? Am I here on karmawhore day w/o realizing it?
