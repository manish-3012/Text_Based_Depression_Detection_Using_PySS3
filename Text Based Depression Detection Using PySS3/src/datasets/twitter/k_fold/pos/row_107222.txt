So I had a playlist for bus/subway for school. Now whenever I play it I feel like im on the train Ok so I had a specific playlist I usually popped on leaving the house. Now I eventually added a lot more songs so whenever I hear one of them I feel like im back on the train, does that happen to you guys too?
