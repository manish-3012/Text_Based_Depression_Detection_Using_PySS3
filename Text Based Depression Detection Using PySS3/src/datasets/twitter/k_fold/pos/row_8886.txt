I finally beat my favorite 3D Mario game I played Mario Galaxy a lot as a kid on my Wii but some reason could never beat the final level. I'd always need my older brother to beat it for me. A few years ago I replayed Mario Galaxy on my Wii U's Wii channel but ended up forgetting I was playing it so I never beat it. Now I'm playing it on my Switch and after all these years, I finally beat Super Mario Galaxy on my own. The nostalgia is hitting hard.
