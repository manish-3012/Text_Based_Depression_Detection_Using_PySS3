I did it. I actually did it.  So I started talking to this girl a couple of weeks ago and I started to like her. We have 2 mutual friends who were always asking if we are going to get together, so me and this girl started to pretend we're together to prank them. And last night I told her that she's really cute and she answered "Are you starting to catch feelings too?", then I asked her what that "too" ment, she said something in the lines of "yes, are catching feelings or no." Then I told her yes. I have a girlfriend now, I'm sooo happy, I can't stop smiling. Now I'm gonna tell you what my friend told me "If I could do it so can you".
