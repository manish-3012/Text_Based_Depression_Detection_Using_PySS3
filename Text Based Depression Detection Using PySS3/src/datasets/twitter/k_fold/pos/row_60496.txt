So, I got broken up with. I'm not asking for pity, or encouragement, I'm just ranting a little, today, minutes ago Actually, my gf texted me after basically weeks of not talking to me unless it was for something "important", she asks if we can call and I'm a little fed up, and I say why the hell not, I call her I'm a little frustrated and she says if we can be friends, I oblige almost emotionlessly Because I'm not trying to get pity from her either, and so here I am, single, broken up with because I tried too hard, just needed to get this off my chest, stay safe y'all,â¤ï¸.
