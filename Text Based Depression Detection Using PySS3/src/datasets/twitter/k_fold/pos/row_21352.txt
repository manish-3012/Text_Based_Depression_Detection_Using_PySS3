I am sad Recently I have been feeling this small sadness but today it was truly overwhelming. I felt to motivation today. I just wanted to curl up and sit in silence. 

I donâ€™t know where this has come from. I just feel scared that my life is doomed to fail. I feel like any form of career is not gonna work out and romance wise I feel like nobody is gonna love me. 

I donâ€™t know why I feel like this and I was wondering if anyone else has gone through something like this where they suddenly feel depressed and how they got over it. 

Advice would be greatly appreciated
