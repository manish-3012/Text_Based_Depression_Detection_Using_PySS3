is this considered cheating? so basically I have a girlfriend, it's long distance so it sucks that I barely get to see her. well anyway theres this girl that got transferred into one of my classes and she reminds me so much of my girlfriend and I feel like I'm developing a crush. I love my girlfriend to death and I would do anything for her. it's just something about this other girl.
