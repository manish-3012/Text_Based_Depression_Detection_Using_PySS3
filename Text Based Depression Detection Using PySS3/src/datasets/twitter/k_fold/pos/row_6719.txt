Can we all collectively agree to this? That when our friends, future children, and people closest to us, say that they are having mental health issues, we believe them and talk through it if they want to? My parents and everyone in my life have written me off, saying I should be grateful and happy, when Iâ€™m not. Or when I tell friends itâ€™s always â€œyeah, me too, all the time! Anywaysâ€
