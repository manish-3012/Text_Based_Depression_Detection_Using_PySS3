I'm actually kind of worried for this guy I met on discord Alright so this guy (let's call him josh because idk his real name) has always been pretty cheerful around some of the discord servers i'm in. I met him through a server my friend owns, and we've become pretty decent friends ever since. He has been going through some pretty tough times recently, mainly being that his boyfriend (he's gay, yes) had cheated on him with one of his best friends. He feels horrible and messaged me saying "since when has self harm felt so good?" we talked for a bit, and he's actually serious. I tried to cheer him up and told him if he needs someone to talk to, i'm here but i'm pretty worried for him. What should i do?
