Sheâ€™s gone again and she probably wonâ€™t come back. My dog, Winny, ran away once again. We have an electric fence set up, weâ€™ve had it set up for almost 5 years now, and she just ran past it, yelped, and went on her way.

Sheâ€™s gotten porcupine quills 3 times now, and if she gets them again then we wonâ€™t be able to pay for it, we donâ€™t have the money. My grandma and grandpa were talking about taking her out back and shooting her in the head if she comes back again with porcupine quills since we canâ€™t pay for it. 

Sheâ€™s a good dog, sheâ€™s funny and has a good personality, but sheâ€™s a pain in the ass. She has gotten loose at least 50 times over 4 years, Iâ€™m not exaggerating. 

Sheâ€™s been gone for 6 hours now, we live next to a big forest thatâ€™s occupied by coyotes, bears, and bob cats, so who can say whatâ€™s gonna happen to her. 

I hope sheâ€™s alright, but I donâ€™t see her coming back this time, I just have a strange feeling.

Goodbye Winny...
