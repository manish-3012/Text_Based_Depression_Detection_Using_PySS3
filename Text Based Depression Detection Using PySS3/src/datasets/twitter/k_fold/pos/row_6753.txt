Hi people I have a question! So I'm about to get a Galaxy Note 9 and i cant decide on the color, I'm a guy so I think the black would be more fitting, but the purple is cheaper, not $100 cheaper but $20 and that's a lot in broke teen eyes. So what do you think? Black and pay more, or Purple and possibly get fucked with. 

Any opinion is thanked!
