Im so angry My sister got a lizard a while back and enjoyed it for a little bit but then she started to stop caring for it. My father was the main one who cares for it while she did little to nothing. I never bothered with it because it wasnâ€™t mine but then one day I decided to take it up to my room and I started to like it. I started to take care of it, feed it, change its water out, and clean its tank. My sister found out and she got all pissy about it (hormonal 7th grader) that I was holding the lizard and playing with it when it was HERS even tho she never did anything for the lizard. I just had this whole argument over who gets it and she wanted me to pay for it I didnt want to since it was already in the house and she didnt even pay for the lizard it was my dad. My dad said if we cant solve the problem then he will just give it away for free and my bitch of a fucking sister said she was fine with getting nothing she just wanted me not to have it. OMFG IM SO DONE WITH HER BS... I hope she gets some major fucking karma for being a massive bitch.
