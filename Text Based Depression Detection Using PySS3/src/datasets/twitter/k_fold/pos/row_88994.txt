LGBT community of r/teenagers, what do you think about the super straight movement? Before I get a ton of hate for this, I am bisexual and have dated a trans person in the past, that bring said I just find this movement funny as I think it's fucking stupid too call someone transphobic for not wanting to date someone who's trans and I don't believe it deserves a whole sexuality, would like too see other people's opinions on this, p.s. the super straight community has said there is super gay as well meaning only the same biological gender
