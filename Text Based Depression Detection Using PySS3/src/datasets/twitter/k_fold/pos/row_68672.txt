Iâ€™m so pissed that my mom moved my brother into my room. I totally makes sense because it was 3 brothers in 1 room and then a sister (me) in the other. But like, to have privacy for all of my life and then suddenly at 17 lose it? As I am going into college? It makes absolutely no sense. And now the two oldest are in the same room while the two youngest are in another. Wouldnâ€™t it make more sense to put the 5 year old in my room rather than the 11 year old? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t fucking get it, but itâ€™s annoying because we had always planned on me moving out at 19 or 20 but I donâ€™t want to deal with this bullshit for 2 more years. I was so used to being able to have the light on in my room after 10, being able to make sound, even play guitar at night. Now I canâ€™t do shit, and I have to use a flashlight when I go to bed and be super quiet. Not to mention everyone just barges in my room now all the time (itâ€™s like a free for all). No one knocks and they know how to unlock the door really quickly. I hate the lack of privacy and it is really getting to me. Unfortunately the smart thing to do financially is just stay at home and deal with this while I save up money, but God it is really affecting my mental health. (No, I canâ€™t dorm, my college is 15min away and itâ€™s not worth the $8k a semester.)
