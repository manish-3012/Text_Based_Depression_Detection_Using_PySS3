I came out to my parents as genderfluid today!! They took it really well, and Iâ€™m going to start using they/them pronouns in real life now!! Iâ€™m going to reach out to my guidance counselor and ask about using they/them pronouns at school and with teachers and maybe using the gender neutral bathroom too!! 

I donâ€™t mean to seem like Iâ€™m just trying to get karma or anything but Iâ€™m really excited and just wanted to talk about it somewhere, so thank yâ€™all that actually read this.
