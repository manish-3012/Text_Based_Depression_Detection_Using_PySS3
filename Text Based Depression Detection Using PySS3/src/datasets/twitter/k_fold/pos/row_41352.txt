I Need You To Give Me A Good Argument I really want a rat. like, really REALLY want a rat. I can't right now, because my cat has FIV, (like HIV for humans,) but when he dies i hope to get one. My parents are both fine with it, but they said i have to share it with my brother. someone help me think of an argument so that i don't have to share, or for them to get two rats
