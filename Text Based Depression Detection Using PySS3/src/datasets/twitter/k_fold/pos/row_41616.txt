Greetings, My children. Be humbled in my presence. I bring you a question. My children, my offspring... Rejoice! For I am here. I guess you are wondering "Oi! wot you doin' ere?" Well, I bring you with a question, A survey, If you will. For all my existence, I have been guiding you; And now, my children, you can return the favour. I ask you this: Why the fuck do you like toes? Why?
