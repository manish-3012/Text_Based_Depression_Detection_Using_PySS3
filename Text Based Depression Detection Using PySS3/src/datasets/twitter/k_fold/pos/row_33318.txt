Please don't be toxic about NNN Every year j see people getting so triggered and butthurt that someone chose not to partake in an internet trend. NNN is just that, an internet thing. If people don't wanna partake in NNN, who care. Personally I think NNN is stupid but if people wanna do it and it makes them happy then good luck to them



Tldr, be nice people
