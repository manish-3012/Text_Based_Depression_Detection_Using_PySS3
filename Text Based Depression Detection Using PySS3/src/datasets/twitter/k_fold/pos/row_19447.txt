MY GIRLFRIEND CAME BACK ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­â¤ï¸ She was at the psychiatrist for 13 torturous days, but FINALLY!

She came back ðŸ¥°

Today was a really rough day... someone told me my race/ethnicity doesn't exist, and another told me that I'm a mysogynist just because I was a man, which really stressed me out and ruined my day, but once I saw that my princess is back, I jumped out of happiness!!!!! And my day got made and my happiness meter has multiplied by millions!

Those were a really tough two weeks. They were so hard for me, but it is so goddamn worth it!

I felt so warm and wholesome when she called me a princess once again ðŸ¥ºðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­â¤ï¸
