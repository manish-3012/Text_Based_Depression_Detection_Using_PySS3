What kind of person am I? I like being alone, and I like being with people. I love wearing hoodies, listening to music and cutting myself out. I want to make friends, but even if we start hanging out after some talks, I start to behave really weird, and people start to gravitate away from me. I have a few close friends that I love spending time with. I'm often very anxious and blue, but at the same time I'm often very happy and positive, mostly when I'm talking to someone. I think I may be a social introvert, but simultaneously I feel like I'm way too sociable and way too closed off.
