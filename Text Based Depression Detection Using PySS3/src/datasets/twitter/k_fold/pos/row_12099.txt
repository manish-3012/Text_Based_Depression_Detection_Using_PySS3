Should i get braces? Im a M at 17 yo and i have a really hard time deciding if i should get braces or not. My teeth are straight its just that my two front teeth are overlapping slightly. Its an insecurity of mine but is it worth 1.5 years to fix it? Braces are free were i live until you turn 18 so its like a now or get broke kinda thing too.
