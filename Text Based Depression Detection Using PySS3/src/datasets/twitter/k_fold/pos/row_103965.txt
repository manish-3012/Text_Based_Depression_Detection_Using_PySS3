So i tried to ask a girl out This morning i sent a girl i like a message on Facebook messanger and asked her if she would like to go out this saturday with me. At 12 pm i went happily to school, talked with a couple of the bois and i saw her. I talked to her a bit, and a classmate who im friends with told me they were togheter. My stomach just sank and i became so sad i almost fucking cried right then and there with all my classmates present. I go to class normally and i just think about it. I delete the message i sent her (she didnt see it yet) and continued about my day depressed as fuck. At 7 pm i went home and talked to some other friends about it.

Tldr: I tried asking a girl out, my friend and her were a couple and i became really depressed,
