Iâ€™m fine with using pronouns like he/him xe/xim but iâ€™m not calling you kitten/kittenself Honestly youâ€™re delusional if you think iâ€™d care enough to remember your neopronouns. Iâ€™m not calling someone doll/dollself.

I fucking hate this generation so much. If this is what this world turns into iâ€™m going to mars I fucking hate some people.
