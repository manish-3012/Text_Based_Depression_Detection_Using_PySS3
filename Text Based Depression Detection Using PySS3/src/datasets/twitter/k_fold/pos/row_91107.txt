Are my parents overprotective? So I am a 17 yo guy and i think my parents are overprotective because they want me to be home at 11 PM and if am not they call me like there is no other day and if by chance my phone is on vibration and I don't answer they get so mad, they don't sleep and they are stressed and at least one of them is awake when I arrive home. Or another thing my house is small we have 2 bedrooms (one is mine and the other is theirs), a bathroom and a kitchen merged with a living room, and our house is a duplex in a way or another,in the "other house" (I put it in quotes because it is the same house but with a different entrance and separated by a brick wall) my dad keeps junk like old boxes full of stuff, furniture, tools and any other thing that you could imagine from pc cables to car parts, where I want to go with this is that I want to move there so I don't bother them anymore and I don't have to deal with them I want my privacy(I want privacy because my dad thinks if I shave my pubic or under arm hair I am gay or I am a woman and only woman should do those things, even when i tried to fix my unibrow he mumbled some stuff...) maybe i want to come home with a girl or idk party with a friend, but they don't want to move or at least tidy up the place so I am stuck in a room next to them all day and the only place that I can stay with a girl is outside in parks. What do you think about all of this?
