Should I vape thc just for tonight? I haven't caught covid yet I told myself I'd quit and I haven't vaped in about a month and a half, but I'm currently going through one of the most stressful times in my life and I'm thinking about taking a half second hit on the lowest setting for just tonight.

My 2 friends that don't vape got bad fevers and others were asymptomatic. I'm moving out in 4 months and am buying edibles only from there on out. I've been trying to rest my lungs but damn y'all. Should I smoke just for tonight?
