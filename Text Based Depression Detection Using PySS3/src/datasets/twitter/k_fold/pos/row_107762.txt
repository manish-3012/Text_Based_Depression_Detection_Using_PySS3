My school year has been a shit show, here's why My teachers have been very proud and vocal about our district being one of the best in the country, and i never understood why, i have never had a good learning experience there was always something  that went wrong and something that was just stupid. but none of those years have even come close to as much of a shit show as this year. i have been doing online school and every single one of my teachers are older the age of 60 or are in there 50/40 but act like baby boomers. for the first 2 months of school we could not access the files for 4 of my classes because the teacher could not figure out how to change them from private to public (we tried to help her, but she would not accept any help). the entire class commonly does not complete the homework because 1. the teacher did not tell us we had homework 2. the homework was not in the assignments tab 3. the page of completely empty and was just a blank screen 4. the homework has zero instructions. and when this does happen its all our fault and the teacher did nothing wrong. there are sooooo many small thing and big things that make school unbearable, I have never had that bad grades always over C+ or B's but this year i have an F in 4 classes. before i could go to school and yeah it was boring but at least i could talk with friends and i had some free time, now i have 5 hours of zoom classes a day, and so much homework that i have not been able to play games or anything in 8 days. i am writing this in a zoom meeting for fucks sake! every morning on a school day i feel like crying, every weekend i am so happy to just have 2 days of no teachers and zoom. if anyone else is have an experience similar could you give me some tips, this is just painful.
