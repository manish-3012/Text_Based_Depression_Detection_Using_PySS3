AHS is a curse it changes how you look at songs The song "Tonight You Belong To Me" I see as a creepy song when thats not what its meant to be. It was first written by [Billy Rose](https://youtu.be/33PFsybEWpg) in 1926. You can't even find it by him on spotify. The only recording I can find are really bad ones on youtube. Then there's 1927 by [Gene Austin](https://youtu.be/S-HoFhLRuO4) and boy is the tone so much different. Also [Roger Wolfe Kahn](https://youtu.be/ctqlO_aeRUk) which is crackly and has a different tone. Now were in the 1952 with [Frankie Laine](https://youtu.be/nZ1x_dDiQ8o) which has a chorus and sung much louder. Next were on [Patience &amp; Prudence](https://youtu.be/fOjVjc5vJ6I) 1956 which sounds like how I know the song. But were not done this song has more history. Still 1956 [Lawrence Well with The Lennon Sisters](https://youtu.be/n8bmXG4MtPI) it sounds close to the one I know, but different. The history continues now by [George Maharis](https://youtu.be/iX_tV46D9NY) 1964 sounds close to the one I know just its a duo now. Now onto [Dottie West](https://youtu.be/iW8xG-LRSgk) the tone is more joyful and has chorus of men in the background.  And thats the history of this song sorry I'm bored and looked into this and wanted to share. Sorry I'm bad at describing songs tones and stuff so I tagged all the versions of this song as I listed them.
