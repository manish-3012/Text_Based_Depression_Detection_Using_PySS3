My Spanish teacher was a bit confused In Spanish tutoring he was reviewing how to say different body parts in Spanish and the last word he went over was â€œla cabezaâ€ which if you donâ€™t know is â€œheadâ€ in English. He started talking about how he hears â€œheadâ€ in a lot of American music and asked the 7 kids including me in tutoring what it meant. Everyone just stayed silent and waited till he moved on. He was confused as to why no one answered but I hope he looked it up for himself.
