why the hell are teachers and administrators so strict on social distancing, while they are closer than us? Everyday I walk through the halls of my current school to get to my classes. There are these stickers that tell you where to stand and walk throughout the buildings. I get yelled at to â€œspace outâ€ and to be mindful of what you are doing, and thatâ€™s good for us. Honestly, no one would do that if it wasnâ€™t enforced; but these people who yell at us and cuss at us to space out and be distant, are never distanced themselves. I always see two or more teachers talking in small groups, way closer than the required distance of 6 feet. They then jump out of their small conversations and bark at us to get away from themselves. PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH pleaseeeeeeeee
