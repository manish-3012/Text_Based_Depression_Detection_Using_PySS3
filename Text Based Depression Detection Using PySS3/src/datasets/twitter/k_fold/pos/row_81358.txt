Do people actually leave once they stop being a teenager? And if you stop being a teenager would you leave this sub? 

Do you think itâ€™s appropriate for someone to leave once they become adults?

Also between the ages 17/18 to maximum 23, there probably isnâ€™t much development/ maturity in most cases so what age range would it be weird to be in this subreddit?

Not assuming anything, I donâ€™t mind the age range but it would be nice to get everyoneâ€™s input just for fun.
