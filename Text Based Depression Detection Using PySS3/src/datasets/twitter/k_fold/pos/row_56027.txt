Is it strange that 2 years ago I played my music a bit loud and hoped my crush could hear it? Yeah I could not and still canâ€™t start a convo for shit so only takes when she initiated it like twice a day so I had the great idea in 7th grade to play my music in my AirPods at max volume while my seat was assigned next to her in class yeah that didnâ€™t really work. Kinda funny tho that I would listen to shit like creep or let her go at max volume on loop for an hour and a half and kinda hope she could fairntly hear it and get the message lmaoooooo what Iâ€™m not depressed at 1:30 typing this out because I have nobody else to talk to ðŸ˜ª.
