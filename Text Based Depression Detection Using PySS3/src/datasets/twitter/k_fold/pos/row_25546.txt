i peed myself this morning I have a uti and this morning i felt my underwear was slightly wet. I was like "ok i started my period" and then i stood up to check and it all just came out. i was like "oh crap my period" but to my real shame, it wasnt blood. not a drop of blood in sight. I had whizzed myself, and i didnt even have the urge to pee. So I started seriously criticizing my life choices and got ready to pull a Sasuke Uchiha dissapearing act. I started cleaning myself up and to my luck i found a pair of leggings the exact colour i was wearing and shoved the old ones far deep in a pile of dirty clothes. 


And my parents have no idea :)
