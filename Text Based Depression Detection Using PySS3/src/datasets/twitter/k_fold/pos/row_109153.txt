I just told the best friend of my crush that I like my crush Help what do I do now sheâ€™s encouraging me to send her texts&amp;amp;amp;from another mutual friend I heard they were together

Update one: sheâ€™s ignoring me &amp;amp; her BFF says â€œshe wouldâ€™ve said that he was sending her WhatsApp messagesâ€

Update two: she did text back but she is â€œworking on herself after her breakup a couple of weeks agoâ€
