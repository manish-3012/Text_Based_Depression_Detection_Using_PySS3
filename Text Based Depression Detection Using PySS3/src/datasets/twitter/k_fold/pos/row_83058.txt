Goodnight everyone! Here's something that made me happy today: For the first time in a year, I was able to visit my parents' graves at the cemetery. After being placed on a waitlist due to the pandemic, I scheduled my visit for today, and drove there.

I feel so relieved after feeling guilty for so long.. not being able to visit them. I miss them a lot, but this trip gave me a lot of solace. Even if sometimes I don't want to live for myself, I'm going to try and live for them.

Goodnight everyone. &lt;3
