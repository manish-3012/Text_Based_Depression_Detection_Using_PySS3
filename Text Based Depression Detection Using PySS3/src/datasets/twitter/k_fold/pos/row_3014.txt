Quarantine and my mental health So I live in Hungary, where we have been in lockdown for 2 months. We have an 8 o'clock curfew, restaurants are only open for take outs, and a bunch of other stuff but the rule that really screw me up is that all the high schools are closed. I've been struggling with my mental health for about 2 years now ( I'm in therapy), and last summer was the happiest and most healthy time of my life. Now I feel like I'm back at square one. The reasons my mental health approved are my friends, and just people in general. I'm very social, and people motivate me. Now that I can't have the safe life and surroundings that I built for myself I lost it. My substance abuse is worse than ever, I have zero motivation to get through the day, I have trouble eating, sleeping, concentrating, studying. I went into a downward spiral and I'm really scared cuz I don't know where it ends. I sometimes meet up with a couple of friends, but it doesn't seem to help a lot. I really really want to go back to school on monday, but it seems like they are gonna keep these regulations. Which I get ofc, our death rate is terrible.
I really really don't want to hurt myself again, but if I keep feeling lonely, and lost, and like I have no control over anything I might. I want this f-ing quarantine to be over. I just wanna be happy and stable again.
