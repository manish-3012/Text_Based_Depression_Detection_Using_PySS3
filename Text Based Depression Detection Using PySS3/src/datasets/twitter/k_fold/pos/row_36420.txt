My parents bought a car for me for once I can drive! They werenâ€™t looking for a car yet, but they saw this for sale and not for very much since itâ€™s 22 years old, so after some research, they bought it. I wanted to tell my friends but I couldnâ€™t figure out how to word it without sounding like I was bragging, (because none of them can drive either) so Iâ€™m putting it here!
