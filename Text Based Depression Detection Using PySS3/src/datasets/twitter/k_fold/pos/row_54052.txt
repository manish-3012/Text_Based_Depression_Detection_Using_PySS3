Moved to college and now super anxious Hey everyone, so yesterday I moved into college at about noon, and I was fine until my parents left, and still fine for about an hour after. Then, while I was unpacking, I got hot flashes and a terrible stomachache. I thought I was going to throw up. I started crying and my roommate tried to distract me because that usually helps me with my anxiety but it wasnâ€™t working. I texted my parents for hours, and Iâ€™ll admit, it was pretty annoying. They wouldnâ€™t let me come home (about 2 hours away) so I just gave up and drove myself home even though theyâ€™d be mad. When I got home, they were a little disappointed but they finally understood that going home was what I needed. Anyway, Iâ€™m going back today, but my whole anxiety attack made the college a bad place in my mind and I really hate the thought of going back. I know I have to, but itâ€™s hard. My parents will also no longer be at home anymore. Does anyone have any advice for feeling less anxiety (mainly separation) so I can actually have fun and get through the month until I can go home again?
