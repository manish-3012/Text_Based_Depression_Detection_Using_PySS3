Why the fuck do people like rap music? So I can understand artists like post malone who actually put time and effort into their songs and have lyrics that mean something, it's just not in a style I enjoy. But then you have some dumbass like 6ix 9ine or lil pump who just spout nonsense and people eat it up! Like what in the hell is WAP! How in the god fuck did that sad excuse for a song get to #1 on the charts? It dosent even have a fucking chord progression for christ's sake! People that listen to this crap, please explain to me why cause I honestly have no earthly idea why people would want to listen to this.
