This really pissed me off, and I have no fucking clue what to do Me: Dad, would you be angry if I cut my hair

Dad \*no hesitation\*: Yes

Me: .... How mad...

Dad: Really mad-

Me: is this another one of your jokes?

Dad : No. It isn't. Im being serious, emi.

Background: I live with uh... *controlling* parents. Lately Ive been experiencing some gender confusion, and I feel like I would be way happier with a gender-neutral cut. Is it really that much to ask for? I mean Im young, so cutting my hair shouldn't be a huge problem... I was planning  on doing it but now Im scared. This fucking sucks man.
