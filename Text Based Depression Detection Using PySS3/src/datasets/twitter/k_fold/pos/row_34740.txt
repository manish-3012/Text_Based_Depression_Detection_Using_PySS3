Since itâ€™s Christmas time, I have a Christmas question When I was in elementary school, we read Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and we got a packet we were meant to fill out. thereâ€™s a scene where the kids meet Santa and we werenâ€™t allowed to call him Santa because the book calls him Father Christmas, did anyone else have this experience?
