Timing sucks sometimes and donâ€™t wait to ask your crush out Some info for background: 7 months ago and pre COVID this girl and I were hanging out very frequently and both of us seemingly enjoying each otherâ€™s company. However, a combination of low self esteem and being terrible at picking up at hints lead me to not pursue a relationship over the break. During this time she got a boyfriend but he turned out to be an asshole so they split almost 2 months ago. 

Now in the present: School starts again and I see her more frequently, we start hanging out, we talk about how she was crushing on me back in February. I didnâ€™t think she liked me like that at all and thought she was out of my league so this was a shocker. Also, I was now being hyped up by my friends who hadnâ€™t seen me in person all summer and telling me I glowed up. So my confidence is at an all time high. All of this would lead you to believe that we would start dating and happy ever after. Right? ... Wrong. We talk about it and sheâ€™s still getting over her last ex and her mother wants her to focus on her academics. Thatâ€™s reasonable, and why I would prefer if we dated, Iâ€™m fine with being friends because sheâ€™s pretty awesome. 2 weeks go by and we are still frequently hanging out and neither of us bring up dating. Until 2 nights ago. She brings it up and we talk about it for like 4 hours as we make a bunch of brownies. Everything she is telling me is like she wants to date me right now but canâ€™t because she has reservations. I essentially say the same thing back. She goes home and Iâ€™m left confused and conflicted. I text her telling her that Iâ€™m fine being friends but we canâ€™t flirt or hint at dating if it isnâ€™t going to happen. 

If I had texted her over the break we would likely be dating and I could have avoided this. But I waited to ask my crush out at the worst time. So In summary timing sucks sometimes and donâ€™t wait to ask your crush out.
