So, y'all I use r/teenagers and I'm popular, I walk into my pe class and a girl yells from accross the court "We besties, right, ben?"  and I was like, "yeah, sure, I guess" and then later that day I asked a friend, "she is totally tricking me, right?" cause he was talking to him and I heard her saying something about me, and he responed, "Nah, she totally like's you, but don't take it to far" so, now, I have a girl, that thanks me when I hold open the door. It's fantastic!
