Iâ€™m really thankful I didnâ€™t bring my phone to college on Monday Since I didnâ€™t have my phone to entertain me, I took out my Walkman and tuned into my favourite radio station.  
  
And thanks to them, I discovered a new song, Little Jeannie by Elton John.  
  
Trust me. If you like old music, youâ€™ll love this masterpiece.
