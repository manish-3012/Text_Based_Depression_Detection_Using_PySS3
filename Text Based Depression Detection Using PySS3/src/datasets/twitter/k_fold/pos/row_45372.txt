Why do so many people think disliking/hating someone for their political opinions is a bad thing? Like dude, some people whether they know it or not want to take the rights away of minority groups, why is that not a reason to hate someone? I was talking to an open fascist yesterday who was advocating for a literal fucking ethnostate asking me why I would hate him for his opinions. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT AN ETHNOSTATE. Im not going to be polite to people like that. But this opinion of people shouldnâ€™t hate people for politics is also a conservative and liberal opinion. Some people want to limit rights of others, thatâ€™s not good, why should I not hate those people?
