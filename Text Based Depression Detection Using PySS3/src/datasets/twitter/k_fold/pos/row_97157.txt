It bothers me that whenever people talk about Christians they act like every Christian is a white American like people from other countries and of different races canâ€™t be Christian. I donâ€™t really care all that much most of the time but I think itâ€™s a silly presumption. 

It mostly bothers me because of the whole racist standpoint. Like Christians love using the bible to be racist or what not. Like Iâ€™m not even white or even Western, please try to speak more objectively. 

Completely unrelated thing but it bothers me when some African American people start talking about taking back the religion of their ancestors when they know nothing about it. Most stuff about it isnâ€™t really publicised so you wouldnâ€™t know about it unless youâ€™re actually around it. I mean those guys can believe what they want and I respect them but some of those things are scary. Like witch doctors, too many murders connected to them with none of them actually being arrested. I remember this other guy chopped up his nephew cause a witch doctor told him it would make him rich. When the guy went back with the body the witch doctor was gone and the guy hide the pieces by a river. He was caught tho and the story was even in the newspaper. I know most people donâ€™t believe this kind of stuff but if you ever come this side you must be careful. 

Anyway, have a good day
