I DID IT!! I FINALLY GOT MY FIRST KISS AFTER 17 YEARS OF MY LIFE!!! I saw a post a few days ago about a guy's first kiss and left a comment there mentioning a date with my girl. So if anyone sees the post from there, here's your update. After going through much struggle to arrange a date with her, I finally kissed my girlfriend. It was both of ours first kiss so it felt amazing. We went for it 6 times in a row and the elderly woman next to our seat at the restaurant had pure horror and shock in her eyes while she saw us doing it. It felt heavenly as her lips touched mine :3
