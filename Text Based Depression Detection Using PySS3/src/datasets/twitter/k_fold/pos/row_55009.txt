Pls help... Need this advice for my friend. So... hi guys... hopefully I dont get memed by my friends or anything for this post.

My friend has a weirdly weird sis... that sister is like, the synonym of evil tbh... 

This time, my friend (let he be X)(its a "HE") was bathing... And this little brat wanted to go to the same washroom to pee... obvio he cant show off his "steel body" cuz... its cringe to do that... so he said no.

X's sis: its urgent.

X: go use the other washroom.

U know what that sis did next? 

U see, X had packed all his clothes cuz he was moving... like, shifting to a new house. This brat went and peed on his clothes... in his suitcase! I mean, wtff mahn?? Might sound funny but think it from his side ... that eternal stink of pee on his clothes... how can he even wear them when he remembers that his sister peed on them?

And to make things worse, X's mom supports X's sister telling that he should have opened the door. Bruh. 

Now idk what to do to calm him down... Hes fking pissed and even exams are going on... All the time angry, moody, etc. (This incident happened yesterday).

Hopefully someone knows any option which I might be able to use... btw,Thanks for all your advices in advance.
