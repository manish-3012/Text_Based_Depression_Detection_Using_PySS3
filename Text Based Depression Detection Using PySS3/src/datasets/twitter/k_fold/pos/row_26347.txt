My teacher used the n-word but for teaching and a student tried to "expose him" who do you think is in the right? He used it but after saying he entirely believes that nobody should be saying it to take down people. And he said it for a reference of what people would say as white supremacists during the time period. I will also say he has very obviously implied before that he is a left leaning person who is against racism.

On the other side the student believed he should never be able to say it, no matter the situation. Even though he said the use of the word was entirely educational and that he wouldnt use it anywhere else than the class room. She wanted to have him outed since she wanted him to be reported for ever saying it no matter the purpose.


(For extra context I live in a generally white neighborhood and both the people were white)
