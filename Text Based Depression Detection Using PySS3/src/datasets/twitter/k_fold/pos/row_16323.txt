Gonna confess to my crush!!! Thank you for the support in the previous post! I don't want to ask her out because we are very young (both 12) , and in my country there are a lot of cases of covid. So maybe when things cool down I will ask her out if things go well today. All advice is welcomed bc I need to earn confidence, so I'm gonna text her in an hour maybe.
