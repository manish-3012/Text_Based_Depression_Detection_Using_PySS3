This zoom class sucks rn Yesterday someone didnâ€™t mute themselves and told whoever was in the room with them the class was boring. The teacher went off at them and they got in trouble. It was pretty funny until today, and everyone has to keep their mics unmuted the entire two hour class. You canâ€™t hear anything. RIP to the kid whose parents are currently fighting very loudly.
