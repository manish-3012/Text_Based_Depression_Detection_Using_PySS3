Am I wrong for thinking the way I do about my dad? Covid is an extremely difficult thing to navigate, and it doesn't help that some people turn it political and act as if it doesn't affect lives daily. My parents are divorced and I tend to stay with my mom more often than I do my dad. He has a totally different way of handling covid than my mother and me. I finally bit the bullet today and told him I don't feel safe going over to his house. He freaked out and said that, "this is bullshit". I truly do love him and now I feel guilty for telling him how I feel. Are these feelings warranted, or should I think I did the right thing?
