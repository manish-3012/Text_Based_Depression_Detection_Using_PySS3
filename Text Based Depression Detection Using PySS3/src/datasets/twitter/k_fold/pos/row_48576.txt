If it isn't world generation isn't just fucking me over, then the amount of iron I've been able to find 21w08a tells me why Mojang was scared of ruining Minecraft with a cave update. Over the course of several hours in caves, I've been able to find a total of 4 iron ore blocks, each grouped together in pairs, at a very far distance from each other, and both were in deepslate.

Has it been like this for anyone else, or have I just been screwed over by the world generation?
