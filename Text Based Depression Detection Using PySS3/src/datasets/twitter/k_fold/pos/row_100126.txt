My insecurity (14f) I apparently have a big butt. My parents are always asking me to wear longer shirts and tshirts (in which I don't feel comfortable at all). I looked at myself in the mirror and even when i walked normally, it looked kind of "provocative", if you will. I've always really felt insecure about my butt, but now I feel even more insecure about it. I've tried exercise once or twice, but have always lost motivation to workout. Please advice me on how to overcome my insecurity and how to lose fat in that area (any specific exercises?) . Thank you!
