Man, abusive women, fuck you for real Sorry just have to get this off my chest.
I (m19) have been doing pretty well in the last few months actually, with a bit of underlying loneliness which I mainly related to Corona. In the last few weeks I had a few hook ups and similar due to restrictions getting lighter (I'm from Germany) and I also had a thing with this girl during Corona with which I got along reeeally good and we almost got together but decided against it since we lived a bit apart. We still stayed in contact and had the occasional thing, and since I'm very good with all my exes I didn't see a problem. Now recently I spent more time again with my last real girlfriend (2 years ago) that's since then been in a relationship with her girlfriend. So I started missing the feeling of a relationship and sharing your experiences with a  person who you like (not her, just in general). So today I chatted with girl 1 a bit (she hit me up again bc she felt we lost contact a bit) and since I was sad and I'm always very open with my emotions I talked about my feelings of loneliness. I was really depressed and really needed someone to listen and she did until she suddenly just left to fuck a boy bc she was horny. So now I'm here, left alone, while I'm absolutely destroyed, by a girl I thought I trusted bc she just wanted to fuck, like wtf dk you not have any compassion bitch
