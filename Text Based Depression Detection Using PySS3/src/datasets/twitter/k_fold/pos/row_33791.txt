still salty about the third grade ice cream social some kid won 3 whole baskets out of like 8

and it was all the cool baskets

totally rigged. he was either rich and bought 20 million tickets, or his mom rigged it as she ran the event

i won an ice cream maker tho. i still have it but i never used it.
