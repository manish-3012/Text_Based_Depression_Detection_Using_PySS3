Listen to me everyone Iâ€™d like everyone here to go and listen to your old nostalgic songs and read through the comments remembering memories and the early days of your life. Go be happy, cry, sulk over the fact that we all have lost so much time and now are stuck in the middle of a shithole pandemic with the world falling apart and being pressured to get good grades and have a life. All of you, go relax for 20 minutes, and come back when you all feel better. Think of all the better things to come that we will be able to do. Thank you for reading. I hope you feel better after doing this
