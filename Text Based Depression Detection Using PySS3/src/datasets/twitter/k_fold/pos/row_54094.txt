I have gained a new irrational fear. I now have a fear of insects in my bed while I'm asleep because I found several earwigs in my sheets even after changing them and cleaning my room. It's bad enough I have a huge welt from where one pinched me in my sleep. So if anyone needs me I'm sleeping on my couch.
