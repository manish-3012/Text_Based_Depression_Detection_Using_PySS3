I am officially coming out as super straight. I have really good posture. Like my posture is so good, my spine doesn't even curve. But being super straight like me comes with its own challenges. Standing with this posture can be so tiring, and when I sit, sometimes I feel the sinful temptation to slouch. It calls to me. Dear god, I would love to give in to the temptation and slouch. Even when I sleep, I make sure to keep my posture straight. I must reach my full height! And to anyone else who is trying to be super straight like me, never give up! It may be tiring to try and keep your spine ramrod straight but it's worth it for the extra centimeters of height you get. Girls love it. Trust me. I talk to a lot of girls.
