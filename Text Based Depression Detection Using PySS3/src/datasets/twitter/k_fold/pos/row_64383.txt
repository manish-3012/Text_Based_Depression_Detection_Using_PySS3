I rubberneck for unironic displays of insanity. I am attracted to brokenness, drawn moth-to-flame to walking contradictions in a skirt. I am helpless when someone whispers a metaphor into my ear, and the moment she unlocks 1,000 unrelated memories in me - is the moment I fall so deeply in love that I forget who and what I am, I become a slave to their joy and a servant to their well-being. I am selfish in that I take the word simp and make it look like a joke, not with showers of material wealth of which I have none, not with pink and purple valentines and chocolates leading the way to a turgid be whereupon my progeny might arise to slit my throat an eon later. No. My simpery is in a sad adoration of them, the way a child drew a picture of her mom that looked nothing like her mom? So ugly and pathetic, but so sweet and well-meant, that even if the best I could do for you was  to honor your insanity as a religion: if I were Gollum in the chasm at the end, I would be holding your love over my sinking head so my dying body could honor you until my last boiling heartbeat. I love -- by outdoing what I love in the one I love. You're crazy, I'll outcrazy you to secure your respect. You're emotional, I'll produce tornadoes and perfect storms of emotions to show you how beautiful your tears are, how devastating your smile can be, and how one touch from you could set of depth charges in the quiet sea below the surface of my placid-seeming nature. I do not love \*lightly\*. I rubberneck for disaster people. I love them and I would go down with them in a heartbeat and take every poem with us, broken on a spire, as the harlequin city goes out
