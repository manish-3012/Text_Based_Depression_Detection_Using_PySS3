Girl with heavily suicidal gf back at it again Tw/ suicide ðŸ˜•

Hi again. My girlfriend is heavily depressed/ suicidal and Iâ€™m not sure how to deal with it. 

Sheâ€™s probably the most important thing in my life, so itâ€™s really scary when she randomly tells me that she wants to kill herself and stuff. 

I ask her to vent to me, but she says Iâ€™m too unstable for that. Fair enough. 

She would get a therapist, but her mom is shitty and wonâ€™t let her. (Are minors allowed to get therapists in Canada without a parents consent?) 

She hasnâ€™t gone on her meds for years (bpd/depression) because of the side effects. 

And with Covid, all I can really do is text or phone her, which I do almost constantly. 

Does anyone have any advice to encourage her to open up, if thereâ€™s anything I should mention to her, or just generally how to deal with a suicidal gf? I knwo this is kinda general but this has really been stressing me out lately, and what better place to go than r/teenagers
