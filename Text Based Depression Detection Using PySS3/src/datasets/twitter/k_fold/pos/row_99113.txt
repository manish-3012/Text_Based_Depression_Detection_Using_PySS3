My friend (16F) told me she's sneaking out tonight. Should I call her parents? My friend is 16, and is currently dealing with a lot of mental health issues. She is a very dramatic person and I am not sure if this could ruin our friendship. 

She wants to go out with her friends (not mine) to meet people in a different state. While I don't think she is going to hurt herself or anyone else, I know that she consumes illegal substances like alcohol and weed. Again, she is SIXTEEN.

I am friends with her parents, and I want to call and let them know what she is planning to do. I'm just not sure it is my place. 

Note: Our friendship has been pretty weak recently. I feel she only cares about herself and her own problems and makes thing up for attention. I find myself bot believing her when she tells me things because many of her stories are either impossible or she acts in a way that makes me not believe her.

(IE she was raped a few years ago and I believed her whole-heartedly. She now smokes and drinks with this guy, and brings him to school. Her mom drives her, and her younger siblings. She said he apologized, so it's okay now.)

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure this is in my right to do, and even if it ruins my friendship with her, I'm not sure I would be upset.
