My parents are making me want to run away I understand my grades right now are absolutely shit and everything but for more context last year I had a consistent 4.0.  I am literally enrolled into every accelerated class there is at my school. I have ALWAYS been a good student so they aren't used to me getting bad grades. My mother called me a whore and an asshole cause I am struggling for the first time in school. She also told me since I'm 16 I should be cooking for the whole family and cleaning the whole house everyday because she had to cook for the whole house when she was 15 (Its normal in our culture)  My brother never had to do any work in the house and he is constantly babied despite being TWENTY NINE. I don't care if its a culture thing. We are no longer in our country of origin and I shouldn't have to deal with this fucking misogyny. I admit my grades are horrible and disgusting and I have no excuse for them but im tired of this cultural bullshit. I'm a teenager, I make mistakes, I'm kind immature, but I fucking deserve to have a fucking chance to grow up and learn like every american kid out there. I'm not being spoiled for wanting to have the normal teenage experience and wanting to be treated like a normal human being i can't take this
