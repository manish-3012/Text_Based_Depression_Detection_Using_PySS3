You could say my first week of college went really well! 1) as is obvious, it started in a middle of a pandemic, really limiting opportunities.

2)i thought i missed my first class on my first day, really stressing me out for a little bit 

3)my laptop completely stopped working, and i have had to do half-online schooling from my phone. 

4)i broke up with my girlfriend! 

So yeah. *Good* week.ðŸ˜Ž
