Iâ€™m genuinely terrified for school to end I havenâ€™t been running as fast as I want this season (Iâ€™m on the XC team) and after a lot of reflection I realized Iâ€™m upset not because I actually care too much about some specific goal except getting faster, but Iâ€™m actually terrified because Iâ€™m wasting one of my four years. I feel like Iâ€™m running out of time, like the happiest days of my life are slipping away from me

There was one point, around 8th grade, where I didnâ€™t think your teen years could ever be called your happiest. Now that Iâ€™m in high school, on a team with some of my closest friends, I know why high school is called the happiest times of your life, and Iâ€™m really fucking scared Iâ€™ll lose it without accomplishing everything I wanted to.

Can anyone relate?
