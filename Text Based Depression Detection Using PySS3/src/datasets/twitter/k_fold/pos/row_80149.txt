My fucking roommate lefty her light on ALL NIGHT LONG So itâ€™s the holiday and I wanted to sleep around 11pm and cause this is technically lights out time the main lights are already off. My roommate wants to keep studying so she has her desk light on, itâ€™s pretty bright but fine, fair enough.

I get woken up at 7 am, by her phone ringing and her light is still on except she is also asleep. She is in fact sleeping so well that she doesnâ€™t even get woken up by her phone ringing and just lets it ring out on full volume. 

Anyways, itâ€™s now 8am and I want to sleep more but canâ€™t
