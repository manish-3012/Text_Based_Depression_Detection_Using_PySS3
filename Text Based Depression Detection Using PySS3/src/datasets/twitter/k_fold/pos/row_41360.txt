To whomsever it may concern, plz check tho ( from a fellow teenager ) I just got a ps4 after a struggle of 5 years , being jealous of others and watching them play on their consoles. I however don't have any game to play with it , ( except ofcourse warzone ) I would be very kind to a rich man who could help me with something, like a PlayStation Store Wallet code. It would make my day :D 
Regards,
A fellow teenager
