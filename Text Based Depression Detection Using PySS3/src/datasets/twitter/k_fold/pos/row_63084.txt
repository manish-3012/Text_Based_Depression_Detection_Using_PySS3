I messed up and now I have feelings for my friend. Shit. We were watching a horror movie, him and I (15F), and we built this pillow fort sort of thing, and we even had stuffed animals. So it was just us, on the ground, with a blanket and stuffed animals.

During a jump-scare, I screamed and jumped onto him and hugged him. He just let me, and then (I swear i didnt realize I did this) I ended up holding his hand and arm. 

I realized after a minute and went "Oh, shit, sorry." 

He just shrugged and said it was all right. 

Then, when I stayed holding his arm. I was scared, okay? But I kept thinking about it. And how like he was so close to me. 

So, when I let go of his arm to grab another stuffed animal, I slumped down next to him again, and he put his hand on my chest and grinned "You can keep holding on, scaredy-cat." 

So, I held his hand this time. And every few scary scene I'd squeeze his hand and he'd do it back. 

Now, its 1 AM and here I am. Thinking about him. His hand. His face. Shit.
