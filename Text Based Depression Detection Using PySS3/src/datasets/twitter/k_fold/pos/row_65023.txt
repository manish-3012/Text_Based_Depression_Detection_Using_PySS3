Unpopular Opinion: Looks are important too Don't get me wrong, obviously personality is super important and if you don't get along a relationship won't work either.
But if you're just not attracted to a person ( Attraction doesn't mean that they have to fit in the general beauty standard) it's also a problem.
I think people are lying to themselves if they say personality is the only thing that matters.
