My dad is forcing me to socialize I'm an introvert, so i'm really not that much of a social person. But my dad will not have it. "I'm just trying to direct you to the right path". "You don't understand the mistake of not going out with friends". I keep trying to tell him that it's just how i am, it's my personality. But he just wants me to go out with friends, and he won't have it any other way. Another problem is that most of my friends are pretty much extroverts, but they don't really seem to care and don't invite me to hang out. What the hell do i do?!
