Itâ€™s my one year anniversary of being single!! Man this has been such an upgrade!  The girl was really a dick and broke up with me on our 2nd year anniversary when I had gifts and stuff planned, and I was trying to fix our relationship, but she broke up with me and got with my best friend lol. (he was actually very cool about it and weâ€™re still friends) Overall tho, itâ€™s been a huge upgrade for me!  Of course, I was very depressed for a majority of 2020, but now Iâ€™m(usually)way happier!  Life is so much better.  She was incredibly toxic and I had a hard time realizing that without people giving examples that I didnâ€™t see due to my love blindness or whatever.  I wonâ€™t go into it unless someone asks, but yeah, I live a much less stressful and guilty life now!  

Quite the 180 from the usual posts here, huh? Haha
