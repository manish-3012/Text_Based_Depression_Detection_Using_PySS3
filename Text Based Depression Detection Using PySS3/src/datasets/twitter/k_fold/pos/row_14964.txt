Using this sub as a diary day 8 Today i wake up to a nightmare about my old house, damn,I really need therapy I'll have to add it to the list of things I'll do when i get of here. Also at school i had a lot of inconveniences so I think it could be seen as a bad day...but it haven't destroyed my will to leave this place and keep the fight 


Rating my day was a 6/10 full of bad thing but it's what's on my mind that matters so let's see tomorrow
