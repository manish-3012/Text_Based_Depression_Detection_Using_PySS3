Why is it wrong to not have lofty goals? Some people are just not ambitious and I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s so wrong about that. Recently some 30 yr old was shitting on a guy because he said his childhood dream was to be a barista. Just because the guy has the means to do something â€œbetterâ€ or â€œsmarterâ€ this older guy was saying that he should set his goals higher and scrap whatever dreams he had and go bigger. But why tho. Lifeâ€™s gonna come at you and the advice that should be given is to not waste an opportunity when presented. But why shit on people for not dreaming that high? I thought it was a cute dream and felt really bad when the older guy said this. Like do I not deserve respect if I donâ€™t do some high and mighty job? And if do deserve respect no matter the job then why u shitting on that dream. I thought that it sounds fun to be a barista and go to concerts every weekend and if youâ€™re financially stable whatâ€™s the problem. I guess Iâ€™m just affected by this because I respected this 30 yr old and valued his opinion. Let me know what you think. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.
