I(15M) get very emotional I hear a lot about men shouldnâ€™t get emotional or cry and I ignore that but I feel like get upset a lot. Idk if this is normal and hoping you guys could help me out. Donâ€™t bother with awards or the â€œyou are amazingâ€ Iâ€™m not looking for a pick-me-up just some answers.
