I want her again I thought I was over my crush and the fact I blew an opportunity to shoot my shot at her when it looked like she may have very well had interest in me.

Apparently not because I ran into her at the park on Sunday and I still had that kind of interest in her. We didn't say a word to each other (pretty sure we're both shy so it's lowkey better in most situations, I hate being called out by other people I don't really talk to). I'm gonna be at that park all summer balling on the court though so maybe I can try and get something going?
