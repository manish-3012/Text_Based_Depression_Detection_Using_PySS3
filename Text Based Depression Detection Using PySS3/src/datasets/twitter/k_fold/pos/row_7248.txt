I have 140 pages of reading to do in English and a whole unit of geometry that i do not fuckin understand because my school thinks that starting the day with two 1.5 hours exams is a good idea. Weirdly, I genuinely don't care. I used to tell myself that i didn't care while in reality I was stressing out. This time I actually don't care at all and it feels amazing. Two years ago I would be on my desk studying my ass off and maybe having a panic attack from time to time, now im just swiping through reddit and re-watching hymym for the 3rd time. Ofc my parents wouldn't be proud of me for that, but I am because now I feel better. Also, one of the few perks of doing a test online is that you have access to enternet (true, we are monitored by a second devices camera but one can go around that easily) and i actually don't feel guilty cheating because I know that the school doesn't feel guilty being freaking ridiculous. I will still study those subjects, because I like them, but I'll study them on my own pace because that way im actually interested. And I will actually progress more than I would if I was studying stressed. Why am I writing about this? No idea.
