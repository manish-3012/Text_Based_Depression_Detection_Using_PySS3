Ive seen so many flirting tutorials, so heres a story i would like to share. So when i was 11, i  was sorta the one boy that girls hung out with without feeling weird. One of my freinds was a tomboy who hated all things girly. So we started a buisness at school together.
C &amp; J matchmaking.
Heres the catch: we never helped ppl get who they liked. In c&amp;j we made fake instructions on how to flirt for our clients. Heres how it worked:
Step1:They would come to us to tell us who they like.Then we would ask them how much of a relationship they wanted.
Step 2: We would talk about whether or not that is a good person for that guy or gal.
Step 3: Tell client to flirt based on fake instructions,.
Step 4: ask target who they like [the target is the crush ], and then they will automatically start flirting with whoever they like, because after a while our buisness had a rep which was when we ask you,  someone likes you. But they didn't know we would lie and say that the targets crush was who asked us to help.
Step 5: tell client that crush likes him or her. THIS WILL GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE.
Step 6 bring target, client,and targets crush together if we dont think clients crush is good. The target will flirt with their crush.
Step6again: bring target and client together and me [c] or my friend would tell the target the feelings if we think she or he is a good match.
Why?
Because our system was more about who the crush is, how toxic they might become, and why you like them. If our client liked them for one reason that would be a no.
But if the client said at least 4 things and we found 9 common things, we qould boost his confidence and convince target that she or he was a good match.Remember, confidence is key, and flirting is not. 
Good luck guys.
