My friend is gone He didnâ€™t die or anything, but we havenâ€™t seen each other in person or even heard each othersâ€™ voices for 8 months (different schools + being really busy a lot of the time + quarantine + parental bullshit making us unable to call), and today 2 hours before my friend group was going to meet for a planned â€œreunionâ€ he said he couldnâ€™t go, disabled all messaging apps and social media, explained nothing to anyone, and has basically become a ghost. Fuck man
