Advanced NNN strategy - watching ecchi anime NNN this year feels like someone flipped the switch on hard mode. 
Previous years, I would get distracted all day by school and hobbies but now cuz of Covid I donâ€™t go out much and I have to put out an inner fight with myself every time I see a random thot on my twitter timeline.

To the point: I think I found an advanced strategy for NNN since all the basic oneâ€™s wouldnâ€™t work ,,on hard modeâ€. That is - WATCHING ECCHI ANIME FOR THE PLOT.

Iâ€™ve been watching a Youtuber named Gigguk and he made a video reviewing a new controversial anime - Interspecies reviewers. Basically itâ€™s about a bunch of guys in a fantasy world having sex with many different girls of many different species (elves, succubi, salamanders, ..) and writing a review about their experiences.

The main problem for me during NNNâ€™s was almost instantly nutting by only seeing a twitter thot appear randomly on my timeline since I distanced myself from all the sexual stuff and seeing it after a long time just always made me lose.
Thatâ€™s why I think this strategy is so brilliant. You watch so much sexual stuff that some mere thots wonâ€™t do anything to you! It may seem challenging, but if you watch for the plot, it is really entertaining even without having to fap to it (thatâ€™s why I recommend echi anime and not hentai because hentai has mostly sex and no plot).

Wadduyu guys think? Anyways, good luck all on your NNN yourney! 



TL;DR: overwhelm yourself with etcchi anime so that egirl thot taunts will be useless against you and will not make you lose
