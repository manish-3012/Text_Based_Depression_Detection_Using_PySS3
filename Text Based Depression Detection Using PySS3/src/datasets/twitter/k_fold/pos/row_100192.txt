I really like going out in the rain Why do people run inside and use umbrellas when it rains? I don't go outside much because of the pandemic, but I always go in the backyard when it starts raining. I just don't understand why people hate it so much. I also don't understand why people like weather so hot that you sweat. My ideal weather would be cool and rainy.
