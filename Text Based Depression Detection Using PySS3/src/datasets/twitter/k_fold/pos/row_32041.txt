It's possible to have a serious discussion with your fathers? I think not. I was walking with my fathers and I tried to ask they about their opinion of what tf the old people consider games make you violent, cuz they don't consider that the war in movies or books make you violent too. They don't have even considered the question and they started to laugh and say that this wasn't a serious theme. It's very frustating the fact that they will NEVER take me seriously cuz of my age. What do you think?
