Dear Moderators of this sub Another user made this post but it needs more light because it is true

 

i have been working hard to make relatable memes for my fellow teenagers, but they seem to be a poaching bot that doesnâ€™t allow pre made formats. i feel like the addition to [u/MAGIC\_EYE\_BOT](https://www.reddit.com/u/MAGIC_EYE_BOT/) was nice because it eliminates possible reposting, but the bot just completely removes any post with pre-made templates.

For example: I have uploaded 3 different memes that I made with mematic, which were (not fully) origional content. i used a template and psoted my fresh relatable meme about a school scenario, and poof. 1 minute later, my post was removed because of: â€œidentical or slihtly modified image recently posted hereâ€. i think you should have the bots programmming reconstructed so the bot can depict the difference between text colour, position and other tags on post, so the meme doesnâ€™t get taken down because of possible repost. im honeslty so mad about this because I see other memes using the template get posted, and not taken down.

i say this for probally more than just myself, but I would like the Magic Eye Bot removed from this sub.
