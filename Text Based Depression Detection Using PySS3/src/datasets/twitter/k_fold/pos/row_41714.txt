I once stole something I once stole money from church donation box. Once I saw a happy 3 year old running to the store with a 10 dollar bill, yep I stole it and he started crying, but I still kept it. Once somebody asked me for 2 tens for a twenty. As soon as she gave me the money, I ran. One time I told the cashier that I already given him the money but Nope I didnâ€™t. I got free stuff along with changes. I once got 2 twenties instead of one from a cashier but I never gave one back. I once told some kid to do some yard work for $10 bucks and he did, that stupid kid worked his butt off for like 2 hours but at the end I told him to get the hell out and never gave him the money. These are jokes. Donâ€™t downvote. I once stole 2 bucks from my own pocket. One time, my mom gave this cancer kid 50 bucks and the kid put it under his pillow and I was like what is he gonna do with money, heâ€™ll be dead soon, soo I took the money. I once shop-lifted a box of condom but for some reason all of them had a tiny hole at the end. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
