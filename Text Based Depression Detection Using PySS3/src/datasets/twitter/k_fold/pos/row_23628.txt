Why canâ€™t anyone see it? Centrism, and corporatism is the way everyone suffers

Communism is bad but the only ways that the people have good conditions is under democratic socialism and libertarian capitalism

In socialism everyone actually has enough resources

In capitalism you can actually work your way through the system if small businesses have a chance against big businesses

And healthcare becomes cheap as fuck now that the government isnâ€™t artificially driving up the price

Under the free market corrupt corporations or monopolies basically fall apart because they will have competition by hordes of small businesses so they really wonâ€™t have a monopoly just a large market share
