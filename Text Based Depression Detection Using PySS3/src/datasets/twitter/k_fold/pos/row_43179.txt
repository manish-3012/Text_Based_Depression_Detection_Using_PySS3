How to prevent myself from getting kicked out of my university Hi everyone, I hope you all have a good day

So, I got homework from my psychology class and I have to write an identity paper (nearly 900) words. Basically I have to write about who am I, the way I think about myself, the way I am viewed by the world and the characteristics that define me. And the most important part is about your culture. We have to describe how it affected us and how â€œbeautifulâ€ it is.

The thing is, I hate my countryâ€™s culture. Like absolutely hate my nationality, itâ€™s values and mentality. So freaking much. People here are homophobic, racist, sexist and thereâ€™s so much discrimination against different religions. Every single day I try to put up with my classmates and relatives. Fighting for my rights is my daily routine.


Iâ€™ve heard about people getting beaten up and expelled because they said something bad about this countryâ€™s â€œmentalityâ€. Even with my friends I try to avoid talking about it. 


Iâ€™m just waiting for a day to get out of here.


So what should I do? Do I have to lie in that essay? I need this grade. This post was just a rant, but some advice would definitely help
