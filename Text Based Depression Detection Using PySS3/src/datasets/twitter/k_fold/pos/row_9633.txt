I hate my life I lost BSU co-president to two seniors, one of which has not done anything during his time in the club and just won bc he's popular.  I quite literally brought the club back online this year by emailing the advisor.  I ensured that we had returning AND new members by reminding the advisor of names and sending out our Club Week notice.  I made our social media page that they are now asking me for even though I wasn't EVEN voted in.  In EVERY other club this year, someone was appointed or the person who asked to start the club back was named president.  I lost to the seniors and now my advisor quite literally acknowledged that it's a popularity contest (like, directly) and doesn't want to do shit?? Should I just quit?  Seriously, I'm a sophomore but I cannot emphasize just how FUCKED UP I find this.
