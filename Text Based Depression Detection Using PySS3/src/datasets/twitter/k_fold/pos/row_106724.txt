Idk I like posting these even though they're not great one two three and four

that's how many sides there are

to this mental war

&amp;#x200B;

each side of me fighting for victory

though they all want the same thing

&amp;#x200B;

to hurt me

&amp;#x200B;

the god complex

the broken soul

the heartless anarchist

the obsessive sadist

&amp;#x200B;

everything I experience

always strengthening one

always hurting me

&amp;#x200B;

vodka downed

fueled by warlike mental indecision 

fueled by lack of decisive vision

fueled  by confusion in one's ultimate mission

&amp;#x200B;

internal power struggles

causing external addictive battles

causing fear, wanting to escape

causing mental self rape

&amp;#x200B;

anyway uh thanks for reading if ya did but only like three people will see it so eh
