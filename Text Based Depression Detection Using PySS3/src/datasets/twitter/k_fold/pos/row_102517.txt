Guys donâ€™t be mean to band kids..... There was a kid in band who was really really shy still is today. He didnâ€™t have a lot of friends and the friends he did have were mean to him. He was in my classes and I was nice to him. 

He was very awkward and didnâ€™t know how to socialize and kinda fought himself to say things or not. His parents were really mean to him and tough on him when he didnâ€™t do good in school and thatâ€™s what caused him to be the way he was.

Please be nice even if they are awkward or if you find them to be weird treat people the way you want to be treated and donâ€™t stereotype and group kids and treat them as less than people. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
