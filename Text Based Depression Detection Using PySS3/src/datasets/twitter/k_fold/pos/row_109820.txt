A question I ask guys about crushes I have this crush, itâ€™s been going on for 6 years, we are friends and can talk very easily but Iâ€™m afraid to tell I like him because I feel that he wonâ€™t correspond or that he will just put me aside for that reason. Thatâ€™s why I ask, do you wait for girls to confess feelings? Or in any case, if a girl did so, what would you say?
