How to escape the feeling of being lonely So since the 7th of September until November 20th I have been what I think is called grounded in America. Basically I canâ€™t go out without parent supervision unless I am going to school/work. All my friends are going out and doing stuff with each other at the moment and I am just stuck at home feeling lonely. Just looking for tips to reduce my feeling of loneliness.
