I'm worried about school When quarantine started work just got thrown at us and it was all so confusing (we don't do zoom calls and shit we use an app where they put in work for us to do and we complete it) my school also threw double the amount of work at me than we were doing before quarantine. My school's a grammer school and I had to study to get into it so it's basically full of smart people and I'm worried that I'm like expected to be some A+ student who does everything they're given and I'm worried my teachers are gonna lose their shit at me about missing work or something. They don't understand the stress I'm going through and with that stress I'm starting to feel really fucking down and it's fucking me up. The only positive thing happening is my birthday in 3 days so I'm not gonna need to pretend to be 13 anymore lol
