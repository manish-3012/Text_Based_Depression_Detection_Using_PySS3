Girl Iâ€™m seeing Iâ€™ve been seeing this girl a few times now and weâ€™ve both said we would want a relationship together. Weâ€™re going out again on Monday to go bowling and have dinner yatta yatta yatta and Iâ€™m thinking I finally wanna send it and kiss her but Iâ€™m thinking one of two ways. Either make it kinda a bet for bowling (weâ€™re both competitive) and say â€˜loser has to kiss the winnerâ€™ because this way I can see if she is okay and comfortable with the idea of it or, I can just go for the kiss at the end of the night spontaneously. What do you think I should do
