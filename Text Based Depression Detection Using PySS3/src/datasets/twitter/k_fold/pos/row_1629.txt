* \[5 stars\]There's a real atmosphere at da porc, the owner is an absolute G, and the tendies were scrumptious. One of the few restaurants to accept reddit karma to boot! 
* \[5 stars\]PORK SOSSIG FUNNY Can i have a medium pork with my sossig Also add some extra funy sauce pls Was vrey tastyyyy and unfuny as the sauce was stale 
* \[1 star\] I drove 11 hours from lagos (in nigeria) to reach the one and only da pork resteraunt. Seeing the spectacle was a truly magical experience. My mouth was watering as the sheer smell coming from the restaurant was too good. And that's where the good part ends. Upon trying to go in, i found out that i didnt have enough reddit karma to enter the property, and the owner(discord mod of 50000 reddit servers) wouldnt reveal the threshold to enter. After this, they told me mutiple times that i wasnt funny, and they made fun of my fortnite kill to death ratio. 
* \[5 stars\] Very nice business, am looking forward to selling methamphetamine to your company
