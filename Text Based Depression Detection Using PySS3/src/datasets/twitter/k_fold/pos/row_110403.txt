OKAY, BUT LIKE, HEAR ME OUT: A GPS app that local people can anonymously input info on. Like,

*Turn left on Smith Street, but be careful, because thereâ€™s a kitty named Chonko who runs around on the street*

Or

*Go straight on West Avenue, but thereâ€™s this little area where a bunch of kids with no regard for their own safety like being little shits and play Chicken in the road*

The only problem I can see arising from this is that the anonymity will make people be petty as hell, like

*Turn onto North street, but this bitch named Donna lives there and sheâ€™s nosy as hell, so donâ€™t tell her anything*

Or

*You have arrived at your destination, but the neighbors have absolutely no taste in music and theyâ€™ll play stupid-ass songs at full blast. They also mow the fucking lawn at 6am. Fuck you, Jennifer and Steve and your two little shits that threw mud balls at my dog*

MAKE IT HAPPEN!
