This one girl in my zoom class So thereâ€™s this new girl in one of my classes, and not gonna lie sheâ€™s kinda pretty. She doesnâ€™t have insta and isnâ€™t in any of the group chats, but from what Iâ€™ve seen she actually seems like a genuinely nice person. Plus, I made her chuckle a little bit when I made a joke after the teacher asked me a question (chill teacher)



How do I approach her and other people during online school? Like idk how
