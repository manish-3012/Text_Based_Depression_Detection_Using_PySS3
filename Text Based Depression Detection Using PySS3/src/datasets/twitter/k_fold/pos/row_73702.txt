I need to get something off my chest. And some feedback. So to start my shitty life, I was basically born without a â€œbatâ€. And yea itâ€™s small because of the rare Disease, 1-40K. Doesnâ€™t seem that rare until you know that some of thoses babyâ€™s born like this, either was gender swapped and it is common for that to happen. For instance (not going into much detail) all Iâ€™m going to say is I had â€œbaseballsâ€ but no â€œbatâ€.

Now I know this is r/teenagers but I donâ€™t even feel comfortable talking to girls about it because all of the girls Iâ€™ve met always says that size matters and I donâ€™t want some man who canâ€™t pleasure me, my own fucking problem is that I probably canâ€™t even have kids!

Or even pleasure anyone... I am scared of my future because my dad only had 2 boys, me and my brother, and if I canâ€™t even help with our bloodline, then my brother would have to. I want to live without being scared over my future. 

Sorry mods but I needed to get this off my chest. 
I tried to keep a lot of personal info out. 

I didnâ€™t mark this as â€œseriousâ€ because itâ€™s not even serious, all I want in life is a girl who doesnâ€™t judge, who just loves me for who I am... I donâ€™t want to be something or a bargain for people but fuck. 

Everyone has there storyâ€™s, I just had to get this off my chest and want some feedback.
