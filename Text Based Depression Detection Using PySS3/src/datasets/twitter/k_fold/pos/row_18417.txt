I hate this feeling so much Im very introverted. In school, there were this moments where i needed to talk to people or join them but i cant because my voice is very mono toned,quiet af and im so insecure about myself physically. Im just gonna stand in the corner waiting for my one bestfriend to notice me, thats all i can do.
