youtube is bad Before I got a flood of hate just hear me out. Iâ€™d rather stay inside and watch do YouTube the whole day instead of go out and socialize with people. It distracts me from doing so much stuff that I need to get done. I end up getting sucked into the YouTube blue pool instead of doing work. Itâ€™s not bad for everyone but itâ€™s just bad for me
