So I'm 18 now, kinda wild I've been 18 for months now but it's really setting in how much has changed.

My parents can kick me out if they want to, I have to do taxes, the law is a lot less forgiving now

I feel like I'm way behind where I should be, when I was younger I imagined I'd at least have a stable job by now.

There are some positives

I can put in my actual birthday in wevsites instead of January 1st 1875

My parents can't take my stuff away anymore

Mostly I'm just really disappointed in myself that I'm pretty much in the same position I've always been in
