Yesterday was the best day of my life. Yesterday, my boyfriend came to my house. We had never met irl before so I was super excited. It was honestly the happiest I've ever felt during my whole existence. He's so amazing. I'm the luckiest person in the world. I am nothing without him. He makes me so happy all the time. I don't know how he doesn't see how perfect he is. Some exciting and fun things that happened while we were together: firstly, when I greeted him, he picked me up and gave me a big hug. That was amazing. Then we had our first kiss and that was just magical, I didn't see it coming, it was such an amazing surprise. Then we cuddled in the grass for a little bit (and kissed some more) that was epic. And we slow danced, that was so amazing. Then when he left, he gave me his hoodie and it smells like him (He smells really great). Anyways I'm so happy to have found such an amazing boyfriend. I don't want or need anyone else. 
P.S. I'm sorry for ranting over here, I just needed to express myself somehow.
