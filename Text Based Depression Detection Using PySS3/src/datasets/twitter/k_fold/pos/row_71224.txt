Idk where to ask so I'm asking here â†“ Do you guys have any cool let's play YouTubers you could recommend me?

You see, I used to love watching gameplays but all the YouTubers that I loved either quit or just degraded so to speak, and the last time I watched an actual gameplay was like over a year ago.

So again, anyone interesting you could recommend? Maybe someone small who doesn't get the love they deserve, maybe some of your favorites, or heck even a friend of yours that's trying to make a name for themselves, all I want is some good gaming and commentary :&gt;
