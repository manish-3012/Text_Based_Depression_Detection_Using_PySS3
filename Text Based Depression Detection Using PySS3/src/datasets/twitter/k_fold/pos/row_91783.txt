I lost all control of my life... and I don't know where am I going to. I lost all hopes in achieving my life goal, my parents want me to be either an engineer or a doctor and I know that I don't have what it takes and I don't have it in me. I've been stuck in another country where I study for over 2 years because of covid. I used to be sad and have breakdowns, but now I don't feel anything, just upset most of the time. I've given up to my fate and I'm just going with the flow, and I don't know what am I doing here. I don't know what I want. I just wanted to share what's on my mind with somebody. Hopefully I can get help.
