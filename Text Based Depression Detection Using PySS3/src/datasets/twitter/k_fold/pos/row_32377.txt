So, I just saw the post of the guy that is 18 and has no dating experience.. And I think we may be on a very similar situation, only that either way I've already kinda come to terms that I can't have a relationship.

So, I don't really know what to ask for, I mean, I also have never had a friend that is a girl, and all through highschool I did nothing but study and then go back home.

It may be important to point out that I studied in a guys only highschool, Catholic, so I basically had zero contact with a girl since I started that period of my life.

I'm starting college soon, but it's going to be online, an I bet it will for a while, only making matters worse, add the fact that I have no friends or anyone really to rely on, so I'm in a Limbo at the moment.

I know a lot of people have it worse, but the questions still remain, why has anyone liked me? Am I actually doomed to die alone? Or most importantly, do I have to be worried about this?
