Iâ€™m having my first date on Sunday !! Advice? Iâ€™m taking a girl out on a date on Sunday!! Weâ€™re having a picnic and Iâ€™m soooo excited : ) I even cut little hearts out of cheese for the crackers and Iâ€™m getting her flowers.

Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship or gone on a date. Please hype me up
