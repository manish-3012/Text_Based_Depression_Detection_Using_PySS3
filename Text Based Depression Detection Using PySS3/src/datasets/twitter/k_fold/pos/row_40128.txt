For any boys growing up without your dad... Back in the 60s, 70s and 80s, I grew up without my dad.  It had challenges then, as I know it does now.

[I started this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr_aQ) in September of 2019 to help kids, especially boys growing up without a dad.

If that's you, I invite you to check it out, subscribe, and let me know what you'd like to ask, or how I can help you.

You young ladies are more than welcome to watch as well.  I just want you to know that someone out there cares about you and wants to fill that hole you might be feeling, missing your dad.
