Bruh, selling pics makes a lot of money So I posted a picture of myself on the AmIUgly sub, and obviously there's a lot of creeps who decided to show up in my pms. But like... a dude was gonna pay 500 bucks for me to video chat with him wearing not very much, and another said he would pay like 30 bucks for a fully clothed pic. Like this is an actual market, I mean I thought onlyfans was a joke, but it really pays. Anyways, that's my revelation, thank you and have a nice day.
Ps: I'm also pretty average looking, so if ur super hot you can probably get like twice the money
