Was in a very dark place for weeks, wrote this poem in the psych ward. Hope you guys like it! [14M] Some of us smile, others struggle to just get by,

drowning in depression, not sure if you'll see the light?

Therapist asks me what do I see, "Hope" says my brain,

Be careful, the light at the end of the tunnel, might just be a train.

Grades are slipping lower every passing day,

I feel so lost, like a needle in a stack of hay.

Got home and greeted my mom with a smile,

she saw right through my pain,

if only I could tell her, I'm losing the battle again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Latched my door and cut, cut till I felt alive

Oh no, gotta do homework, it's already half past five!

Tyler calls me after the game , "What's wrong Jean, you missed the shot from five"

Wish I could tell him that I just see no point in life.

&amp;#x200B;

Adults, you say you've seen life, because you made it out alive?

Don't forget you too started with a hundred friends,

and finished with only five.
