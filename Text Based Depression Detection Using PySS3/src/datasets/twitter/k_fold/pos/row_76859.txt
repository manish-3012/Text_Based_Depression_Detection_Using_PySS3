Bakemonogatari is really weird I've watched a few episodes and I'm not really sure if I like it or not. The plot is weird. I don't know if I like it. The art is weird, annoying and amazing. I don't know if I like it. The characters a weird. I don't know if k like them.

But I still want to continue watching.
