So I went to the dentist today. I literally never wash my teeth (yes Ew I know) and when me and my sister got there she was talkin mad shit about what the the dentist was gonna say, so we go in there and she gets checked up, no problems, and when the dentist starts looking at mine, he looks straight at my sister that washes her teeth religiously "Well they're not any dirtier than yours so you're both fine" and the whole drive home she didn't even look at me ðŸ˜‚. Pretty dumb story I know but I had to share it.
