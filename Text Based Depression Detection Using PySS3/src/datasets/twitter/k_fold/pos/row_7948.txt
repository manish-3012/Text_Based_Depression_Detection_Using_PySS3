How I gained weight from being Anorexic So I just made a body positivity post yesterday on my body 2 years ago vs my body now 4 days ago. I received a lot of love and support so thank you! 

But a lot of people asked me questions and here is my answer. 


What is anorexia? 

In the DSM 5 (the book of mental illnesses and disorders, yes I have read it, yes I read it sometimes) anorexia is defined as: 

A. Refusal to maintain bodyweight at or above minimally normal weight for height/age (less than 85th percentile).

B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese, even though underweight.

C. Disturbed by oneâ€™s body weight or shape, self-worth influenced by body weight or shape, or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low bodyweight

D. In menstruating females, absence of at least 3 consecutive non-synthetically induced menstrual cycles


I can safely say I fit all that and went through all that all my years being anorexic and recovering although I am technically still in recovery. 


How did I gain weight? 

-I started taking vitamins such as vitamin D,C, omega 3 fish oil pills (they are huge and hard to swallow), centrum (which is a womenâ€™s multivitamin so men, you guys should take the male one), I also take iron supplements because it turns out I was also anemic (low iron) 


-Eat whatever you want whenever you want. A lot is convincing yourself itâ€™s okay to eat this and itâ€™s okay to splurge. I remember I felt very guilty, fat, ugly, gross. I had tried throwing it all up even but that will just make you feel worse


-I used to eat and eat and eat until my stomach felt beyond full and I felt like throwing up but then pushed through and slept it off. Eating more will make more space in your stomach so the feeling of being too full will be farther away and achieved by eating even more. Itâ€™s like tricking yourself into eating more. 


-eat greasy food, the grease is fat and fat content is what you need to gain weight. I ate a shit ton of junk food. I also ate a shit ton of rice and beans and tofu and paneer and cheese. Milk products, white bread, pastas, candy, chocolates (on my period I would convince myself the chocolate was needed) 


-Donâ€™t work out. I guess part of it was my depression but I didnâ€™t work out at all. I used to do yoga but then I got injured and was unable and I noticed how much weight yoga actually burned and kept from me gaining weight. So I have not been working out, Iâ€™ve just been letting the weight build up. 


-Make excuses to eat, Breakfast is very important, I found that I have a newfound love for everything bagels with a shit ton of butter and salt with iced coffee so everyday I eat that for breakfast. 


-Go out to eat (I know not everyone can afford this but I mean like McDonaldâ€™s or something) if you buy the food yourself and see how much it actually cost you can convince yourself you have to eat it because you spent so much money on it. 


-Family and friends used to bully me and skinny shame me. So many skinny jokes, so many anorexic jokes and I was so fucking tired of it all so I was like you know what?! Iâ€™ll show you! They still make those jokes but not as much anymore. Some say Iâ€™ve gotten to a better weight and Iâ€™m doing good. My mom calls me fat when she gets mad and although I get mad, at least sheâ€™s not calling me bones anymore. 



Anyway I hoped this helped or helps you guys snd doesnâ€™t get lost in new! Again Iâ€™m very thankful for the support and also thanks to the mod who removed creepy shit from my post, I posted it at night and woke up in the morning to nothing but positivity! :)))
