Saw something at work today that made me really pissed off. First thing before I start the story... This girl in question was about 10, maybe even younger. 

(I work at a Cafe btw, itâ€™s my first job) Basically, I was walking to the kitchen to put away some dishes, and when I looked behind the counter, I saw this girl wearing an oversized â€œTHE FUTURE IS FEMALEâ€ T-Shirt. 

It was clearly her motherâ€™s. It just makes me mad that parents allow their young children to wear shit like that
