Dyed my hair black I dyed my hair black today, i cant show a pic atm but look at my face post but just imagine black hair, i think it looks good and takes away from how *prominent* my eyebrows are. Ive been insecure about my hair for a while now and it feels good to look at it and smile instead of hating it.
