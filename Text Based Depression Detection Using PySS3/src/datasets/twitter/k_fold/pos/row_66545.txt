Iâ€™m sick of being scared of flying bugs Like whenever they get close I have this fight or flight feeling and I violently shiver and try to hit it. They make me feel sick and whenever I tell someone Iâ€™m just told to man up or deal with it but I canâ€™t. I get erratic and I canâ€™t handle it. Thereâ€™s nights where thereâ€™s a moth in my room and I can not sleep at all because itâ€™s always there and no one ever helps me. I sound like a child and I hate it because I do but I think thereâ€™s definitely something wrong with me. I feel embarrassed to ever talk about it even on here too a bunch of strangers but Iâ€™m tired of being expected to be not emotional or scared because Iâ€™m a boy and â€œboys arenâ€™t scared of tiny bugsâ€. I have a panic attack when they circle around me and itâ€™s awful. What can I do? Whatâ€™s wrong with me?
