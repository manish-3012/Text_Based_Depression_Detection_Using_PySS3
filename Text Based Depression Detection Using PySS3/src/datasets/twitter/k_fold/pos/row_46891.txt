Yk about dating as teenagers... Don't most of the relationships fail tho?My tchrs and the adults around me always tell me that relationships and dating as a teen almost always never works out in the end and that it's all for nothing,not worth it,etc.

Obviously there are ppl who get married from an early relationship from high school until they become adults.

But idk man y'all in it for real or just fooling around??
