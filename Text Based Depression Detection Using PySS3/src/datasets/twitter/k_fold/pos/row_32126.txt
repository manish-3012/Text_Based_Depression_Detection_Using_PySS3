Day 171 of posting random "fun" facts everyday until I forget or get bored Henry â€œBoxâ€ Brown escaped slavery in the American south by mailing himself to freedom. He had friends pack him into a small box, and ship him as cargo from Richmond to Philadelphia. He survived, and went on to work as a magician.


Have a nice day
