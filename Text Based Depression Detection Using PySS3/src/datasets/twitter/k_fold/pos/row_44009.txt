So some irani noobs kicked me from CS GO server... I was playing random competitive in CS, and all my teammates were irani, and they were professional noobs.

 Still we were winning, I had the most kills (top fragger). Everything was going well but at the start of a round, I accidentally attacked my teammate, I said it was by mistake I'm sorry but they just didn't listen and kicked me from the server. 

Sometime later, I checked my recent matches and guess what "they fucking lost the match."
Part of me is really happy because they got what fucking deserve, but I'm also sad because I wasted my time for some fucking random irani dudes who doesn't even know how to play.
