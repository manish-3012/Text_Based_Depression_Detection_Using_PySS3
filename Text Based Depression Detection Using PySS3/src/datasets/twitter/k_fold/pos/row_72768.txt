My boyfriend and I broke up but are in the same small friend group, what do we do about our Halloween party? Basically, the breakup was on good terms, we still joke in the group chat and all but haven't spoken directly, seen each other, been on a call at the same time, etc since we broke up. (Yes I know the general advice is to completely cut contact

For Halloween our mutual friend group (both of our 2 closest friends. We grew up together and all) wants to have a movie night at my house. 

We teccchnically haven't told them we've broken up yet and I'm worried our little meet up will be excruciatingly awkward for everyone involved. 

It'd also be a bit unfair to force one of us to miss out on the only social gathering since the pandemic started for the sake of the other. 

What do I dooo?
