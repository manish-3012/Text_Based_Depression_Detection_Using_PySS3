Loneliness takes over everything bro I have friends and all but idk anymore. Iâ€™m losing hope that I will see happiness again. How do people do it? Only thing that could possibly make me happy would to find true love, but I doubt sheâ€™s out there no way. Eh who wants a suicidal piece of shut anyway I wonâ€™t make it to see if sheâ€™s even out there.
