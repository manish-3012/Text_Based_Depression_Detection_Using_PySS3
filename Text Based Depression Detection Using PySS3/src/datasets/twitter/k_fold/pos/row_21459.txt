Well, itâ€™s been 2 years... Itâ€™s been to years. Two entire years, and they were both wonderful.

I remember coming in here, getting to meet new people, getting to have a look around and really exploring this platform entirely, it was amazing.

With everything in those two years everyone has managed to commit to. Weâ€™ve accepted new members and had to say goodbye to some, all joining being given a warm welcome, and everyone leaving being wished good luck in their future.

I know that in these two years this platform has been a safe space for me, somewhere where I got to know things, a place which made me who I am now. I will admit that saying things like this arenâ€™t regular for me, but I feel like everyone deserves to be told.

I would love to thank everyone who has been here at any point, and thank everyone whoâ€™s made mine and thousands of otherâ€™s journeys what they are now. This community really has overcome a lot and everyone deserves a big pat on the back for that.

Dearest appreciations to everyone, and remember to stay safe.
