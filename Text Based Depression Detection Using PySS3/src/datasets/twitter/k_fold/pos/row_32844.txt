So, I'll start a twitch streaming job (I don't know what flair to use, for that I'm sorry.)

Hi! So uhhh, I'm kind of in a tight situation right now since I want to go to good college and my fam doesn't exactly support what I want to be after and where I want to go. I decided to do streaming on twitch since my only skills involve "gaming" and jobs are hard to find. I have no idea if this is the sub to ask for support, but I went here anyway coz I don't know where else to go haha. 

To be completely honest, I'm also doing this for fun and develop my social skills. I think I'm bad at social interactions and public speaking so I'll train myself using streaming. 

If you want to follow me my name's CowboyCatSensei on twitch and uhhhh thanks for hearing me out I guess.
