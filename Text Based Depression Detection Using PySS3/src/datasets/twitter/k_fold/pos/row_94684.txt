Don't complain why I'm too shy if you call me sick after I send you my jokes. Imagine you want to share something to your groupmates, what makes you laugh or  brings enjoyment (or other feelings).

You don't expect them to call you "Sick f***!" or something.

Be tolerate to people's interests. Otherwise don't be surprised they want to "backstab" you later or do stop to speak with you at all.
