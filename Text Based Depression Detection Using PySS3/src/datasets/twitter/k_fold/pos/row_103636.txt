Is it weird I cope, rather pre-cope with stuff being canceled by the pandemic by just expecting it to be canceled? This has happened since last March on a variety of things in my life that have been canceled because of the rona, every time something exiting or big is going to happen, like my summer camp or my bar mitzvah, I always expect them to be canceled and  be virtual. (In both cases they were canceled/virtual) And now my family plans on going somewhere for spring break, and yet again I expect it to be canceled. Is there any way I could get a more optimistic look on future events rather than pessimistic realism?
