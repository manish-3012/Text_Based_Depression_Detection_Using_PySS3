Drawing Apps on iPad I was looking for good FREE drawing apps on my iPad. Are Adobe Fresco and Adobe Photoshop Sketch totally free apps ? I mean they have in-app purchases but what all do we get for free? And which of the two is better ? Also what about Autodesk Sketchbook ? I was using Krita on my Mac but now as a I switched to iPad, it would be really nice if i get some advice and suggestions. Thank You !!
