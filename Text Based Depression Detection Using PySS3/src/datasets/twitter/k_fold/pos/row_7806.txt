I give up with some people sometimes I am a fan of Formula 1. For those who don't know, Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and currently the top driver is Lewis Hamilton. He is on course to break most records and has been dominant for the last few years, but most importantly he is black. He is been incredibly supportive of blm and has stood up whenever he can, and yet he is facing so much backlash. Constantly comments on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram say that he only wins because of the car and that he's not actually that good or just any way that people can pick holes in him. People relentlessly pick so many flaws with him, say that he is overpaid say he doesn't understand common issues, say he should shut up and do his job, say he drives a Nazi car (Mercedes). He put a post up on Twitter earlier honouring Chadwick Boseman for his life and being an inspiration to black people and it got ambushed with comments of "well he inspired white people too" or "where were you honouring a driver that died last year, busy thinking about the image of you kneeling?". There's even a picture on Facebook of him instead of having a blm t shirt it being photoshopped to say "my ego matters". He's not always been my favourite driver, but the things he says are important, and it's sad that he faces so much stick for them
