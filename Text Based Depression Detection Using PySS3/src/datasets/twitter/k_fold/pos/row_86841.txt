Havenâ€™t talked to my crush since school went online in March. Thinking about sending this text out. Thoughts? Iâ€™m gonna change the names cuz Iâ€™m paranoid lol Hey Jennifer,  
I just wanted to say thank you for being such a kind and supportive person. I find it difficult to be really open and honest about how I feel, especially in person, but I just want you to know that I think youâ€™re really cool. I was hoping to get to know you better senior year, but it never really happened. Ms. Smith split our group up!!! Idk if you remember but it still irritates me to this day lol. (And then I was too lame to ask you to homecoming...) Anyway just wanted to put this out there now that the world is falling apart. Would love to get to know you better in the future.
