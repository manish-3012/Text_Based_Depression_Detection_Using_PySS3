I don't know So there is this girl I like.
We knew each other for like i dunno half a year but literally never spoke to each other or sent a text to each other. We know each because we have the same friends. A few days ago I texted her just because I wanted to say hi. So we started a conversation and she is really nice. I have never met a person that I liked instantly like it was magic. We texted the last week every day the whole day. So now we really like each other (I know that because she told me herself) but here comes the problem. One of my friend was already in a realationship (no clue how to write that) and she doesn't want to be the person that seperates us but he did some very bad stuff and our friendgroup is pretty pissed because of that so like I would still call him my friend maybe even good friend but not best friend anymore. And now I'm really sad because she likes me and i like her but my friend is kinda in the way. I need your help what should I do next. I can't just say no he isn't my friend anymore because I know him since Kindergarten but I also like her for real she is like the first girl I really fell in love which.
