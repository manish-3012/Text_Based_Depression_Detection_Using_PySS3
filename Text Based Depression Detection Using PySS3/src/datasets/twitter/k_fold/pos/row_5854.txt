Hope your all doing okay :D Hey fellow teenagers! I just want to let you know that your amazing and if you havenâ€™t heard it today, i just want to remind you, You are doing great! 2021 hasnâ€™t had a great start for Americans and people are still being idiots, but i know none of you are those people, i hope your social distancing and wearing a mask! If any one of you is having a rough time, i want to tell you that you arenâ€™t alone, many people including me, just donâ€™t know what to do with themselves, but i want you to know, and iâ€™ll say it until you believe me, you are amazing, and you are doing great! I know this is weird from a stranger on the internet, but everyone is on the internet now, everyone has school on the internet, itâ€™s been hard. And i donâ€™t think there will be any good 
outcome of whatâ€™s happening, but i believe in you all! I really hope your okay :D
