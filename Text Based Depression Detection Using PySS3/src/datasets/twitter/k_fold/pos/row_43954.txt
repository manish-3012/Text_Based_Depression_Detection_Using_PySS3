/mu/ is terrible and I don't know why people recommend it. I have seen people say that if you want to talk about music you should go to /mu/. But when I have been to   /mu/ everyone is just a bunch of pretentious transphobic assholes who just complain, and if you want to talk or have an opinion you will just get made fun of with a meme that is more cringe than every meme off of r/teenagers and r/pewdiepiesubmissions combined.
