Highschool Tips? Heyy, so I'm 14 and my last year of Middle School (grades 6 through 8) will be coming to a close soon. 

I'm both excited and nervous, as I'll be leaving my K-8th school that I've been going to my entire school career. 

For reference, this is a public school in a large city that seats around 1,500 people. 

I want some advice on highschool, especially as a freshman. Any advice?
