10 things I'm missing out after deleting my Instagram account &amp;#x200B;

1. Low quality memes from shitty meme pages. Screenshots of tweets that aren't funny/thought provoking whatsoever shared by those meme pages.
2. Celebrities endorsing brands and showing off their rich lifestyle.
3. My distant friend's stance on political matters which I don't agree with most of the times.
4. The stuff my friends do during their spare time.
5. Instagram models who are hungry for clout.
6. A screenshot of a song my friend is listening to.
7. A very ordinary picture of nature that my friend uploads on his/her story.
8. Trending news that I would know if I just read the newspaper or type news on google.
9. DMs from the same group of people who I talk to on WhatsApp.
10. 1-2 hours of scrolling through out the day and wasting time subconsciously.

Do I regret it? - NO!

I am proud I did that
