I'm sick of my anger litteraly taking everything i ever have. I got kicked from an animation project by the producer (friend) just cause I cursed at the director (friend) due to a simple thing she said that I took as offensive. Now I just want to breakdown in tears and die. I'm sick of my anger litteraly taking everything i ever have.
