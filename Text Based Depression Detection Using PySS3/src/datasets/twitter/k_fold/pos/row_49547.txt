I Want Some Candy Canes I was just laying in my bed watching Hulu when I realized how much I want a candy cane, and not those weird Sour Patch Kids or Jelly Belly flavored ones. I just want a traditional peppermint candy cane, and donâ€™t even come at me with, â€œJust buy some peppermints.â€ I didnâ€™t ask for peppermints. I need that cane shaped pepperminty deliciousness. But no. I have to wait until the end of the year, since thatâ€™s when the boxes go on sale for like 50 cents, because they think no one wants them after Christmas is over, which is why they take them off the shelves, which is dumb, because weirdos like me would love to eat them year round. The candy cane market is not being utilized to itâ€™s full potential. Also I like doing that thing where you suck on one end and it gets pointy. (I couldnâ€™t think of a way to word this that doesnâ€™t sound wrong, so whatever).
