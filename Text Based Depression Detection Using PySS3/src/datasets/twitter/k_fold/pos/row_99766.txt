Iâ€™m getting help... Recently a lot of stuff happened and Iâ€™ve been struggling with Anxiety for years but never diagnosed (I have multiple panic attacks a week) and I believe I have BDD and have been harming myself. My boyfriend finally convinced me to talk to a teacher about it because Iâ€™m terrified of my parents. I went to my English teacher and vaguely told her about stuff and she immediately set up an appointment with a therapist at my school. Things are looking up, Iâ€™m not feeling any better however I have hope and Iâ€™m just really proud of myself for finally doing something about something Iâ€™ve struggled with for years.
