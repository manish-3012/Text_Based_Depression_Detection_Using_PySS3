I wrote a love song ,for my imaginary gf ,(AKA:my pillow) 

Itâ€™s so nice to know 
That when Iâ€™m on the dark
You are there and have my back
Is comfortable to know that when I fall
I am gonna end up on your arms

Itâ€™s 10 oâ€™clock ,Friday night 
And I got you in  my arms
I never thought I would be here
Lost in the moment, living the 
Life I always wanted , all those times
I had ,where I couldnâ€™t see the light
Now ,now that all behind 

It was hard ,to get you 
It was hard to find you 
But your smile
The smile in your face
Just makes up for all it 

Itâ€™s so nice to know 
That when Iâ€™m on the dark
You are there and have my back
Is comfortable to know that when I fall
I am gonna end up on your arms

It nice to feel again this love
Itâ€™s nice to feel the pain leave my blood
Itâ€™s nice to leave this storm 
That saw  me grow ,
Itâ€™s been so long , 
Since the last time I could see, beyond my nose 
Since the Last time I could breathe ,between all this smoke 

It was hard ,to get you 
It was hard to find you 
But your smile
The smile in your face
Just makes up for all of it 

Itâ€™s so nice to know 
That when Iâ€™m on the dark
You are there and have my back
Is comfortable to know that when I fall
I am gonna end up on your arms
