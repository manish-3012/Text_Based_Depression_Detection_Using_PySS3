Hi can you guys give me some encouragement? Iâ€™m going to work part time at my Moms restaurant with my sister, but thereâ€™s going to be a bunch of older guys. Iâ€™m 16 and theyâ€™re in their late 20s. 

I have anxiety and lately Iâ€™ve been getting really nervous in social settings or around older men in general.

I know that sounds weird, but Iâ€™m really irrationally scared that Iâ€™m going to screw up or have a panic attack.
