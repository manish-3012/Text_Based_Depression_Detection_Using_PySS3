small political rant itâ€™s funny to me when people are like â€œhaha joe biden sniffs kidsâ€ as if donald trump hasnâ€™t been accused of rape countless times and literally bragged about sexual assault, like dude i donâ€™t like biden very much either but at least be fair when you are hating on politicians. as bad as both of them (and most politicians in general) are, at least biden is more of a weird and creepy uncle and not a rapist. and as far as politics go, joe biden hasnâ€™t done a ton so far but heâ€™s still done more work than trump ever did in this amount of time.

in conclusion, 99% of politicians suck but you shouldnâ€™t specifically target one while ignoring the bad stuff others have done

edit: i love the people downvoting this but not commenting, thatâ€™s exactly what i expected.
