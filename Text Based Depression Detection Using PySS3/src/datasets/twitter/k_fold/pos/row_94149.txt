I'm panicking when I see a spider or a moth.... I just discovered a Spider in the bathroom again and thank god someone lives with me. The person took care of it. After that, I went into my room just to find this weird moth. I tried to get the moth out of my room for 5 minutes without success. I ended up slamming it on the ground with a book somehow. I was just trying to slam it out of the room through the door. The person living with me took care of the rest again.

Isnâ€™t there a service that you can buy that will get rid of spiders and such in your home? I'm literally panicking when I see such creatures. I can't get rid of them myself. Airtasker isn't available in my country. There has to be something.
