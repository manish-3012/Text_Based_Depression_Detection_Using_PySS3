I hate what my face and skin looks like I hate acne so much, my skin looks so shitty when itâ€™s up close, I just wanna grab a pair of shears and take my face off. I hate what it looks like, and I randomly just have blood all over my face. I only look good through a blurry camera and from a distance. I donâ€™t know how to fix it and I donâ€™t have any money I can use to fix it... I also canâ€™t afford to go to the doctors for this cause this is America! I hate my face
