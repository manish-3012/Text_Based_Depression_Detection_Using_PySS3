I had a dissociation now i want to kill myself. A week ago i had one of the worst dissociation, nothing felt real and even now nothing does. I had posted on this sub that i might kill myself but i backed out and I'm sorry for that.

So now, i really feel empty and i want to die because if life is fake then what's the poin? I can't do school work or anything because i see no point. 
I told my mom, she says that she's here for me but i don't believe her, i still don't trust her for the shit she and my parents did in my childhood and gaslighting, lying, yelling and hitting me.
 I talked to the teacher i trust about it, she actually freaked out and set up a meeting with the school counsellor set for the 3rd of August. But that date is too far and i think i just need to talk abt it. 

So teens with dissociations, any tips i could use to hold on until my meeting?
