How to get the hottest girl/boy in your school Damn, are you murder because "I got murder on my mind" 

Aye girl, are you an ak47 because those looks made "traumatize" 

"Didn't even mean to shoot him" his looks "just caught me by surprise."

Aye girl, are you a glock because I want to hang out with you at 9

Insult when they reject you: Aye girl, are you a mac-11 because you're so fat you look like you ate 11 big macs. 

If you're a girl: Replace the areas that say "girl" and put boy. 

Now that's how you get into a relationship thank me later.
