Hehe sad boi go brrr (sry for bad formatting Iâ€™m on mobile) Ok so I was just minding my business and doing my school stuff Then my dad tells me to try on the absolutely terrible glasses (he cancelled an online order but it still came) but I already know they look terrible and work fine So when I say I know they work and that I donâ€™t like them He slaps me and calls me an ungrateful little shit?!?! Then when I explain why I donâ€™t like them (he already canceled he order, they just look terrible, and they look nothing like the pic) he does it again and TAKES MY NORMAL GLASSES and says heâ€™s returning them and these are my new glasses (The terrible ones) And when I put down the bad glasses on the table (a little rough ngl) he screams at me saying I threw them?!?! Then he grabs my arm super hard, screams at me some more, then grabs me by the sleeve and drags me out of my chair and to the stairs and screams for me to go to my room and while Iâ€™m going upstairs he PUSHES ME DOWN ONTO THE STAIRS Thatâ€™s not even all of the stuff he does Like me and my brother got in a fight (happens pretty often) so he takes all my stuff (phone, Xbox, tv, switch, DOOR) Who takes their childâ€™s DOOR???
By comparison my mom is a saint Most she does is sometimes yell when weâ€™re being dumbasses

Oh and continuing the thing about taking my stuff, I canâ€™t go out of the house other then to walk my dog Now I canâ€™t see ANYONE, most interaction I used to get before that was going to my bfs house like every weekend and sometimes playing dnd but now nothing And that wasnâ€™t even enough to make me feel not rly lonely (The going to my bfs house every weekend and sometimes playing dnd)

And I still feel like im just overreacting (â€¢~â€¢) like I should just sit there and deal with it

And the house is always just trashed cuz of my brother and sister, like itâ€™s REALLY bad

i cant wait until im able to get out of here or have an opertunity to get out of here before 18
