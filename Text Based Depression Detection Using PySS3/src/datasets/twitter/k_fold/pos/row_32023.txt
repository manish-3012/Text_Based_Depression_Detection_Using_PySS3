I literally don't have any friends now I'm 18 and just graduated high school, I had a lot of friends there but we just kind of stopped talking all except for my 2 best friends. I've always been a pushover and haven't had much confidence in myself, but recently idk why but I've had a a massive surge of confidence and aggressiveness.

My first best friend I've known since elementary, weve always gotten along super well but recently, probably because of recent world events, hes gotten super political and almost never shuts up about it. I am on the opposite side of him politically and ever time he brings that stuff up it pisses me off, but due to my nature I am horrible at having arguments specifically political ones, so I've just been ghosting him for the most part and feel awful about it

My 2nd friend is my ex girlfriend, when she's in a good mood she's an amazing person to talk to and be around, but has has a lot of anger problems as well as being really selfish. She gets mad at anything and everything that challenges or goes against her and if you call her out on anything regardless of severity or intent she shuts down and goes beserk making it impossible to have any kind of discussion with her. For the most part I was always able to ignore it or look past it, but due to my recent change I've been putting my foot down more and more leading to more and more arguments with her until last night we had a really harsh argument where she outright said she hated me, then there's just been a painful silence

I know I'm most likely in the wrong in some way, and I feel horrible because of it, but at the same time I feel little to no regret, its just pain

Sorry if it seems I'm rambling or karma whoring I just wanted to get this off my chest and couldn't think of anywhere else.
