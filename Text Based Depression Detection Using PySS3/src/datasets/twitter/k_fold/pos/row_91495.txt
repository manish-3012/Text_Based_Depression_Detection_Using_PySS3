My grandma got covid She has to work to make enough money to stay afloat after losing it all in 2008 and paying for her late husband's treatment after he got cancer... (he was super cool grandpa, miss him lots)...

My point is is that she has to work, and because of that she got covid... she is getting up there and has bad asthma and respiratory problems

I hope she will be ok! Sorry for boring you guys... just was relieving stress...
