I don't have feelings Yeah... 
The thing is, it's not like I don't have emotions. I feel stressed, and I cry, and I enjoy some things, but then thinking about it, do I Really enjoy them? I don't know.

When my great grandma passed away I remember my sister was crying a lot, and she was very sad, but I felt nothing. I knew I was supposed to be sad, but I just felt nothing. 

I've seen some movies about wars, and it's not heavy for me (I don't know if you can say that in english), and I just watch it without feeling anything.

I am a jewish and an Israeli, and every year we talk about the holocaust. I hear about what people have gone through, and people all around me are emotional, but I feel nothing.*

*TO CLARIFY:  I am NOT antisemitic, I *don't* doubt the holocaust happening and I believe many people have gone through hell. Please do not tell at me, this sub is supposed to be a safe space.

Is anyone else like this? Does anyone know why I'm like this?

Thank you for taking the time and reading my post, I really appreciate it.
