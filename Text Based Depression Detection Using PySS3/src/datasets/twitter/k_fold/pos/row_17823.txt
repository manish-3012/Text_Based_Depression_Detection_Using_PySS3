Here is my crazy confusing story bout this guy Soo, uh, my dads friend invited my parents over to a hangout, well they went and I stayed home cause I didnt need to go, they were all adults that were getting drunk. Well they show up and are there for about an hour, this girl brought her teenage son. Um so anyway, all the adults got drunk and thought I should come to. Well my mom called me (she was not drunk, she hates alcohol) saying she is going to come &amp; pick me up and so I just put on an outfit and put my greasy ass hair up. I didn't really care to do my makeup tho or anything because it was outdoors and hella hot. We get there and immediately I'm getting shipped with this boy I've never met lmao. Anyways the whole cookout turned into all the adults trying to get 2 teens to get together. Well I'm super awkward and shy and so I wanted to cry lmao but my mom talked me into it and I got the balls to go over to him and hang out for a bit. So we just kinda walk around and talk. Well he tells me bout his ex that did crap. Anyways, he asked if he can get my snap so I give it to him and the rest of the day we basically hang out. We did alot together for only knowing eachother for a few hours and both being hella shy. Now maybe some of you all are like "awe that's an awesome story teheHEE" no, it's not... anywho, we talk like all night on snap and then the next night he gets back with his ex and then 3 days later they break up and then she gets my snap from logging into his snap and then we snap and then she says he did crap to her and then blocked her from his story and location and then he did the same to me but now like all of the sudden 3 days ago he unblocks and I can see all his shii. Hm. Odd. Weird.
