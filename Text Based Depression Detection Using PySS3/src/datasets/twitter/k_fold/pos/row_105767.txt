I turn my flashlight on at 11 pm, this is how I almost died. I turn on the flashlight on my phone so I can carefully put my headset off my bed, but instead I see a small ass spider drop down from my ceiling onto the edge of my blanket (as I'm half naked). I killed it my crushing it with my blanket.

The spider was a pancake after I was done with it. I used the audio jack on my headset to wipe it off my blanket it and throw it off the side of the bed
