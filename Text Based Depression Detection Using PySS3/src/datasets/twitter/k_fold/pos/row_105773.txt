My Teacher has some nerve My teacher has to nerve to send me an email of homework at 11:47 PM (I go to sleep at 11PM.) and then be a smartalec when he says "That's you right? I sent it to you!" like are you kidding me? Maybe you should send the homework earlier! It's not my fault I have to sleep and wake up at 8 AM! I'm able to do work but not when you don't send it to me!
