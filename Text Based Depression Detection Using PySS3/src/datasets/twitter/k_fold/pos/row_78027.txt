Male redditors under 18, please tell me about your dating experience. I began dating a girl two months ago and she tells me she enjoys being with me, but never texts me, never initiates hugs / kisses / dates, ect... 
Needless to say, Iâ€™m seriously thinking about dumping her. 

To get an idea of what other relationships actually look like, I would love to hear the pros and cons of your dating experiences! If thatâ€™s something yall are willing to share ofc
