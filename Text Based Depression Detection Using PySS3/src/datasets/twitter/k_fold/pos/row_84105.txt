So there I am laying in my bed Watching a video footage from 1939 or so with Hitler and Mussolini on the stage. I am somewhat a history nerd so I like to watch any historical video. So I continue watching it till the end and at the end Mussolini and Hitler shake hands, I was like wtf no don't do that it's unhygienic and then I remember it wasn't 2020. This is the first time I actually like felt like handshaking was wrong. After a few days I watched some documentary about Mozart and in a scene that features chinese knock-off mozart Shaking his friend's hand and it was just so weird to see. I am not gonna lie I still shake my friend's hands but I wash them after that, I don't know why or how but handshaking feels weird now but mostly on video.
