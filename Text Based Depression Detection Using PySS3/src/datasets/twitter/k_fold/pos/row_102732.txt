How the fuck do I stop procrastinating Like this online school is just too much. In class I had a space where I could just sit down in a desk and concentrate on work, maybe while having a conversation with someone sitting near me at the same time.

At home its not like that. There's too much distractions and not having a schedule makes me always hold off work till later. I have a bunch of work piling up and my grades are dropping. Like there's too much distractions and whenever I start doing work I can only do it for maybe half an hour at a time and then I just can't anymore.

Anyone have any tips on how to overcome this?
