i want my birthday to come but at the same time i don't want to turn 15 i can't wait to be older but at the same time i don't want my birthday to come bc i'll probably enjoy the anticipation more than actually turning 15 and also once i turn 15 I don't really have anything much to look forward to for the next 364 days
