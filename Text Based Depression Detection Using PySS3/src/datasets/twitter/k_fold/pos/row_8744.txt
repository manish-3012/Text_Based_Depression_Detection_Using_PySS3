Seniors or anyone whos graduated high school, has any of this happened to you? That moment where, one day you get an email from a college saying that they accept you for a career department like engineering or english etc, then 2-4 days later, you get another email from THAT college saying that, â€œit was a mistake and we actually dont accept you into our systemâ€.
