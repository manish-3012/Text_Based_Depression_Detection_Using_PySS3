Am I a bad person for stopping talking to my (online)friend He is really nice and I'm glad he has been my friend because no one else wants to talk to me so he has been the only one who has talked to me throughout the day

At first it went well but for some reason I developed a really bad social anxiety. I get really anxious as soon as someone messages me even if it's my friend and then I feel really bad the rest of the day

I feel bad because I often have to tell him I can't talk because I feel too anxious. Then I feel bad because I feel obliged to talk to him. I'm afraid of people including my friend and I just can't talk to people anymore. I can't talk to my family nor people online and I have tried to tell my friend but he says I have to talk to him. I have written a long list of reasons I want to stop talking but he only says "please talk" Then he messages me until I talk and then I'm even more anxious and hate talking to people more than before. 

Another reason I have been trying to cut off contact with him is because I hurt him. I have hurt him in so many ways because sometimes I just breakdown and say some really mean things because all I want to do is to not talk. When he was feeling bad and just wanted to talk to a friend I told him I hate him and I'd rather die than talk to him 

He says I can't go more than 2 days without talking to him. I have even blocked him but he finds another way to contact me. And now he hates me and I have promised myself it was the last time I'm ever going to talk to anyone

I tried to tell him I shouldn't be friends with anyone
