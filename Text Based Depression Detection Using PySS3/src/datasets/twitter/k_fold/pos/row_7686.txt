the boys will help me So i (16M) i was going outside with a girl,and that girl has started to like me,and telled that to one of her friends,and that friend of her telled me.
Pretty soon we will reach the point when she will ask me out,and...i dont know what to tell her.
My parents know with hwo i am going outside and telled me, that girl is ugly and il be stupid to be with her.
Well the girl is not verry good but in my opinion she is kind of pretty.
But i am not ready for a relationship and she is not my tipe.
But she fucks and il be with her just because of her,and it will not be a long relationship,she aniways liked a lot of boys before me and got a lit of breakups with no regrets and aniway i dint feel that it will be something big.
Idk boys what haved you do if you where in my place?
Please seriosity and sorry for bad writing and grammar i dont speak english good,i am romanian.
