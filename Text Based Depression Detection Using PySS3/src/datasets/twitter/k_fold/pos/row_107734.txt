Needing Attention Is it bad that I sometimes think about how if I crashed my car or broke a bone that I would get more attention. And that I would like that since no one really cares about me?  Is this a sign of a mental illness or what? Like Iâ€™d be fine with a broken bone if it meant people cared about me.
