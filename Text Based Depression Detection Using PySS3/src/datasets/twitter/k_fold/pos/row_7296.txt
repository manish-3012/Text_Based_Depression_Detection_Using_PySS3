I know what you are thinking - **"this must be a scam"** or **"I have heard many different tips and tricks; what makes this any different?"**.

In all honesty, I would think the exact same thing. However, if you spare me a minute of your time, I can assure you this will be **one of the best decisions you have made when it comes to ACT prep**.

I sat the **ACT in February and achieved a 32**. A good score, but **not good enough for the Ivies**. I am an international student from the UK, so I figured there was no use for me to apply as I could never compete with the 34+ students. One of my friends convinced me to give it another shot and I registered for the **July ACT**. I was really rusty, however, and **only had a month or so to prepare;** I was **super stressed** and really thought that I could not achieve a good score.

But, I just spent a countless number of hours reading different tips and tricks. The majority of tips completely failed for me and were no use; however, **I discovered some hidden gems that propelled me from a 32 to a 36**.

I was super happy and celebrated getting that 36. However, I have seen so many students who have not been able to sit the ACT due to cancellations or just simply cannot get their **'dream' score** \- I say **'dream'** as **I thought that I could never reach a 35, let alone a 36**.

In all honesty, I started to feel really guilty. **I have so many niche, unknown tips that I have acquired and haven't shared with anyone**. I want to share them now and help you all out in anyway that I can, so **I am in the process of creating a free eBook that will be released within 1-2 weeks.** It will **be free on Amazon for 24-48 hours, so make sure to download it ASAP when it launches**.

**Remember, if you are applying this year, you still have the December ACT - one last shot; what do you have to lose?**

If you are interested in receiving this eBook when it launches, **just fill in the linked Google Form** (you can use any email - it doesn't have to be a Google one) and you will receive an Amazon link when it goes live **- completely free**. It will only be a few pages, **so it will contain no waffling; just the best tips that I have acquired**.

I hope that I can help as many of you out as possible. 

Best wishes,

DrDurak
