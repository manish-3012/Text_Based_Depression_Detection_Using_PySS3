The Teenager Dilemma It occurs to me that nobody will look back on their 15 year old self and say "That's the kind of person that makes me proud!" Nobody says that unless they are hopelessly lost in life. And that means no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try to be taken seriously, this is the stage of my life where I will produce the most cringworthy, laughable trash I wil ever make- It's in our nature as teenagers. And effort I make to better myself will make it more likely that I will cringe at myself in abject horror. And I want to change the world! I'm so ready to change the world, but I don't have the brain capacity to realize when I'm making a mistake until it's been ten years and something vapid and stupid I said is dug up and attached to my name for the rest of time.

William Shapespeare didn't have that problem. He may have written the worst play man has ever written, had a few people laugh at it, and promptly burned the script. And now it's lost to time, and he goes down as the writer who never made a mistake. For all the pratical applications of social media, that was the luxury we traded.

Was it worth it? Because now I'm stuck between growing into a better man, who at the height of my success will think "I was a moron back then! And a vocal one, too! How much could I have changed since then? Maybe I haven't, and everything I enjoy in life is a house of cards." Or I could spare myself the cringe by never improving, and I don't know which is worse. This is what happens when we're given a megaphone, isn't it?
