I canâ€™t stop thinking about her Itâ€™s 3am and I keep on thinking about my crush who I havenâ€™t talked to in months who probably doesnâ€™t even think of me. 

I literally have no idea why my brain is like this bc I know this is so irrational. I know the advice of â€œclear your mindâ€ and all that but I just canâ€™t stop myself.

If anyone has had/is having a similar experience, pls help
