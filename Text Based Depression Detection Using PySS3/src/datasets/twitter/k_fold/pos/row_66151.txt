Just a warning to all teenagers in this sub. So I was browsing reddit today when I got a notification that someone followed me. So I clicked on their profile at saw that their account was created a few hours ago. This right away may be warning sign, but being the idiot I am I checked out their posts. They had one post which had a comment on it with a random link using their name. From this point you should not click on the link but I did anyways. This brought me to a nfsw website that was obviously trying to scam people into giving away personal information. Just want to say to be careful about what you do on all social media, even thought personally I hear it all the time.
