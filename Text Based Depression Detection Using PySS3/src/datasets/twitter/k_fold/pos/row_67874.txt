Okay, I really want to help this person. She seems super sweet and she's still going. Her name is Shirley Curry and she makes videos based on The Elder Scrolls Five: Skyrim. You might be asking yourself, "Okay, a lot of people make videos on The Elders Scrolls Five: Skyrim. Why is she different?" That's not the point. The point is that she is in her mid eighties. Yes, that's right, her mid eighties. She's somewhat close to a million subscribers and I want her to reach that goal in her lifetime. So if people can go and subscribe to her, that would be amazing.
