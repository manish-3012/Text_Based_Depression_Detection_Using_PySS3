Just ranting. Scroll past unless you have something to say I basically feel useless. All I do is sit around playing games all day and watching YouTube. I want to do something with my life but I canâ€™t get out of this routine. I want to serve as a police officer and have a side job as a software/game developer but Iâ€™m just too lazy to even try and do something to help with my future 

Iâ€™m chasing after my best friend who Iâ€™m pretty sure doesnâ€™t have feelings for me but sheâ€™s just so nice and beautiful and I canâ€™t Imagine a future without her

I donâ€™t even have a job yet. I need the money but I canâ€™t get a job

I just donâ€™t know what to do
