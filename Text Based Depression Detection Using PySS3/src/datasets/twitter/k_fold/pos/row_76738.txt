Hey I need a new pc So most of the sub Redditâ€™s arenâ€™t helping and I am In need of a pc. 

Backstory (Iâ€™m on a phone so sorry)

I was playing on my usual pc playing Minecraft or whatever when it broke. I couldnâ€™t pay it off in time so I had to scrap it. It also has a crap ton of work on it so :/, I Also think that a subreddit like this would know quite a bit about it you pcâ€™s.
