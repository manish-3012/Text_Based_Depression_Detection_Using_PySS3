I DONT WANT TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WHY SHOULD IT ALWAYS BE ME WHO DOES THE CALLS FOR THE DOCTOR. I M NOT EVENT THE ONE GOING THERE. MY PARENTS ARE JUST LAZY AF AND ALWAYS ASK ME TO DO IT EVEN THO I FUCKIN HATE TALKING. NO, I WONT GET USED TO THIS. AND I GET REALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT CALLING BECAUSE MY VOICE IS LIKE A HIGH PITCHED FROG. ALSO I DONT KNOW YOUR SYMPTOMS I M NOT THE ONE WHO NEEDS HELP WHY CANT YOU GUYS CALL FOR YOURSELF

I wish i actually could say that to my parents face but i'm too afraid of the consequences. I hate being such a coward.
