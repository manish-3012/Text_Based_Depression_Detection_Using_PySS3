i need help so i am a very picky person, and only like bland foods. however, i need a lot more protein and fiber in my diet, but most foods that are high in protein and fiber have flavor. I need help brainstorming what to eat, if anyone has any suggestions pls let me know!

(i dont like beans, eggs, tofu, anything sour or spicy, which makes it hard)
