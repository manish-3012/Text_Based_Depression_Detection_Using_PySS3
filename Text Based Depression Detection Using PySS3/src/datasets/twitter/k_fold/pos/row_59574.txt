Bit late to the party, but happy national gf day! I respect all of u fellow boyfriends out there who are in healthy relationships. I hope you guys are doing great and I hope you guys will have a good time, if not a good life, with your girlfriends.

I respect every girlfriend out there for being there for your boyfriends, for making them feel loved, for coping w our... primal masculine behaviour which might sometimes show itself. I wish the same upon your relationships

I respect all the single people out there for either consciously or unconsciously being alone. maybe y'all need a period of recovery, or a period to care for yourself. maybe you're waiting for the right person for you. maybe you're afraid you're not good enough to be in a relationship. the latter is never true. you are all valuable and all of you can and will find that perfect partner for you

and then, for sam, who is my amazing girlfriend: I love you so much. you are perfect in so many ways and you are so good to me. I want to be with you for the long term and I want you to know that, even though I've told you a couple times, more than that even... I appreciate you so much and you make me feel like the happiest and luckiest person on the planet. I love you
