Answering questions on Transgender people and specifically Transgender teens Hello! I'm a 16 year old trans girl and lately I've noticed there is still a lot of people who don't know a lot about it or have some misinformation about it. So if there's any question you have ask away and I'll try to answer as many as I can. (If you're trans as well you can jump in and answer questions too) 

P.S. If you try an spout transphobia in the comments I will personally make you change genders with the size of the hole I will rip into you if I feel like it so please just don't
