I think I'm officially friendless now. And I'm glad. Two days ago (Friday) I was hanging out with my friends (which i have nothing in common with) and I pretty much told them to move on. I think that and the fact that I told them my parents want to meet them finally got them to fuck off. 

(BTW I have no idea how to flare this)
