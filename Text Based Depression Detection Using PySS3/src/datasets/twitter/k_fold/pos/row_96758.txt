I donâ€™t get what the big deal is with the Billie eilish photos Firstly people need to understand that the vast majority of people saying not so nice things are joking. They are just having a laugh. Thereâ€™s very few people who have said hurtful things meaningfully 

But also, the fake depressed teen Billie fans need to stop saying she asked them not to be posted, because she didnâ€™t 

She literally looks normal, there is no big issue. 

Idk about you guys, but sheâ€™s still just good looking as before ( Iâ€™m 18 also )
