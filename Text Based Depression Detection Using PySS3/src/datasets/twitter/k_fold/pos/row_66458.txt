I just realized, almost all the people I know and talk with at school right now are girls. I'm a freshman and our school is on a rotating day schedule Like the only people I know who I share classes with and talk with, are girls. I have one friend who's in 3 of my class, plus I sit with them in Lunch (along with her friends from the soccer team who are all girls. The one other clarinetist in band is a girl. All the people I talk with in the flute section are girls (though there are some boys during normal practice). Weird.
