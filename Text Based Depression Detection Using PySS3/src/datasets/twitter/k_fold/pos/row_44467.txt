Two creepy guys followed my sister and I around in the grocery store today My sister and I had to make a last minute trip to the grocery store today because we forgot to get something for dinner. The ONE time her boyfriend doesnâ€™t come with us, two guys kept following us around the store and kept trying to get our attention. Eventually at the checkout (they were checking out at the same time) we asked if someone could follow us out to our car because we were uncomfortable. Someone who worked there walked us out and was very sweet. Stay safe out there everyone! &lt;3
