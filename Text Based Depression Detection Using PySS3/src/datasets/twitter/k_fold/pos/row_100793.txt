My parents have way too high standards and are overbearing. Any advice on dealing with it My parents have always been overbearing and hypocritical. My parents treat me like some prodigy when it comes to anything academic, just because I kept straight Aâ€™s through elementary. Iâ€™m now finishing 8th grade and taking geometry and have something like a 83 in it. For years Iâ€™ve gotten little to no praise for school and just get yelled at for not doing well enough in a class that is designed for people two years older than I am. Meanwhile my parents get super excited when my younger brother gets AB honor roll. It hurts a lot. Iâ€™ve been stressed lately and itâ€™s been affecting my mood around them, making me super pessimistic and a huge smart ass around them, and all it leads to is them yelling at me for talking back.
