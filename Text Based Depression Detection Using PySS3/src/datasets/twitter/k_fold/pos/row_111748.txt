OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY DO ALL HIGH SCHOOL BOOKS HAVE TO HAVE POLITICAL UNDERTONES! My school just started a new trimester and as part of that we have to pick books to read during that time. And I kid you not EVERY SINGLE BOOK IS TRYING TO FORCE A POLITICAL MESSAGE DOWN THE READERS THROAT. I asked my English teacher about this and she said something like "its good to have books with diverse messages" I don't want to go down the fucking rabbit hole of diversity and politics and all that shit I just want to read a book that I like and isn't trying to impose some sort of message on me.
