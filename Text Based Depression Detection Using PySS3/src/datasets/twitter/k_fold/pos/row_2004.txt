I have a strong urge to yeet my brother out of the window I'm barely holding myself back, that little shit goblin is going through my things again, messing with them, clearly insulting my work I do for school, not giving a fuck about them.

At least fucking apologise for once, but noooo, he has to dig his nails into me even further

But hey, I'm trying to make up things with him, I'm living with for at least another 4 years, I'm giving him so many second chances, but he blows them up, and he *blames it on me*

I'm this close to kicking him in the face
