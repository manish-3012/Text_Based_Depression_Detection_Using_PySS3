Shit posting What the hell has this subreddit turned into? from what I can tell this is just a subreddit to gain karma through rubbish posts that take 1 minute to write.

What happened to the days where nobody cared about karma, but actually wanted to help each other with tricky situations.?

This needs to come to an end, and fast because it is heading down a bad direction. People with legitimate problems, rise up, downvote shitposts.

I have helped 2 people avoid suicide and I'm really terrified that if this turns to fucking shit, people who are suicidal won't get the help they need or people who are struggling.

Sorry if this is out of structure, im just really pissed
