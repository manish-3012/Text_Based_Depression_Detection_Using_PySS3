I still remember the day I started liking Frozen and Disney Princesses The very moment I saw screenshots of the Princesses in Ralph Breaks The Internet, I knew it was something I was going to like.  
 
I mean, the princesses are cute. But when I saw them in casual clothes, that was when i just found them to be way too cute.
