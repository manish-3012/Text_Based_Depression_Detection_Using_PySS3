I think its so funny when dudes act like sexism just doesnâ€™t exist and feminism shouldnâ€™t exist anymore Feminism is still needed, even in 1st world countries. 

I mean *even* in America. There are things like the gender pay gap, and even if you donâ€™t think that exists, there are still plenty of other things.

Like how women canâ€™t get their tubes tied without her husbands consent. How when women give birth, the husband can tell the doctors to stitch the vagina tighter without the womans consent (its called the husband stitch).

This one isnâ€™t so much a legal problem, but a societal one. Sexually active women are expected to go on birth control even though they can get pregnant only once every 9 months, while men arenâ€™t expected to get vasectomies (which can be reversed) and can get hundreds of women pregnant in 9 months.



Feminism isnâ€™t against men, it is against sexism. You shouldnâ€™t feel attacked by feminism unless youâ€™re sexist.
