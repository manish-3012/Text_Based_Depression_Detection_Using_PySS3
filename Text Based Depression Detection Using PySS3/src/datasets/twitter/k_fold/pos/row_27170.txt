just got cancelled on twitter, feeling kind of numb the twitter community has been my safe haven during lockdown and i really built a community there. i got cancelled there (rightfully so, it's entirely my fault) so i'm just feeling really numb at the moment. i'm going to deactivate for good because it's a place where i'm unwelcome in now, which is understandable. 

where am i going to brainrot now? how am i going to waste time during online school?? and i'll be losing a lot of friends too. 

it's been stressing me a lot this past weekend because i had to create a public apology yadda yadda ya so i'm ready to leave it behind me and leave twitter for good. i'm sad to see things go and i'm remorseful for what i did, but ouch some of the backlash i received was very unnecessary.

this is just me feeling sorry for myself. i already miss my twitter mutuals but i don't want to make people uncomfortable anymore. :))
