My Parents came Covid Positive, but I am the one in Quarantine My mom got Corona^+ Â½ a month ago, and then a chain followed and caught my Dad, tho moderate, but precautions necessary.

While my lil sis was untouched; They like roam the alleys" of house while i am packed in one room; it really feels like apocalypse, and me a lazy zombie.

I am like in One room for those 15 days, isolated and desolated,  it sucks.

Ya'all take care.
