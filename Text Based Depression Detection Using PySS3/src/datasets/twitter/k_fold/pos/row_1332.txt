i just got friendzoned I have known this girl, call her A, and i have known her since year 8, I'm in year 12 now. I finally got the courage to say that I like her and she said that she doesn't feel the same.

My confidence is now at an all time low.

A and I talked about it and she said that she is no good at emotional stuff and kudos to me for doing it in the first place. She is also too awkward for it all, even though I don't think that at all.

What do I do now?
