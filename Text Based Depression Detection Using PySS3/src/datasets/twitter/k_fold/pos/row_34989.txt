Do I forgive him for calling me a slut? Me and a lad I was speaking to got into an argument over something stupid and then he called me a little slut and a stuck up mong. I said stuff too and we now both want to say sorry and make things better (know this through friends) but idk if i will seem dumb or a doormat if I forgive him. He hasnâ€™t tried to say sorry yet however I have been leaving the room whenever he enters including lessons. How do I fix things without being too easy on him because I donâ€™t like getting spoken to like that but I really like him and want to make things better.
