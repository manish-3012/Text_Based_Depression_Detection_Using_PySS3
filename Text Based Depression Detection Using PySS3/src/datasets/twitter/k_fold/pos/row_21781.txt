So tired I'm just so fucking tired of being the one asking for advice, asking for someone to talk to me, asking to be told that I mean something. I'm tired of being incapable of being happy on my own. I'm tired of being dependant on people because of mental struggles. I'm tired of being me, and I'm tired of life. Idk what to do and Idk why I'm even typing this. I'm just so alone and I don't want to do this living thing anymore.
