Stop making up bullshit Miss Williams Just cause the writer uses the word map does not make the whole fucking poem an extended fucking metaphor for geography for fuckâ€™s sake. And just cause the fucking husband thinks that his wife is like the ocean doesnâ€™t mean she is unpredictable and confusing you stupid fucks. What kind of fucking bullshit is this bullshit for fuckâ€™s sake? What the fuck is the fucking point of the fucking sibilance? NOTHING! Thatâ€™s what. Fuck this shit.
