I think i've fucked up my wrist for life idk if i havent been taking care of it properly, but it wasnt a from one day to the other thing.

Now that i look back my wrist has been like this for as long as I can remember, it cracks whenever i want it to, and i feel constant pressure  on it i guess. it sucks
