I need help know if something is right or not 
So, I wrote this little bit of compliments for someone other than my girlfriend. She is just my friend and I would like us to stay as just friend. But I donâ€™t know if I should give her the note. It is nothing super serious. Just a little note of things I like about her and how she is cool. A little friendly note. But Iâ€™m afraid that she will tell my girlfriend and she will breakup with me or compare herself to the other girl. What should I do?
