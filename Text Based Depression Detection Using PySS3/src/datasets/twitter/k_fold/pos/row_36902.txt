'The Office' has taught me important life lessons No matter how bad you think you are, remember that there is a person named Michael Scott. If he is,  the manager at a failing paper company, have relationship with 3 women, has a hot boss, employees who love him, amazing receptionist, a Sebring company car, a loyal friend like Dwight Schrute, you can do anything in the whole wide world. 
Don't take everything seriously. Eat cake.
