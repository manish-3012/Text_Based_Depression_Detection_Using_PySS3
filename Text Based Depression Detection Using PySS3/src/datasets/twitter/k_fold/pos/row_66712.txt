How do I open up to my parents about my mental health? Iâ€™ve been struggling with self harm and depression since I was 11 years old and Iâ€™m currently in high school. Iâ€™ve only gone to a therapist two times and the visits were about a year apart. The only reason my parents even took me in the first place is becaue they found out completely against my will that I was drinking and self harming. I have always struggled with opening up to them for as long as I can remember for about two reasons: i dont feel safe opening up because im either met with frustration, disbelief, and being misunderstood. The second reason is because Iâ€™ve always been a closed off person and it makes me extremely anxious even thinking about opening up to them because I donâ€™t want them to be upset because of how bad im doing. My mental health has been fucking horrible the past few weeks and Iâ€™m failing my classes and in my house grades are basically equal to the worth of a person. Theyâ€™re threatening to take all of my things away and not allowing me to see my friends who are the only things keeping me going at the moment if I donâ€™t start passing. How do I tell them that my mental health is the reason Iâ€™m  failing my classes and that ive been self harming again?
