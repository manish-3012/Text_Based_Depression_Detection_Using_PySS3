Why do people suck so much Why is it so hard for people to just simply not spoil stuff, to simply not talk about an ongoing show or a movie that just came out. Just shut up about it. And why do you feel the need to bring it up when no one is talking about it? Does it make you feel good you spoiling peaces of scum? Unfit to live on this Earth. Don't talk about it. Unless your are in a place were no one else will care or your alone with people who know about it too then fine go on, but the people who just blurt that stuff out can go straight to hell.
