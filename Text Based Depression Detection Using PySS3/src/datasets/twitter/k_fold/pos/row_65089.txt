Ass Fire There are all sorts of ailments that can come and go effecting the ass as one moves through life. Swamp ass, for instance. But none are as brutal nor as demoralizing as **Ass Fire ðŸ”¥ **. Usually triggered when you take a runny shit after eating chipotle, fried food, or other dangerous gambles. 

Once it begins thereâ€™s no stopping, you have horrible cramp if you donâ€™t take the shit, but once you do, youâ€™ve signed yourself up for a hellish burning sensation in the ass, sometimes lasting over an hour. A prolonged period of clenching, sweating, praying, and even suicidal ideation, and serious questioning of why you ever eat out at all

Thereâ€™s no known cure for the Ass Fire, but a tall glass of water can help ease the pain ðŸ§Š

As I sit here writing this to distract myself I implore you guys, be mindful of what you eat
