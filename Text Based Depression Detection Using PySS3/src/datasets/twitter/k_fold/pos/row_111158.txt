I hate having allergies during COVID time Since itâ€™s warming up my allergies are on x games mode, and so whenever I go out and unfortunately -sneeze- people look at me and make sure their masks are on right and back up. PEOPLE THINK I HAVE COVID BUT I DONT!


Anyways I hate allergies and I feel like death, thank you.
