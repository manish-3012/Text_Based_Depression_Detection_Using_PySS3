I just saw my crush at the store.. I had to repost under the serious flair but I went somewhere and i was looking for something for my mom and couldnâ€™t find it so i saw someone in uniform and i said excuse me and she turned around and it was her!!

We immediately both recognized each other and she said Hi and i asked her if she knew where the item was and thatâ€™s it. Now I wonâ€™t be able to stop thinking about her. Iâ€™ve had a crush on her for like 2 years!!!

Problem is that we havenâ€™t texted in 4+ months because I asked her to hangout and she never replied so I never texted her back.. idk what to do!!  I still really wanna talk to her and its killing me
