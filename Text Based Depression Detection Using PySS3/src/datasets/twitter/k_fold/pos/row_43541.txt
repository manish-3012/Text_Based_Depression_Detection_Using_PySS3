Anyone know a nice teen job I can do while A Levels Anyone know a nice teen job I can do while a levels

My home life is good but thereâ€™s abuse but they have money

They wonâ€™t make me pay rent but I wanna get away from them later

Itâ€™s a lot of abuse but Iâ€™m to scared to reach out
So thatâ€™s not an option


Iâ€™m 13 Male and when Iâ€™m 16 I decided I shall work so I need a job that I can save a decent amount of money from for two years while I do A levels which are hard if I wanna get into oxford or Cambridge 

I will save as much money as I can until Iâ€™m 18 and then I will do uni but keep in contact with my family as they can pay for it and once Iâ€™m done and have a job Iâ€™m done with them
