Farewell to my youth I am officially no longer a teen and my first moments of adult life were spent having an early mid-life crisis about a final. Nothing's really changed but it feels so strange to know that I've lived for so long. I still remember middle school like it was last week. I don't really have anything more to say so I guess I'll keep the post short but I do have a piece of advice for everyone younger: it's not worth stressing over the small things because in a few years you'll look back and realize that it never mattered and that stress serves no purpose other than to worsen your mental state.
