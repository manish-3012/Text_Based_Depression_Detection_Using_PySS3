I hate hypocritical mods So, the title says it all. I was banned the SECOND TIME IN A MONTH from the Star Wars discord server. A mod called AwesomeMa'am is a fucken hypocrite in there. I was warned today for making a political statement, even tho it wasn't political at all. I just gave my fucken opinion, that's it. I opened a ticket to make my point, but it was closed even before someone listened to my plea and was permma banned. I was also warned wrongfully on April fools, and that warning wasn't even removed and it got included in my infarctions. Thanks, I hate Hypocrites now.  
if you are reading this AwesomeMa'an, fuck you bro  
at least listen to what ppl have to say : (
