Why does "dude" need a female variation?? idk "dudette" just doesn't have the same ring to it.

This is just my opinion.

edit: all ya'll are saying dude is a gender neutral term and since I'm too lazy to respond to all of them I'll just edit. I am aware its a gender neutral term, which is why I'm saying this because it works for all, so I'm saying it doesn't need to have dudette.
