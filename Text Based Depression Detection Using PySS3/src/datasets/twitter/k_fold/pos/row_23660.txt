considering going back to my old job so currently the job i am working at doesn't give out consecutive hours to each employee, they mainly give out hours to the employees who've worked there the most. (basically if you're a new hire they just forget you exist) i've told them i am available 4 days a week all day, yet i'm barely being out onto the schedule. 

working about 2 days a week, 4 hours each day is not enough for me to pay my rent which is why i'm considering going back to my old job. however i have mixed feelings about going back.

for starters, i think took my break 4-5 times in the span of my 8 months working there. our pay checks were constantly late, and my fellow employees and i were beyond overworked. the manager was terrible and didn't care about our wellbeing but i did get consecutive hours every week and it was enough to get me by rent. on the other hand after every shift my whole body would be in pain from the amount of work i was assigned. 

the manager stressed us all out which is why we eventually all left, but i don't know if i should go back. my new job makes sure i take my
breaks, our checks are on time, and it's a slow paced job. is my well-being really worth it to be broke?
