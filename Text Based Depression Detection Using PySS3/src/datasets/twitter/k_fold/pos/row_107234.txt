Moving away from my GF So I recently found out from my parents that we will be moving away in January 2021. This wouldnâ€™t be a problem if I didnâ€™t literally just asked a girl out out for the first time in like a year.

I really have feeling for her. She for me too. I dunno what to do now. I told her and she broke into tears.

I donâ€™t know how i feel about long distance relationships, but I really like her :((
