That feeling of stupidity never hits me harder than that moment I drink the wrong kind of potion in a video game... I made this post because I drank a potion in Skyrim that improved archery. I don't own a bow. I just sat there for 30 seconds, reveling in my stupidity and how that potion was wasted. I could've sold that.
