Idk If anyone cares but I am playing GM mode on WWE 2K 19 and itâ€™s super fun! I thought you guys might wanna take a peek and help me out if youâ€™re WWE fans :) 
Itâ€™s super fun! And I knew people probably wouldnâ€™t care but Iâ€™ve made up a little roster for myself and i just booked the first week and was super proud of myself. If you would like to, you can take a look at my booking and give some suggestions or tips on how to make it better! Iâ€™m having a lot of fun with it and thought Reddit might have fun with it too, wishful thinking but I thought maybe you guys could help!
