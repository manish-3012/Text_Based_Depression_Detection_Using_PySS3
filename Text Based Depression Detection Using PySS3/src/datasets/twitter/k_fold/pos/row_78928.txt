Anyone want to talk? Kind of lonely. (14, Male) I don't know why, but all of the sudden I have been feeling lonelier than usual. I was fine the whole pandemic, I liked not having to socialize much, but I am so tired. I only have 2 close friends, and I rarely get to talk to them on behalf of my schoolwork. I just want someone who I can talk to. Anyone? Thanks.
