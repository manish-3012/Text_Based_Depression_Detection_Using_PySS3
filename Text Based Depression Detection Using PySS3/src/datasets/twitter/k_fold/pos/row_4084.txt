I need a hug or something....... I want to bawl myself up in my bed and cry myself to sleep, I miss my friend and I pray her life is doing good.
All because of me, I made a fucked up choice and I will never get to talk to her again, right now I'm really feeling the guilt I felt 2 years ago. I honestly don't fucking care if anything happens or something idgaf anymore, all I want is a hug and someone to tell me "it's all right, you've made it this far haven't you? Keep going your doing great" or something because I'm literally at the brink of crying...ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž
