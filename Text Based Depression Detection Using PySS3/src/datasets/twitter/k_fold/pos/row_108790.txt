Boyfriend wonâ€™t fix broken I need to keep reminding myself. I want a boyfriend to hold me while I cry and help me with my problems. But a boyfriend wonâ€™t fix all my problems. But also I seriously wouldnâ€™t mind a guy to cuddle with. And I donâ€™t wanna burden a guy with all my emotional needs, because that would be stressful for him ya know. Anyways thanks for listening
