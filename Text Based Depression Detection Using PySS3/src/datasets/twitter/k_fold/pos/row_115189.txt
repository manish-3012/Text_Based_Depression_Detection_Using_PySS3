Day 4 of slowing down on videogames Hello once again, i still haven't found any other hobbies that intrest me, i broke a little bit today, i played about 2 more hours than i was supposed to, and usually when i make a mistake, i beat myself up, but i didn't today, i just moved on and told myself to not do it again. hope you guys are doing okay! I've been looking forward to making these posts every day.
