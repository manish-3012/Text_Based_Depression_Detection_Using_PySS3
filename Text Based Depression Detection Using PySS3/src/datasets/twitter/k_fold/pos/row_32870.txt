A month into college and we almost got busted So me and my friends dodged a huge bullet today. We had 8 people in our small dorm (but due to COVID restrictions weâ€™re only allowed to have 3) and everyone but me was hammered and there was open alcohol all over the room. We opened the door and a security guard standing there and she made me step out of the way to look in the room. By some miracle she didnâ€™t see any alcohol and didnâ€™t write us up and we didnâ€™t get an underage. But our friends were escorted out of the building. If the guard took two steps in weâ€™d be dead. Someone was looking out for us tn
