I dislike my teacher greatly IM SORRY BUT SHE SUCKS AT HER JOB. She doesnâ€™t teach. She just stands there and gossips about people she doesnâ€™t like, and tells everyone about her childrenâ€™s private business. She told us on the first day of school that her daughter has an eating disorder and sheâ€™s really self conscious. Like, who does that?? I m not that great at math to begin with, but I need to be TAUGHT. I NEED A TEACHER, NOT A FREAKING HIGH SCHOOLER. I donâ€™t want to talk about your kids, I WANT TO LEARN. Iâ€™ve tried to watch videos, but they donâ€™t go into enough depth. She does one damn problem on the board for the WHOLE ENTIRE LESSON, and that would be fine, IF THE PROBLEMS DIDNT SLOWLY GET HARDER THE FARTHER YOU GOT INTO THE WORK. During quarantine she sent us ALGEBRA 1 VIDEOS WHEN WEâ€™RE DOING CALCULUS. I donâ€™t understand how someone can have A DOCTORATE IN EDUCATION BUT NOT KNOW HOW TO FUCKING TEACH
