Changed my discord name to my best friend's name. Well he didn't take it well. So I stole my RUSSIAN best friend's unique name on discord, he really hates it. Discord isn't letting me change it. He says he sent a KGB agent to my address.

I am in deep shit. He isn't showing mercy or even replying to me.
