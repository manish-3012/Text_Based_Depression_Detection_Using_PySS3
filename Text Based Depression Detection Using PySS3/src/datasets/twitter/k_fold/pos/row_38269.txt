Please help me find an old nostalgic comic website This story begins back in 2016 when i was in 4th grade. I played the Henry Stickmin games by Pegi for the first time and i also watched a lot of Alan Becker animations on YouTube. I got really inspired and i started drawing stick figure comics on notebook paper the entire school year obsessively. It got so big that me and the ten other people in my comic club made a website on google sites (at the time the "old" google sites). We called our club the Tophat Clan (that has to be copyrighted somewhere lol). We made a huge map of different factions and their hq's like the Whitehat clan, our enemies the Afro clan, etc. It was cheesy and very cringey looking back but very nostalgic for me.

Now i was going through this binder I have with some of my old comics and I remembered that at the end of the year I gave my comics away to various people in my class as "souvenirs " or whatever. I kinda regret it but i remembered that I would take pictures of some of them and post them on a google site which was the "Official Tophat Clan Website". Searching that up back in the day brought up my website as the first result which 9 year old me thought was epic. But that was when Pegi was still relatively small and they'd only made up to the Airship (in the game series). I tried searching various phrases to try to find it in google but with no luck. I may have even deleted the website at some point but I hope I wasn't stupid enough to.

Can you, the people of Reddit, help me find my website? You'll know it when you see it, it was an old google sites template (charcoal i think). Please comment or DM me if you have any sort of lead or url.

Here is all the info I have thus far (**TL;DR**):
â€¢ Made in 2016 using Old Google Sites (so used the sites.google.com/site/ format)
â€¢ Called the "Official Tophat Clan Website"
â€¢ May have been taken down for copyright? Not sure if they would because it was very small.

Thank you for any and all help!
