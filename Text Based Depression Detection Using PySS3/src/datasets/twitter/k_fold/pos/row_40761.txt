I haven't noticed my French teacher was missing an arm until now I've been a student at this school for *two years*, and only today I noticed our French teacher was missing an arm (turns out she had it amputated like three years ago). After our substitute teacher casually mentioned this in a conversation. 

Damn.

Sometimes I do hate myself for being stupid and inattentive, but on the other hand (Jesus Christ, pun unintended, sorry) it might be good people don't notice.

I feel sad and dumb.
