I cut myself again today I know u guys are sick of these post so I will make it short but I wanna get my feelings out

So I havenâ€™t cut myself in a month and I was feeling a lot better but then today my crush kept on making joke on have awkward it would be if we were in a relationship. The fact that after my first gf cheated on and now this is happening it just made me think that I was a good bf. Now I have been told that I am I really nice person so that made me think that I was ugly. With all these thing going through my head I just had to do some so I cut myself and I am really disappointed in myself.

I been dealing with the fact that I donâ€™t look the best and people always say you just confidence and I know that but itâ€™s hard to have it when all you hear is how ugly and dumb I am.

Thanks for reading if u did, sorry if there a lot of typo I am to tired to check for editing.
