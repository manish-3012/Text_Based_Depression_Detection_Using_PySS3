should I confront my mom? 
TRIGGER WARNING: depression, self harm
I originally posted on r/advice but I need answers ASAP




okay, Iâ€™ll try to make this as short as possible

so basically, my life is going downhill. all of my friends have left me, I canâ€™t keep a single relationship with anyone. Iâ€™m beginning to feel burned out in school for the first time, and my grades and quality of my assignments are slowly dropping

for context, Iâ€™ve been self harming since I was 13, Iâ€™m 17 now. Iâ€™ve been clean for about 6 months, but I can barely resist the urge to do it anymore. I canâ€™t even think of whatâ€™s stopping me. I have lied to all of my psychiatrists and therapists, telling them iâ€™ve never had suicidal thoughts or hurt myself in anyway. I also havenâ€™t been in therapy for 7 months. The only person close to me is my best friend, she knew I was self harming from the beginning. My parents donâ€™t even know. they know I struggle with anxiety and depression, but they donâ€™t know about the self harm. Iâ€™ve been expressing interest in going into inpatient recently (only to my friend) and she said she thinks it would be very good for me. 

iâ€™ll tell you about my relationship with my mom for context. Sheâ€™s VERY emotional, and Iâ€™m very closed off. She gets upset a lot of the time because I donâ€™t like her touching or hugging or kissing me. we used to fight a lot about me not going to school but I think itâ€™s a little better now that iâ€™m homeschooled. 

today was a good day. I had a lot of fun hanging out with my sister and mom, but now that Iâ€™m in my room, I feel horrible. I feel it all crashing down. I really just want to go downstairs and hug my mom and cry and tell her everything and convince her to put me into outpatient, but Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™ve never felt like wanting to tell her about this and I probably wonâ€™t ever feel like this again


what should I do?
