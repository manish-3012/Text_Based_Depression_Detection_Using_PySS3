I am so so happy!! I was working on a fanfic a mix crossover fan fiction and WITHIN THE FIRST FEW HOURS I HAVE GOT PEOPLE READING IT AND I AM SO SO ECSTATIC RIGHT NOW I AM ALSO CRYING!! I have never been this happy before and it feels so so weird!! :,D I am not gonna give the link though bc that would be stupid. To be honest... itâ€™s about the dream SMP members in another dimension and thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m going to say!
