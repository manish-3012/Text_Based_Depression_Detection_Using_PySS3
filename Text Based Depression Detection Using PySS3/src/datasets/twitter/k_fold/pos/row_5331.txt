TikTok Made Me Buy It List Iâ€™m sure this will come across like an advertisement and I wouldnâ€™t blame you for thinking that, but I think a lot of you will find value in this post so I figured I would share. 

I put together a list of products suggested by TikTok users. Itâ€™s pretty interesting stuff. But soon I might have to shut it off because of the executive order. Hope you guys enjoy it while itâ€™s still up!

âœ¨ If youâ€™ve ever been on the fence or waiting for the right moment to start a business or new hobby, consider this your sign! Take your first step today! No matter how small! The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single stepâ€”some progress is infinitely greater than no progress at all. âœ¨ 

The first global pandemic in my lifetime taught me how fragile my financial situation truly was. Out of desperation, I finally started a small online business. It was my dream to open a shop of some kind and, while I couldnâ€™t do it in person at this point, it felt good to make my first sale. If you have time and want to check it out, please do. It really helps me get closer to making this a full time job (a long ways away from that right now).

And if you really enjoy it, consider sharing on social mediaâ€”if I can ever get something viral, it could really give me the momentum to make it a true business.
