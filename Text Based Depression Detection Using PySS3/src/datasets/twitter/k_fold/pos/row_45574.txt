A fast food restaurant that serves funeral catering food Do you ever miss the times where you gorged yourself on Strombolis   while your aunt stared into space with a dead expression in her eyes? Or perhaps you miss drinking a sugary lemonade while hearing the chatter of young children who are incapable of grasping the concept of death barely aware that the one who loved them and made their lives happier had gone to sleep one day and never woke up?

THEN COME ON DOWN TO CARLES CORPSE AND CREAM

Where we serve not only some random fucking Italian thing covered in pepperoni (seriously what is that thing?) but we also serve ice cream and cheese that tastes like how you'd think funeral cheese tastes like.

And for ultra realism we even host real ongoing funerals at our locations!

and try out our new CREAM-mation which is an ice cream cone dipped in hot fudge and rainbow sprinkles

So what are you waiting for? Share a bottle of wine or 5 with the newly widowed 70 year old with developing dementia and have a fun time. (located off of 1-95 look for the giant coffin sign)

DEATH HAS NEVER TASTED SO GOOD
