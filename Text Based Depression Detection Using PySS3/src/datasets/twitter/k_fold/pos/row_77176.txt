Iâ€™m so glad i met you. iâ€™m so lucky.
i just had to type an appreciation post for [this person](https://www.reddit.com/user/me) because they really mean the world to me.

i think iâ€™m falling in love tbh. Theyâ€™re so amazing, one of the best people Iâ€™ve ever met. So nice, so caring. And I canâ€™t forget how beautiful they are.

thank you for everything.
