Who loves Markiplier? If anyone has ever seen his videos about/when he had to go to the hospital, you know itâ€™s funny when he was high on anesthesia. His latest vid like that was HILARIOUS to me. But did you see how loving he was to his gf? (I completely forgot her name) and mind you the last one was like 1-2 months ago. But the way he was being letâ€™s you know that he is a nice, caring, loving person. And Iâ€™ve seen videos of him just being so nice to Ethan, his gf, and other random people and his fans. I love the guy.
