I rick-rolled one of my high school teachers Long story short, I (19F) graduated high school last summer and started college last fall. My high school teachers were honestly just a bunch of unreasonable people who never gave a damn about our wellbeing so I decided to bother them. I made a fake email account pretending to be an annoying freshman wanting to impress the teachers with a Youtube video she made about her learning experiences. I sent the link to several of my teachers through their work emails and one of them actually fell for it and replied back saying "There seems to be something off with the link you sent me. Perhaps try sending it again? Preferably with your full name and ID details. Thanks ðŸ˜Š."
