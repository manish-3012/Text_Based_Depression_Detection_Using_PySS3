I broke my streak today. Funny thing is. I don't even know why. Had a few drinks, got ready for bed.. and out of nowhere I just felt it. The urge. Something deep dark inside me, and it took so much effort. I had to find a shaving razor I own, pry it apart, put it back together so nobody knew.

So much work for nothing. I hate myself, and I can't even reason why I would do it. There was no trigger, no cause... it was a good day. Maybe it was just too good and my subconscious hated that. I don't know.
