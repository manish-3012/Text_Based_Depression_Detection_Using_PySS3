Iâ€™ve got an idea So I have an idea to tell my crush how I feel. Iâ€™m gonna go old fashioned and have him check a box. I gonna drop it on his chair since I donâ€™t know where his locker is or if he uses it. Iâ€™m gonna write that if yes drop the note in my locker with his number. If no, cool we never speak of it aging. I ran it by my mom and she said itâ€™s a bad idea. But what do you guys think?
