Can we all agree to... To stop putting stupid cringe â€œwiseâ€ â€œdeepâ€ bio/discord status/descriptions in any type of social media...WHY? Because most of the time they just donâ€™t fit your character or who you are, and are cringe

 â€œThose who have never experienced true pain can never understand true peaceâ€ and when you met the person behind this quote they the most stupid average person you will ever meet and not that â€œdeepâ€ or â€œwiseâ€ like his bio smh

Also can we stop insta bios like this for example

â€œLife goes in what can you doâ˜ºï¸ ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸
*country emoji* / *maybe another country emoji* 
*age*

Itâ€™s ok to tell us where you from and your age but why in the goddamn fuck would you add that â€œwiseâ€ or â€œdeepâ€ quote or whatever the fuck you think it is? *stop it, get some help*
