Is it weird that I take pride in my scar? So in 9th grade I had a pretty bad injury on my middle finger that needed to be stitched up so now I have a scar directly down my middle finger. Is it weird that I like having it? It was my first big injury so it might just be the feeling of experiencing something really painful and moving past it but idk
