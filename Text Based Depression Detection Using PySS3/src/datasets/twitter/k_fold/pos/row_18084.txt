Give me a good name for an album, and I will dedicate a hidden track to you. I have been making an album with a friend of mine to keep ourselves busy during Covid-time. Its a rock album with occasional comedic elements. Good news, its almost finished.

But we have no idea what to call it. 

So leave ANY suggestions for a title in the comments. We will consider all of them, no matter how crazy.

And if we end up using one of your names, we will dedicate a hidden track on the album to you. (Seriously!)

Now GIVE US A NAME, R/TEENAGERS!!
