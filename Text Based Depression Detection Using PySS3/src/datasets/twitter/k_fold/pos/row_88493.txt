Six months. I am at a current loss for words. 

My boyfriend flirted with me for six months. 

Six months. 

Iâ€™m *that* oblivious. 

It makes sense, he called me many nicknames I thought he just liked nicknames. 

â€œLover-boy.â€ 

â€œHandsome.â€ 

â€œPretty boy.â€ 

Iâ€™m an idiot. I was pinning over someone who was flirting with me- for months.
