My childhood may be ruinedd I just dont like people from my school, no one is a actuall real friend, they are all just joking and making fun of each other. I feel like im sorounded by bad friends, i havent hang out with anyone for months now.

I havent really talked with anyone in 4 eyes ever, never been actually close friends with anyone. I feel like im mising on a lot socialising.

Ive been holding up good so far, i kindof learnt to be alone most of the time, but idk if its good for me.

Never had a chance for relationships idk what people think about me, idk how i should feel about myself.

Im now in high school and hope to find actuall good people.

Ty for reading this, im just sad i grew up with these people.
