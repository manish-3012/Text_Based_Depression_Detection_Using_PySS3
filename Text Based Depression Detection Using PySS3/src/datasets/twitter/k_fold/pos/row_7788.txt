I had a really bad dream,one bad enough that I would've gotten in jail if I did that irl At first,I couldn't recall it,I had a really bad dream that the 2nd time I woke up I forgot about what it was about,but I knew that it was so bad that I told myself I was going to jail and that I had committed a huge sin.

Lmao I didnt even realise I was dreaming so I confused it with my reality.I thought I had really done it but I was just dreaming.I finally recalled what it was about,I had killed someone,I think 2 people but idk the other one,and not just someone,but my family member,it was my aunt.

Which is pretty creepy bcs I remembered just yesterday when she was yelling at me I thought to myself "What if I just kill her?" Lmao obv that's just me being ridiculous I wasnt gonna kill her and am never gonna do that.And then I went to sleep and my dream turned out to be me killing her.

what the fuck.


lmao I can be really ridiculous sometimes :'
