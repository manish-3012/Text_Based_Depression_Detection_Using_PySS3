I can't get into newer rap music,any suggestions I'm an old head and I've tried listening to newer artists but I just cant get myself to like them.i like rappers like j Cole and 09-15 drake if that even counts,Kendrick of course,and that's mostly it.NF and logic are to corny for me,I don't like rappers like uzi,carti,thugger,any lil except wayne,or female rappers like cardi b and megan thee stallion. My favorite rappers are big l and ghostface killah if that helps.
