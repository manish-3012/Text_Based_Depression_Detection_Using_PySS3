I'm going into college soon In less than a week, I'll be starting college, I'm going to UVU with a degree in Digital Cinema, and I'm really stressed about it! A lot of these classes are gonna be online, and to be completely honest, I could not bring myself to focus when classes were online. Any of you currently in college, can I get some advice, or possibly some encouragement?
