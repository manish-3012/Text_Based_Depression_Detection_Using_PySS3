My parents are soooo BIPOLAR So let me explain the situation first. 
I just gave the hardest exam in my country(rather not revealed it).

I am not the brightest student and have been struggling for the last two years to maintain my average grades.

So before going to the exam my parents were really supportive given my conditions. They said so many positive things like "Don't worry if you won't make it" and other stuff like that. And just as the results were revealed, I got the expected percentage. But they were really angry a d dissipointed and started saing stuff like "We had so much hope from you"," you really let is down" and event went as far as saying that "I was a complete disappoint ".
