How should I do this? Iâ€™m pretty sure that she likes me, and I want to ask her out. We donâ€™t live in the same town, 30 miles away, and transportation is a problem. I want to ask when we see each other irl but I donâ€™t know when that is, so over FaceTime seems to be the best option. I really like her, and really want to ask her on a date when all of this calmed down. How should I ask her?
