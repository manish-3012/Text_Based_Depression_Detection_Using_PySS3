She thinks Iâ€™m hacking One of my teachers gave us a research assignment where we had to create a 20 slide presentation on the subject. She went through the basic rules, No plagerizm, No copying from other students, etc. but then she said â€œNever use Wikipediaâ€ so I decided to look at the sources for the site she wanted us to use, low and behold they used Wikipedia. I took a screenshot of it and showed her it and she thought I hacked it and changed what it said. She still doesnâ€™t believe me.
