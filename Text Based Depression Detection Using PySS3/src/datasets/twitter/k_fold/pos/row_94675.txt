I don't onow who to tell this to, so here it is to you. I have for a long time not been interested in getting into a relationship because i always felt like i need nobody, just my bros. But now, i kind of feel alone and sad. It feels like i am missing a part of myself. I don't know, maybe i should just focus on school and perfecting myself mentaly and phisicaly or try to find a girl for myself. I don't have anybody to open my heart for, to show them that i am not the strange guy that never smiles, listens to weird music and wears weird clothes, i want to show them that i have emotions and that i can love.
