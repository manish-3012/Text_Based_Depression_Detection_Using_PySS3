Basically getting free marks So in my school we need to have a second language as a subject and I got to choose between Arabic and French and since I am fluent in Arabic (even more  than English since it's technically my first language but the school doesn't care), I am acing my tests with ease. Literally got a full mark with out even trying to study. I feel so good rn so I had to brag about it online hehe
