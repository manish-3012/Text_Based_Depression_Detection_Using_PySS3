smart people of reddit is it healthy tooooo...... is it healthy to have a violent taste of music. even sometimes the lyrics. if you wondering what I listen to I listen to Rob Zombie, 5 finger death punch, godsmack, just lots of metal. I'm not sure if it's related to me liking to get people mad. like I would love to be a professional bully. it's just fun. anyways what do you think?
