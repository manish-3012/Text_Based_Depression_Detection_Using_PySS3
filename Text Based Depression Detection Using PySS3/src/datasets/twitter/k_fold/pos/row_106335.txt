There's nothing wrong being a furry guys.  There's nothing ðŸˆš wrong with being a furry. It's a wholesome community that is always respectful and accepting ðŸ‰‘ to new ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¬ members or those who just want to learn ðŸ«ðŸ«ðŸ« more. âž• There are ðŸ‘‰ so ðŸ†˜ many furry conventions it's hard to believe! The wholesome community is active everywhere and involved with everything! A furry is more âž• than a suit, â™£ï¸â™¥ï¸ it's a fursona. It ðŸš® allows people ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ‘©â€ðŸ‘§â€ðŸ‘¦ðŸ‘©â€ðŸ‘©â€ðŸ‘§â€ðŸ‘§ to be a basic human ðŸšµâ€â™€ï¸ in the streets but an animal ðŸ¦ƒ in the sheets ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) or an animal ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¦ in the streets! Not ðŸš¯ all furries are ðŸ‘‰ "down â¬ðŸ‘‡ to yiff" but they ðŸ’ say ðŸ—£ for the most intimate experience you ðŸ˜€ should yiff at least once. All experts say ðŸ—£ yiffing is at least 150% better ðŸŽ°ðŸŽ°ðŸŽ° than regular sex due to the nature ðŸ¦™ðŸŒˆðŸ¦¡ of being a furry. Your true nature ðŸ­ comes out. ðŸ˜ But being a furry isn't inherently sexual. You ðŸ¤ŸðŸ˜Š may just want to be an animal, ðŸ¦‹ not ðŸš¯ fuck them. And that's A Okay! ðŸ‘Œ You ðŸ˜Š shouldn't disrespect an entire community just because of some nasty words. ðŸ†’ After all, if that were the case slavery never would have ðŸˆ¶ ended. Do you ðŸ¤Ÿ agree ðŸ‘ðŸ‰‘ with slavery? If you ðŸ˜€ don't like ðŸ’’ furries then I ðŸ˜Š think ðŸ—¯ you ðŸ¤ŸðŸ˜Š do.
