I have a new least favorite teacher My English teacher told us that we'd have an assignment on gimkit. Oh ok gimkits fun and it should be easy, right?

You read the title of course not.

She made us get 100,000 dollars in gimkit. One-hundred-fucking-thousand. It took me 40 minutes, which isnt that bad.

Well it's not the time that bugs me, its how many questions I had to do. I had to do 197 questions. 197  QUESTIONS. I only got 13 wrong. WHY DOES IT TAKE 184 QUESTIONS TO COMPLETE AN ASSIGNMENT.

That's not even the worst part. The worst part is that when I got the questions wrong it wasn't even my fault because the question would just say "Personification." And there would be multiple true statements about personification. AND SHE NAGS US ABOUT NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN COMPLETE SENTENCES. And then there will be questions like, what is a definition of a simile, and THE DEFINITION WILL BE LISTED TWICE AND ONLY ONE WILL COUNT AS CORRECT.

But hey I'm done right? NO I HAVE TO DO TWO MORE OF THOSEFSUEORUDIDGSVEHEI
