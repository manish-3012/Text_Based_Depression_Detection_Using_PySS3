I've ultimately decided I shouldn't be with her If you've seen some of my previous posts then you'd know what I'm talking about. If not then I'll give you a bit of a rundown.

Basically there is a girl (let's call her A) and I thought I liked her. She had recently broken up with this guy and it was a rough break-up so I thought I'd give her some time. Turns out she wanted to go out with a 21 year old (she and I are both 17). Some may not see that as a problem but where I live there's only one reason a 21 year old would date a girl that young and it's not a good one.

I will still try and steer her away from dating the guy but I can't keep chasing after her anymore. I know she needs someone but she needs a friend. She struggles with self-destructiveness and it wouldn't be healthy to try to date her when she's so desperate. I'll be there for her but I just can't keep chasing her, for lack of better terminology.

Plus I'm kinda glad cause after I made this decision I realized I kinda started feeling things for another girl. I feel kinda shitty for that but the heart wants I guess.  I might make a move but sometime later cause some guy did the classic fuck and fuck off. Imma hang out with her soon so we'll see how that goes.

In the meantime tho I will do everything and anything in my power to keep A away from dating that scumbag pedo.
