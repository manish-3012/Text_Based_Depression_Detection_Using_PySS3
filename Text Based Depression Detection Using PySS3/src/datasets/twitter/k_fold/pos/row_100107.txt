Today I learned that a friend of mine is apparently a trans boy. And I'm okay with that; in fact, I'm proud of him for being brave enough to be able to accept this about himself and tell others about it.

But... this came as a pretty big shock to me. It kind of came out of nowhere and he just REALLY seemed like a girl beforehand. And I'm honestly having a hard time getting past this shock. Is that wrong? And how should I approach this?
