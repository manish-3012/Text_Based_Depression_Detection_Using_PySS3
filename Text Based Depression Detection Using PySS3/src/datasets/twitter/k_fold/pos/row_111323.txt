I made a list on memes that was never funny Here it is:

Juan (the horse meme)

Fortnite bad minecraft good 

Big Chungus (just a picture of a fat rabbit) 

among us/amog us

the impostor is sus

tiktok bad reddit good

the dancing snapchat hot dog

Jimmy Neutron saying "this person has 500gb of child porn"

And thats about it, should I add more to this list?
