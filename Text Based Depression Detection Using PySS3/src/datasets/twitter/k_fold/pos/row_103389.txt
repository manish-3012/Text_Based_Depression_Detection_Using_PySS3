Ok what the hell is going on with me and my feelings So i have a crush on a girl for 4months now which i go crazy after and i know she'll never like me back and im finally slowly but surely moving on but there is something else now , i'm friends with and i kinda find her attractive and i enjoy talking with cuz she is nice and shit , and all my brain does is make fake scenarios and all i think about is these 2 girls , fuck i think im getting a crush on some i'll never have a chance on.....again

I havent talked to the "og" crush in like a week and she doesnt know i have a crush on her...i think. The other one knows i kinda like 2 girls but she doesnt know none of them , well she does know herself but doesnt know i find her attractive in that way , fuck i think i am getting another crush and boi idk how i feel , im happy cuz i am talking to someone i kinda like and sad cuz i will never have a chance. Is it weird to like 2 girls at the same time 

If you didnt understand dw cuz i dont either . Thank you
