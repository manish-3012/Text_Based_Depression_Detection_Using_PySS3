So, I discovered how much fun a PS2 can be ITâ€™S SO MUCH FUN! Iâ€™ve always been a PC kinda guy but I have a thing for older games. I love the backwards compatibility (WHY THE FUCK ISNâ€™T THE PS4 BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE?!) so I can play PS1 games too! Games are also fairly cheap, depending on what ones. Anyone else like old video games?
