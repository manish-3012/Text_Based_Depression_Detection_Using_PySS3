Dear Liam Carpelli, I know you browse this subreddit a lot, and I wanted to say something... # I DUG MY INTO THE SIDE OF YOUR PRETTY LITTLE SUPED-UP FOUR WHEEL DRIVE, CARVED MY NAME INTO YOUR LEATHER SEATS! I TOOK A LOUISVILLE SLUGGER TO BOTH HEADLIGHTS, SLASHED A HOLE IN A FOUR TIRES, MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'LL THINK BEFORE YOU CHEAT.
