HELP ME PLEASE Hey guys and girls, so I somehow got someone to like me. But..... I feel like Iâ€™m acting like a idiot. I feel like Iâ€™m overreacting over little things because of what she says and I feel like Iâ€™m in a mine field . If though she assures me I didnâ€™t do anything wrong i feel like I need to apologize. Any advice? M(17)
