Nothing huge but I just wanted to say that I was successfully able to come out to my mom the other night. It went a lot better than I thought it would and she's super accepting of it. I'm pretty open about my sexuality around my friends and online, but I've been hesitant to say anything to my parents because my dad is of the mindset that since we live in a very liberal state, that I'm just trying to fit in or I'm being indoctrinated or some shit. But after I had seen how my mom reacted to saying my friend was Trans, I was able to build up the courage to tell her. I'll probably delete this post though soon because my brothers occasionally go through my profile, and I don't need em knowing atm.

Thanks for reading this far, I'm just really happy and wanted to share. Have a wonderful day/afternoon/night to everyone, may your life be filled with happiness and prosperity. Stay positive! :)
