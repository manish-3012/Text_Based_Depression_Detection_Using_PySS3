My whole school might be back in the building somethime in April I have mixed feelings tbh. I hate the cohort stuff that we have now, but it's become my normal. So having that stripped away and going from 2 days a week in the building with half of the school to 5 days a week with the entire school is just mentally overwhelming me at the moment. There are so many things that would change about the (albeit shitty) routine I've created for myself under the current circumstances.


It's just heresay at the moment, but I have a feeling it will become my reality. But hey, maybe that means a school sponsered prom will be back on the table?
