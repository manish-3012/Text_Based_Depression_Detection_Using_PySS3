psychedelics should be legal, or at least looked into in 1971, with the harvesting and creating of my psychadelics, there was the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and itâ€™s a United Nations treaty that bans many psychoactive drugs.

but the thing is, the people who banned them had little to no knowledge of these drugs and had not used them before. Hereâ€™s a few facts

1) you canâ€™t die from an overdose on most psychadelics (such as psilocybin mushrooms, acid, and dmt)

2) shrooms and dmt have shown to be very effective in therapy. things that require 15 years of therapy can be addressed in 15 minutes of dmt or 6 hours of shrooms.

3) psychedelics are also very effective on easing depression, alcohol addiction, PTSD, smoking addictions, ocd, cocaine addiction, cluster headaches, and end-of-life distress. 

4) currently shrooms are a schedule one drug, as high up on the list of addiction and abuse as cocaine, heroin, and meth, yet nobody has ever died from the usage of psilocybin mushrooms alone and mushrooms are non-addictive.


before you all say drugs are bad, i get it. people get addicted, spend money on drugs, etc. itâ€™s not always very cool. 

many psychedelics are not fun drugs. you basically have no sense of time and you see, hear, and communicate with your deepest pains and fears in first person. itâ€™s very scary. once you find peace in your pain and come to a solution, you get a bearing on time again and the psychedelics can wear off. and like i said, these are not addictive drugs. they are very tiring. and they can also cure addictions
