Even as an atheist r/atheism is incredibly bad. The sub is just awful. Full of people who absolutely refuse to look at things from a different perspective. Itâ€™s incredibly stupid to try to definitively say there is or isnâ€™t a god (in my opinion) since proving a negative is impossible and I personally havenâ€™t seen any evidence for a God to exist
