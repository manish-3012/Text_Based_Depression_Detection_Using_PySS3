British petroleum (BP) is a British corporation, not an American one A lot of Americans actually donâ€™t know that, they advertise as BP kinda implying there an American company but not explicitly saying it, not that thereâ€™s anything wrong with the fact there a British company, they should just embrace it

Shit I havenâ€™t said fuck British petroleum yet, or Exxon mobile, wow I made an entire post about BP without saying fuck BP, holy shit (I am not suggesting that you actually fuck BP or Exxon mobile, the crude oil will not make for a Pleasant experience)
