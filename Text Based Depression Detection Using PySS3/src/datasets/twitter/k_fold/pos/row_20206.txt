One of my high school teachers passed away.  I got a text from one of my friends back in high school that he passed away in his sleep from a heart attack. He was 61 years old and apparantly his daughter was set to marry that weekend. I don't know why but it hit me so hard. I've been in college for 1,5 years now but I cried when I saw it.

He was such a wonderful man, he was our physics teacher but meant so much more to us students than I can even imagine. He was a kind man, always taught his course with so much passion and hilarity even when we were bored. He was so invested in our school's activities, he sang in the school choir, participated in school plays and accompanied us and entertained us on school trips. On one of my last days of high school, he even told us about how he had stood on the roof of our building to help a depressed student from jumping off. I didn't know how much I appreciated him as a teacher until now, and I feel like shit.

The day after I heard he died, I had to go to college and do a presentation and I fucked it because I started crying in the middle of it. I had to get this off my chest and want to let people know how great of a man he was. Thank you all for listening, and because this is r/teenagers I wanted to remind you high school kids know that if you have any teachers that mean something to you, tell them. Show them how they made you happier and cherish the memories! Me and my friends have been watching old clips from field trips and all of them are just amazing.

Thank you for listening (reading) for a moment.
