Mom told me to do some adult stuff. So... My mom told me I have to act like an adult instead of watching fucking JoJo everyday. So, I did. I got out and walk to the nearest subway. 

I bought six fucking cookies. 

Ladies and gentleman being an adult is nice, (except for taxes). She doesn't like it when I bought the subway cookies because it have soo many sugar... An adult can do what ever they want if they have money MOTHER. 

What the fuck your going to do I bought this with my very own money. You can't do jackshit.
