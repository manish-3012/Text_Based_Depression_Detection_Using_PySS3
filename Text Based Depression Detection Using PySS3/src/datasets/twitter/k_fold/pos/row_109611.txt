A word of advice. Hatred, malice, spite, biggotry, all these things are happening here in the US. We as a nation need to stop, and no it isn't all because of"white supremicist" right wingers, or that "commie-terrorist" antifa! We as a nation, no matter the election results, need to stick together, and stop hating each other. Now more than ever we need to preach love, not hatred. It doesn't matter if you think that one guy is racist for supporting Big Baby Trump. It doesn't matter if you think that gal is an anti-american commie for supporting Sleepy Joe Biden. No matter who wins, we cannot enable such hatred and spitefulness towards ech other, simply based off of who we fancy politically. So instead of rioting or being immature and attacking others for their political beliefs, or claimig the russians hacked the vote, or it was a miscount, accept the fact that who ever it is that will win, we cannot let it divide us!

A wise man once asked a deeply philosophical question, "is mayonnaise an instrument?"

Keep this question in your hearts.

PEACE BITCHES IM OUT!

TL;DR don't be an asshole this election
