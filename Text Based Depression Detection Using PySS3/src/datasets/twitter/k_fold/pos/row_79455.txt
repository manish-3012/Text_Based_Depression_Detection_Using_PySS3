Sorry, i just need to vent a bit So before i type this out, um.. im a 16yr male and this is quite a long vent. Advice is appreciated.. thank you.
 
 so recently (well i geuss the past 4 years) ive been having extremely bad mental breakdowns, and theyve gotten more frequent and worse as of last year.  As a bit of clarity to what im experiencing i need to back a few years. Back in middle school i was not in a safe place. I was getting bullied and even some of the teachers kinda hated me, standard normal stuff for a middle school. Though, i have many mental disabilities, including anxiety and autism. And  everything hit really hard for me, a friend had turned on me, i lost many to death, and honestly i felt like i was about to lose it. I was constantly bottling everything up and crying because i couldnt handle it. I was nearly driven to the point of suicide.. and even more recently i lost more family, and lost and entire group of friends, and nearly lost one to suicide. At this point im constantly stressed, im driven by anxiety and i cant even talk to my own mother about these because i know shell blame it on how much i socialize. Wich.. at this point is the only thing keeping me together. And now i constantly feel like im going to break down into tears and almost concidered suicide again.. and its causing more of these panic attacks, flashing these parts of my life that i want to forget but i cant..ive been shoving everything down because im scared of opening up to my family. I dont feel comfortable at all and im scared. Any time i try to sleep i start getting flashes that i cant make go away.. i dont even know what do do at this point.. i dont know how much longer i can keep telling myself that im okay... i feel like im stuck in a loop, and i dont know what to do.
