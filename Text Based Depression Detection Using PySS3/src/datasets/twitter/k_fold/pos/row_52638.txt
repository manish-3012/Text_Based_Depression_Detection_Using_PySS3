Day 3 of my weight loss (posted late) Sorry for this being late I forget to hit post last night. Anyways hereâ€™s day 3.

Breakfast: my friend made me eat school breakfast, it was like corn dogs but with sausage and wrapped in pancakes. I had 4 of those, they were small.

Lunch: 6inch Cold Cut Combo at Subway ( I had an eye doctors appointment at Walmart and was really hungry) with lettuce, Swiss cheese, bell peppers, and Mayo on toasted Italian bread.

Supper: Cheesy Egg Omelette with Toast and Sugar Free Grape Jelly.

Physical Activity: I didnâ€™t get to do much because there is a threat in our neighborhood. I did play basketball at school for a bit but that was it.

Starting weight: 158lbs

Current weight: 153.4lbs

Goal weight: 125lbs

Notes: I know today wasnâ€™t the best day for weight loss but right now Iâ€™m down over 4 pounds. Feeling great about this and Iâ€™m super committed. I hope to be at my goal weight by the end of summer or early to mid fall. Expect day 4 by the end of today. Bye!
