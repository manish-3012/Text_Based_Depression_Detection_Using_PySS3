Was there any like really bad pop music in like 2000 - early 2010s Cause all I remember is all god tier shit like Britney Spears, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Maroon 5, Rihanna, Selena Gomez, P!nk, One Direction, Fergie, David Guetta, Katy Perry, Gwen Stefani, etc

We have some good stuff now like Ariana Grande but also terrible shit like Cardi B and pop isn't as good anymore.
