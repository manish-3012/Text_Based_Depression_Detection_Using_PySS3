What if paramount used live and learn instead of gangsters paradise for the sonic movie trailer? Imagine how much difference it would be , live and learn would have been such a meme though , it's such a masterpiece,  but I'm also glad they didn't use it so it wouldn't end up on tiktok, tiktok is bad . But I like crush 40.
