Heard a lot of people are salty about pedos. So, im 15 just so u know and no im not talking about the candy guy asking u to get in his van. Bc just the same as being homosexual or trans or whatever, U CANT CHOOSE u are attracted to children. So i think its basically hitting the definition of a sexuality pretty well if u think about it. and no im noit trying to talk ppl who commited crimes into sth or whatever. i just want to try and resepect the ppl who are pedophile and cant let anyone know bc theyre discriminated from society and what is spreading on this sub right now, only makes it worse. bc there are pedophiles out there, who do try not to hurt anyone and go to therapy and the problem is that all this hate going around also hits them and i dont think theydeserve it bc theyre trying their best to be a part of society and idont think u shoulÃ¶d be going against  homophobes if ur doing the same to different groups.  


thx for coming to my ted talk
