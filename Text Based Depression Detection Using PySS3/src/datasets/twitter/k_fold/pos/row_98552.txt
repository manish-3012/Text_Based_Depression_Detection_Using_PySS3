they just closed my favorite pizzaplace :( I'm sad i just don't know how to react, It was from an actual italian family, they made the best pizzas, you coud see the love, the beauty of the pizza, that golden yellow cheese, the red hot pepperoni, the crunchy edge.

We used to go every last tuesday of the month :( we went today and It was closed, with a Big sign saying that they no longer make pizza, they are selling it due to few customers. 

The worst of all is that the only pizzeria left is an ugly Domino's  

It was good wile It lasted
