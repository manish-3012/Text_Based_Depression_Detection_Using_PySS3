Something wrong with american highschoolerzzz so like i have my english exam tomorrow and i wanted to prepare so i just decided to answer some questions on brainly (if yall r familiar with the app) and this person had their exam going on and it seemed like they needed urgent help so i just decided to help them, they sent me this blurry ass passage but it seemed like a good read so i just read it and answered the questions for them (took me so much time but yeah it seemed worth it) except when i started giving them out answers one by one they continuously doubted me, saying that i am giving them wrong answers, they knew nothing about the question, they asked for help???? and when they were getting it, they JUST started fuckinf doubting me and saying stupid shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it was so dumb honestly, i blocked them because I didn't have more energy but i just hope that they decide to write my answers and get good marks because they were DOWN BAD
