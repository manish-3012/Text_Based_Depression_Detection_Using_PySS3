Have this poem I made while in Online Class   

Journey into Nothing

&amp;#x200B;

Death, cloaked in shadow and mystery,

Itâ€™s hidden face dark and freezing.

The gateway into the deep, dark unknown.

The final journey into nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Its invisible hands, cold, grisly, and dim,

Closing in on the feeble light.

The descent into its deep, murky waters,

Signal the end of a long and painful fight.

&amp;#x200B;

The darkness engulfing your dying breath,

The final, desperate beats of your heart.

The end of a long and twisted play,

The end, itâ€™s finished, the final part.
