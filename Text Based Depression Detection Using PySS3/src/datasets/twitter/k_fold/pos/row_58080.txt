My school's getting COVID and I think I might be getting it :( Hi, guys!

We started back to school, Monday. After the first day, we found out a few members of our student body and a couple of teachers tested positive for COVID after testing at the door. We're finding out more and more students and staff are coming down with COVID including a couple of members of our own cheer squad and a couple of students in my class. I have been in contact with some of these people that have it. I'm pretty good at wearing a mask and washing my hands. I even have some hand sanitizer that I carry both on my zipper and in my backpack.

What are the chances I can pick up COVID even with taking precautions? I don't want to bring this home even though we have no one high risk at home or immunocompromised.

Thanks!
