I am so mad at my friend right now I was talking to my friend on the phone and said "dang,Tony Allen's last album is releasing,that's sad" and then he said "ok...am I supposed to be sad?" He said he didn't care. He said "I don't know who that is,why should I care"
I'm so mad,literally one of the greatest drummers and one of my idols,no respect for the dead,makes me sick
