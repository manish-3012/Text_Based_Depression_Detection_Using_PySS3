School blocked access to toilets My school found out that some kids from the year under us (year 9) wrote some racist things on the wall in the bathroom, and has now basically made it so that you can only go to the boys bathroom (that year 10 and year 9 share) during break, and only one person can go in at a time. You have to wait about 15 minutes out of our 45 minute lunch break to get in. for reference, the girls can still go to their bathroom at any time. The school obviously know that it was year 9 kids that did it (theyâ€™ve been previously caught vandalizing the bathroom) but still doesnâ€™t let us in because â€œthereâ€™s no evidence that it was year 9 kidsâ€. They are planning to continue this until the person who did it admits to doing it (and would get expelled) or untill someone tells the teachers who did it. Do you think its fair for them to do this?
