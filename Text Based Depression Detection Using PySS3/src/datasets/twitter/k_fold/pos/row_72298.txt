I have an irrational fear of Mirrors Iâ€™m not scared of my reflection or anything like that, I just feel disturbed being around a mirror especially at night, idk why. I just hate mirrors, I donâ€™t mind how I look, I just seriously cannot stand being around mirrors, the ones Iâ€™m scared of the most are public bathroom mirrors and those big mirrors attached to Drawers/dressers, I donâ€™t understand why people want those in their rooms. If you ever stared at your reflection at night or in the dark your reflection changes into some monstrosity, I hate that too. The day I live alone thereâ€™s def gonna be lack of mirrors.

Mirrors Scary bro
