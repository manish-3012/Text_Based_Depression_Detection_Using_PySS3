how the fuck yâ€™all be having friends? my brainâ€™s straight up empty so i canâ€™t have conversations with others. iâ€™m just all â€œsorryâ€ â€œthank youâ€ â€œmy badâ€ etc. like, all empty, recycled phrases. i donâ€™t think i have a personality, so i just donâ€™t talk. everyone thinks iâ€™m a bitch. my lifes just ruined, huh? the fuck iâ€™m supposed to do without personality or talent.
