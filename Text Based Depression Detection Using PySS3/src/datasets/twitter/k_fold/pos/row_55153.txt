Someone said I'm the best today! Earlier today, my crush said that I was the best. I know it could have been said by anyone, but it was the first time anybody said something like that to me, and it made my day knowing I made someone else's. :)

I just wanted to share that with someone, thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day too.
