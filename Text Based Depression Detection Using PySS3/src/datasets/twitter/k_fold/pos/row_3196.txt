Running my head around Its snowing outside where I live, also 12:00 pm here too. I'm outside in shorts and a jacket listening to Ricky Montgomery - Mr. Loverman and I haven't really talked to my best friend today because my mood has been acting around and my answers have been kinda rude. I feel bad, but I dont want to tell them that. I'm not sure what to do and being outside just brought me to a sadness.
