im completely inanimate and spaced out wtf my body is conserving energy because I have to express emotion for 6 hours straight today and i do not have the mental willpower for that. I am. scared. although it's just my boyfriend so i can probably just fall asleep while he tries to make me start watching every marvel movie in chronological order
