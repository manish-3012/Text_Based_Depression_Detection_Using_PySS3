Just stop. Please keep politics out of education. I am tired of going to school everyday and only hearing about politics. My teacher talked about politics for a whole period. A kid got beat up because he had a different opinion on the presidential candidates. Iâ€™m tired of seeing â€˜Trump 2020â€™ and â€˜Harris 2020â€™ on every school locker. I hate living in the south. If you are one of these people, just stop talking about politics.
