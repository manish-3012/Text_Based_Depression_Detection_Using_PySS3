Got my drivers license. What now? I really enjoyed driving with my instructor, it took a lot of time and it kept me sane through the second quarantine in my country. Now that I've passed I have nothing to do. I literally don't have a single thing planned for the foreseeable future. 

Not to mention the fact that I'm scared to drive by myself for the first time. I know I'm a good driver (it's pretty hard to pass the test here), but I'm scared of doing damage to other vehicles around me. 

I don't have a car and my parents sold the car that I was supposed to have.  Don't have anywhere to drive to with their cars either. 

So what now?
