Pet names while dating... This is just my personal opinion I know other people might disagree which Iâ€™m cool with.

Anyway, I honestly donâ€™t like the usual pet names that most people give each other in a relationship. 
Stuff like; Babe,Baby,Princess,Queen,King,Sweetie,Darling,etc. I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s just weird to me. Wouldnâ€™t you rather have a nickname personalized to you, it just seems too common. 

Plus for some reason when I think of babe and baby it makes me think of my parents and I donâ€™t wanna think about that!! (They used to call each other that)
So, thatâ€™s just my rant and all I wanted to say. 

Hope yâ€™all have a Wonderful rest of your Day/Night! 
Ps; Iâ€™ve always disliked sappy stuff, I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m weird
