So Iâ€™m a femboy I donâ€™t really have a clue in what to do to be a femboy without anyone finding out. My parents snooped through my phone and happened to see that I mentioned that to my â€˜friendâ€™ and they (at least my mum) supports me. My school is really homophobic (even my science teacher) and also transphobic so I donâ€™t know what to do about it. Any advice?
