Did u guys ever cheat on a test I do study but i did cheat at french, im just so bad in it.

I cheated together with my friend, the first part was multiple choice so we signed to eachother what the answer would be with our fingers.

The second part was french grammar and i used a small note i hid in my sleeve.

Before anyone says its bad, well no shit man

I try to pass and get succesfull in life, i am not going to fail because of a language i never use
