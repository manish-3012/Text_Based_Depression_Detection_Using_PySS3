I'm so fucking tired of no one loving me I just want someone to fucking love me, but I'm too fat and ugly. 

Even if I managed to get prettier it wouldn't matter. I'm so fucking needy, and I need constant reassurance that I'm not ruining their life. 

I just want someone to love me. 

I want someone to make me feel like I'm not worthless and stupid.
