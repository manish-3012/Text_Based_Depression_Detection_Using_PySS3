My daily routine! Wake up at 7am. Good to get an early start you know!

Stay in bed until like 1pm and realise you have classes

Drag yourself out of bed at 1:30 realising you're getting no work done and make lunch

Sit there for 20 minutes still not getting work done and just waiting for your lunch

Eat your lunch for as long as possible. This should bring you up to 2pm

At 2pm start actually attempting to do classes but give up at around 4pm

Parents come home at about 5pm

Have dinner sometime after that point

Sit around until like 10pm. Realise you don't have any motivation to do anything and just go to bed

10pm-2am watch yt until you eventually doze off

Wake up at 3am

Go back to sleep at 4am

Wake up at 5am

Go back to sleep at 6am

Wake up at 7am and say "Fuckit I'm awake for the day"

I'm healthy kid
