A little rant that I might post on my Instagram close friends story So, I had to temporarily remove a few people from my close friends list before posting this but...I'm gonna be completely honest...I miss (insert girl name here). And by that I dont necessarily mean I'm still heartbroken or anything, what I mean is I miss talking to her and being around her. I miss my friendship with her. I havent seen her in over a year. I havent talked to her in several months. Before I asked her out, I felt like we had a really great friendship and connection and after I asked her out I felt like that was gone and I'd ruined our friendship. But then back in like May...I felt like maybe that was starting to come back. We started talking a bit more...and then (insert guy name here) had to be a fucking dumbass and get involved in stuff that's none of his business and fucking ruined that. And now I dont even talk to her anymore. I basically just keep our sc streak going and occasionally she'll reply to one of my stories but that's it. I miss her. I miss our friendship. I miss that so much. But maybe it's just better this way. Maybe I'd just end up catching feelings for her again if I started talking to her again. I feel like it's too late to try and get that friendship back now. It's just been too long
