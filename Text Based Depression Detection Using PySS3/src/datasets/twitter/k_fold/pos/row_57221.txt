My life is ruined and iâ€™m thinking of committing suicide. I asked to try dating my crush (who was a bit in love with another girl, but he had feelings for me too) 
He told me I had to ask permission from the girl he was also in love with, and I did. What ended up happening was she told me that he loves him and i told him that, now theyâ€™re together. 
I LITERALLY DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO, EVEN WORSE THAN JUST FUCKING GETTING REJECTED. 

My life is literally ruined. I lost my only reason to be happy and my only reason to actually continue living this shitty life on this god forsaken planet.

Edit: His crush is literally telling me i donâ€™t love him, im obsessed with him.
