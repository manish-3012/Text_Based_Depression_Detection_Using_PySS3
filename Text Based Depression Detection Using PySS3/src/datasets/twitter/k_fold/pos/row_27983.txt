Here's a small story from one of my camping trips I was around 8. My family was camping with some family friends, and while I was exploring at the base of a hill, and I saw a water canister that said "Non Potable". At first, I read "Potable" as "Portable" and thought to myself "Wait, but it can be moved..." I may have been smart for my age, but I was also kinda stupid lmao.
