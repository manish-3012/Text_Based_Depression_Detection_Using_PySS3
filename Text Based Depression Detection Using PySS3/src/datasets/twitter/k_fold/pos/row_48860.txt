Can we please stop posting otter pics/videos now? (and we are so sorry u/comrade-d0ggo) Not to seem like a grouch or anything but these otter videos are kind of annoying to see all throughout r/teenagers when you can easily find some 2 hour cute otter videos compilations or something. I think that it'd be best if we try not to do things like this anymore (as the selfish assholes have ruined it for all of us) But most importantly, u/comrade-d0ggo is getting a lot of backlash and (to keep it simple) extremely negative feedback from people claiming that he is stealing credit or claiming that the otter in the videos they posted was their otter, when in all actuality their friend just gave them the videos and he wanted to make people happy by sharing his wholesome videos (granted r/teenagers wasn't the best place to post them) and he had no intention of "farming karma." Above all else they have self harming problems and all of the users being least of all polite or kind really does not help their matter, and before you say that they are faking it, any threat/mention/etc. should be taken seriously by anyone, ever, no exceptions. So if u/comrade-d0ggo does end up reading this, I am extremely sorry on behalf of the users who have harassed you for no reason and to no end I really hope that it didn't/won't affect you in the long run and if you need any help with ANYTHING I can say with confidence there are people here for you and don't be afraid to reach out for help. These last few sentences apply to ANYONE so please, anyone else with self-harming issues, don't be afraid to reach out to anyone, whether its someone you know irl or a (TRUSTED) stranger on reddit, or even a therapist if you think you can reach that far, and if not we can reach with you. :)

I will most likely be back with more soon
