I donâ€™t know what to do now So basically Iâ€™m have really bad anxiety with school and other stuff just not as bad as school and itâ€™s really hard for me to take my mind of it stuff like that. Iâ€™ve found many ways to forget about it easily. The problem is that when ever I find something that works to take my mind off of school my mom somehow hates it. First thing was getting a knife collection and learning how to do tricks like with a butterfly knife. That got shot down really fast. Second thing I could get my mind off of stuff was just being able to talk to someone really like no matter who I make friends with my parents donâ€™t like them. This one is really bad because also it sucks hearing my friends getting shit talked by my parents. There was a couple more things I donâ€™t remember at this time but most recently like tonight I was playing on my ps4 and I just bought R6 and I was playing it was my friends. Itâ€™s a fun game and we were all having fun, talking, making jokes, not thinking about school. I had my brother watching me as he wasnâ€™t aloud to play because there was guest over and he plays in the living room. Yeah we were having a good time like every night mostly. So I knew it was going to be time to get off soon so I was ready for it. My mom comes in tells me to get off but then she goes on a rant about how video games are more addictive than drugs and that I may as well be a drug attic. First of Iâ€™m 13 second of Iâ€™m not at all addicted to videos games yes I play them all the time on my free time buts itâ€™s what I found to not worry about school. I was literally away from video games for 2 months and wasnâ€™t trying my hardest to game I was able to spend time with my dad which I donâ€™t usually. So basically another way of getting rid of stress and anxiety is gone. I donâ€™t know how much more of this I can go through itâ€™s really a lot. Just wanted to share and kinda ask like what should I do?
