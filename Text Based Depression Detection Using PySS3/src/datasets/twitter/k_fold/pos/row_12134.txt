i need some help guyzz  

I've been trying to get into my account from my new phone. And it got recorded as a ''supsicious attempt''. I know the password of the account, but I can't get the verification code because the account is logged with my old email (which i dont remember because instagram only gave me the inital and the last letter of it) and my old phone number. I have proof that the account is mine , I could literally show Instagram a pic of my face if it would help them.

I have also been scammed by a so called ''hacker'' before, so don't tell me to go pay some random dude on insta plls
