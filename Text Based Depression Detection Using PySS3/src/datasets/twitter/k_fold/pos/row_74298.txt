My mom actually thinks that ghost shows and all of that crap are real. It makes me kind of angry cause of how many times Iâ€™ve told her that itâ€™s just basically reality tv but with ghosts, yet she continues to watch it. I even compared it to the mystery shack (donâ€™t know if she got it) and she still continues to watch it. This was a short one, but I just wanted to say about this somewhere. Enjoy to anyone who read.
