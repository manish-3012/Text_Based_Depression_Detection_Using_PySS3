Cyberbullying Workshop Before I start, I've marked this as rant because I think it fits the post best, however advice on this would also be very appreciated.

With that out of the way, my mother recently went to a cyberbullying workshop, and i feel like after this my mum is making too much of a fuss about this sort of stuff now. After she came home, she sat me down and gave me a half hour lecture about how bullying over social media is different to in person bullying, and how one kid didn't tell his parents about him being bullied and him receiving text messages at 2 to 4 am and committing suicide after the fourth day of this happening, and that cyberbullying is different because you can't get away from it, and that there isn't any way to stop cyberbullying from happening to you, and I feel like this is a massive overreaction on her part, partially caused by misinformation because she tells me the guy who did the workshop was in his mid 40s. This has ended up in me not being allowed to have my phone in my room overnight, because apparently "I will let social media influence me, and being a teenager I wont tell my parents." As you can see, my account doesn't have my real name, i don't actually have any other social media and the only accounts with my real name are the ones i made for school, I've told them this and they know this and yet for some reason "people from school who don't like me" will still know who I am and send death threats or some sh\*t. I feel like my mum is massively overreacting here, have you guys had any experiences like this?
