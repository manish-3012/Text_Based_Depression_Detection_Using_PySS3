with the loss of flash coming up, I wanted to see what your favorite flash games were my personal favorite was motherlode, although I really liked tanks as well

while I realize that the games on coolmathgames are staying around, and there is a current project to archive other flash games and run them on an emulator, its still a sad sight for me.
