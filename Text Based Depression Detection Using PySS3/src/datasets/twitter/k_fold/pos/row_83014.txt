If you don't care by the slightest about someone's circumstances then don't say something about it when you've got nothing to do with it. If someone comes for help, help them.

But don't listen about stuff that's non of your business and then go 'awww' or something like that. All your doing is making that person more sad because they then think that you care and then get MORE upset feeling like everyone doesn't care and are faking it.

Like once I said how I was always paired with people in P.E. or whatever and they leave to go to their friends instead. So some people behind me went 'awww, bless him' or something like that and proceed like three days later to do the exact thing I was talking about.

I literally feel like my entire class doesn't care about me because of this crap. I've already got enough to deal with in my crap class and this crap is making it even worse.
