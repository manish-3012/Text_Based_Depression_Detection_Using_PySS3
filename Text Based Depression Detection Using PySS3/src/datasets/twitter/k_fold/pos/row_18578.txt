I confessed to my crush Okay so, Iâ€™m pretty bad at hiding my feelings for people. I managed to hide my crush for like 2 weeks and then everyone knew. 
My friends doesnâ€™t seem to get how much it affects me so they kinda told a lot of people. 
My friends boyfriend is friends with my crush and he has been helping me. I thought that I could trust him but apparently he had told his friends and they told my crush. 
I realized that the olny thing I could do is to confess. Everyoneâ€™s been telling me that he likes me too so I thought that I might as well confess. 
My friends boyfriend said to me that my crush had said: â€I like her but Iâ€™m to scared to say anythingâ€
Yeah, my fucking ass. 
I started a conversation and wrote: â€œI have no dignity left, I donâ€™t dislike youâ€
He answered, â€œEpicâ€
I talked to my friends boyfriend and he logged into my account and confessed for me. 
My crush didnâ€™t answer for a while but when he did he apologized for taking so long to reply, but he didnâ€™t say anything about my confession. 
I wrote today that: â€œIâ€™m sorry and I donâ€™t wanna be annoying but please just answerâ€
He hasnâ€™t answered, itâ€™s been like 3 hours. 
HELP!
