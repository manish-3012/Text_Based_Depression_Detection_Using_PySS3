For the first and probably only time I'm the hottest guy in my class. So rundown of my class. There is a total of 8 people. 3 guys (including me) and 5 girls (a first that there are more girls then guys.

The guys: Me, the terminal liar and the fellow geek

The girls: the quite girl with the proportions of an anime character, the girl with the emotional support dog, the very unattractive one, the emo with a slight eating disorder and the loud but thick Loli. 

If anime has taught me anything this is going to be a good year.
