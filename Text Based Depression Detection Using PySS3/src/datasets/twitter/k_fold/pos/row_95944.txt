Home made cheese So it's pretty late and I just got off my ps4 and I was carying a blanket I was using back to my room, and the corner tipped a cup of unknown white yogurt consistency stuff, and come to find out is spoiled milk. WTF why is there a cup of cottage cheese in my living room, on the carpet floor, seeping most likely  into the carpet and creating some ecosystem under, the God damn carpet! Then plus my brother a day earlier had a plate of rice unknown to me on a unstable platform to just happenly fall off onto the same place. Like Holy sh*t why be so inconsiderate, by leaving your container or plate of food ready to be most inconveniently knocked off by yourself. Then having to clean up that mess? FML.

Sorry for bad any En91ee5H or gr4M3r.
