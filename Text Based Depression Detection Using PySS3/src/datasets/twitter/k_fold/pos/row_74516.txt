My lie Today, I was lied completely about my past, and changed my entire existence when talking about myself.

About an hour ago from when I began writing this, I was going on a daily run like any other. I was doing my normal track surrounded by the cold of a midwest fall afternoon. It had rained earlier, so the dirt was muddy in quite a few areas. I just so happened to slip when I was about to enter the dirt portion of the trail. I fell, covering my knee with dirt, and drawing a little blood which I found upon inspection inside my house.

I stood back up and leaned against a fence at the entrance checking to see if I was all good to keep running. However, from a little down the trail, came a girl who seemed to be about 25-30. She was dreads, and sandy brown hair. As she was walking past, I decided to open up conversation, because I'm a very outgoing person. However, as I began to speak, I realized I was putting on an accent. Now, this isn't that wierd, because I've been watching a lot of STORROR lately, and I've been doing accents all my life. And yet, as I continued to talk, I just began to make up a past. 

Apparently, I had come over from the UK when I was twelve, and I had lived here ever since. I was taking an off year from college to make some money, and I had been planning to work at a movie theater, but then Covid ended that. At the end, she offered me her business card,  but I backed up, thinking about Covid and all that. Thinking on it now, I'm not sure if she was interested in me, or just felt bad for me, and yet I don't really care. 

I know this is going to sound wierd, but to become a completely different person was nearly euphoric.  It felt natural in a way that I have not felt in so long. My heart beat extremely quick, and yet I felt completely calm. I felt in my element, lying... I'm not sure if I should have written this out, because I'm still very conflicted on my feelings towards it, but I just had to tell it to someone.
