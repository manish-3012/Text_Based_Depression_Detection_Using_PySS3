Does anyone else think the technology behind record players are amazing? Like I mean how the hell did someone somewhere come up with the idea of scratching in sounds into a piece of circular vinyl, and then make a very tiny needle powered by electromagnetic induction to turn those scratches into sound waves?

Like I mean sure the invention of computers is great and all that, but come on mate the technology of a record player is just astonishing.
