I (15M) was FORCED by my ONLINE SCHOOL to CUT my HAIR because it was considered FEMININE and UNHYGIENIC. A month ago I was forced by my school to cut my hair because it looks feminine and unhygienic because it had a medium hair length (my family also supports this).

I loved and cared my hair for half a year then get it stripped away from me unwillingly. 

This somewhat traumatised me but I had to keep a happy face although I know Iâ€™m being constantly shamed by the system if I make a sad face because again it was considered too feminine.

I had lost weight even though I was already underweight and havenâ€™t slept a lot ever since, I also considered jumping off my balcony multiple times but somehow Iâ€™m still living.

And now Iâ€™m considering getting a buzz cut as a power move, I would probably never do it but Iâ€™m just thinking about it.
