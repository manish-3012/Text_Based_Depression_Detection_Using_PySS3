Yo anyone else moving out in like 8 months? I freak out about it from time to time but I've never wanted something so bad and worked so hard for. It's already October and I'll be 18 in 3 more months. 

I kinda raised myself so I don't think it'll be too different from what I'm used to but it still scares the shit out of me that's why I'm doing it
