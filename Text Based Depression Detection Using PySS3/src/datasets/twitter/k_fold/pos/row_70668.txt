I DID IT! I FucKIn DId It BOYS!!! (and girls) I got meself a girlfriend!!

Not sure how... but I did!!!

Ok so I had found her attractive for quite a while and finally this year I started talking to her. We flirted a bit and regularly exchanged compliments always on the wholesome side. After a few months or so we talked and shared some of our more personal facts and became closer, and I'm pretty sure that the thought of dating bounced around both of our heads more often than not. FINALLY last night we started talking about it head-on and.... SHE ASKED ME OUT!!! I was gonna hold off a few days because I didn't want to rush it but DAMN! She took initiative! And that children, is how I am no longer single. Thank you.  
(Edit: pretty sure shes reading it lmao)
