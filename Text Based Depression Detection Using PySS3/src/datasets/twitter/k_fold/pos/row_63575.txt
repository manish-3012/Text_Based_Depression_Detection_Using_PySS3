Crushes &amp; all that I'm really torn up because I've had a crush on this guy for 3 months now and he has made it clear that his best friend has a crush on me, so my crush is talking to me less and less and i do not like his best friend back. I'm trying to let him down easy and get back closee with my crush. but now i dont know if I like my crush or the idea of him I made in my mind. And I dont even know if he likes me back.
