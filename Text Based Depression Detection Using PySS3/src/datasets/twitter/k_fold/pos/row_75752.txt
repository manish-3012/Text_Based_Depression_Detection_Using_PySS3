So my class is going to do sweatshirts for being 8th grade, but my class is so f*cking indecisive So we have to put a picture of the mascot (preferably), a bible verse, our names, and â€œclass of 2021â€. Simple as that. We held votes for waht people wanted. For some f*cking reason we are going to put f*cking claw marks. CLAW MARKS! True only wanted a picture in the front and nearly everything on the back. We said that we were going to draw a picture of the mascot to put on the sweater (itâ€™s a husky btw) but all of a sudden they all went â€œLETS JUST TAKE A PICTURE OFF THE INTERNET!!â€ I am seething.
