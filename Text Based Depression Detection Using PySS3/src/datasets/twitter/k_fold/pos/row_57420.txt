bruh, statistics how do i cram 4 hours worth of math videos before a chapter test? itâ€™s currently basically 5pm, the test is due at 11:59pm. 

for context, iâ€™m 15 on all college courses and i also babysit my 5 siblings, including a 5 month old baby brother. not to mention, i have depression and anxiety, and when i have too much work i donâ€™t do it because iâ€™m overwhelmed and yeah, itâ€™s a constant cycle. anyway, yeah.
