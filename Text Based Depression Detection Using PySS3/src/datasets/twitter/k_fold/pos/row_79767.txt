I'm having a bad day Wake up and I have to do online school in the family room because of some guys that didn't even come. Gender dysmorphia at the worst its ever been. Then what I forgot probably just ruined my grades, thanks to my civics teacher. I showed my little sister the alaphet and had her write it down just to make her forget it a minute later. So... How has your day been?
