Is saying the n word out of context bad? Now, I know what youâ€™re probably thinking. What the fuck? You say the n word? Just to clarify, I donâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m well aware that thereâ€™s a lot of debate regarding the n word and whoâ€™s should and shouldnâ€™t say it, but I donâ€™t see many people talking about this. 

For example, if I was reading something like To Kill a Mockingbird and the n word came up, should I be allowed to say it (Iâ€™m a white Latina) because itâ€™s out of context and Iâ€™m not using it in a derogatory way or not? 

I donâ€™t want to accidentally offend someone because Iâ€™m too naive to come to a conclusion, so what do you think?
