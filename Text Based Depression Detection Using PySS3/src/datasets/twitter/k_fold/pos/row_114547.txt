i got roasted by my mom me my mom  and my brother were in the car and my brother told us that he tidied his desk at school and i said "i remember when my desk was a mess"

and my mom told me this 

"&gt;!do you have anything thats tidy!&lt; "

and my lazy ass doesnt have anything tidy so i just went silent 

and since that day ive been questioning myself 

so anyway thanks for reading
