Breaking a youtube record So I was thinking to upload a short 30 second black screen video and get it to 1 billions views before 1st Jan 2021. I don't know of its possible or not but if I have the support of this sub then I can try to achieve it. I am doing it just for Fun and I don't have any monetary benefits.
