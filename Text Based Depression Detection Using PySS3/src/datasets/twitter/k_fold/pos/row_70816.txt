Nobody wants to make a low budget youtube series with me :( Ive been interested in filmmaking/directing/acting/editing since i was 6. Ive always wanted to make a somewhat-serious series on youtube. Me and my friends made a few little short videos for school, but when i proposed the idea of a series they turned me down. I have realised that ive been disconnected with that friend group for a while since online school (around 2 months ago for me). I feel like they just pity laugh and find me annoying since im clingy. Theyre sometimes nice but i havent been able to make them laugh for like 3 months. I have other close friends who really arent interested in filmmaking/wont take it seriously. Im sad because nobody here shares my passion for filmmaking. The main problem is ive been planning and writing the script and making the storyboard for 2 months now. It makes me sad that i wont be able to record what i wrote.
