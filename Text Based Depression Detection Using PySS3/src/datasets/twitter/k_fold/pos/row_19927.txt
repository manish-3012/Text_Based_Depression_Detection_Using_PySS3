My mother and grandmother are fighting over something incredibly childish And I feel horrible about it. I heard shouting from upstairs and I went to check what was going on, and they both didnâ€™t acknowledge that I was there and continued screaming at each other..and when I asked they both turned and said â€˜Go back downâ€™. Theyâ€™re fighting because my mom didnt call my grandmother down for a meeting.. is there anything I can do? Iâ€™m always weary of these kind of fights because they usually end badly, I hope it doesnâ€™t escalate further
