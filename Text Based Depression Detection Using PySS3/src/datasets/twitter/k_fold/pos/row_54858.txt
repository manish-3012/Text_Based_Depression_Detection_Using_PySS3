Donate to Wikipedia (reposting cause bad title last time) Ah yes, Wikipedia. The thing that teacherss hate. The website that got us through school and probably our whole life. I just want to say:

If you're going to donate your money somewhere, consider donating to Wikipedia. It's helped all of us and we should be grateful for it. Please, don't donate to the TikTok thots or the Onlyfans people; donate to Wikipedia. It's a much better use of your money.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
