Should Teachers be able to use memes in their presentations? so my english teacher (letâ€™s call her Mrs.P) is a sweet, young woman. sheâ€™s been working at my school for years, and trying to keep up with the new trends is kinda hard for her, especially with my grade being all bitchy and hard to approach. my school is going back hybrid style, so i only see my teachers two days a week and the rest of the week is online. itâ€™s even harder for teachers to connect with students and make â€œmemoriesâ€ if you say. so Mrs.P and a bunch of other english teachers decided to make memes into every presentation to make it fun for us. now iâ€™m a junior, and most of my classes are honor, so itâ€™s full of dumb assholes and rich, bratty kids filled with daddyâ€™s money more than sympathy. so when it was the first day of school, our (small, social distant) class was very disgusted seeing a teacher use 2010-2015 memes and try to get us to participate. honestly, it was adorable and made my day! i get they should be teaching us and focus on the syllabus, but with everything going on, seeing a meme of nyan cat on the screen is unpredictably what i need. what do you guys think?
