Asian parents don't consider their child's mental health So for all my life parents always wanted better grade, I was above average, just below the toppers. They always wanted me to be in the first position( understandable) but last Saturday was too much

On Saturday, my college entrance exam test results were declared and I had 97 percentile (means 3% people were scored more than me), which was better than other two tests with 80 and 87 percentile. At night they praised me and then on next day, Sunday, they scolded me for not being higher for almost whole day, whenever I sat down in living room, dining table, in car and I felt so horrible. I already tried my best and yet they are not satisfied, Am I in the wrong?
