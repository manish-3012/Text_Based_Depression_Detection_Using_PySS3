I made a bass video on my youtube channel. It isn't that great, but I kinda want some more music stuff on my channel. If anybody's interested I'd appreciate it if you checked it out. As for anyone who wants to learn an instrument - my advice would be to research it before you get it, and if/once you get it, stick with it and make sure to play songs you enjoy, otherwise you'll hate every bit of it! God bless, my fellow teens!

Here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBm6UIGjZg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBm6UIGjZg0)
