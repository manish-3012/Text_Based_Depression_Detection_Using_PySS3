Iâ€™m confused about my ancestry So basically, I will distinguish the nationalities of my family based off sides.



Fatherâ€™s side:



Grandma is Japanese, Grandpa is Filipino, met a while after world war 2.



Motherâ€™s side:



Grandpa is Filipino-Spanish, Grandma is also Filipino-Spanish, or Filipino mestizo if I remember correctly.




Not really a smart person, especially when asking this type of question, but what am I really?
