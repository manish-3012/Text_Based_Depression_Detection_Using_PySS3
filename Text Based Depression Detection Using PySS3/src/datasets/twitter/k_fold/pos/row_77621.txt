a title im 15 iv had an issue with forcing myself to throw up, like with my fingers and i scratch at my skin to help my stay calm in bad situations but recently things have been happening to distract me from that buts its come back again. im not sure what it is but it makes me feel alone, my friends have each other but im not apart of their circle but they come for me for advice. my boyfriend hangs around with his friends a lot and female â€homieâ€ and he takes awhile to respond but iv gotten used to it. i let him do his own thing cos i cant control him and he mainly only responds fast when itâ€™s something he wants to do he complains i donâ€™t tell him whats wrong but he says im boring when i do. my family are apart and itâ€™s holiday season, (christmas soon) so its the most painful time of the year knowing i cant see my family, i would think the were all i have. i mostly feel safe here and i wanna avoid hurting myself cos iv been sober for so long (2 yrs) and i donâ€™t wanna break that . i just need to know what i have to work toward to be happy. im lost..
