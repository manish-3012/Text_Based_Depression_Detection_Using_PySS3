So I accidentally curse in a zoom class So I was in a discord call with a friend and was playing among us (not cheating) and was trying to say who the impostor was, but it didn't let me press the "A" button, And I accidentally press Alt+a that un mutes yourself, and said "I can't write the F**king A" hear what was that, thinking it was my friend and Repeat what I said, And then realize I was unmuted in zoom, the teacher said "I have a bad connection what did you said?" I respond I'm sorry I was doing something else. The teacher said "oh don't worry" and continue doing the class.

Long story short: curse in zoom class, teacher didn't hear me, apologies.
