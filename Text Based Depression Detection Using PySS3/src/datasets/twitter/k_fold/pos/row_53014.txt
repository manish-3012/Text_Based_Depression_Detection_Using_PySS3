I got a feeling that this girl likes me, but for some reason I can't bring myself to ask her out Its not that she is bad looking or has a bad personality, but I have a mental block for some reason. I'm not sure why but I have some trust issues. I had asked out girls that seemed to like me but don't. It sucks man.  But it seems like I can't get the words out of my mouth, even when we are alone. I'm going to try it the next time I see her. But I don't know what the best way to put it. Plz Help.
