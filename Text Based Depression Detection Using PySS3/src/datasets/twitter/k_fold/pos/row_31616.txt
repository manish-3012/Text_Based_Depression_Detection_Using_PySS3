I just made like, the best sandwich So a little bit of backstory, Iâ€™ve been at my grandparents for a while because of online school and I need to focus on work. Now, with that out of the way, I got some bread put some roast beef on it, a slice of American cheese, put it in the microwave for about 15 seconds just to melt the cheese a little bit, I then put sweet and spicy Thai sauce on it, and topped it off with 4 rings of red onion and 2 slices of tomato. Overall 10/10 would do again.
