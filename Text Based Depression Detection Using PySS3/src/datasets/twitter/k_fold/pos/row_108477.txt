King Pig from Angry Birds admits that he's gay infront of you. KP: Well well, I finally got you in here!

KP: You will NOT get back the eggs this time!

KP: ...

KP: Well...To be honest...I don't have the eggs...

KP: One of my minion pigs went out to hide them in the bushes...

KP: I only told you I have the eggs so I could lure you in...

KP: And, well, here you are...In my throne room...

KP: I was thinking, maybe we should hang out...In my King Bed, y'know? Like Homies...

KP: Now, I don't mean any harm...

KP: ...I simply, just want someone to talk to...

KP: I thought you would be a good candidate...

KP: We could eat snacks, read bedtime stories, tell jokes, talk about our many clashes with eachother...

KP: ...Well, follow me...

*you start to think that this is all just a bad dream, but you're still curious to see what happens, so you follow him...King Pig jumps onto his King Bed and he tells you lay down next to him, you do as he says...*

KP: You know, I've never actually had someone in my bedroom...It was all just me in here...every evening...alone...

KP: ...but seeing you here, makes me...happy...I think...

KP: ...

*King Pig turns in your direction*

KP: You know, since we are all alone here...M-M-Maybe we could...Uuuh...Do some...A-Alone time...Just...u-us...uuuh...mmmph...I...uuuh...

*King Pig bursts out screaming*

KP: AAAAGH! OK! I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY! I'M GAY FOR YOU! I LOVE YOU! I'VE BEEN KEEPING THIS IS MY SNOUT-SHAPPED HEART ALL THE TIIIIIIIME!

*You decide to leave*

KP: W-Wait! Where are you going!? We haven't even-!

*You go away and slam the door shut*

KP: ...we haven't even eaten snacks...

(-THE END-)
