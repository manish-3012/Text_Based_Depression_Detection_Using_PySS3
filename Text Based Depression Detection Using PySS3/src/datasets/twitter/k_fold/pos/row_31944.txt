Classmate being groomed? A girl that goes to my school has been posting on her instagram that she is dating this guy who looks like his over 20, and has tattoos on his arms and neck. Keep in mind, we are freshmen in highschool and are 14 maybe 15. She has always been the type to be a rebelious and bad kid, for example she smoked at school in seventh grade, and sold novos and other vapes to kids throughout middle school. But yeah, she started posting pics with this dude grabbing her sexually, and them kissing. It's not really my place because I don't really know her but with everything happening in the past few years, and everything I have heard this seems like a very serious situation. Is there anything I should do because all my friends don't really see a problem with it, but It just doesn't sit right with me. Is this normal, or should I do something?
