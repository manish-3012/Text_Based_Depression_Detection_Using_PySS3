Stress Sucks My schedule is as follows: (Iâ€™m a junior btw)

1. AP Microeconomics
2. AP Calculus AB
3-4. AP Science Prep Lab/AP Physics 1
5-6. Marketing/English 3 H
7. AP U.S. History
8. Computer Programming 2

Iâ€™m glad I only have homework for 2 of my classes tonight, but one positive is that Iâ€™m losing weight. Thank you for my TedxTalk!
