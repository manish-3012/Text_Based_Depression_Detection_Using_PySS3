Can't stop thinking about her I know this girl we hang out together a few times, I can't rn because of the situation and I just got feelings for her and I hate it 'cause every damn time this happens it doesn't end well... I've never had good relationship with any girl and I can actually imagine being happy with her... I'm sad.. What if she finds someone else? What if she stops talking to me? I hate this so much, I haven't felt like this for so long... I mean... It's not gonna end well anyway I'll be sad for a while and I could get throught it after a while I guess... But I really want to be with her so much... It's like... I feel like it's my biggest wish to just see her again... I'm sorry if it doesn't make sence, I'm not sober rn but damn... I hope I'll find someone here who feels the same. All my friends are ok, they have someone or they know where to go with their life and there's me who's just lost, I suck at school, I suck at everything, I didn't do much in the last 2 years but damn... I don't remember being happy or... Having a dream... And now I have... And it's so stupid but... Fuck I don't want feelings right now it hurts. 

What should I do??
