Females of r/teenagers I need your help So to explain my sister had just broken up with her boyfriend who sheâ€™s been dating for almost a year and she feels really bad and she feels like everything that happened was her fault and apparently her ex-boyfriend was very manipulative which I learned almost now is there anything I should say or do to make her feel better? Or should I just stay out of it and let it run itâ€™s course? Boys if you know youâ€™re advice might be helpful too
