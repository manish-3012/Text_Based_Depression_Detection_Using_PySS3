I just grinded 90% of my school work thatâ€™s due tomorrow and itâ€™s only 8 am For reference I started at around 6:30 am, and the work was assigned last Wednesday, I couldnâ€™t sleep so I thought, might as well get this done, and now I have a psych paper and some math work to do all day. I feel accomplished yet stupid because I didnâ€™t do this earlier.
