something i just remembered last year in the middle of lockdown when i hadnâ€™t been to school in months i woke up at 5am and half asleep i went and ate breakfast and got ready for school only for my dad to wake up and ask what. the fuck i was doing

maybe it was sleepwalking but i remember doing it? and iâ€™ve never sleepwalked before
