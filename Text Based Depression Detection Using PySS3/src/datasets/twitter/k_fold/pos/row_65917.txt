My so-called-friend decided to pull a not-so-harmless-prank on me She decided it would be funny to pretend she committed suicide. This isnâ€™t the first time she decided to do this and I hate myself for falling for it *twice* now. Two times. Iâ€™m absolutely sure she knew how sensitive I am with this topic but she decided to do it anyway. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth it staying with her because it really tore me apart.
