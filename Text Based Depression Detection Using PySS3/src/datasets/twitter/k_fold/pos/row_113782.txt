It's quite simple .......... Killing a person is simple
Step 1: stalk them to see what they like what they do.

Step2: start doing his most regular or common activity, (golf, sports, safari, camping, hiking, going for a drive, or almost any hobby or activity he she does regularly.

Step2.1 : start boating in 6momths advance as a hobby, watch boat races and get to know alot about boats ,buy one, similar thing can be done with planes(Cessna planes r cheap)

Step 3: continue doing the above step for 6months, and then one day, stop said person in tje middle of the activity, talk to them, get to know about them(last chance to turn around from the guilt).

Step3.1 : keep your phone away from said person, say at your home or anywhere that isn't there, police can track phones 

Step 4: get up to do sm(take a piss, pick sm, bring sm, keep sm) pls plan that excuse yourself.

Step 5: get a string to strangle said person, this doesn't dirty the place with anything.

Step 6: get a few tubs, chop up the body in pieces and keep in bags

Step 7: clean the buckets with alcohol

Step 8: go out boating(or as said flying) , go far out into the ocean/(mountain for planes).

Step9: throw the bags tied to rocks out(not required incase of planes) into the ocean , they will sink to the bottom of the ocean, make sure the body parts have been cleaned out and no air is left in bag or limbs.

Step 10: return home, continue flying/boating for another 4 years to make it look .................normal. then leave it if you wanna.

Advantages: police cannot suspect irregular behaviour from you, since phone locations were not there and your activities were normal.
Suspect body will never be found, only family will say that he's missing if he even has a family( god forbid never kill a man with ppl waiting at home, what kinda sicko does that) 

Disadvantage: you won't get caught and the guilt will eat you over and uptill your old age.
