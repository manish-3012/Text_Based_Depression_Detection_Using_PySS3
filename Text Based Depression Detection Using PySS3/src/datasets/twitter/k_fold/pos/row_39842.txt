I wanna share this thing with you guys So my dad's friend came to visit us today, and like always he brings his dog with him because he doesn't want to lock him in the car. And I was really not in the mood today, basically I was depressed and I needed a hug ASAP. Then I saw his dog (albino shepherd for those who are interested) and I out of pure sadness came and hugged the dog. I felt a bit better afterwards and now I am thinking to get a dog.
