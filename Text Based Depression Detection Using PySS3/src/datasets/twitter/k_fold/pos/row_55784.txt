just asking here but... why did it stop being cool to be anti-SJW and stuff. It seemed from 2015-2018 everyone in my generation was apart of that movement but now they are all SJW's I don't get it. Just wondering please keep shit civil but I doubt anyone will since the reddit hivemind is so left leaning they won't listen to any level headed discussion.
