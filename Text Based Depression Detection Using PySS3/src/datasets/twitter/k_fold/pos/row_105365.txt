My poor engineering teacher One time we got my engineering teacher off topic that he asked us what we would do in the event of a zombie apocalypse. I told him that I would just straight up kill myself and to his horror we all agreed that death was the option. 

Some said they would fight until it seemed that there was no point. I just said â€œTheres living and then there is thriving.â€

I guess he didnâ€™t realize how easily we would give up.
