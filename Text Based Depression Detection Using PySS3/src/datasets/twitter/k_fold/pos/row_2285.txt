I donâ€™t understand how people generalise other people so much I was having this discussion with my parents the other day and I understand that generalisation happens to every group of people. But why tho?

Why is it normal to form preconceived notions about someone based on one thing you found out about them? 

People always get upset when theyâ€™re generalised because of their race, religion etc but then they do the exact same thing. I understand we can all be unintentionally hypocritical but why arenâ€™t you at least trying to be part of the solution. 

People really donâ€™t wanna because treat everyone as an individual and just because they are a part of a certain group doesnâ€™t mean they behave the way you believe people in that group should behave. 

I just wish people could genuinely love each other. Why do we take every opportunity to find reasons why we should hate each other. 

If you actually read this far then I wanted to say that I love you. Even if we donâ€™t have the same beliefs or like the same things I still love you. Have a great day.
