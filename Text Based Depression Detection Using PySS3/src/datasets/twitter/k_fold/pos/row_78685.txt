I just cut my mum's hair. My entire syllabus of organic chemistry and electrostatics combined  wasn't as painstaking, meticulous and tiring as cutting her hair. 

My mum told me that on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best and 1 being the best, I scored a 7. 

Pretty fucking proud :D


We're donating almost 7 inches of her hair to a local Cancer foundation .
