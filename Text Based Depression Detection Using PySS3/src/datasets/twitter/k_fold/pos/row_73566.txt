After 503 days of no self harm I caved today... I donâ€™t really know what to say. I was doing great and things were going really well with my gf but thatâ€™s over now and I donâ€™t know how to deal with this other than drinking and Iâ€™d rather cut than drink any more than I have. Sorry for oversharing, but I have no one i can talk to that will respond or care.
