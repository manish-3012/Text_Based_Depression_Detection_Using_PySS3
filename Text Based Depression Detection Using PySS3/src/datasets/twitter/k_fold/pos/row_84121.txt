The anime community is too pretentious. I put this rant here because the pretentious/elitist ones are people who are my age. 

I've noticed this from being in the anime community for 6 years. When I meet other anime fans they always try to one up me. Act like they're better than me because they watch sub over dub, they've watched this much more anime than me, they don't watch mainstream anime, they can speak this much more Japanese, etc. Let me tell you something. You're not cool if you think this way. Dude, we're both nerds. One upping me doesn't make you better than me at all. You're still as much of an outcast as I am.

I've noticed that the people who act like this are male (I am female) and I've also noticed that male anime watchers put female anime watchers down. "Girls ruined the anime community, all girls do is simp for anime characters, girls who watch anime do it for the trend, etc." So what? Who cares? Why do you care so much? Any time I ask this to them, they can't give me an answer. Don't men simp for anime characters too? Where did the term waifu come from? Stop putting others down to try to get validation from "the boys".

Why do y'all act like you're better than everybody else? You're not! Stop it!
