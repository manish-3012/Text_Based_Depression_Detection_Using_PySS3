My mom : appearances arent important why do u hate ur looks so bad Also my genitor:

â€œWhy are you trying to be Marilyn Mansonâ€

â€œUr nose is too bigâ€

â€œTake care of ur skin more ur acne is grossâ€

â€œUr flatâ€

â€œIf u actually made an effort on how u dressed u would be popular, stop trying to be goffâ€ (fyi she listens to goth music AND im not trying to be goth im a poser EMO)

â€œChains make u look like trouble. Ur friends will stop talking to u if u wear themâ€ (they ALL made compliments about them and think i look cool asf, one of them even said i should be a stylist, which i dont think is true but yeah)

And now she found out i was wearing my chains at school without her consent, confiscated them when SHE bought them.
They were the only thing that actually make me have a tiny bit of confidence, i really really hate myself and i cried bc of it

I hate that my parents act like theyâ€™re supportive towards my mental health but then are actually the ones destroying it.
And they wonder why i cut and why my 9 year old sister has suicidal thoughts.
(Not the only issues im having w them atm just felt like ranting)

Ty for coming to my TedTalk
