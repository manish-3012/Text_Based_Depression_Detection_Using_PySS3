Guys idk what to do anymore So I do amateur boxing and I have a fight coming up. To get ready for it I soar in order to gain experience but the bad thing is that I canâ€™t impress my mom and dad. I always do something wrong and I know the coach is just trying to do his best to train me but I just canâ€™t seem to get the hang of it. I love boxing and itâ€™s fun and Idk why I just canâ€™t do it right or live up to my parents expectations. I want to make my parents proud but I just canâ€™t because I want to itâ€™s just that if I do one little mistake then itâ€™s over. My dad says I have 0% chance of winning and that hurt bad. I just donâ€™t know what to do
