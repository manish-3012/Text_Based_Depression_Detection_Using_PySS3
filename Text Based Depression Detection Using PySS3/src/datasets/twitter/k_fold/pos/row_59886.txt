The first days of school The first two school days are now over. I was anxious the whole time. I felt like I needed to leave immediately. I went outside during every break and I just walked. I also smoked a cigarette every break. That made me feel a bit better. That's the entire reason why I didn't just go home.

I was hoping that I'd feel better when the school starts. Apparently not.
