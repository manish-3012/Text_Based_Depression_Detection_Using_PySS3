I'm 17, is it bad that I have trouble interacting with people online, unlike most people my age? I'm an introvert and have a bad social anxiety disorder. I don't have any online friends because it's hard for me to just talk to people on discord or online games. 2 friends recently told me that this was weird and I was the only one my age like this. Made me feel more lonely and invalid than already.

Am I really the only person my age like this? Is there anything actually wrong with me?
