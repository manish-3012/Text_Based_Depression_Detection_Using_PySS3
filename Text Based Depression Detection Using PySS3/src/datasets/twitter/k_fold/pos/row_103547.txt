I was accused of abusing someone I considered important, and it turned my life into a hell well, to start my name is zÃ¡ion and i live in Brazil, i used to live in a small town in another state, but because of the lack of jobs my family (my father and my brothers) had to move, the process of The change was very difficult mainly because I distanced myself from all my friends, including my girlfriend, it has been two years since I moved there, I haven't been able to make many friends in all that time but until then I still had a strong contact with everyone there since my mom still lives there. until my ex-girlfriend's best friend (I'll call her helen) move to the same city as me, so I decided to go out with her a few days to go to some malls and stuff, after going out often for around a week we started to stay with each other, until i decided to call her and a friend of mine to come to my house to see some movies and play some games, and that night we kissed and that kind of thing, but my brother the youngest was also a friend of the people in the city that I lived in before, so he told them that we were staying, which would have no problem, if helen wasnâ€™t lying about breaking up with her boyfriend, then she stayed 2 days at my house and after that we went to a party, everything was normal she was completely fine with me and everyone saw it, but for some reason when she arrived at her house I realized that she had blocked me, and her boyfriend, who according to her it was already over, send me I walk messages asking why I did that to her, so without understanding much I explained everything that happened and defending myself, they were accusing me of abusing Helen, and everyone who was at the party, my friend and my brothers saw that we were staying and we were completely fine with each other. basically what happened was that she cheated on her boyfriend by lying to me about breaking up with him, but when he heard the story for her not to come out as wrong the escape she arranged was to accuse me of abusing her. I was very bad and I still am, because she was someone very important to me and also because afterwards I was accused of that, all the people I considered friends stopped talking to me without even giving me the chance to defend myself. now i practically don't have any friends that i can vent about all of this, that's why i'm talking to you here on the subreddit. I just think it's amazing how a false accusation can ruin someone's life so easily and people don't give a damn about this matter.
