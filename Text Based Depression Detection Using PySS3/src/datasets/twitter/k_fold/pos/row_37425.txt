Rant about teachers and school Itâ€™s funny how parents will say that we slept the day away because we woke up at 1:00 but then will say that we didnâ€™t work for the majority of the day working from 7:00 to 9:30 on missing assignments and homework given out by dumb fuck teachers who are still stuck in the fantasy that hardship makes people tougher, thatâ€™s not the way you go with teenagers, thatâ€™s how you get teen suicides
