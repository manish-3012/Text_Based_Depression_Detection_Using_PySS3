Apparently my agoraphobia great-grandma had hundreds of diaries she wrote throughout her life, and BURNT THEM ALL once she started dying My grandma told me about this when she informed me she was translating her interesting diaries to English rather than her personal code so that we can understand some of it. 

Anyone here who keeps diaries pleassse don't burn them when you die, your great grandchildren will be very disappointed.
