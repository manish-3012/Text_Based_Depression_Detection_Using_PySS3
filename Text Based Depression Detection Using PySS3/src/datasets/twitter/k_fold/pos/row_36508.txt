How to get karma on reddit Hey! Iâ€™ve got a guide for getting karma and attention on reddit through posting or commenting (or both) ^(i had to repost this because i accidentally said the up-v word)

#Posting:
1. Come up with a unique idea or concept, such as when people post a daily meme from a (usually lengthy) tv show, in episodical order corresponding to the showâ€™s progression.

2. Aggregate content from other sites to relevant subreddits. Examples are users such as u/\_\_dawn\_\_amber_\_, u/My_memes_will_cure_you, and u/gallowboob (a most extreme example). Doing so will take a lot of time and get you a lot of karma, but at what cost? **[do not aggregate memes, especially not to r/memes and r/meme. I already have enough shit to moderate as-is.]** *(however, you can repost memes to r/me_irl if you so desire. Itâ€™s not against the rules)*

3. Come up with something interactive, such as a choose-your-own adventure game made of multiple posts, usually to your profile.

4. If you are extremely talented at art (not *just good*), post your work. Doing so in an interactive or sequential way will work wonders. (Such as u/seamuswray and his series involving painting yourself)

5. If you are a girl and relatively attractive, subtly letting people know that youâ€™re a girl on this subreddit (as long as you dont mind guys starved for attention) will get you a lot of attention.

6. Write something out or post (to this subreddit) something wholesome that happened to you. Alternatively, rant about something annoying that happened to you.

7. Do something crazy and over the top ([such as this](https://www.reddit.com/user/Master_JBT/comments/kpzjno/and_you_get_a_car_and_you_get_a_car_everyone_gets/)

#Commenting:
1. Have something unique that you do with every comment, which will draw attention to yourself in a big way. Examples are users such as u/SrGrafo with his EDITs, u/ImPrettyWhack with their poetry, and u/GuyWithRealFacts with his believable stories.

2. Subscribe to a bunch of large subreddits and sort your home feed by rising. Then, comment frequently on posts in those subreddits that you believe will gather lots of traction. A tip is to reply to parent comments that have no replies if they happen to be at the top few comments.

3. Comment a lot on an individual subreddit in order to make a name for yourself. Make sure to abide by the rules(as goes for everything else iâ€™m advising)

#Do **NOT**â€™s
* Do not beg for karma
* Do not beg for awards
* Do not chainpost. Examples of chainposting can be seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/BkfA5v8.jpg) and [here.](https://i.imgur.com/bsUWyVb.jpg)
* Do not vote on your comments and posts with an alt account


#Awards:
While there *are* certain ways (albeit not very moral) to get awards. Iâ€™m not going to get into that in this post. If you *really* want to know some ways, tell me in the comments and follow me, and I might decide to post an award-centered post on my profile (iâ€™ve got lots of knowledge on the subject)


This concludes the guide. If you liked it, why not [follow](https://www.reddit.com/u/Master_JBT/) me for more like this in the future.
