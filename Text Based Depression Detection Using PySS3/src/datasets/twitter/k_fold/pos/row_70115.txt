How do I block my ex on Gmail? I broke up with my toxic ex in April and is still trying to cause my problems. I would block her, but she has my email and I canâ€™t find a obvious block function. I would just delete my email, but I have it linked to steam and some other websites so it would be a hassle to keep everything. Any help?
