Shoutout to my mom because sheâ€™s great So, Iâ€™m 9th grade I had a really creepy teacher who is CLEARLY a pedophile and made me and everyone else really uncomfortable. I mean, heâ€™d be suggestive with the female students and would always touch me or just do creepy things like get really close to me and call me sweetie and some other stuff. (And by â€œother stuffâ€ I mean.. literally like playing with his nipples in class AND WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO ME) My friends had experienced this is as well. So I was telling my mom about how he made me uncomfortable and about the stuff heâ€™d do and omg I love her so much because sheâ€™s going to report him to the school for me and Iâ€™m so thankful. Iâ€™m glad that sheâ€™s listening to me and doing something about it. I just really love my mom. Sheâ€™s also just really understanding and sweet to me, like sheâ€™ll check on me if Iâ€™m having a breakdown and when I tell her i just need some alone time she actually gives me space and I really appreciate that. So yeah :)
