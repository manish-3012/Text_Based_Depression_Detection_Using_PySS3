Your important. Time doesn't stop. It goes on and on. Never ending. Each second passed is a second that's gone. It never comes back. Never replays. However those seconds we make memories. Those memories make us who we are in the sense that we learn from out past experience and know not to do the same thing if it did not work. Those memories are not always bad or always good. They are memories nonetheless. Each of those memories play an important role in our life. They help us when we are down. Help give us wisdom to not make the same mistake again. However we may experience horrible things in our life. These things make us not feel well. They make us upset, sad, mad, afraid, and anything else we might feel. They have a huge impact on us. If anything is bothering you don't be afraid to ask for help. There is no problem with asking for help. Everyone needs help at some point in there lives. We all will. Your life is important. Every second counts. Every second you matter. Every second is important. We all care about you. You're not alone. Time will never stop, but that doesn't mean you stop. Make memories. Be happy. Life is hard, and unfair. However we are all in this together. We all know the struggles of life. Don't give up on yourself. None of us have gave up on you. Even if you feel like giving up don't. Reach out and let someone help. None of us may be professionals, but we can help you in the right direction. Your important. You matter.
