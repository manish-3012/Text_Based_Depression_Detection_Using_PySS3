I know alot of teens say this but Fuck my mom. Im so miserable all the fucking time. I have no electronics (other then this phone im not allowed to have) no books, no anything fun to distract my self from the loneliness. Honestly if I don't just kill my self im never talking to her again. My little sister (12) constantly yells at me saying how no one wants me in the room or house and to leave and shit and my mom doesn't bat an eye but I tell my sister to shut up and I get yelled at. When I move out 2 things are gonna happen 1. The lawn gets over grown (i mow it for free) 2. The house is gonna get disorganised (I clean for free) anyways i needed to rant
