Turning 17 soon My parents asked me what I want on my birthday, but I myself don't know what I want. I have a new laptop and phone already (yeah, i am kind off spoiled) but I don't know what should I ask. I thought of samsung smart watch but it was a bit too expensive according to me. Any cheaper suggestions will help

Ps: My parents never denied the watch, I did because I thought it was a bit too expensive for a 17 year old
