I'm tired of not being loved. I'm fucking Tired of not being loved, I'm fucking tired of being people's second choice, I'm tired of being a good friend and a good person. Coz, No matter what, in the end I'M THE ONE WHO ENDS UP GETTING HURT. 

At the end of the day, all I crave for is a feeling of being loved by someone, someone who would understand my feelings and someone who would make me their priority. But that hasn't EVER happened for A SINGLE TIME TO ME. I have loved and cared for people, for friends, for crushes. But in the end I'm the one left alone. 

It often feels like MY FEELINGS don't mean shit to people and like I'm an inferior soul whose feelings and emotions don't matter. 

Can't I just be loved for once by someone? Maybe for a day, or hour, or a minute? Can't I be hugged by someone and be told that I'm enough and they care for me? 

A little love and a hug and some care is what I have craved for all my life. But I haven't received any of that ever.
