I just convinced my math teacher to get Reddit...  I was talking about a scary movie for Spooktober. And my teacher asked what Spooktober was and I told her that it was a thing on Reddit. Then she asked what was Reddit so I proceeded to tell her what Reddit was where all memes are born and stuff like that. Then for ten minutes she allowed us to get on our phones and she just browsed Reddit for 10 minutes and is now in love with it.  Epic.
