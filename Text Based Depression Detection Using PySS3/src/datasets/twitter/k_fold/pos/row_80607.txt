A kitten my family was taking care of just died and its sibling's cries are haunting Their mom got sick with an infection from mouth all the way to her lungs and it's likely that the kitten got it from her. The sibling has been mewing loudly the whole day. It's fucked up to think about how the sibling mightve been calling for someone to check out his now dead sister. Fuck man
