I hate online school It was fun for the first few days, but it just keeps on getting worse. I just want to pass by people in the hallway. I want to walk into a classroom of other kids talking. I want to sit down at my desk and have a 2 minute conversation with someone before the teacher makes us stop. I just want to interact with those kids that I'm not necessarily friends with but can easily talk to them when they're sitting next to me in class. I want to laugh at unironically bad memes with my friends while the teacher is talking. I want life to go back to normal. :(
