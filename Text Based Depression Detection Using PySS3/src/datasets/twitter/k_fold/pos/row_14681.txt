What are some good casual games for the DS that my Mom can enjoy? * She seems to be interested in Animal crossing after showing it to her, so I want to get her a DS for her birthday coming up. I don't have enough money for a switch, and I want to enjoy the game together, but what is another game I could get for her with it? She likes puzzle games and simpler games. This is the only place I can think to ask, so thanks in advance!
