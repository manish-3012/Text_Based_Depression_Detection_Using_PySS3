I need help about confronting my parents bout something So my family is religiousreligious being forced into it I've drifted away from it. Now the issue is I don't know how they would like it if I tell them I don't follow "God". my friend did the same thing and his mother started being mean to him. Now my parents would most likely just not acknowledge me or just kick me outta the house. They're pretty ok anything as long as I'm religious. So what do I do?
