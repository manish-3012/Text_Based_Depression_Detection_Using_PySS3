I lost my virginity to my crush of one year I have severe social anxiety and as the title states I recently lost my virginity. I'm super happy because I was obviously super anxious and unlike the other people I've been with, he was calm and assured me everything was alright. He didn't act annoyed when I took longer then usual because I was freaking out and it made a huge difference. The whole concept of virginity itself is stupid but make sure when you decide you are ready that it's with someone that truly cares about you. It makes such and unbelievable difference. I just wanted to let other people with similar issues know that there is hope. I'm also obviously super happy and it's not exactly something I can share with my friends and family so here you go.
