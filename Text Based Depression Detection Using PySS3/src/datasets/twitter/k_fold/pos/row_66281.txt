So I learned something yesterday When I talk loud for too long my voice starts to get painful 

I dont usually talk that often and when I do its quiet and not loud but at work I have to yell at the top of my lungs to tell everyone I'm coming through due to how loud it is in the kitchen and its sorta painful on the throat
