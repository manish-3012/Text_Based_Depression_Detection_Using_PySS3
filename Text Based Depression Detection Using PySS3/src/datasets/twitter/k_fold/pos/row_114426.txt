I'm one oblivious fucker. There was this girl in seventh grade when I was in eighth and she always hung out with me for like the last few weeks of school. People would always joke about me liking her and what-not. She sat by me a lot. One day she rested her leg on mine, and a month later she *sat on my fucking lap*. God I wouldn't know a girl liked me if she said it straight to my face.
