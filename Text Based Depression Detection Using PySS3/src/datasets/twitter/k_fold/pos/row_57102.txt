How many subject do yâ€™all study in high school? I want to know what my fellow teens (sorry) from all over the world study.. for research purposes.. yâ€™know. I go to a private high school in Indonesia, here we are divided into two majors (?) Science and Social Sciences. 

I major in Science, we study 13 subjects: Biblical Studies, Indonesian Language, English Language, History, Civics, Computer, Physical Education, Specialized Math, Compulsory Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

As for Social Sciences, they study 13 subjects too: Biblical Studies, Indonesian Language, English Language, History, Civics, Computer, Physical Education, Specialized History, Compulsory Math, Economics, Geography, and Sociology.

Is that a lot? I donâ€™t know, lol.

The translation to English is kinda off, I canâ€™t find the exact translation.. but oh well.

Thanks yâ€™all.

Edit: I forgot to add another subject, arts, all student choose either music or art, then in music you choose guitar, keyboard, violin, or vocal. As for art, you choose digital or traditional. So itâ€™s 14 subjects.
