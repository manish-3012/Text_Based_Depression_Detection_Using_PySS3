i hate class participation grades I love Spanish class, but the participation grades suck. I'm good(ish) at Spanish. But I just hate participation grades.

Today we we're talking about favorite music artists as an intro-acitivty, and the teacher asked us our favorite artists.

I like Doja cat, nicki minaj, lady gaga, destiny's child.

im a guy.

so of course I didn't participate. i don't not like being made fun of so in no way was i gonna say my favorite artists.

i couldn't have even made up an answer. idk what people listen to today. rap? idk
