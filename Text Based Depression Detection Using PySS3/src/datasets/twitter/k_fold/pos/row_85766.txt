NEVER come out lmao my mom wanted to just barge into my room and ask me what i am doing and i basically kicked her out and told her that "i just don't want to talk to her right now" and she left but i felt bad as i ALWAYS do everytime she tells me something and i decline her

i told her i wanted to change my hair and even change my name to noah lol and she said she wouldn't mind until im 18 and/or an adult which actually surprised me but i was on my bold shit 

then i told her i wanted a binder which no i didn't mean a school binder lol but a binder is something u wear to flatten ur chest and i wanted one to feel my own masculine euphoria but ofc my mom being the closed off minded person she is starts getting confused and saying "no u can't do that" and that it's so "taboo".. TABOO? u MADE me? wtfðŸ˜«

i should also include she's a hellbent christian and is homophobic and even transphobic im pretty fucking sureðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«so what was i even expecting..? idek myself but i thought she would maybe understand me a lil more now after the countless amount of times people in my family told her to just TALK to me 

andddd the moment yall have been waiting for.. i told her i am genderfluid and she was really confused lol but i was hesitant to even explain more of what it was but i didn't even get to- why? becuz she starts doing something else and was not even paying attention to me but wants to complain when i do the same exact shit? pfft- anyways i even tried to tell what being genderfluid is but she wouldn't even give me the time of day becuz she wants to call literally EVERYONE in my family and ask and tell them what i just said.. even though i just said that im not comfortable with it

me raising my voice at times and a few good tears and i am mentally fucking exhausted,, i cannot do this shit anymore and i am so burned out that i don't even care if she blabs it to everyone in this fucking world,, all i do KNOW is that i will never be able to comfortably speak to that woman ever in my life
