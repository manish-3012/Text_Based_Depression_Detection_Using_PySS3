Thank you for this past year. I know a lot of you wonâ€™t care, but this past year has been really tough on me, just like a lot of us. 

I just wanted to say thanks for all of the laughs and advice that r/teenagers has given me. 

To everyone that is struggling in life. Donâ€™t give up. Once youâ€™ve hit rock bottom, life can only get better.

Thank you reddit, and thank you r/teenagers.
