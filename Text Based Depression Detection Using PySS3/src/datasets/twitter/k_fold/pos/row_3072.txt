I canâ€™t sleep and I need help Itâ€™s 3:30 am and Iâ€™m trying to sleep but Allie can think of is how I fell in love with girls then did something really stupid to mess up everything and how different my life would be if I hadnâ€™t messed up and Iâ€™m thinking back wondering why I even did those things which in hindsight was really dumb, for example probably the first girl I fell in love with was my best friend and she said I was too clingy and I canâ€™t even remember which order the events that happened after she said that were but I can remember texting my other best friend for advice on what to text her cause he knew how I felt about her but I accidentally sent what I was supposed to send to my friend to my crush/other best friend then she got all confused and blocked me and that was 2 years ago but somehow my life has still been going downhill since then and I regret being â€œtoo clingyâ€ even though I was really young back then and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever get over any of this.
