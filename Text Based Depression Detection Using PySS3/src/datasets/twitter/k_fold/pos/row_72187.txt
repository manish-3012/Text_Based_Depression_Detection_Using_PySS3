epic win on my part I taught my younger sibling how to fish! I know this sounds dumb, but he has been in a wheelchair since the age of 8, i took him to my local park and taught him all i know, before I knew it he caught 4 FISH, this was one of the first times I felt accomplished for a while after we went home and watched Minecraft videos while eating skittles, good day. :D
