For everyone wondering whether to confess to their crush or not, hereâ€™s my idea of what might happen If you donâ€™t send the message, then youâ€™ll never know how she feels about you and live with regret for awhile

If you send the message, then youâ€™ll know if she likes you or not. If she likes you (1). If she doesnâ€™t like you (2).

(1) if she likes you, then you have a shot at dating her. (3)

(2) if she doesnâ€™t like you, then could possibly lose youâ€™re friend or make things awkward for a bit (end)

(3) if you date her, then you could either break up eventually (4) or get married (5)

(4) if you break up, then you could continue to be friends with her or completely sever your relationship (end)

(5) if get married, then happy ending (end)
