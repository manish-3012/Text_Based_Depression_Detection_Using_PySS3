People who say cold is better than hot are fucking lying that shit makes no sense Cold you can't sit in the sun to avoid it, you need to wear a bunch of uncomfortable clothes and still be cold

Like literally tell me how your dick and balls feel in cold weather when they shrivel up vs in warm weather. Enough said.

Plus tropical vacation places and shit we all know that's better than the snow. You don't have an unpopular opinion you are just wrong.
