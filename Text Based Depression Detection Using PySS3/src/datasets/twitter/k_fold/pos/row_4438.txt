So I feel disconnected from my body I don't feel like I'm an actual person; I feel like I'm just watching over some persons shoulder and watching their every move. It feels like a poorly written movie. Suicide is a constant thought in my head and I've attempted before. I want to be able to feel happy, but there are so many factors that seem to go against that. Girls are tough because I give off a brother vibe to every one I try to talk to, my family is simultaneously supportive and destructive, and my social life is like walking on a rope bridge with only 1/4 of the wooden planks left. Any advice or words of wisdom would be nice
