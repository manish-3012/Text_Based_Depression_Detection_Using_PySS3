Anyone else just wanna live in an apartment but can't because they're a kid and don't have any money? I'm pretty sure there are people that are just tired of all the bullshit around them and wanna live on their on, but they can't, cuz no. Like imagine being 13 years old, living alone in an apartment on one of the top floors with a beautiful view of the city. I could decorate my rooms however I want, invite whoever I want, and do whatever I want. I could live, study, and do all the chores without someone shouting in my ears to do it whilst I'm doing it. I live in a joint family house btw, so you can imagine how fucking annoying it is for me. I just can't wait be 18 so I can get the fuck outta here
