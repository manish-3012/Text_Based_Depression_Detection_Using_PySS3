Tell me if I'm in the wrong here There are some relatives over and I've never seen them. 
The focus is on the 8 year old girl and the 12 year old boy.

I've never been a much of a communicative man and I really don't want to talk/see them. Especially the boy.

He is everything I find annoying and acts in such a way that a despise.

Yet my parents are incredibly angry at me for not wanting.

So I have to ask if I'm the bad one here, or I am not
