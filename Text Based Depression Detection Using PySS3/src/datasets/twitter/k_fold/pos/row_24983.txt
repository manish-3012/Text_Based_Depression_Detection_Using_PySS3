Bruh why do hamsters always die in the most random and horrific ways possible ? ðŸ’€ Not even kidding my hamster went missing and it turns out he somehow fell and landed in my parentâ€™s sweet tea jug that they made and had been decomposing there for 2 weeks. We had to dump it all out.

Whatâ€™s your traumatic hamster death story?
