My universityâ€™s response to the pandemic has sucked, and I hate every single day of online clases I am a second year computer science student. My university switched to online classes the third week of March, and thereâ€™s still no date for when we will be going back.

Since the beginning, the amount of homework we were assigned easily tripled. I talked with many of my peers, and everyone felt the same way. In May, some students had the chance of joining a zoom conference with the board of directors as they wanted to hear our opinion. I was one of the students in that conference, and I remember almost everyone complained about how much the amount of homework had increased. We were told next semester would be different, as the curriculum would be properly adapted to online learning.

Next semester rolled around and nothing changed. A couple of weeks into the semester, the department of physiology ran a survey to see how we were coping with the pandemic. Everyone I know answered that they felt overwhelmed with work, and that having no free time was making them depressed. Once again, we were told our feedback would be taken into account to improve the situation, but nothing changed.

Someone from my small group of friends already dropped out because he couldnâ€™t take it anymore. There is probably many more like him that I simply donâ€™t know about.

For the last year, I have lived the same routine every day. Wake up for classes, exercise, work on various assignments until midnight, and repeat everything the next day. There is no time to relax or do things we like, itâ€™s simply too much work. I donâ€™t even have free time on weekends, as I end up finish my assignments on Sunday at around 7 pm. 

I feel like everyone forgot we are human too, we arenâ€™t just robots made to work all day. The pandemic has been hard on everyone, they should consider our mental health and give us time to relax and do things we like. 

I truly donâ€™t know how much more of this I can take, I hate every single day. I told my parents how I feel, and they basically told me to suck it up because university was also hard for them.

Thanks for reading my rant.
