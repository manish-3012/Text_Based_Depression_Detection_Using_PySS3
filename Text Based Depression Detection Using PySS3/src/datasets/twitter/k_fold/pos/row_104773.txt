Me and my family have a high chance of getting/ already having lung cancer In my area itâ€™s common for radon, a natural radioactive gas, be a problem for houses with basements. Weâ€™ve lived in this house for 3 years, and have noticed our dog and my sister who both sleep in the basement have been getting sick a lot in the past few months. My parents just recently found out what radon is and decided to get a radon detector. A safe level of radon is 2-4, in my sisters room it was 187. In the garage itâ€™s over 200. Weâ€™re installing pipes to get it out, but weâ€™ve already been living here for 3 years. Radon is the 2nd leading cause of cancer in the US right behind smoking. Me and my family are going to get x rays to see if we have lung cancer. Shittttttttttttttt
