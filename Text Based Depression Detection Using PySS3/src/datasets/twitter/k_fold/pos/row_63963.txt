Is it weird that I think British girls are really cute? Iâ€™m American. Pretty much all my life Iâ€™ve found British girls really cute and in general adorable. Basically all my childhood movie crushes were British. Jane from Tarzan, Hermione Granger, and probably some other names I canâ€™t remember. I mean, yea it matters whatâ€™s on the inside and all, but I just have a bias towards that cute British accent.
