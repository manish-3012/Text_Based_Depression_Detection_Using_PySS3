Welp im single now i broke up with my bf of 9 months today and idk how I feel. There was absolutely no bad feelings between us and we still feel the same abt each other, the circumstance we were in tho was just a mess and he didn't was risk anything fucking up for me (pretty much my parents hated him bc he was white). The whole thing was just fucked. He was the only person I could feel 100% seen and heard with. He had such an amazing presence to him that would make anyone around him smile. I can easily say that I loved him and I still do but we'll can't do shit any it now ig. Even while were exchanging what I guess are our last text messages for a while he was still super sweet and just an overall amazing person. He even texted my bestfriend asking her to watch over me and make sure I'm eating and shit. I honestly wish he was dick bc it would make moving on easier but instead I gotta live with the fact that I broke with the most perfect person just bc my parents think being white is a crime. 

When I tried talking to my friends abt it they all brushed it aside and said I was being dramatic...oof, even if I am Id appreciate them at least pretending to care.
