My thoughts on the Texas situation Hey all

I live in a certain Midwestern state in the US. I saw that a bunch of people have been really critical of Texas recently. Unfortunately, it is not just the stereotypically dumb people we all laugh at, but like actual people who think that Texans are not as tough because they canâ€™t stand the cold.

Almost all of the infrastructure and buildings in Texas arenâ€™t built for this weather. This type of weather almost never happens in Texas, so it isnâ€™t worth the expense of insulation and other necessary materials if this cold only happens once every few hundred years.

I also saw some posts talking about how Texas, the state that wants to secede, is asking for federal aid over 4 inches of snow. They went on to call all conservatives sissies or whatever. Again, itâ€™s not their fault that they didnâ€™t plan for this extremely rare situation. 

Isnâ€™t this common sense?

(To anyone from another country who will inevitably comment how your country is better, good for you. We see that a ton, and it isnâ€™t helping anyone out.)
