[18M]. I don't want to be alone at Valentines day again.. I have almost one month to make a change I have never had a girlfriend ( only summer love). Now I decided to not wait any longer, because the love won't come by itself.  The question is for everybody, guys and girls. Just tell me your experiences,  results  or your opinion. I don't use dating apps,  I am better at real life interactions so...

Girls, how would you like to be approached? Anywehere, grocery store,  street.. what should the guy say to make you want to see him again? Any suggestions, some teasing, flirty lines?

Guys,  Whats your experience with approaching women? What to say at the grocery store for example? Or according to you, flirty, teasing lines to make a good first impression?

I have one month, I am on nofap so my confidence is increasing and I am feeling better than on the days when I used to fap. 

I will be happy for each of your answers.
