I started socializing. I started to use Snapchat and talk to some people in my school rather than just avoid them and so far it's made me so much happier. I've already made a lot of friends and they even think I'm funny. i also am now friends with some people that I thought were kinda intimidating. honestly, all of you guys that are secluded and just scroll Reddit put yourself out there, you will be so much happier.
