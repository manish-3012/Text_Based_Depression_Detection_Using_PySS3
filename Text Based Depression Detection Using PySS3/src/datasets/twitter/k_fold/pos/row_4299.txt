i told my mother it was international mens day i said it was a disgrace cuz there was no google doodle. my mother had the nerve, nay, the audacity to say "YeAh bUt wOmEn gEt tRaFfIcKeD aNd RaPeD" like this shit happens to men too. i said there should be a doodle to thank men for their sacrifices and yet again she said: "wHaT SaCrIfIcEs?". your husband works 8 hours a day 5 days a week and your ungrateful ass asks what men sacrifice? they sacrifice their youth to provide for their families and push their ailing bodies for their salaries. men gave their tomorrows so you could get your today's. smh. 

right rant over goodbye
