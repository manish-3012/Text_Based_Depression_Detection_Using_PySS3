Gonna miss someoneâ€™s bday and I feel bad Yea like the title said a friend is gonna have a party and changed the date so now I canâ€™t make it cause I have to do something in that day thatâ€™s pretty much out of my control. I feel really shitty now because I said I would go. Is it shitty of me not to go.
