My 9th grade bio teacher wanted to skip out on the fire drill for a test This happened last year and Iâ€™m still disappointed and kind of upset that it happened.

So last year I was taking an honors biology class, and I was barely managing to keep my A because biology is boring to me and my teacher sucked at her job.

She gave way too much homework and even admitted she didnâ€™t know 90% of the material she was teaching us during one of our lessons.

Anyways, one day we were about to take a normal test, and she was just talking about it at the beginning of class. It was very normal.

Then the fire alarm goes off, and it jump scared most of us. The teacher had a worried look on her face and said, â€œThey never said there was a fire drill today.â€

As we are packing up and getting ready to go outside, she just hesitates for a bit and then she says that this test is so important that we canâ€™t miss it, so letâ€™s hope itâ€™s just a drill and hope thereâ€™s no real fire.

We all looked at her like she was insane; it wasnâ€™t some sort of joke, she was dead serious. After some time passes in the class, all of us and the teacher go outside after seeing a flood of people in the hall leaving.

Luckily it was just a drill, but that doesnâ€™t make this okay! She put us in danger just so we can take her stupid test. Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s probably illegal to ignore a school fire alarm. And if it isnâ€™t, it definitely should be.
