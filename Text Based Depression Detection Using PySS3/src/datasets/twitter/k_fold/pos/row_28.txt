ok i feel bad about this and i want to get it off my chest i ordered donuts from deliveroo on the website but couldnt figure out how to tip the delivery rider throught the website, so i thought that i would just tip in cash. i was doing some stuff then i hear a knock followed by 'ok thank you' and a engine noise. my fucking brother went to get the food, didnt know about the tip thing and didnt even bother to tell me 'you your food is here' and i feel bad that the deliveroo driver didnt get the tip. 

they completely deserve the tips, and i always tip waiters/waitresses in any pub or restaurant, i just couldnt figure out the website and my brother answered instead of me so the rider didnt get the tip. 

i honestly feel kinda bad even though i dont feel like it was 100% my fault. 

thanks for letting me get this off my chest. that felt good!
