Idfk what to do anymore I've been suicidal for the past 5ish years and with a lot of my family (including me) having gotten sick recently I've been very busy with them along with my summer job and schoolwork and it's stressing me out a lot, it feels like I've had to do something every 5 minutes, these past couple days have been especially stressful because I got a few days behind on my schoolwork (I was sick, stomach bug) and today i found that my mom had a temperature of 101 so yeah... any help is appreciated
