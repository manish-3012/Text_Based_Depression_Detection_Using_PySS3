Rant about Tik Tok... I was in Asda the other day (UK supermarket) and I was paying for the food and whatnot. So just as I did, paid for the food and loaded up the bag. 

Then I saw a small child, maybe 4 years old on his phone (I could tell it was his own, because his mother had a separate on) watching tik tok.

This may not seem bad to some, but seeing that this is a TODDLER watching an online app, that is not for kids. Idk who to blame in this situation.
