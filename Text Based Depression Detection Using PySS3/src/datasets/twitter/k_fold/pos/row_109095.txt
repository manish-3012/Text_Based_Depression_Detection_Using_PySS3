Things I hate about myself :) Physical - My nose, my eyes, my mouth, my ears, my eyebrows, my skin, my cheeks, my forehead, my hair, my neck, my shoulders, my stomach, my sides, my thighs, my feet, my wrists. Personality - I keep driving everyone away, I keep annoying people cause I canâ€™t keep still and talk too much, I tell shit jokes, I struggle to talk to most girls, I canâ€™t form a friendship until I know them for at least 3 months, I forget to start convos with people which leads to them thinking Iâ€™m a prick.
