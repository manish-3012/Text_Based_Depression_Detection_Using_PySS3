Childhood slipping through my fingers Due to the pandemic, myself and others have become much more depressed. It feels as though life is going by too fast, and what could be precious moments to me have been lost. Itâ€™s going to be a year since lockdown began, and I havenâ€™t enjoyed much since then. I donâ€™t know where to begin coping with this, I hate the fact that Iâ€™m going to remember these years of my life as sitting in my room alone, day by day. Iâ€™m curious as to how others feel, and are coping with this situation.
