AP Literature is terrible This class is just awful. I mean our assignments for this week, our first week back to half the week at school and half the week remote, is to finish our analysis of our poem and then to write an essay analysis for a poem we read a month ago but never reviewed then write our Senior Research Project and also make sure you have time to read your books all the way through and write a report and a review guide by next week. Also keep working on your hours for your Senior Project. It's just too much sometimes. And this is just for this class not including my other classes it is just too much work. Like I'm doing 4 AP classes and the only other one that assigns this much work is AP Chem but even then it is doable. I'm just tired of the work. I mean at this point I'm giving up hanging out with friends and I'm giving up video games just to keep up. Like I messed up and got bad grades in high school and now I'm rejected from the college I wanted to go to it's just hard to see the motivation. I mean I've taken an AP class every year of high school and passed every one and still I was rejected. This went away from my original post idea and kinda turned into a rant but it is just infuriating and I needed to vent a bit. I'm just tired of constant work and wish I could take a break.
