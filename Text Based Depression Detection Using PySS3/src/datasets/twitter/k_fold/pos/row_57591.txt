How to go about rebuilding a friendship So i have been friends with this girl for a long time and we eventually ended up dating for a few weeks, but things ended kinda suddenly cos she just couldnâ€™t deal with a relationship right now. Itâ€™s been a few months and we still talk now and again but there was always a â€œpurposeâ€ whenever we texted each other. Like it was just a quick â€œdid you do...â€ that sort of thing.

I really hate the way we grew apart and I want to text her again to at least try to rekindle our friendships but I donâ€™t know how to text her I guess? Like I can either just say â€œhey whatâ€™s upâ€ and try to start a conversation or just give it to her straight and bascailly write what Iâ€™m writing now lol

Also I donâ€™t know if I should ask her to call on discord or just text her so if anyone has any advice on how best to approach this
