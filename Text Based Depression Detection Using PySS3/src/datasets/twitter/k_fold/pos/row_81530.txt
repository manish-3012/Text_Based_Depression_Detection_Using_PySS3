Who else feels like they lost most of their friends over the course of the pandemic? As my final year of high school comes to a close, I reflected back on the first months of the pandemic. I realized just how many people Iâ€™ve lost contact with and how I havenâ€™t really made any new friends to replace them with.

Itâ€™s like everyone has already left for college. No one talks to each other and the only time I physically see my peers is through a Zoom call. Iâ€™ve asked a few people I still know if they felt the same way and got varying responses. It really depended on what their social life was like before the pandemic.

So what are your guysâ€™ thoughts?
