saddest slow and soulful rap songs? any suggestions im making a playlist 

so far 

swimming pools and samidot by kendrick 

street lights by kanye 

mockingbird by eminem 

sheâ€™s mine pt 2 by cole 

and thatâ€™s literally it, im trying to be kinda strict with the playlist to only keep it a few per artist, preferably im looking for slow soulful sad songs rather than aggressive disturbing stuff like dance with the devil by immortal technique or changes by 2pac (as much as i love them songs) but im open to any suggestions thank you
