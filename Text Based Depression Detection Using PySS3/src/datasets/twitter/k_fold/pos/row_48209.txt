I just need to rant and none of my friends are awake atm So my dad passed away in April of last year and I can't see anything that reminds me of him without getting shaky and hyperventilating a bit, well I added his email to my phone when I got it out of habit and never removed it, every time I get an email meant for him(all spam bit still) I get kinda emotional and I hate it, bit I just can't bring myself to delete the email because that's one of the few things of his that I have left.  And another thing that always reminds me of him is a video we recorded a few years back of me, him, and my step mom making a dry ice bomb(we were safe while doing it, don't worry) and every time I watch it I can't help but cry, but it's still my favorite video to watch.  Anyway, rant over, thank you for reading.
