[Imagine your at a sports restaurant, having a good time when you see a conversation spark up] Me: Oh hello there!
Human: Hello there as well!
Me: How was your day?
Human: why are your shoes a bit too small?
Me: *frantically sprinting out of the building because Iâ€™m seven burrowing owls in a trench coat AND NO ONE CAN KNOW*
