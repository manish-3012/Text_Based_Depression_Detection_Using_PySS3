my teacher history teacher never thinks things through my history teacher like most teacher does a note check at the end of each quarter and it goes for 500 points.  for test he uses open not because he cant find a way for e learners to cheat despite there being a program on our laptop that prevents us from looking things up during tests  so i write all my notes on flash cards for easy A  but he didnt like that i wrote all the notes down on that so i have one day to rewrite 4 units of notes........             (someone kill me)
