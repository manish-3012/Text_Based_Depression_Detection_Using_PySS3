I would like to recommend all of you a good song. The song is called No Stress - Leatherphace.

Genre: Hip-Hop/LoFi

Itâ€™s one of the chillest songs iâ€˜ve heard and it delivers a great message that you should stop worrying about all the crap that life gives you. The song is not that deep actually but this is what i get out of it.
