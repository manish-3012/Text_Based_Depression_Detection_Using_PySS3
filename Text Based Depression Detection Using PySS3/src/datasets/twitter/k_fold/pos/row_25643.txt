Unpopular opinion circa my comment on another post "aLl mOdeRn rAp suCkS"  
  
Cuz Kendrick lamar, jay rock, schoolboy q, ab soul, j cole, (mixtape) logic, Kanye, polo g, aminÃ©, earl sweatshirt, jpegmafia, vince staples, big sean, meek mill, jayz, nas, andrÃ© 3000, tyler the creator, and more totally don't exist.  

I fuckin hate this anti rap attitude that this community has, mfs thinking that gucci gang, a song that was popular for like, 3 months is all the sudden the epitome of all rap. This shit is the most closed minded garbage I've seen, it's just yall circle jerking your own ego cuz of that "Rap? More like (C)rap! Amirite" bullshit.   
  
Some of these people made the most influential and best projects in the music world as a whole. Come fuckin on.  

Actually take a step outside of your hivemind and give a listen to some shit, listen to good kid; maad city, listen to aquemini, listen to born sinner, listen yo to pimp a butterfly, listen to Late Registration, listen to 4:44, listen to watch the throne. Actually give the genre a chance, and maybe you'll stop fuckin calling rap bad. This shit pisses me off to an unimaginable degree.    
  
Yall mfs downvote me all you want, just know that y'all r missing out on some real shit. Fuck.
