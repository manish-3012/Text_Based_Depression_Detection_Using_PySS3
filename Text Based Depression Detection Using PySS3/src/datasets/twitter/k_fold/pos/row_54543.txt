I have a weird situation One of my friends basically asked me if I would go with her, wearing some strange disguise, to a restaurant in order to basically â€œscout outâ€ our other friendâ€™s date. She phrased it like we would be somehow watching the date and making sure the guy she (our other friend) was with was okay and good and all that. As much as I love social interaction I refused, I thought it was sorta weird and controlling. 

Is this like a common thing to do? Spy on other peopleâ€™s dates?
