Youâ€™re Not An Insomniac, Youâ€™re Lazy Unless of course you actually are an insomniac, but I swear I hear so many people say omgggggg I am such an insomniac I stayed up until 3 in the morning and couldnâ€™t sleep at all 
:(((((((. If you are one of these people, just get off of your fat ass and go run. Thatâ€™s it, after exercising you will feel incredibly tired and sleep should come naturally. Not only that, but get off your phone, especially if youâ€™re reading this at like 2 am, and go to sleep. Goodnight!
