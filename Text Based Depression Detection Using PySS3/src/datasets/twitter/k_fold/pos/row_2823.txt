why do I always feel sad recently I have startef to lose interest in everything that I like and I'm always irrationally sad and I can't tell my mom or dad because this has happened years ago and they got me therapy that didn't do anything other than make my parents lose 300 dollars in a week and since the covid thing we haven't been doing good on money so I don't want to tell them because I always feel guilty about making them lose money.
