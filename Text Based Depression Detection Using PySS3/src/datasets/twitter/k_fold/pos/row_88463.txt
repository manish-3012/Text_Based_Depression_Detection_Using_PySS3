For anyone wanting info on the California fires Hey there, hope your having a good day. California is currently going through a lot of things, and one of those are numerous wildfires. I made this post to compile some places on the web you can go for updates or help.

[here is a fire map that is updated frequently, with control percentages, coverage zones of said fires, and evacuation zones](https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/)

[you can use this website to check for things to pack in case of evacuation](https://www.readyforwildfire.org)

[use this to check the air quality of your area by putting your city in the search bar](https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Walnut%20Creek&amp;state=CA&amp;country=USA)

My family and I are kinda scared Because of how numerous the fires are, but these resources have helped a little. I hope that at least one of these resources has helped someone who needed it. Stay safe out there
