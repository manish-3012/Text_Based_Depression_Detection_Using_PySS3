I really donâ€™t want to grow up. Iâ€™m 14 right now and canâ€™t stop thinking about my future. What am I gonna do with my life after high school? Do I wanna go to college? Every day grows near to the time I have to live independently and do my own things. But Iâ€™m scared. I feel like I wonâ€™t make it out in the world. I have many interest but I donâ€™t know what to do (like jobs/ careers). I donâ€™t know how people just pick a career path and stick with it. Iâ€™m not rich so I canâ€™t just do nothing. Every day I think about this and every day comes the inevitable and Iâ€™m scared REALLY scared.
