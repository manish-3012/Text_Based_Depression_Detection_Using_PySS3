Guys donâ€™t play Texas holdâ€™em with a old sheriff So I was playing some poker with some of my friends. and the old sherif came on into the store cause itâ€™s my friend dads store. He asked if he could deal in and we said yeah why not. (We were basically plying the real deal with chips and stuff) I tried  to bluff him off with a two pare. The dude had a 3 of a kind and I now owe him 50$.
