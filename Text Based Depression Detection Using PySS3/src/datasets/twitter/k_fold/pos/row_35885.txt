A poem I wrote for a boy I dated yellow

heâ€™s the color yellow for me,
sunflowers, rain sprinkling,
dandelions
the sun against my skin.
the sunset and gentle sunrise, 
the start of my day and the end.

my heart is yellow
enveloped by daffodils in my hair and brushing my cheeks
laying in a white sundress
wishing and wanting to be in his arms
to be close to him

to be yellow
