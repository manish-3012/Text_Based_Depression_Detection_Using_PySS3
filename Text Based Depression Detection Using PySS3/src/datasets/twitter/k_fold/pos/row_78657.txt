I don't know what to do So me and this girl have been talking for months and we both like each other the only problem is we live on opposite sides of the us and neither of us think a long distance relationship would work because we both have a need to be able to hug, and cuddle the person were dating so I don't know what to do from here we flirt over texts but I don't see anyway we could take this that lasts more than a month
