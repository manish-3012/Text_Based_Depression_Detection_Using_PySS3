Iâ€™m kinda sad So fitz the YouTuber it just dawned on me, I feel like his content has taken a huge dive . His older vids feel like better versions of what he posts now and if I want that kind of comedy I can watch swaggersouls who is just way more consistent than fitz is now . It sucks I used to love his videos but now they seem stale and his personality also seems a little flat like swagger , smity , kryoz and grizzy really carrying the vids general direction with fitz just cracking the same old jokes .
