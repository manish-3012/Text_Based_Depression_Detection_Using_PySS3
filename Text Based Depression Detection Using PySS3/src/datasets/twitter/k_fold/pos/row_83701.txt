Three different dates with guys from tinder in a week??? Okay so i fucked up i guess??? I've got tinder so i could maybe find a guy i'm interested in. Over the last week i started talking to three boys. Somehow it ended up with me saying yes to meeting with each one. Am i doing anything wrong? Should i feel guilty for it? They really got my attention and i want to meet them.
