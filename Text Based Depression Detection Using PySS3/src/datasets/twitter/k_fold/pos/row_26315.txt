scared for a doctors appointment Iâ€™ve been in 13th percentile of bmi for a very long time and I still havenâ€™t gained any weight during 6 months of working on it so hard on it and pushing myself. Iâ€™m really scared my doctors going to get mad and mark me as uncooperative and I donâ€™t want to make that excuse, Itâ€™s so fucking frustrating.
