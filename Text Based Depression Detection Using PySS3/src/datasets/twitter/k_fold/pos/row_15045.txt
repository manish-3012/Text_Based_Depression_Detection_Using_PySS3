Im feeling appreciatedðŸ˜Š Okay so no idea any1 is gonna read this or not bit i still wanna say it.

So im currently in military basic training in my country and de live in rooms of circa 8-10 ppl per room.

So anyway, yesterday evening i was in my neighbouring room and chilling w the ppl who sleep there, and one of the girls who sleep there said that she likes it when im there.
And since then ive been feeling pretty good about myself and feeling like ppl really do appreciate me :')
End of rant
