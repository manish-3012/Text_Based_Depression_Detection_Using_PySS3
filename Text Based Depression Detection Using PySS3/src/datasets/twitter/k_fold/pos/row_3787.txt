My body is too much of a coward to play old school Doom There's this thing happening to me Every time I play 90's Doom, My head starts to hurt and I feel dizzy forcing me to stop the game. I really like it and wanna play it but every time! I tried using meds, Ointments, Etc. The gameplay is fine, It's just me. This also happens when I play quake. I played a handful of first-person games and most of them are fine. I played Half-Life, Call of duty, Halo, etc. and Only Doom and Quake. I tried Doom 2016 and eternal and they're fine. Please help me, I wanna play doom
