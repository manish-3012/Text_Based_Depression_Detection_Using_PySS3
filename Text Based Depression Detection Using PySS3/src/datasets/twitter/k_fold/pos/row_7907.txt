Im pissed af at my science partner... So we have this project for science and we have to write a thing and make some drawings for it, or something else but thats the thing we chose to do. I made all the drawings last week and wrote like 3 paragraphs, expecting this kid to work on it too. Since it was Thxgiving then I celebrated my bday of the course of 3 days, I didn't check on it, hoping he would work on it and the little shit head hasn't done shit and fuck him. It's due tomorrow and all we have is 3 paragraphs and 2 drawings.
