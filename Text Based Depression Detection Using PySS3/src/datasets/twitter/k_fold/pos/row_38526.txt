College sucks i miss school. it felt like an actual community and people were fun. yeah a lot were dicks but at least it was jnteresting. idk how to explain it but college is just fucking boring and lowkey depressing. i come into class anxious as fuck because the teachers expect so much of you and i have no friends there because everyone sticks to their own predetermined groups. then again i donâ€™t even want to make friends for some reason. Back in school i could actually sorta connect with some people and i made good memories. Literally the first day of college i became so depressed because i just thought that the good days of my life were over. the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me going is the fact that i like this girl. if it wasnâ€™t for her i swear i would be so done with life
