Serious question for guys. (I am a male.) okay, this only happens past 10:00pm, you ever get done doing your thing (ðŸ˜) and then you just are falling asleep the hardest you ever have before? Am I the only one who feels like this when Iâ€™m done? Like Iâ€™ll finish and then Iâ€™m legit fighting to stay awake and then 5 minutes later Iâ€™m fine.
