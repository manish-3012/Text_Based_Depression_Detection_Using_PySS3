I hate my dad I was just about to fall asleep (i live in sweden som timeâ€™s a bit convoluted) and my dad tapped my shoulder. He was grinning ear to ear and i could sense what was coming... my dad proceeded to tell one of the worst dad jokes i have heard in my life. 

He legitimatelly broke my whole sleep plan to tell a dry and unfunny joke... God i hate this man sometimes.
