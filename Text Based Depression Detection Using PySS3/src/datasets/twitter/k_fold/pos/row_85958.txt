Iâ€™m scared I made a terrible mistake on my college aps and I wonâ€™t get in I have done 6-7 classes throughout high-school and the last class has always been a sport that I get an A in. I did not add it to my list of classes because there was no column for PE or sports. You can type it in, but I didnâ€™t. Was I supposed too?????? Idk???
