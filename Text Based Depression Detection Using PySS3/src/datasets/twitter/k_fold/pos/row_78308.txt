The scariest story you'll ever hear You slowly open your eyes. It's like 2AM. You try to get up, but you can't move. You find it difficult to breathe.


At one point, you see... something next to your bed. A tall, shadow-like figure standing there.

The figure slowly moves towards you. You want to struggle, but you can't.

It eventually slowly leans in towards your face, and whispers into your ear a thing that leaves you shocked.
