I want to use a name online Yes this is a bad idea, I donâ€™t know why but I really want to just use a name...maybe Iâ€™ll just use a name of a celebrity or something. I changed my name to some fake randome foreign name on discord...lol. But I would never use anything near my real name. Any tips staying safe online as well
