What should I do if my friend tells me that he wants to kill himself? Heâ€™s not my close friend, heâ€™s just a guy from Discord and we play MMORPG together, but it seems like he doesnâ€™t have friends (or anyone to share his problems) at all and Iâ€™m the only one with whom he can talk about it. Itâ€™s a really heavy burden for me, I canâ€™t (and maybe donâ€™t want to) deal with it. But I also canâ€™t just let anything happen to him.
