Some of you might not like this I had a nightmare that my mom found out that I had reddit, I haven't told her because I am LGBTQ and not out and I am on some subreddits related to that. Reddit is my safe haven and without it I would be so much more depressed than I am now and would feel even worse. Thank you for making it worth my while staying here. All of you, you are appreciated. &lt;3
