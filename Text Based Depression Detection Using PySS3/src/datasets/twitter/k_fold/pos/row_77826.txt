I had my first in-person class in over 10 months It was surreal.

The class building was eerily quiet and empty and there were only 5 students in the class. Unlike in high school where it was bustling and filled with noise and lots of people. But hey, there's a global pandemic, so things would be different. I left right away for my next class right after.

Honestly it feels like I fell asleep as a senior and woke up the next day as a freshman in college
