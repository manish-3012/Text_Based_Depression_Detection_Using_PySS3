I could use a little bit of love and encouragement right now Tl;dr girl of my dreams likes me then one day doesnâ€™t, not really handling it well.  I do not care if you read I just could really use some love from you guys


I donâ€™t really have any in person friends I can talk to about this stuff.  Story starts with this girl.  Letâ€™s call her â€œJillâ€.  Jill lives in Europe and I live in NA, so weâ€™re very far from one another physically.  However, mentally we are very similar and as she used to say we â€œvibe on the same frequency.â€  Jill began liking me in late July this year (we talked a lot back then and given Covid, the distance didnâ€™t really seem too bad due to not being really able to see one another if she were closer anyway) and I began liking her not long after.  None of us really knew about the others thoughts till one day she started dropping hint after hint and I finally caught on.  Everything seemed to make perfect sense after that point, and man â€œJillâ€ is one in seven billion.  Sheâ€™s like everything I want in a person times ten (except for location unfortunately) and everything she does puts the biggest smile on my face.  Sheâ€™s the only person I know period that *thinks* the same way I do.  I think deeply about the world and resent the shallowness of pop cultureâ€”a rare viewpoint where Iâ€™m fromâ€”and so did she.  She had plans on coming to NA for uni in 2021 and we both got very excited for that.  Then things changed a couple weeks later.  I can pinpoint the day.  The inside jokes and the cutesy-dutesy stuff kind of faded away to nothing over the course of the next few weeks and now here we are.  I saw it coming a mile away, but Jill messaged me this morning saying she â€œdoesnâ€™t want to give me false hopeâ€ and I lost it, avoided even opening it till now.  Things were looking up then came a few weeks of me in denial and this was the nail on the coffin.  

I knew it was coming, but it still shocked me to see it and really, really hurt.  Sheâ€™s different.  Iâ€™ve dated a couple people before but things didnâ€™t click, really, then fate introduces me (we met on r/teenagers!) to the girl of my dreams who lives right thousand miles away.  Man I would do anything to hop on a plane and bring her flowers and just make her so happy, but itâ€™s too late for that probably.  Oh well...


Sorry guys just needed to get that off my chest and you guys here are the only friends that donâ€™t interrupt me or push me to the back of the group.  Love you all
