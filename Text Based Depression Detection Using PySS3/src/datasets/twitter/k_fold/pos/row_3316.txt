No woman no cry No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba observing the 'ypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I seh

No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

Said, said, said, I remember when-a we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights, I seh
A log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, I seh
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on throughâ€¦
