Wait wut? Ok so this thing happened to me and it's kinda stupid So I thought you guys might want to hear it. Alright so I was going through YouTube you know as you do, and I saw this video named [the family friendly noose song](https://youtu.be/VJe6LLoGgR8) so it's a song about how to tie a noose pretty self explanatory anyway I thought it was funny as the world is just going to shit so I watched and sent it to a friend with this exact words " bro does yt want me to commit suicide this showed up in my recommended" and apparently he still has his phone monitored so his mommy called my mother saying that I was thinking of  hanging myself and that I was desperate. A day before I was asking for username ideas for another app and he suggested hoeza134 and I said " honestly I'ma try if I get too desperate" do I guess they got it from that but they twisted it into me being highly suicidal and desperate to *end it* so they broke into my room FBI style took away my phone my tablet to monitor all my text and search history I had to argue for 30 minutes to get it back. After she called my siblings telling them I was suicidal and to talk to me. Now their thinking of monitoring my phone and blocking everything that can be seen offensive. I won the argument after two hours and showing them my texts multiple times. She did not inform my siblings however so I had to explain it to them.  So yeah  that's it if you read this far then here have a cookie ðŸª. Have a good day.
