I really need help so I have scoptophobia and I get really anxious when I am being looked at and my teacher just put a new rule that if we donâ€™t turn on the cameras we will be marked as absent and I donâ€™t want to because my heart starts racing and I feel like crying but I donâ€™t wanna tell her and for it to sound like an excuse to just turn off my camera and do whatever I want with the camera off. How can I tell them?
