awhile ago i promised this to myself so basically, like 2.5 months ago I went out to play ball, and said if i was goin to hit 3/5 mid court shots im asking out this girl. this mofo here hit 5/5. she said yes. 2 months passed. pro tip on making decisions:  before fliping a coin, decide which side will be which album, and before throwing it, youll already know the outcome youd want. (same thing with basketball) oh yeah, she know my account. if u see this, wsup boo :))
