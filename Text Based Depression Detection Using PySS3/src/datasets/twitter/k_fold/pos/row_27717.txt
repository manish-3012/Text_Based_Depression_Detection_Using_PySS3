Goodbye, fellow teens I am taking action to change who I am as a person. I feel it will be better for not only me but for my friends and loved ones aswell. The first step im taking is to cut negative stuff out of my life, and unfortunately, the majority of reddit is one of thoes things. I know there isn't a ton of hate here but there definitely is some. And I just dont want that to be a part of who I am as a person. Its been a good run soldiers, I hope each and every one of you have a good day and or night. Adios
