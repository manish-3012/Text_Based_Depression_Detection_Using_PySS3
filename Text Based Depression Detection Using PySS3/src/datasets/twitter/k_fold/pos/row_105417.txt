Unpopular Opinion: Light bullying and criticism from classmates and peers is actually good for kids. I know it sounds weird but tbf I was an obnoxious little shit head in 6th and 7th grade. And I got kinda bullied (maybe it was a bit too far) but it helped me not be a little shit anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is , bullying ,on a maintained normal level , is actually helpful for a students personality. 

If yall have any opposing points please do share. Downvote if necessary.
