We're Dating! So a while back I made a post about how I confessed to my crush, and how it turned out she liked me back.   
Well, we're dating now! It's been a solid good bit and I don't regret anything at all. We've only met up a few times physically due to COVID, but it's good times and it's helpful to have someone like her by my side.   


And with that, I give you some advice; confess to your crush. If you confess and it turns out she doesn't like you, you're only back to where you started.   


Thank you for listening to my two cents worth of a TED Talk.
