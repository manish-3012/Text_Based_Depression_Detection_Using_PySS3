I just uploaded my first YouTube video!!! i used to perform when i was a kid but developed serious social anxiety in my mid teens. i have been trying to get back to performing (it has been my new years resolution for  years now) but the pandemic has just made it impossible.

its my birthday today so i decided to start this year off right and finally gathered enough courage to put my voice on the internet. i don't know how the video will do, but i already feel great.
