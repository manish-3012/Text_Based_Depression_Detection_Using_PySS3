Itâ€™s always the tiniest thing that ruins my day If one thing happens in my day, it will be completely ruined for me. I donâ€™t know if I am just sensitive or what. I get upset easily over things that I love. I made an earlier post about my bb gun being damaged and that completely ruined my day. My mom doesnâ€™t know yet and I am scared to tell her. They arenâ€™t the most expensive things but she will probably be disappointed in me.

That event completely ruined my whole day even though what happened was so small. Same thing happens with everything else. Iâ€™ll play a video game, draw, or play music and something similar happens. Iâ€™ll lose a single game and Iâ€™ll be completely bummed out about it even though my games are mostly good. I draw pretty decent but if I mess up a single thing or if someone says that what I drew was traced, I stop drawing for a long time. Lastly when I am trying to learn a new song and if I just keep messing up, I give up.
