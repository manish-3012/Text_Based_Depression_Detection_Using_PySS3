Don't you hate it when the things that made you unique all of the sudden became a trend? I remembered that dying your hair is a sign of art and self expression but not damn it seems like it has became a trend it used to be powerful way to express yourself but now?..... IDK anymore no hate on people who dyed their hair am angry at those who just do it for the feels and not anything else
Sorry bad grammar an just so angry I can't type right
