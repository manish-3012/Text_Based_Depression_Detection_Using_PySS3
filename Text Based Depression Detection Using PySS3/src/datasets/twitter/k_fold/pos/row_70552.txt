It's one thing when a friend does something to hurt you, it's another thing when they don't even realize that it's hurtful What fucking universe do you have to live in to think ghosting a person isn't inconsiderate? They reconnected and I assumed they'd apologize or explain theirself or something, but no. They seemed confused why I was being short, defensive when I called what they did inconsiderate, and haven't even tried to apologize or make it up.

How could I be so naive as to assume they were a good person? And why is it that I still hesitate to block them because it'd hurt them? Why should o care??
