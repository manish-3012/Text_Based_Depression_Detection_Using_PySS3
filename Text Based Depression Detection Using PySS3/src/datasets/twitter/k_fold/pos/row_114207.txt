I just got a 68/100 on my biochem test and I dislike science and Iâ€™m bummed that I got a bad grade but I donâ€™t really care at this point I care but I donâ€™t care. My teacher doesnâ€™t put his grades in till the end of the 9 weeks so I just need to get good grades on the rest of the stuff but being on hybrid and missing in person class is kinda difficult when learning new info. Especially when he assigned it like a month ago

Chapter 7 and glycoproteins and proteoglycans and all that confuses me. Can anyone here relate
