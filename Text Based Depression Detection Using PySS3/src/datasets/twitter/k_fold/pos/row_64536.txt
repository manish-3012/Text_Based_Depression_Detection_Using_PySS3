A Random Dude's Dairy: Day 3 I missed day 2.

I had a math test today, I didn't fuck up that bad.

I meet some dude who lives close to me, his name is Abd Al Malak(I just call him Malak).

Turns out he lives close to me and goes to school on foot too, I was happy to find someone to walk with the whole distance between my house and school.

I am getting taller(thank god), I am nearly as tall as my older brother.

I am willing to practicing kick boxing in a local sport class.

I have French and science test tomorrow, wish me luck please.
