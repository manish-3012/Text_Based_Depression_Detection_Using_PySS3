I'm genuinely scared of losing my human rights. As a gay person (trans to but i haven't transitioned) I'm genuinely scared for the equality that i currently have. I'm already discriminated against as is i don't need my rights taken away. Both of the political candidates in the USA are terrible people but at least Biden won't restrict my ability to live. I don't live in the USA but my countries equivalent to the right likes borrowing the pumpkins policies.
Here are some things i could loose if donald trump wins
-BASIC FUCKING HEALTHCARE
-RIGHT TO ADOPT
-A SAFE LIFE WHERE I DON'T FEEL THREATENED
-LIFE OUTSIDE A CONVERSION CAMP
