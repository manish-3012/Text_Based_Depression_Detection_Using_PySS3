People are spitting at Walmart employees. So a friend of mine that's starting to work at Walmart told me that sometimes people spit and threaten to kill the employees that tell them to wear masks before entering the store.

LMAOOO imagine getting mad and thinking you have the right to barge into another persons business without following their rules
