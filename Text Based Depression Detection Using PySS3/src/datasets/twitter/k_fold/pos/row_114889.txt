Smoking looks cool af, Change my mind For the record I am not saying it's good to smoke. That shit is addictive and it kills you. I am by no means endorsing smoking, I am just saying that it looks pretty cool and badass.

Some extra points:

-saying things like "cancer doesn't look cool" aren't valid points. I'm talking purely about esthetics. 

-im saying that smoking itself looks cool, but in certain contexts it's pretty nasty. Ex: a cowboy or biker smoking while riding would look cool vs a trashy homeless junkie smoking is pretty gross

-im mainly referring to cigarettes, not vaping or weed. To all those teen vapers: I'm not gonna judge, do what you want, but if you think vaping makes you look cool you're wrong. Seeing someone vape is just cringe. And with weed, yeah it's fun but the lazy stoner esthetics isn't exactly cool or badass.

So yeah I'm mainly referring to a certain look with cigarettes in the right context. Change my mind

And again, don't smoke.
