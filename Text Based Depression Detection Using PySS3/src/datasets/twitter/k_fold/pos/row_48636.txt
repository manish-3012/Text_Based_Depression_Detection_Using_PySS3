Saw my girlfriend at a restaurant with another guy and they kissed. My heart is broken in pieces right now how could she do this, after being in a relationship for 5 years? I'm still not able to process what i saw. I want it to be not true but i saw it from my own eyes. fuck this world man, i loved her more than anything else in my life. idk what i'll do when we'll meet tomorrow, she doesn't know that I saw her there. I wanted to confront her in front of that guy and beat his ass up but i was with my wife and kids, i didn't want them to see all that. ugh fuck my life
