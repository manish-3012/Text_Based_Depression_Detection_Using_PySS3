I miss my dog. So, me and my dog had been together for a long time. And I have some great memories of him. My mom and step dad were getting a divorce because my step dad cheated on my mom and got HIV. So, when they got divorced my step dad took my dog. And he started losing money because he got fired from his job. So, my step dad put my dog in a shelter and didn't even try to give my dog back to me. I called all the dog shelters in my area and none of them had my husko. I've been so sad and I just don't know how to deal with losing my husko. How am I supposed to deal with this?
