So Like TikTok Bad So around 4 months ago i had gotten with this girl and we loved each other so so so much. One month ago she broke up with me and didnâ€™t tell me a reason. then she started being a bitch on tiktok and she said a lot of fucked up things about me (none of witch where true). i decided to make a tiktok about how i hated her now and the tiktok got taken down for bullying in harassment WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HER SHE REPORTED MY TIKTOK! honestly in the end im more upset about the tiktok than i am about her breaking up with me
