"Why aren't you doing anything useful, son?" Oh I wonder. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I physically can't because you and mum are being asshats dad.

My desk with my laptop on has now been buried for almost a week now. I'm not allowed to move anything off it without my mum because I "would only make more of a mess to clear up later."

This would have been solved last Friday, but my mum was "too busy" to keep her end of the agreement. This wouldn't have been an issue in the first place if my dad hadn't told my brother to "clear up".

Congratulations, you've made it my fault that I'm not allowed to get any work done.
