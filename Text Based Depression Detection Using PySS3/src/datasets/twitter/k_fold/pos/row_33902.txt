Iâ€™m miserable I have no good, healthy, close relationships. Not even one. Iâ€™m so tired and nobody cares about my interests. I just called my friend to tell him I might be getting a new pet and he just talked over me the whole time (narrating himself playing Skyrim). We had a festival thing at school too and he followed me around the whole time and made me feel like shit. My other close friend hardly spent any time around me at all during the event and had been constantly ignoring my texts all week. My next closest friend is wonderful and nice, but he just wants to â€˜fixâ€™ me any time we hang out and we donâ€™t really talk very often at all. None of my other friends are close to me whatsoever. I just want to crumble into dust. Iâ€™m an extrovert, but Iâ€™m secretly really depressed, and while I make jokes about it a lot I never really open up to people because I donâ€™t want to burden them with my sadness or waste their time. Iâ€™m incredibly loud and out there in about half of my classes and itâ€™s really exhausting sometimes. When I donâ€™t act excited or social people usually point it out and I feel like Iâ€™m dragging the mood down. I hate myself and all of the aforementioned â€˜friendsâ€™, but itâ€™s so well hidden that nobody knows. Iâ€™m so tired and sad and bitter inside all the time. I just want to collapse. I can take so much shit and still smile and laugh through it all like itâ€™s a big joke. I honestly just want to kill myself but at this point itâ€™s just a distant fantasy.
