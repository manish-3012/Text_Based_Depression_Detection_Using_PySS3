What does one do.. When they've lost motivation to do literally anything, their mental health is at an all time low, they feel like they're becoming detached from everybody they love.. But trust nobody enough to tell, ecxept for one person but they just don't know how to bring it up, And last time their mother didn't listen, just insisted on asking what the problem was, what caused it but they didn't know so they went back to hiding it. They're not suicidal, they'd never do that.. But they know something is wrong
