My family has a special talent when it comes to making me feel unwelcomed Tonight was â€˜family movie nightâ€™. I had a swim lesson beforehand (Iâ€™m a swim coach) and because of the fucking heatwave I was super tired and decided to take a nap. When I woke up, I went downstairs to find my family choosing a movie for the movie night. It was yet another action movie. I asked them politely if we could watch something other than action and my brother said because my cousin and him hadnâ€™t watched it, we were doing to watch it. I said, donâ€™t I get a say? He says nope I donâ€™t care what you think. My mother then says donâ€™t take it personally OP, itâ€™s fine! No problem!

I am so done with my mom enabling my brothers insults and how she always say donâ€™t take it personally even when I know my brother means to be insulting!! I feel like Iâ€™m losing my fucking mind in this house and I really miss my dads place...
