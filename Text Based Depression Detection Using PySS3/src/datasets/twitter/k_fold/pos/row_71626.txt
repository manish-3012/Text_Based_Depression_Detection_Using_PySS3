Details

Sherbase12 has multiple YouTube accounts leaving him as a clear target. He mainly target gacha channels, that seem to be mainly populated by teens, and then revealing said teens name, ip adress, house adress and everything else for everyone elses taking. Sickos might try to do something very very bad to em. Sherbase12 seems to be collecting cult like following in his quest to "make YouTube great again". Were here to stop it. If you succeed on hacking him, do as i told before. No doxing allowed for obvious reasons. Sherbase12 is a sick person Who lacks empathy. Get To work, i trust you guys
