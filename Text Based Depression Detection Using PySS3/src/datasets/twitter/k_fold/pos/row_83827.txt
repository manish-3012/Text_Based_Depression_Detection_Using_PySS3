I got my first crush a few weeks ago and I'm 99.9% sure shes into me too and now I'm happy:) I've had 2 girlfriends but I guess never felt anything. I've been through a lot of mental trauma and ever since my mind has been really foggy in general but more so with emotions, but this managed to get through. And holy fucking shit is it scary god damn
