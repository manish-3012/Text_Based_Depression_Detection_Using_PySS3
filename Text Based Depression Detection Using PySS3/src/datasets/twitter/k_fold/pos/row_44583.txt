My mom and this job I stg. After 10 weeks of 5am mornings to work long days raking sand in the heat as a full time summer job. I told my boss that I was rolling back to weekends only to prep for college in the fall. 

Boss said â€œyeah sure go aheadâ€

My dad said â€œyeah sure I donâ€™t care good planâ€

My mom got pissed and said it was somehow rude to both my boss and her to roll back my hours for â€œno reasonâ€. Apparently I havenâ€™t made enough money.... 

Iâ€™ve  been working and saving for the past three years. This year I made enough to push me into the tax bracket, not a good plan considering I just barely turned 18 and am going to post secondary... I knew that if I worked full time I was gonna crack that barrier, but my mom told me to work full time anyways...

So I told her why I did it. And she asked how I had been feeling this summer. 

And I was honest and said â€œKinda shit cause my program got delayed, Iâ€™m working a shitty job, I didnâ€™t have a prom or grad and everyone I know is gone.â€ And she just looked at me and said â€œYouâ€™re kidding, right?â€ Apparently thatâ€™s no reason to be sad and Iâ€™m being selfish. 

News flash mom, Iâ€™ve made more than you for the past 3 years...

Like my god I have 1 week left at this place I do not wanna be doing 5 am mornings raking sand for the rest of my last summer my god... Iâ€™ve made more than enough these last few years.
