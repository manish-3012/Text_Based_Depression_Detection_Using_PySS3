So my first day of school is in 8 hours and I canâ€™t sleep because of my anxiety rn Bc of a girl.  So basically this girl I thought was attractive did one of those yolo stories on Snapchat and I sent an anonymous message saying she was cute. Well later she found out it was me but she didnâ€™t like me (shouldâ€™ve ended there) But she has to go out of her way to tell everyone I liked her so now Iâ€™m embarrassed af.                                                      TLDR; my crush has told everyone I like her so Iâ€™m about to get made fun of tomorrow
