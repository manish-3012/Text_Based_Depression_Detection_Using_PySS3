I canâ€™t stop thinking about a girl who Iâ€™ll probably never see again who I think had a crush on me. I blew my only chance at a girlfriend and I think I like her now even though I havenâ€™t talked to her in about two years and I didnâ€™t like her back then. She gave pretty clear signals now that I think about it and her sister even told me that the girl liked me but I thought she was joking. I feel like a typical dense anime protagonist. Someone kill me. Is this weird to suddenly develop a crush on someone you havenâ€™t talked to in two years? I canâ€™t tell.
