Broo I straight up hallucinated that she texted me Did this happen to anyone else? Or am I going insane? She is my ex-girlfriend and I still did not get over the breakup and I just saw a notification on my phone with her name and everything but when I checked boom nothing but I can swear I saw that notification am I going crazy?
