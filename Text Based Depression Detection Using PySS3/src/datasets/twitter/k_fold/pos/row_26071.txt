Thereâ€™s a girl that likes me online but I need help A few weeks ago I randomly met this very nice and sweet girl on Twitter my age. She began to DM me and we have texted quite a decent amount..
And on Sunday she started flirting a lot with me and admitted that I was cute and that she liked me, she was going really fast ig but my problem is...

1. Iâ€™m a little interested too but Iâ€™m very insecure about myself, sheâ€™s wanted to FaceTime but so far Iâ€™ve declined because Iâ€™m scared that there will be awkward silence or our convo will be shit and sheâ€™ll lose interest. Iâ€™m talented when it comes to art and animations but Iâ€™m known for being socially awkward irl and I donâ€™t feel like I want to dump these issues on her
2. Iâ€™m scared that we will get fully invested into online long distance relationship but one of us or both of us will end up hurt 
3. We follow each other on twitter. She talks to this other guy that seems waayy cooler than me, like he plays drums and knows a lot about bands and has like 4k followers and I think they know each other irl.
4. She seems smarter than me... sheâ€™s always posting BLM posts and informative immigration posts trying to defend others... and my twitter is just filled with like me posting my stupid sense of humor and shit

It tears my heart because weâ€™re both 17, she told me that nobody has ever told her that theyâ€™re interested and she keeps calling herself ugly when I think she doesnâ€™t look that bad... she also lives in Dallas which is where my dad lives and itâ€™s not even that far but... Iâ€™m scared to make any effort :(
