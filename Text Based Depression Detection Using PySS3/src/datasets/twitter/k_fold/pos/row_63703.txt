Why is this sub so against doing any type of drug? If I mention doing any type of drug no matter how unharmful it is, there will be at least half the comments if not more saying drugs are bad or making up a story how your best friends brother died from injecting marijuana in his arm.



I even seen a comment where this 15 yo guy would not let there parents drink alcohol regarding there not alcoholics and not a mean drunk.


It's annoying af and sometimes makes it hard to enjoy this sub
