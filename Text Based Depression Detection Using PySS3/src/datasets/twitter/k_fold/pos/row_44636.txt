I need a study break. So bye Reddit... It's been quite some time here, and all have been cool and a strong bonding community filled with sadness, happiness, and relationships.

I'm HS Senior, last year, and it has hit me now that in order to get to my dream college, I need to score a legit 100% in all 5 Subjects (Maths, Macro and Indian \[yes, this is an Indian kid\] Economics, Accountancy, Business Management and English \[where you can actually never get more than 98%, even if you're Shakespeare, it's the rule\]) , when Calculus and Relations and all are kinda freaking me out.

I have scored 95.2% in Grade 10th, but now, in 12th, I'll need to put more efforts. I have limited time, and need unlimited effort to pull that score.

Wish me luck guys. 100% in 5/5 Subjects. It will be unachievable, but worth the success. What I can maximum achieve is 99.6%, but aim higher, so I can at least score something.

See you all in April 2021.

Wish me luck guys. If I get there, my life is actually cleared.

I need wishes, I need motivation. I'll do it, but I need wishes.

Thanks y'all, have a great day.
