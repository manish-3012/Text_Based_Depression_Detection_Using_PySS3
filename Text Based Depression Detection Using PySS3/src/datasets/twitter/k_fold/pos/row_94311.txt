I have a question for the boys I want to figure out some stuff so can you describe what you do or talk about with the boyz when you all meet up. Cause lately the feeling with being with my boyz is just not right. We meet up and there are like a shitload of awkward silent moments. Itâ€™ll really help me figure out wtf is wrong
