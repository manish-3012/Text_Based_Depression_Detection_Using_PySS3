I need some advice... (I didn't sleep last night so sorry if anything i write here doesn't really make sense)

I really like this one girl in my class and have developed a pretty good friendship with her but i'm worried asking her out would ruin our friendship. Im also just scared cause im too much of a pussy to do it. Probably because of the first reason actually. Will probably delete this when i properly wake up tbh
