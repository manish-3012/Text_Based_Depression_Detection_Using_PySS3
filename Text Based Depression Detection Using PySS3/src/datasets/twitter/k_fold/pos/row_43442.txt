I feel like I'm being punished because I started to study Recently I had to live with my friend for a short amount of time, but in that time they got me to begin studying regularly. It got to the point that I was actually enjoying getting the work done (I know, I'm a nerd). I start living at home again and my mum is really happy that I'm studying, so she declares that I am going to study 1 hour a day, everyday. I fine with that, but then she talked to one of my teachers. Suddenly, she starts micro-managing everything I do. Studying becomes "reinforcing the discipline of it", and instead me completing anything, I stare at a screen for 60 minutes+ because I feel like shit and can't focus. I feel like no matter what I do, my assessment will turn out like shit, so I delete all my work, then I get stressed because I'm starting over, then it happens again. I feel like shit.
