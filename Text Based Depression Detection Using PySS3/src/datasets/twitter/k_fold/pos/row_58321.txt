An open letter to the kid who stole my Bee Movie game for the DS Dude it's been over 10 years, that was my first ds game and you had the AUDACITY to steal it bc you thought i stole your game that your dumb friends were playing with in the other room. I know i have to be an adult ot whatever but like bruv fuck you. I didnt even finish the game bc I couldnt pass the level where the dude tried to kill Barry in the restroom. I'll find you some day Bee Movie game:(
