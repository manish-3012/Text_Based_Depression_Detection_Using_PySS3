I donâ€™t know what to put as a title but Iâ€™m freaking out right now [Possible Trigger Warning]

Iâ€™ve been seeing and feeling things that arenâ€™t actually there. I usually see shadows or something moving - I occasionally see things shining even when itâ€™s not supposed to.

As for feeling, itâ€™s usually something crawling on my body. Though feeling this is less common than seeing something.

I donâ€™t know what this is but it freaks me out every time. Iâ€™m hoping to go to the doctorâ€™s soon but the pandemic means we have to wait, I donâ€™t want to self-diagnose either.

But does anyone know what this could be and why Iâ€™m getting this?
