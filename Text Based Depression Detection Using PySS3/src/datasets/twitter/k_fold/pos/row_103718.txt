Rant rant cause I'm mad The government of this colony keeps telling people what to do. They said that we could not start farms WHEREVER I wanted. I started a farm in the east of the colony and then the Native Americans wanted a fight! Did the government come and help me out? Nope. So I set up a militia (a group of my buddies with weapons), attacked the local tribes, and then we marched onto England's second permanent settlement. The English had better get the governor, a man who has limited our colonyâ€™s rights, out of here before I take over!
