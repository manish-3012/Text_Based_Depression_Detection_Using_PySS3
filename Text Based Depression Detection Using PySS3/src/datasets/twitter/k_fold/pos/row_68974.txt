Asked out the girl I have a crush on today We saw each other at the store today and we talked for a while. I told myself today was the day I was going to ask her out. After she got everything she needed I asked her if she wanted to go get lunch with me and she said sure. By this point I was really happy with myself because  I was going on a date with the girl I had a crush on for at least 2 years. We went to Dairy Queen and talked and ate for at least 20 minutes. I then said something stupid as we were leaving â€œWas this just a friend thing or are you as interested in me as I am in you?â€

As you can probably guess she said it was a friend thing and that she would never date a guy like me. Iâ€™m so mad at myself for saying that.
