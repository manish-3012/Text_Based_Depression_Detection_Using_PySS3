My dad finally having the son he always wanted after 2. So my parents had told us that my mom was pregnant and hoping it's a boy. My brother is 21 and I'm 18. My dad's name is JesÃºs and mine and my brother's is Jimmy and Jesse. He said he always wanted to name their first kid his own name but my brother never got that. Neither did I. So now that my parents know about how me and my brother, my brother kinda being irresponsible sometimes and me having ADHD and having my head cracked opened twice but only in minor damages, they hope the new kid doesn't disappoint them like we did.
