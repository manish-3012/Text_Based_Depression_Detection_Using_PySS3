Parent's Expectations too high Let me preface this by saying I don't post on reddit frequently anymore, so I'm sorry if this is somewhat out of place, but I just needed to vent my frustrations to a group who (hopefully) will support me.

Now that that's out of the way, my parents have been driving me up the wall lately. Constantly all they talk about is getting my SAT scores and my APUSH grades up, and its driving me insane. For reference, I've already gotten a 1350 on the SAT- far and away enough to get into a moderately decent college, and more than enough to go to the school that I want to attend. I want to get a music engineering degree, but they're insistent that I get a degree in whatever engineering to make sure that I'm "successful", but all I want to do after college is be happy doing what I do and live my life how I see fit. I don't need to be making 6 figures, as long as I have enough to live on my own I'll be perfectly fine, but they can't seem to understand that. Now they've turned to criticizing me whenever I'm doing anything that isn't schoolwork on my spare time. Like jesus christ let me have my hobbies and live my life in peace. At this point I'm starting to want to not live up to their expectations just to show that I can be content with my life without following their "perfect step by step plan to fulfillment". I can't fucking deal with it anymore.

I'm sure some of you guys have delt with this too, and I'm wondering how the fuck you managed to deal with it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
