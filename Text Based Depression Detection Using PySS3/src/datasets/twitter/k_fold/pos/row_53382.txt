I hate how I get jealous So I am a freshman and am super into musical theatre. I know that I am good but it is a super competitive thing to be in. Whenever I see someone else post something about how good they are or how they got a good part in a musical, I want to be happy for them and I am alway positive when talking to them and when talking to other about them, but inside, I canâ€™t get over it. I just beat my self up cause Iâ€™ll never be that good or confident. I have this dislike towards them and itâ€™s not fair to them cause they donâ€™t deserve it. Does anyone have any tips for pushing past this? I really want to be friends with these people but it is just so hard for me to push through that. 

Side note: ik itâ€™s a shitty thing to be like this so donâ€™t @ me. Iâ€™m trying to work through it and I donâ€™t need judgement.
