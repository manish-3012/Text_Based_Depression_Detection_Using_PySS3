To all oil companies: I hope making a quick buck was worth making the planet unlivable and creating a mass extinction.

You guys have messed up the climate so much that thereâ€™s already a mass extinction of marine life. 

But who cares, right? Because climate change is a hoax even though 97% of scientists agree that 

1. The Earth is warming

and

2. Humans are causing it.

What they should really be saying is:

â€œI know that Iâ€™m ruining the planet, but all the ways I could help fix it involve not making those precious dollars anymore, and we all know that nothing is more important than having money. Even the extinction of our species!â€
