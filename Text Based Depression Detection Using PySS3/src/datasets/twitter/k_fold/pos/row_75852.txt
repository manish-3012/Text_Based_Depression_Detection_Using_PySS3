Why the hell are parents so damn nosy and pushy for things not meant to be nosy or pushy? All right, I know the title doesn't seem to make much sense but just read along

Today, I had to get printouts done but the gosh darn printer wouldn't print a thing, so I thought I'll quickly go the the internet cafÃ© down the street and get the prints from there. But my mom decided that she'll tag along too, I knew arguing with her wouldn't make things any better either so I said ,with a sigh,  "Sure." 

Once we reached the internet cafÃ©, the guy there for printouts was a bit of a newbie (I think) because he didn't know how to do things properly... Anyways, we spent 45 WHOLE MINUTES TO GET A GOSH DARN PRINTOUT!

So naturally, I (being the forgetful lad I am) kinda forgot that I had brought a USB Drive with me.

My mom reminded me that I had left my drive at that place so I quietly explained that it's too late now to call the guy in-charge of the cafÃ© and I'll get it in the morning, BUT APPARENTLY THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING TO SAY AS SHE WENT BATSHIT CRAZY AND ORDERED ME TO CALL THE PERSON IN-CHARGE OF THE CAFE. I tried explaining to her that its almost MID FRIKING NIGHT RIGHT NOW and the guy would have gone to bed. She didn't even try to listen to my explanation and called the guy and handed the phone to me and left the room.

I said "Hello there, I'm sorry to disturb you at this time of the night, I had came to your cafÃ©...  " and that guy simply said "DO EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT TIME IS IT RIGHT NOW? I'M SURE YOU MUST DO AND FOR YOUR USB DRIVE, COME IN TOMMOROW AND I GIVE YOU YOUR F\*\*\*\*\*\*G DRIVE"  and hanged up on me

When my mom came into my room, she went "SO??" and I said "I'll go and get it myself" and she said "You are an ungrateful little man who has no idea of money or anything!"

I simply said "^(Fine)"   

\*SIGH\*

Anyways that's all, Thanks for reading this rant
