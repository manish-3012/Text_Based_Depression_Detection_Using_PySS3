Should you date me? 1. I look like a 5 and plenty of guys around me are a 7-9
2. I like anime. 
3. I canâ€™t start a good conversation, you have to be the one talking, Iâ€™ll pick up from there
4. Iâ€™m 6â€™3
5. Iâ€™m 19 years old, and still in my motherâ€™s house

In conclusion: I guess if Iâ€™m your type and â€œsweet and charmingâ€ and you want a butt ugly guy as a boyfriend, go ahead. But otherwise, no. But Iâ€™ll still try to get a gf though.
