Iâ€™m fucking seething right now. Hey this is a long read but I really want someone to hear this. Please. Give it your time. Today, my mom threw out my science project (she knew I had been working on) and when I notified her she was like OKAY!! OKAYY!!! In a really snarky tone and I asked her to apologize and she said â€œwell when you mess up my stuff you never apologize.â€

So I stood the fuck up to her and snapped back like lightning â€œtell me one time I did something to any of your stuff and failed to apoligizeâ€ and she looked at me speechless and after about 30 seconds since she was wrong and could not admit it she yelled â€œget the fuck out of my room.â€

I am really glad I stood up to her and her bullshit. One time a few weeks ago I remember she asked me to do the dishwasher so after 5 minutes I got off the call with my friend and did it and she was so angry she yelled at me and she threw a CD case at me.

She always makes me breakfast in the morning but for about a whole week afterward she stopped making me breakfast or lunch and I kind of have a developing ED so this severely affected me as I ate nothing except dinner.

One night, I was using my moms phone to set up an alarm for my presentation the next day. Guess what I saw. She set an alarm every day at 8:00AM and 12:00PM labeled â€œMaki dishwasher late no breakfast or lunchâ€ and I confronted her about it and she ACTUALLY SAID â€œwhen I tell you to do something, you do it. I WILL NOT wait 5 minutes so you can talk to your bullshit friends. You answer to me.â€

And I just left her room and cut myself later that day. The good thing is, today, I stood up to her, and didnâ€™t cut myself!
