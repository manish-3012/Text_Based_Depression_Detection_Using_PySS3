Sick of these dumb transgender arguments. Ever since this super straight shit came out people seem to think, that not wanting to have sex with a trans women is transphobic. "She went through full surgery, if you would have sex with a regular women you shoul-" If you ever see yourself about to say this, stop right there nobody cares. Trans women and regular women are not the same. Its dumb to say they are and its not transphobic to not want to have sex with them. This dumb shit just pisses me off, I do not want to have sex with a transwomen and many straight men don't want to either, we are not transphobic, we just want to be with NATRUAL women and natural women alone. Are you homophobic for not wanting to sleep with him?
