Please help me fill out this survey for my physics class So in my physics class we are doing an experiment, where we have to ask different people we know how good their hearing is, so thus I figured I would ask here.

Please go to [https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/hearing) and take the test and remember your score.

Once you're done go to this google form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpNl0BXXImCunUXoIZ\_985sx4siD4gEbMOnPJGHgGvD37mPQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpNl0BXXImCunUXoIZ_985sx4siD4gEbMOnPJGHgGvD37mPQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) and fill in your score + age (or not)

Thank you in advance =)
