Why do people downvote posts/streams? If you don't like the post or the stream then I get it. But there are streams that I'll be watching of some pretty chill people painting or having a nice discussion and they get like 10 downvotes. Just why. Like I'm not gonna lie it's happened to me where I stream and in the first minute of streaming I'll get like 4 downvotes and it sucks coz you feel like your just bad at streaming. What's the point? But yh be nice guys
