I want to ask something to everyone.  I have been on Reddit for about a year now, and have read numerous incidents of parents abusing or kicking their children out and many more such incidents. However, me being in India have never seen such incidents hid the news. Is this something that is prevalent in the developed countries or is it some cultural thing? 

Adding to this, in India, the cases get reversed where parents are left out and abused in their older ages, and these incidents hit the headlines frequently. Is there some difference?
