Iâ€™m growing up :( Well... itâ€™s happening. Iâ€™m growing up. Got a license, going in for my first job interview right now, and almost turning 18 years. This subreddit has kinda helped me through some thing by sharing experiences with all of you people at my own age. Iâ€™ve have anxiety and am a complete introvert. Clearly that means I relate to a lot of you, but itâ€™s about time I go and see the dim light of adulthood. Thank you everyone for being my age and sharing my experiences :)
