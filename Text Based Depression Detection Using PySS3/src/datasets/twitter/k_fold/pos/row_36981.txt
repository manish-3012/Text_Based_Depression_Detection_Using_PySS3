presenting my partner with a promise ring for their birthday. nervous asf im a 17 year old lesbian in a very, VERY happy relationship with my 16 year old nonbinary partner in crime. we're two peas in a pod, two halves of a whole, blah blah blah gross icky sappy shit etc.

since we're so often apart due to MANY, MANY factors, our relatively new relationship feels strained sometimes. okay, a lot of the time. we're happy together, but it's near impossible (and not responsible, lets be real), to hang out right now. not ideal for a blooming romance. we facetime for hours nightly, but its not the same. you know how it is to miss someone and be kept apart.

so i decided it would be perfect to grab us matching promise rings. i scraped some cash together and bought us two simple silver bands with a moonstone set in the middle. moonstones mean a lot of different things spiritually, and it kinda depends on the individual, but in wicca (my family practices, because we are obnoxiously, exceedingly irish in ancestry), theyre widely known for secreting all encompassing love of all kinds and a certain feminine energy. my partner constantly wails on the fact that im such a girly girl, saying that being around me is like being in the presence of a high society lady. so, i was thinking that a moonstone promise ring would remind them that im around, always. 

the rings come on the 7th, and their birthday is on the 14th, but i have NO idea if i can wait that long to show the rings to them. 

my partner assured me that no matter what i got them for their birthday/the holidays, they'd love it because it was from me. but im still so, so nervous! singles and non-singles alike, please throw me a bone and voice some romantic (and considering miss rona, SAFE) gestures i could pair with my gift.
