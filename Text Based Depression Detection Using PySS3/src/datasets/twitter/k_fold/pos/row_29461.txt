About to enter decade three of my life Imma miss you guys when I leave on the 21st of March! In the past year, a lot of shit happened. COVID, I went through 4 jobs, got a very loving girlfriend back in September, and now Ive gotten laid twice! However great my year ended, we should also take time to think about all that weâ€™ve lost this year: that one dumbass that ate a bat, Chadwick boseman, half of the dc tv shows, and everyoneâ€™s family and friends suffering due to the VID. I hope yâ€™allâ€™s 2021 is much better! Sadly, I leave this year, as I turn 20 on March 21st, and Iâ€™ll miss yâ€™all. See ya when Iâ€™m 113!
