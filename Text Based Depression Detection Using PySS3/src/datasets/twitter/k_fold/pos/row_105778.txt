my stepmom thinks every time i bring up my real mom i do it for attention here are the name roles  


my stepmom will be known as Jen  


my real mom as mom  


and me as me  


  
So my mom and her husband abused me and my sisters and brothers for around 8 years of my life, it really affected me. she physically abused me with the belt and made my brother eat cat litter because he accidentally spilled his juice (he was 4). she mentally abused me and emotionally abused me. it gives me PTSD thinking about it but i gotta get it off my chest. im not in the best mental state, so i posted i long thing to Facebook and Jens first action was taking away my phone. i talked to her calmly and said   


"i dont know why i am being punished for feeling emotions."  


she ranted about how its obviously the people im talking to (which its NOT, my online friends are so nice to me). it makes me feel like shit when she trys to turn the thing back onto me.  


she wont even let me contact my mom, sure she was a POS but i miss her, she said "she knows your number, why would you care about someone who never calls you"   


Jen doesn't respect my pronouns (they/them) or my name (Grey) she keeps calling me by my dead name. yet when i try to correct her shes like "go to your room, im the adalt" she thinks just cuz shes an adault she can make me sad.  


i have autism so im naturally more immature, yet she tells me evrytime "your a fucking teen, act like one"  


here is a little [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JT9WKD1ACr3K3tqmltCxZlC1kcjzBR8gaqlHuSi3wIk/edit) i made, only 3 questions.
