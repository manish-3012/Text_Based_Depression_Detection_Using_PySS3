I wish God was real My life already sucks as it is

1. My parents and family are older meaning that they will die sooner and i will be stuck alone
2. I have autism
3. I'm ugly yet meaning i wont have a girlfriend which will make 1. even worse

without god im even more lonely than i am

and plus i have nothing to be happy about either

i mised out on everything

for one is star wars

i never watched it before disney ruined it

i feel so empty
