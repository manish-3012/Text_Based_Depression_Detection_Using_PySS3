This happened moths ago, but I want to talk about it When I was watching YouTube on my switch of all things, I get a ad. It was talking about some state, and said something about the lines of this,"with social distancing, sanitizing and wearing masks, were doing this state the right way." That's it, that was all it was, and it pissed me off. The fact that you have to waist 15 seconds of my time to tell me that covid guidelines are being followed just goes to show how mad I can get. Why do you do this?
