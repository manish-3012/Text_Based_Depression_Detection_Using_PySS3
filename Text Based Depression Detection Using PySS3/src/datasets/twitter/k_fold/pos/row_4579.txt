Had a bull ant (Inchman) in my kitchen a couple weeks ago.  I treated him well. He feasted upon sugar and ham. I put him in a bowl of dirt and leaves and covered his throne with cling film. I wished him goodnight as I put him outside. In the morning I discovered he had escaped..   I wonder if he has spoken to his clan of the bounty he encountered, a promised land of sweet and meat.   I wonder if I shall ever see Glenn again, marching at the fore of his great and terrible army.  I hope we do not meet on the battlefield my old friend.
