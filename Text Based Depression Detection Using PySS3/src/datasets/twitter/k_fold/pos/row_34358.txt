I know No one on here gives a fuck but I don't care I just feel like i have to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell. I literally fucking hate life. No one gives a single fuck i could literally kill myself right now and no one would ever look back at it once. I've tried to make friends but literally none of them care. Literally  only one of my friends MIGHT care but it never feels like it. I'm honestly just tired of everything I'm done being blamed for everything and no one giving a fuck about how I feel
