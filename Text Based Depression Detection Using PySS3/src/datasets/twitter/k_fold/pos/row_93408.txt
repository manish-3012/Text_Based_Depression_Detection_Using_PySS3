I got left on read today and I feel good about it  Not some long story (i just finished typing/ranting and this was a LIE lol) but earlier today I got left on read and it felt really good for some reason. We had been talking for awhile and I had feelings for her but she didnt have any feelsings for me. We kinda stopped talking halfway through summer but as soon as school started we started hitting hitting each other up on snap again and we went back to snapping each other until 4 am and just talking about stuff. I hadnt really lost feelings for her but I wasnt really interested in dating her that much so it seemed cool. We kinda fell off again though real quick this time and she would never reply to me in the middle of the day despite the fact she as always on her phone (snapmap and just knowing her really) and she would reply only after 10 or 11 pm.

Last time i sent her a meme and she had seen my story around 10 minutes after i sent her the meme but she left me on delivered for over 23 or 24 hours. When she did reply the next day I didnt really feel like snapping her so i ended up replying like 6 hours later around 4 am. Surprisingly she ended up opening it in the early in the mid afternoon the next day and I got the notification that she was typing but she ended up leaving me on read. I dont really know why but Ive felt like Ive had a slight headache since school ended early and we started talking around a 8ish months ago, and when she first left me on read I felt like w o w but after around 2 minutes that never ending headache was gone and I had felt really good. I dont know why but its been a couple hours and for the first time in a long time I actually feel happy/dont have a headache.
