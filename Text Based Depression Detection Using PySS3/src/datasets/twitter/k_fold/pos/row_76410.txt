Do teachers worry about their students? Iâ€™ve been wondering recently if teachers even worry, get concerned or even care and give a fuck about their students? If so what students would they be worried about and why? Recently, a few of my teachers have been acting really weird around me. One of them who practically ignored my existence at school has begun constantly looking and staring at me in her class with a concerned look on her face which is just creeping me out! And then the other day when I had pulled an all-nighter for an assignment, and I was sleeping a bit in class and really struggling not to, another teacher who also used to totally ignore me came over to me and asked if the girl next to me was ok (because she was complaining about how tired she was) and then kept staring at me (she would never even look at me before) and again with a concerned look on her face. This has only been happening to me! Additionally, more of my teachers have started doing this to me and asking if I am ok. I have no clue why they are doing this especially because it seems to be only toward me. It makes me honestly feel uncomfortable and I have to fake a smile or say â€œyeah, Iâ€™m fineâ€ for them to stop or go away. Why are they doing this? And what couldâ€™ve caused them to..?
