It's hasn't been my best day. So turns out my family has to self-quarantine because someone in my house has corona. So i can't go to dance or school or anything. My parents aren't very fun when they're sick, so I got yelled at a lot. Then,  I lost 100 dollars in a bet. Then my favorite TV show made me sad and I was kind of a wreck. I can only say it's been better.
