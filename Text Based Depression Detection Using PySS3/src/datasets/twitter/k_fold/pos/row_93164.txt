I have to present a poem for english class, can you guys give suggestions on how i can improve my terrible poem?   

Poems are bad

It makes me mad

I feel so annoyed

That it doesn't spark joy

Why do I have to do this

So let me make a list

Of why poem is so bad 

Poems are bad 

Unlike my dad 

He makes sure I'm warm at night 

While this project kept me up all night

Poems are bad

'It's boring' I should add

It's making me sleep

I want to fall in a hole that is deep

Public speaking is not my thing

Why should I let a literature pull my strings

I'd rather be in science learning about the wonders of the universe and creations of God

I'd rather be in history learning about dead people and what they did 

I'd rather be in maths thinking about what I ate for lunch last week

Reading a poem will not help me in life 

So what is the point of this

Poem is bad 

Including this one

My rhymes fell apart

But oh boy am I glad, that this is over
