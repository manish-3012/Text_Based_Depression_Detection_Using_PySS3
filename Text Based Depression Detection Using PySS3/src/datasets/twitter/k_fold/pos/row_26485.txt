School made me realize how insecure I am After a while of slacking off from my classes(I had a load of homework and I was really stressed) I was browsing through youtube and discovered phycology youtube channels. Then later I watched a video called "7 signs your insecure" I was having a rough day, I keep on thinking about some deep stuff(I felt like I was kinda wasting my life and I'm not worthy of anythign[hard to explain]), I was feeling under the weather(this week) so why not. At the end of the video I realized just how insecure I really am(I can't even make friends who are boys(16F)).then I spent the night questioning myself and looking up stuff online and I realized how insecure i was in the past. I know that a lot of us are feeling the same way and everyone feels this at least once in their lives but I have never realized to the full extent how insecure I really am(I knew I was a little insecure). 

Whoever is reading this if your feeling the same way,just know your not alone. We can get through this together.
