My brother keeps calling me the â€œfâ€ word and a fat fuck or fat ass. He started call me this somewhere around 4 years ago but I didnâ€™t mind. He kept calling me the â€œfâ€ word or a fat fuck every single day until I moved into my moms house and thatâ€™s where I found peace. But, my dad forced me to move into his house again, and thatâ€™s where it all started again. I donâ€™t know if I can handle it anymore. Every time Iâ€™m with him, he puts me to my lowest levels and unlocks new levels of rage and sadness that I thought Iâ€™ve never feel. Is there anyway I can handle it or any advice you guys have?
