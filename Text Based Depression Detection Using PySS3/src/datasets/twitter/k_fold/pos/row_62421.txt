I'm tired of all these posts about gender and races and stuff! Can we just talk about normal teenager stuff instead of sex offenders? Also if you hate your gender, you will hate the other too as both genders have their problems, I really hope this will be the last post about this but I know it wont, so I just want to tell everyone who reads this to not post about stuff like that, and preferably not about beating cancer and stuff as people can just karmawhore out of that. Peace.
