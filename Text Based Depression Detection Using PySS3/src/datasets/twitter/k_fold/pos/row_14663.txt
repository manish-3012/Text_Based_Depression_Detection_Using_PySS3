So I was talking to my therapist, right? Then I was talking about how much I miss my best friend, Iâ€™ll call her Emmy. Emmy and I have been friends for almost a decade and she moved recently. Like about a year ago recently. My therapist said to me that what I was experiencing was similar to a heartbreak and losing a loved one. Istg Emmy is the one that I love and this did feel like heartbreak so my therapist wasnâ€™t that far off.
