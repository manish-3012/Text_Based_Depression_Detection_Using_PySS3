Between 16 and 18 I gained like 70+ lbs of muscle and there are honestly basically no benefits It's hard to get comfy, girls like skinny guys way more often, I can't reach my back for my life, I gotta eat so much, I break stuff accidentally, and it takes like 18 hours from my week to maintain

Kinda feels like it's for nothing. It feels healthier at 230 than sub-160, but it's not as nice as it seems by any means
