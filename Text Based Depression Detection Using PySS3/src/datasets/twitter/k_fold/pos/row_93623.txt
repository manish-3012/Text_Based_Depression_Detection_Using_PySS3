Hi, just dropping something off I needa say somewhere. Hi there. This might come across as a rant or like I'm depressed or some shit but that is not the case. 

Earlier today my insanely disorganized, un-functional had yet another argument. It's kinda driving me crazy cause nobody else really seems to care about anybody and just use the other people for their own benefit.

Now I'll admit I'm slightly at fault there but, I still cared about everyone. Yes I said cared. After today I had another one of those realizations asking myself why I was still apart of a group that didn't care about me? Well tbh I don't know. The only real, true friend I have ended up leaving the group, which is really just a discord server at this point. 

In doing so I was left completely alone with people who have really never cared about me the same way I cared about them. Seeing this hurt cause for 2 years I thought I had friends. 

I'm gonna be a senior this year and I am absolutely horrible at making friends. I don't really tell many people this but I have insane anxiety that I don't usually control. It kinda controls me. Which is why it was so devastating seeing none of these people actually cared for me, when I had tried so hard to be a person they could trust and love. 

I could get more into but at this point in time I'm feeling slightly better from saying what I did say. 

The reason I marked this as social is I wanna know if you guys have had similar experiences. Lmk :)
