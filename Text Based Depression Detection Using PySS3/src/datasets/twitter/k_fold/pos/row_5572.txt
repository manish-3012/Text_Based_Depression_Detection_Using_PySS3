Funny story my mom told me about the other day. So one time when my now 24 year old brother was in elementary or middle school his friends and him would bring legos to school the normal. One day his friend brings a lego toy gun the ones that shoot of the little circles and the school tries to suspend him for it needless to say parents arenâ€™t happy. Unknown to the school this kids fathers a NYPD detective so they call the parents and the kids father starts your yelling â€ARE YOU SERIOUS YOU CALLED ME FOR THIS.â€ His mother then walks out the room. Then all the sudden the mother hereâ€™s a loud BOOM and the father start yelling â€œTHIS IS A FUCKING GUN IM A POLICE OFFICER AND HE KNOWS WHAT A GUN IS.â€ needless to say my brothers friends father was a fucking savage.
