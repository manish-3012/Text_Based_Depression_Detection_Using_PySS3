don't do what my bf did. So, when I was 13 I had a new best friend, and I actually kinda liked her, she was amazing with me. She was the only person that talked to me on lunch breaks, would usually share homework and help me with history and I helped her with math. Things were going great, but she was always really physically close to me, she would rest her head on my shoulder, hug me pretty often, heck she was so close to me she would even cry knowing I would make things better.

so turns out, I thought she was telling me that she liked me in a romantic way, and I told her I liked her. I still believe this was a mistake.

she said she didn't like me back, and the next day she just wasn't doing the same things, we wouldn't have the same conversations, she didn't hug me, or even touch me for almost a year.

a year later she actually apologized for all of it, she said she felt nervous close to me and didn't know what to do, she still would kinda avoid my hugs and sometimes freak out if I tried hugging her because it made her nervous. even after her apologies I still struggle telling my emotions to others, because I think this will happen again.

tl;dr: my best friend was really close to me, I thought she actually liked me back and ruined our relationship for a couple of years.

also, sorry if you had a stroke reading this, english is not my first language.
