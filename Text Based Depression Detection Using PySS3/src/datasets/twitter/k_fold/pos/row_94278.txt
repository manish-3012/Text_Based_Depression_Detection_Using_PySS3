I LOVE POST MALONE!!!!ðŸ˜ŽðŸ–¤ anybody else? I just absolutely LOVE his songs! The beats, his voice, his lyrics, just everything! I lovee so many and I have a whole playlist with like 17 songs of his!! I absolutely love Goodbyes, Zack and Codeine, A Thousand Bad Times, Takin' Shots, I'm Gonna Be, just so many!!

I don't know anyone else from school who likes him from my friend group and I don't have anyone to just gush about and jam to his songs with ;(

ANYBODY INTERESTED IN BEING JAM BUDDIESS!?!? :D
