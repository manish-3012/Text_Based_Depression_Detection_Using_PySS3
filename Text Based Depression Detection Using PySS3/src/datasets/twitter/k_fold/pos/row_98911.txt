Asked my crush out. So today i told my crush, who is also my friend, about my feeling. she told me that she loves me just as a friend .  Tbh i don't feel bad at all i fell great. my feelings for her won't change but that doesn't mean i will break the friendship she will always be my friend and a great one too .

so all those fellow teens i just want to say that,  if your crush just likes you as a friend and not the way you do, do not break your bond with them  they have feelings too . understand them . cherish that friendship rather that breaking it 

PS: also if you love some one go ahead and tell them you might not get another chance or it would be just too late. life is not very big live every moment at fullest .
