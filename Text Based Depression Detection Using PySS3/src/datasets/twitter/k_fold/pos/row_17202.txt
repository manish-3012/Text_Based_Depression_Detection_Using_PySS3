Im fucked up. My entire life is fucked up. All thanks to the motherfucking corona I am currently in 8th grade of elementary school, which in my country is pre-last, but also the most important grade. 9th grade is just going over everything we've learned in elementary school and giving us time to prepare for the entrance exams to high school.

Back to the 8th grade i am currently in: my dad does not want to let me go to school because the cases of corona recently got notoriously high (technically, the record of daily cases is almost 6 times higher than america's average daily, which is 50k) and my government does not give a fuck.

I actually want to do my homework, i keep asking my classmates multiple times a day to send me everything they did in school, or at least if they wrote down some new notes, to take a pic of them and send them to me. All of them read my messages but nobody ever answers.

So here i am, in 8th, most important grade, with no way to find out whatever the fuck is going on in my school. I dont even know if we are gonna have online classes and if so, where are we supposed to go.

Im fucked up
