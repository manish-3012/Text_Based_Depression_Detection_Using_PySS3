How would you like to die? Personally i would love to die peacefully. Like I'm 85-86, sitting on my chair and i know that I don't have much time left. Then after some time or days i die because of heart attack. But i also want to once experience painful death like I'm going near railway lines, the train knock me out far away then after somehow walking to the street i get hit by a car. Then die in hospital
