Parents told me Iâ€™m never allowed to drink alcohol even after I turn 21 Iâ€™m barely not a teenager anymore but Iâ€™m still posting here cause Iâ€™m getting treated like one.

Anyways, I turn 21 soon and my parents told me Iâ€™m never allowed to drink alcohol. They even told my friend to call them if I tried to or went to a bar. As if my own friends would SNITCH on me. 

Iâ€™m in college and theyâ€™re so lucky Iâ€™m even waiting til Iâ€™m 21. 

End rant
