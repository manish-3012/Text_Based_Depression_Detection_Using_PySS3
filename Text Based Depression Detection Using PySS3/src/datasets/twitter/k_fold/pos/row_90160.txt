Iâ€™m going down a dark path right now My whole life me and my friends would always make fun of anime and instantly judge someone if they watched it. We deemed any person who enjoyed anime â€œweebs.â€ This has been my belief for my whole life but then, one fateful day, I watched Spirited Away. It was one of my favorite movies after I watched it. It conveyed so much more emotion and life than any American cartoon. After that I tried to refrain from watching anymore but I couldnâ€™t help myself Iâ€™ve watched a few Studio Ghibli films and Akira. Should I end all this madness or give in and keep watching?
