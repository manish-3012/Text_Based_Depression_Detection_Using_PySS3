Listen, guys, I don't mean to get political but... I have to get something off my chest I'm the kind of guy that says "Mmmmm, this is a tasty cheeseburger". And so what? People-- some people-- they have a problem with that guy. And so it gets political.

Listen, guys, I don't mean to hash it out right here. I really don't. But what some people think, and what others do and, maybe even more so, what some people *think* about what *those* people do, it's all a bunch of "hubbub". It just is. Empirical fact.

It can be shown. It has been shown. I could deliver it to you on a silver platter in 90 degree weather in the middle of San Antonio wearing a plaid skirt and the latest Hollister cologne, and no one would notice. I shaved my legs. No one noticed. They're not going to notice this, that's for sure.

42. That's the number of executive actions taken by the office (my office, some say) in the first week of--they call it "the management". I don't believe in this "management", as they say, only colloquially but, as we all know, in "good faith". Pfftt.

I'm the kind of guy that sits at the bus stop on a rainy day, waiting for chowder, and at the top of my lungs singing.... singing to *Beyonce*! But no one looks upon my shaft.  It is there. No one looks. And so what? People-- some people --they have a problem with that. And so it gets political.

Well guess what. This time "the people" is *me.* I have a problem with it. *I do.* It can be shown. It has been shown. I'll remove my trowsers, rip off my vest, tear my shirt in half like the Hulk and shriek your name to prove it. I could deliver it to you on a silver platter in 90 degree weather in the middle of San Antonio wearing *nothing* but the latest Hollister cologne, and what shards remain of my vest, and no one would notice.

And so it should be.
