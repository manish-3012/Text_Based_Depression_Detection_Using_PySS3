You won't believe what happened in my online class today. I have my online classes on Ms teams. Some guy was taking the class on his phone. The teacher disables student's mics to avoid disturbances so we have to ask questions in the chat until the lecture is over then we are allowed to use our mic. The guy using the phone was trying to ask questions but the auto correct on his phone was constantly changing ma'am to mama. This happened multiple times and the poor guy didn't even notice. I would post pictures of chat but its self post weekend
