Hey, you. Youâ€™re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.  

Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadnâ€™t been looking for you, I couldâ€™ve stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me â€” we should be here. Itâ€™s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.  

Ralof: Weâ€™re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.  

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!   

Lokir: And whatâ€™s wrong with him?  

Ralof: Watch your tongue! Youâ€™re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.  

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? Youâ€™re the leader of the rebellion. But if they captured youâ€¦ Oh gods, where are they taking us?  

Ralof: I donâ€™t know where weâ€™re going, but Sovngarde awaits.  

Lokir: No, this canâ€™t be happening. This isnâ€™t happening.  

Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?  

Lokir: Why do you care?  

Ralof: A Nordâ€™s last thoughts should be of home.  

Lokir: Rorikstead. Iâ€™mâ€¦Iâ€™m from Rorikstead.  

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!  

General Tullius: Good. Letâ€™s get this over with.  

Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.  

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.  This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funnyâ€¦when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe. 

Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?  

Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub.  

Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.  

Torolf: Inside the house. Now.
