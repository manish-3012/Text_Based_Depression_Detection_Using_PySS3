Age gap? What do I do? Theres this girl. She's 14, I'm 17. I feel like if I ha e want chance at getting a girlfriend, it's her. I have known her for 5 years now because she's a very good friend of my sisters. I always thought of her like another sister but now she's... developed more and I'm around that age and like she's one of the very few girls that I genuinely find attractive. 

And I also know she used to be into me, so she doesn't find me unattractive. As far as our interests go we are both very into anime and I'm a big gamer, she would probably be into gaming if she could. Tbh, all i look for in a girlfriend is someone who likes what I like, and it's right there fucking in front of me with the addition of also being very attractive, but I dont know if that's alright since shes younger.

Theres also the possibility this is all in my head, she has no feelings for me and if I stop thinking about it I won't have any for her. The more I think about her the more I can think of reasons why I should or shouldn't do something. My mind is both hoping something happens but simultaneously thinking of reasons why it's no big deal if nothing does.
