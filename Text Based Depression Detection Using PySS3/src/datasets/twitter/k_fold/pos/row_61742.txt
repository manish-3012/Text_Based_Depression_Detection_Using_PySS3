Idk if itâ€™s a fruit it looks feels and tastes like a piece of wood itâ€™s kinda white and itâ€™s usually around a kilo each ( of weight) like 2.2 pounds ...Iâ€™m re re watching my hero academia for the 27 time ...I have been eating ice cream as breakfast for the past 3 months the firs month is â€œok â€œ it was like the best part of my day so kinda fun I guess , the second month it kinda gets boring, now itâ€™s just disgusting I kinda wanna puke every time I smell ice cream but I still donâ€™t wanna stop eating it u know *(side note * ice cream for diner NEVER gets boring or gross ) , , I have being watching weird movies , go watch emo the musical in Netflix, my fav song from it is could Jesus be an emo , and give up , ,, Iâ€™ve also watched teen beach movie.. for some reason.... ..
