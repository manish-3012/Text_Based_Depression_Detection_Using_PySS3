Happened a few days ago decided to post it here So I had a dream where I was a master swordsman and could control metal in the earth (dreams are ducking weird) and I was slaughtering an army like cutting people in half and shit I had no control but I just watched as I cut down other people with sword and daggers all charging me and yâ€™know the part that got me? I enjoyed it, every last minute. something wrong with me? Does it mean something? It was almost therapeutic I used to do boxing before Covid to relieve stress could this be something similar? Or am I just a fucking psycho? 


Will delete in a min probably
