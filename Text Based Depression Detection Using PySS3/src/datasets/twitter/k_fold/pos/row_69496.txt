Accidental 911 call I accidentally called emergency when going to shut off my phone while half asleep. I hung up immediately, and I did not receive a call back. It has been exactly an hour and nobody has showed up, texted, or called back. Does that mean Iâ€™m in the clear and can go to bed? I have anxiety and I want to be out at ease that I can sleep and nothing bad will happen.

And yes I know for next time I shouldnâ€™t hang up immediately and instead say it was a wrong number. I just panicked and I wasnâ€™t even on for a second.
