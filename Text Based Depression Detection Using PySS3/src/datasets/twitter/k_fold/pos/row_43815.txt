I hate working retail I've only been here for a month and a half, but here's a list of things people have said:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Man: "Do you guys still sell China Lily soya sauce?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "Yes, is the shelf empty?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "I haven't checked, I was just making sure that there wasn't embargoes on it because it's from China and has the Virus in it."  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \*dies inside\*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: \*reorganises store because it was disorganised and corporate told us to\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "What makes you think you have the right to move everything around in this store without consulting your shoppers? I need to speak with your manager."  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: \*explains why the store was reorganised\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "This is ridiculous. I am a senior citizen, and I've been coming here for years. Put everything back, or I'm not returning! You have no right to move everything around. I want to speak with *your* boss."  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: "I can give you his email address"  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "I don't want his fucking email, I want to talk on the phone! If you won't give it to me, I'll just find it my damn self." \*leaves\*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lady: "Excuse me, where is the flour?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "I'm not sure, but I can-"  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "Well, get off your ass and help me find it!"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Man: \*brings in own bags\* (completely fine, we're just not allowed to fill them because COVID)  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \*puts items beside bag so he can start bagging\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "Why aren't you putting the stuff in the bag?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "Sorry, as per store policy, I'm not allowed to put items in bags brought from home."  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "Ugh, always something. You kids these days are so damn lazy, you can't even put some shit in a damn bag. Back in my day, we respected our elders."  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "Sorry. I can give you plastic bags and I'll bag them for you. I just can't bag them in your own bags."  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "Always excuses. Lazy-ass kids, don't even know how to pack a fucking grocery bag. I'll do it myself, but just know that I'm ***not*** happy about it." \*packs bags and leaves\*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Man: \*buys groceries\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "That'll be 122,90$"  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "No, 122,75$."  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "Yes, but there is a five cent charge per bag, which adds another fifteen cents."  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "What kind of communist shit is this, charging for plastic bags. Probably another scheme from those carbon-tax idiots. I don't believe this, let me talk to your manager."  
&gt;  
&gt;Manager: \*explains that it is provincial law that plastic bags have a five cent carbon tax\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Man: "All you damn commies, charging more just to help the environment, what a joke! Don't come crying to me when the economy fails because you want more minimum wage for bagging my groceries! But, of course, your five cent bags will change all of that won't it! Damn hippies, they're ruining this country!" \*rants for another five minutes about communism, the environment, and hippies\*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: \*rings lady through\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "Did you notice that there was no animal products in my order? I'm vegan."  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "Cool"  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "Did you know that veganism is the healthiest diet, and that it is far less savage and cruel than eating meat?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: "No, cool"  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "Would you consider converting to veganism to have a better life? It will end animal cruelty forever if everyone does."  
&gt;  
&gt;Me (who hunts, helps at a beef farm with slaughter and butchering, and is going to school to be a butcher): \*lying\*"Maybe"  
&gt;  
&gt;Lady: "Great!" \*pays and leaves\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Co-worker: "That's just Bryttneigh(fake name). She comes here every week, you'll get used to her."
