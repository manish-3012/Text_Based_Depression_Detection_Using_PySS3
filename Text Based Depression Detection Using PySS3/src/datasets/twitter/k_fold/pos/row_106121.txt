Pretty damn sure the free awards scale with how much money you have spent on reddit coins. I have one account that has spent nothing (this one) that gets no awards. I have another where I bought a bunch of coins and I get a ton of free awards. Also, it makes sense from a monetary standpoint to target the people that you know are willing to spend money.  
Have a nice day.
