A 20 paragraph essay for my English class on why recycling is important and different ways we can improve our planet's current environment from judicial to household methods. This post is actually about how I finally got a girlfriend, I just know people hate seeing "I gOt A gIrLfRiEnD" in their feed, so I thought I'd make the title as boring as possible so no one thinks I'm posting this for karma. 


We've been dating for about a month, and I'm just proud of myself so yeah. :)
