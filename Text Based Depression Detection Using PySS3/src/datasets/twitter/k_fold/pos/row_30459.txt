When your mom makes fun of you for having an interest for the 78th time Basically Iâ€™ve been learning Japanese because I like Japanese music and I thought it would be nice having something to distract me from all the shit thatâ€™s been happening lately. 

My mom walked in on my practicing writing and asked what was I doing. I said I was writing simple sentences so Iâ€™d remember their structure. She dead ass said â€œOh well we are having chinese food tonight so will that be ok even though youâ€™re in a Japanese work environment?â€

I just replied â€œvery funny.â€ She does this a lot. When the virus hit she asked me if I wanted to catch it because it was chinese. Just because someone likes learning a language does not mean they are obsessed with everything about it and hate other countries because of it. 

God it gets so annoying.
