I think losing weight will be way easier once I move out - I won't be as depressed so working out will be more motivating. And working out with minimal clothes on sounds amazing but too uncomfortable to do that with people around.

- No mom randomly bringing me a lot of food

- More things to do so I won't eat as much 

- I can do drugs which can help to lose weight

- I'll be able to transition and take female hormones which is supposed to redistribute your fat to butt etc and away from belly
