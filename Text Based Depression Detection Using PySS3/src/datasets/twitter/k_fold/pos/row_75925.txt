Cops are fucking bad at teaching about drugs in schools Don't get me wrong, drugs can and will mess you up especially at a young age.

Cops are not addiction specialists.
Their goal is to scare, not to inform. 
Just saying "ughu you can get addicted very fast" or showing scary images does not help anyone or prevent anything.

We should be more informed about physical/psychological addiction, physical, psychological and social harm, behavior changes...

Also we should learn more about how to prevent bad habits or help drug users find alternatives.



I'm just a french high schooler so I apologize for my bad english, also I assume that it's nearly the same in most countries so tell me if i'm wrong.
Take care of you &lt;3
