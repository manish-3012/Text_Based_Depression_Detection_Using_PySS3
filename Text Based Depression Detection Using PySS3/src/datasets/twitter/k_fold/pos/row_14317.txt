A gift from my dads friend. My dad got it from his friend to give to me. He told me to close my eyes and put my hands out. I knew something wasnâ€™t quite right. Then I feel something soft and about 10 pounds. I open my eyes and see a severed deer head in my hands. It was still warm. Going to put it in a bucket of water.
