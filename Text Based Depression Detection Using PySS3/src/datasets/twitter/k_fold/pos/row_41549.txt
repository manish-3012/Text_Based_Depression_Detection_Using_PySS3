A kid dressed up as a fortnite skin shit in the corner at my work tonight I worked a closing shift tonight and about 30 minutes till close a family walks in. The kid in question looked about 7 years old. When the family was walking out he hung back for a bit took a shit in the corner and caught up to them. A coworker found it told us and we checked cameras. That's how Ik it was him. Luckily I didn't have to clean it and I thought it was funny that he was dressed as a fortnite skin. Other than that it was actually a pretty good night.
