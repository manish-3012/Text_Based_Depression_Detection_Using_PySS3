I'm being sad so imma rant feel free to pass lol Welp im fucking dumb. This like my 3rd rant on her this week and like how pathetic is that. But everyone else i have seems to not care or the thought of talking them makes me sick to my core. So let's just continue here (check my acc for the background info ig if u want)I'm still dealing with post breakup shit. I mean thats pretty expected since its been less than a week but I never thought it would hurt this bad, I've had break ups before but never in my life has it felt like someone practically shoved they're hand into my rib cage and ripped my heart out. Cliche ik but there's no other way to explain it. Everytime i see anything that even slightly reminds me of him I just start tearing up. And the issue with my parents is making it even harder bc I can't even be sad around them so its only in those rare moments of privacy that I can actually let myself grief. So yh that sucks

My parents and older brother have been urging me to start looking for a therapist while my doctors attempts to refer me to a clinic but I've been too scared to. The thought of being put in an inpatient program keeps freaking me out. And the idea of having to talk to a complete stranger who probably only wants money isn't helping either. But what can I do

I feel like im at my witts end. I've had no energy. Even the simplest of things makes me wanna break down and cry. I have test prep and so much missing work I gotta do but it just all feels too much. Idk what to abt it lol

Alr thats all if u read this all thank you, i hope u have a great day
