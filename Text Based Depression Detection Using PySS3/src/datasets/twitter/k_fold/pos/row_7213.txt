So I Don't Get Any Twitch Ad So well, I was getting a lot of ads on twitch and very repetitive ones, but one day it stopped. And even if the streams plays a comercial my phone won't load it. Is my phone that bad that doesn't load ads? 
I reinstalled the app and i don't get any ad so I guess is a Mistery
