I need someone to vent to irl. I have plenty of people to vent to online. But there's a huge difference between typing something/saying through an app, and actually speaking to someone in person... at least to me. And I really need to talk to someone about what's going on in my personal life. But none of my real life friends are at school,  they're doing it online. So I've got nobody. Ugh.
