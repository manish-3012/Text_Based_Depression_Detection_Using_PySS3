I canâ€™t trust sad posts Lately, Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of posts about family, friends, pets, etc. getting injured or passing away. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I feel really bad for them but I just canâ€™t bring myself to up or award them. I have that little voice that tells me what if theyâ€™re just a karma whore or something. I was just wondering if others felt the same way or if it was just me.
