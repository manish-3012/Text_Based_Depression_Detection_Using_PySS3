Interesting day if I do as so myselfâ€¦ So today, I went to go check on a girl that I had a crush on last year who ghosted me completely after telling her I liked her. She was nice to me before and I found out she had a boyfriend the hard way. But once I told her, everything went to shit I found her IG that was publicized and had 3 pictures up; followed her, and she removed me as a follower, privatized her account, and took down the 2 photos. I follow request and she accepts. Then, requests to follow me. I come back and she just completely blocks me. I can tell by using my 2nd account for Tech, send her profile account to me via DM, and if it says â€œcannot find userâ€, Iâ€™ve definitely been blocked. 

Funny thing is that I followed her from the beginning. Lmaoo
