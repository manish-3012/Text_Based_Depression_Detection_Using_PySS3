Why does my mom constantly have to put me down and make me feel like shit? I'm wanting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday and she keeps calling the idea and me trashy and says I'm gonna regret it.

She constantly tells me I'm too skinny and don't eat enough ( I do eat, my weight is normal)


I remember I just wanted to go down the street with my friend to get mac Donald's and she said "you're going out like that? You don't even have makeup on "

And than she constantly picked on me for having a little bit of acne and said it was my fault because of my diet and because I don't take care of myself properly ( even though my dermatologist said it's just genetic and hormonal)

The thing I hate the most is when I call her out for it she puts on this sad puppy voice and acts regretful but than will immediately go back to treating me like shit
