My mom: your sister has bad anxiety, stop predicting her movements and let her yell at me everyday for stupid reasons Also my mom: if you talk about your feelings Iâ€™m gonna send you to a mental hospital without a second thought, and donâ€™t forget youâ€™re a disappointment who doesnâ€™t even attempt to understand the world because you have bad grades with a high iq. Stop complaining, Iâ€™ll take my anger about your sister out on whoever is around at the time and remind you of every little thing you did wrong on a regular basis. Your sister deserves more than you even though she used to be really abusive and caused a lot of family damage because she has straight Aâ€™s.
