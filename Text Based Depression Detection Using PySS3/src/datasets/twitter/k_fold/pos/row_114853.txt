Is it okay because its fictional? I really dont know where else to put this so I'll do it here.

Ships in fandoms, I'm talking about the ships that involve inc*st and p3dophillia. From what I've seen. People who ship that use the same arguement "Its okay, its fictional." In my opinion, even if its fictional doesnt mean it's okay. It's also like you're supporting it. 

It's fine if you disagree, but please dont down vote me? I just want to hear others opinions.
