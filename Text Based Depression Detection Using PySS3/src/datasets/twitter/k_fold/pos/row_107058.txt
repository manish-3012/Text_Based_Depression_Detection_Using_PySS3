Anyone want to help me out by joining my dcord server? I had to restart it from scratch for the 2nd time now, so there aren't many people in it. Though the number of people is low, the quality of the people is high.

I might go into the vc in a little while, so you could join if you would like.

If anyone is interested tell me, and I'll dm you the link, or you can go to the sub: r/TheUnitedStatesOfChat
