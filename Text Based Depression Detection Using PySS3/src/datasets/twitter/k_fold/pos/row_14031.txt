I think I might be making progress I used to go to the gym, but I haven't been since Corona came and the gyms closed. So I decided that I'd do exercises at home, all summer I didn't have time because of my internship, but the past 3 weeks I've been busy again and I think I'm actually making progress. Yesterday it seemed like my arms were bigger and it seems like I'm losing weight and getting a little starting shape of abs. I'm a long way from a sixpack but I'm getting somewhere.
