Around 3 years ago i found something super interesting So around 3 years ago, i was out with my friends talkin and walkin, and i stumble upon something that looked like a car remote but there was a ribbon cable coming of of it and it connected into a small keypad and maybe a custom written eeprom ( had ports for programming and looked like a eeprom), so naturally i press the unlock button and

two of the cars infront of me get unlocked, so i press another number and another cars door unlocked, so i pressed another button and this made 6 cars alarm go off.

what was that thing ?

and why did i listen to my friend to throw it away ? ( i shouldnt have done that )

it probably was used by a thief or sth.

what do you think it was ?
