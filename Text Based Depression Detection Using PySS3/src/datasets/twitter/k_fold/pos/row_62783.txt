California should have the same relationship with the us as the Marshall Islands or Palau Basically be our own nation but have open borders so anyone from the us or California can live, work, and study in the other, free trade, and the United States is responsible for our defense

We conduct our own diplomatic relations, we still provide over 40% of the countryâ€™s fruit, and the rest of the country still gives us water, Amtrak and the usps would still operate, weâ€™re just not controlled by the federal government as much anymore, basically every federal service except passports would be the same and if your a citizen of the us right now in California then they canâ€™t take that away from you so you would still be able to get a us passport
