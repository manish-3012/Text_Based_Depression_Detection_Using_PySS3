Is this other people too? Ok so Iâ€™ve been bullied so much and insulted so much that I no longer care when I get insulted. Like people will say things like â€œyouâ€™re really annoyingâ€ or â€œyouâ€™re so stupid lmaoâ€ or â€œbruh why are you talking to meâ€ just to my face and I no longer care. I mean I do care about what they say but Iâ€™ve normalized it. Itâ€™s gotten to a point where if someone compliments me on ANYTHING i think they are being sarcastic cuz Iâ€™m so used to being bullied. Idk is this just me?
