This isnâ€™t a joke I need help: am I slowly dying? Like I have stopped eating recently, cry a lot, panic attack when study, temptation to self harm, etc (plz help. This is a repost bc ppl hated other) What should I do? I have I irl friend and literally just watch jojo thatâ€™s all that makes me smile. Anyone know anything? A solution? Thanks
