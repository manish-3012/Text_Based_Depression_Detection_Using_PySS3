Iâ€™m going to my dream school and I donâ€™t think I have ever felt more depressed in my life. I donâ€™t really care if this drowns in the posts of new, but yeah, title just says it all. I feel myself constantly comparing the school iâ€™m going to with everyone elseâ€™s schools, I have no motivation to continue keeping up my grades, and I feel like my entire high school career has been so fucking boring. I rarely went to partyâ€™s (certainly not any big ones), never kissed anyone or had a girlfriend before, didnâ€™t push myself hard enough when I wanted to work out (although Iâ€™m trying to get back into it lol). I feel like my friends are growing farther and farther away from me. I always thought I was pretty smart, but lately it just feels like people are getting farther and farther ahead of me. I donâ€™t know, it just really feels pointless to wake up in the morning these days. 

Yeah, sorry for the pity post, but I just wanted to vent for a second. Thanks.
