I keep surpassing Lucas sport edition! Lucas: "Sis, I played football when I was younger. I wasn't the best, but I had a lot of goals. Sometimes one, two or three, three times very often! I wasn't the best, but I could do it!"

Me: "Three goals in one match? That's nothing man!"

Lucas: "Why not?"

Me: **"I scored twenty goals in one half! One half! Forty goals in one match!"**

Lucas: "Sis..."

Me: **"I scored header, volley, all on my bare feet Lucas!"**

Lucas: "Chill..."

Me: **"I even scored with my heel. I scored every time! I scored more often than Messy!"**
