why canâ€™t i respond to texts like a normal person lmao i have no idea whatâ€™s wrong with me. iâ€™ll get a text from a friend that i defffinitely donâ€™t dislike and i just donâ€™t want to answer. itâ€™s like a feeling of dread. so i leave it until i do and by then itâ€™s a couple days later. i feel bad about it but i donâ€™t know why i do it and i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m so flakey.
