God Iâ€™m sick of shittt I was looking forward to this weekend as I could finally finish my really damn stressful assignment. Then APPARENTLY I have to go to my relativeâ€™s. Okok thatâ€™s annoying I can handle that for a night, as they said. After a tiring day we go to sleep there. I wake up. Having another tiring day looking after their 1 and 3 year old very loud children. It is now that night. Apparently my dad just DECIDED that he felt like not going tonight and going tomorrow. So Iâ€™m really fucking tired, got little children screaming in my ears, I was looking forward to getting a break from this tonight finally as I would be heading home, aaaaand Iâ€™ve got half a day to do a super stressful assignment. Oh and also I have to have dinner soon. I have a weird issue where it can be very difficult for me to eat food depending on the environment I eat it in, its hard to explain. So because of that Iâ€™ve been mostly starving myself here because here is a VERY bad environment for me. But now my aunt has already made my dinner so avoiding that would be really selfish so Iâ€™ve got to get through this. God help me lmao istg. Sorry for the long ass rant I just needed to vent somewhere.
