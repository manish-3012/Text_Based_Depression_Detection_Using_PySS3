Does anyone know how kissing feels like? If you know how it feels like, feel free to post your emotions about it or the story of your first kiss. I'm just curious whether it's really a good thing or completely overvalued. Thanks for discussing the topic here!

In case you can't contribute to the topic, stay here anyways, have an imaginary cookie ðŸª and tell me anything else you'd like to.

However, have a nice day and stay hydrated, guys, gals and non-binary pals!
