Iâ€™m kinda concerned for my friend So they randomly left during class(teacher told them they where being picked up or something), I checked the snapmap because me and my friends where bored and where looking at snaps in weird places (like north sentinel islands) and noticed they where in the hospital. Then we talked on Snapchat a bit but they randomly havenâ€™t been online since then.

Am I just overreacting?
