Webtoon Rant; Skip if you don't care/don't know  

Hi hello yes how are you today we're talking about Webtoon.

An annoying thing I've noticed is that people who use Webtoon seem to read more webtoons with "Anime" styles. Yeah ok I know there are tons of exceptions like Blue chair, safely endangered, How to love and so many more. However, when it comes to a lot of canvas stuff, have a look and try and sort by popularity. It's all styled like anime and styles like that.

I may just be a salty asshole who is pissed who can't draw anime, but I have noticed some serious bs.

Here, have a look at these two webtoons:

The top webtoon has 6 episodes. 5 of them just have a single still jpg with a creators note. The one episode with actual content has like 4 panels, ends incredibly abruptly and isn't even finished. It's literally just sketched outlines. The thumbnails for each episode are also all the same. Terrible upload schedule: 2 in april. 2 in may. 2 in August. The artists don't even mention or apologise for the unexpected hiatuses. It also happens that the authors were depicted as 2 anime girls. Simping? Maybe I'm just salty? Anyway, have some stats.

Now the bottom webtoon has 22 episodes. The first few episodes were pretty short, but soon they were in the 20ish panel range. It had actual effort put into it, and was set in a cartoonish style. Each thumbnail for all the episode was unique. Used to have daily uploads, but eventually started to bridge episodes further and further. Author however continuously apologised for the unexpected hiatuses and tried to make up for it.
