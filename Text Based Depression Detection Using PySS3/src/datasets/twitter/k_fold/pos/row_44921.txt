It's so fucking weird how so many straight guys be like: it's not gay to realize men are so hot!! 

Like it's not gay or straight to realize the fact that it is indeed definitely possible for people in the world to be hot. But when you go out of your way to specifically talk about certain guys and like definitely want to fuck them, "if you were gay" then it's definitely 100% gay. Any attraction to guys as a guy is gay and we gotta stop thinking that's a bad thing. But it's not a 100% straight thing.
