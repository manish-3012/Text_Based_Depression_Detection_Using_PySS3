I have no idea what to do now :/ so there is a girl that i like but i think i was too nice. my problem is that i like to give compliments but i hate to receive them. we talked for 4 days and i rly liked her but then out of a sudden we just stopped. 1-2 weeks later we met up and it was fun bcs we laughed a lot. now im thinking almost every single day about her and im kinda split in half. one part wants to be with her but the other one thinks its better to forget her.
