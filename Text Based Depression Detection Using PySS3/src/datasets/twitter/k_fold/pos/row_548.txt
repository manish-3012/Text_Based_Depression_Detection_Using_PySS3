I literally cannot stop laughing. In my public speaking class, we were given an assignment to write a speech over any topic that we wanted, as long as it was at least 8 minutes long. On the day of the presentation, she called up the first person, and he walked up onto the stage, and I kid you not, this was his opening line:

â€œWhat makes Shrek such an amazing movie?â€

THEN HE PRECEDED TO DO AN 11 MINUTE SPEECH ABOUT WHY SHREK WAS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE. I am literally dying. Like you couldâ€™ve done your speech over anything and you did it over the financial and cultural success of Shrek. You have my respect.
