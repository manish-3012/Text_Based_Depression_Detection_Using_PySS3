STOP Saying America is a shit country. STOP Saying that America is a shit country. Your out of your mind if you think weâ€™re the most racist country. Ive never seen a immigrant talk shit about America and there is a reason for that. They came from a shit hole country where running water was deemed as success and the sound of a bomb going off became normal. If you live in America you are privileged and have no reason that you canâ€™t become successful. There is no systemic racism that is stoping you from becoming successful. If you work 40hrs a week and are poor you have no right to talk shit about billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos who started there own company and work 120hrs a week living off of ramen. Even now that there billionaires they work 80hrs a week.
