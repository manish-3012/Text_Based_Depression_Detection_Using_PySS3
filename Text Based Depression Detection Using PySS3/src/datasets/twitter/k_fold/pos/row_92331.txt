It's 1AM but I won't be able to sleep without crying out to a bunch of strangers who have better things to worry about than a teenaged girl hating herself. I've never been good at poetry. Sorry. Every time I take a breath its like a tidal wave of emotion crashing over me


How could you just tell me to breathe, to relax, when every time I try my lungs catch fire and refuse to take that breath


"Its quiet" you say on the car ride home after an argument held in public. 


It's quiet to you but life is a constant ringing, an eternal scream in my ears


Every movement takes up more energy than my body allows me to use


Why are you tired? You have so much energy saved up in pounds of pointless weight


An endless cycle of not having the energy to move and putting on weight, weight that could be used in getting me out of bed


Why am i so sad? There's plenty of good in your life, you are loved, and yet you still tell me it's a lie


Chemical imbalances ruining my life, no need to get hooked on drugs when you already fuck me up enough


You told me to die then pulled me back the last second, saying you were scared and then proceeding to call me a worthless pile of shit for thinking about doing that to my friends


I have no future because of you. You've taken all my talent and thrown it down the drain, I can't do math past a 7th grade level because you didn't want to try.


Pass the blame to another all you'd like. The longer you push it the more it hurts when it snaps back at you, screaming at you that it's your own fault.


It's my own fault
