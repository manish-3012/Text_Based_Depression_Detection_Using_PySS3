You can't really call believing in a religion 'stupid'. I'm an atheist myself, but I have seen a lot of people, especially in communites like this, attack people simply for their beliefs. What I mean is that many people here spontaneaously associate religion with sheer ignorance and strict sectarianism, without knowing what religion really is about.

Form how I see it, religion is not simply believing in a higher power from which we all originate, but rather a pattern of thoughts concerning existentialism, morals, culture among with many more.

If you were to grow up with the bible as your main source for everything, you would likely believe it. Same with the qur'an. Most belief system claim themselves to be right, so believing in a religion isn't more stupid than believing in anything else.

I'd like to say this again, I don't believe in any religion, but some people are just straight up cunts when it comes to people believing in something else than themselves. This goes for people within religions too.
