I don't know what to do and I'm scared that I'll screw something up Me (M) and my bestie (F) are really close, she's said herself that she trusts me the most out of anyone she knows she said she loves me, and I'm one of her exes may I clarify, she's just asked me to ask her crush out for her, and I did since she's too shy, he's said "let me get to know her more first and it would be a yes", but I know feel bad for him, he's also one of my best friends, but.. I like her aswell and she knows, and I think that she's been playing with my heart strings to get what she wants, I don't honestly know and I need some outside help
