High school musical I watched a small fragment from the first movie while eating diner and I am now watching the second movie with my sister. The songs are very catchy and the movie characters are very melodramatic which I usually donâ€™t enjoy, but it suits these movie really well due to the musical like style. Please tell me Iâ€™m not the only teenage male who enjoys the movies and the songs...
