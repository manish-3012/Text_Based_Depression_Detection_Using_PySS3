This world can burn to the ground  I think I just destroyed the relationship I had with the love of my life, with my 1 in a million, I hate myself soo fucking much I want to die, why I've to be so stupid, why do I ruin everything good in my life...
 I destroyed paradise and now I feel like the most lonely person in the universe. In this horrible world where people are seeking pleasure and ignoring meaning. I'm so sick of having people who pretend to have compassion for my problems and for me, i'd rather they insult me so i have an excuse to release my anger on them.

But you probably don't care. Btw fuck BLM, abortion is murder, divorce is a horrible thing and it's unfair for men, Feminism  is sexist, comunism does not work, free healthcare is a stupid idea, and "bieng an independent person" when you're 30+ just means that no man or girl can put up with your bullshit. 

Bye and fuck youðŸ™‚
