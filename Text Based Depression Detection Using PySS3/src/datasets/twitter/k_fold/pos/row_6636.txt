I miss March quarantine Am I the only one who really misses March Quarantine from last year?

I had so much fun with it, from playing Minecraft, GTA V, or Cod with the boys to binge watching Netflix to getting your sleep schedule absolutely fucked to spending one day of the week to get your weeks assignments done to just talking to the boys on playstation.

It was fun. 

Now do yâ€™all think we might be getting another quarantine soon with these new strains especially with the one from the U.K?
