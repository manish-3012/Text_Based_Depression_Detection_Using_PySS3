Im scared My parents just had a huge fight

So first of all my mom takes my dad shopping and it was supposed to take 1 hour, but it took them 3 so my dad was already mad about that, during their shopping trip my dad tells my sister to put something in the freezer, she puts some things in the freezer that werent what my dad told her. They come back with cinnamon rolls and my dad explodes as he sees the things he asked for were unfrozen and probably will have no use anymore, my dad starts yelling and my sister starts crying, she leaves then my mom and dad start arguing about how my dad is selfish and how she has maintained him when he had no job and my dad stays silent, seconds later my mom says she will divorce him if something similar happens and then i start crying, i finish doing the dishes and then leave to my room, my mom comes and starts crying with me 30 seconds later my dad comes and tells us that we have to help him and do things when we are supposed to do and says stuff like we never help at the kitchen and my mom says that she works and all that, then we keep crying and my mom is kinda heating up things at the end by saying you couldâ€™ve gone to jail for what you did, and then my dad replies then do it, and at that moment i just collapse i start yelling and crying to pls stop fighting my dad is sitting next to me and my mom just leaves, idk what to do im scared thinking that something like this can happen again and they could get divorced im just sad in bed and scared idk what to do. Someone pls send advice
