FUCKING HELL LAZY ASS BITCH DON'T FUCKING JOIN A COMPETITIVE GYM CLASS IF YOU ARNT GONNA TRY!! I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE 2v2 TOURNAMENT WHO GOT THE LAZY GUY! 

HE NEVER RAN, NEVER GUARDED, NEVER PASSED, NEVER GOT A POINT, NEVER GOT A REBOUND, NEVER GOT MY PASS! ALL CAUSE HE DIDNT FEEL LIKE TRYING! 

WE LOST BOTH GAMES AND WERE THE FIRST TEAM OUT CAUSE HE DIDNT TRY WORTH SHIT! 

If it's a fair loss, fine, they played better and deserve the win. But when I'm the only one trying, let alone playing I'm gonna be a little pissed. It's a competitive gym class for a reason. Don't fucking join if you're gonna sit there the whole time. That's what fit for life is for.
