Equal Rights Equal Fights So the phrase â€œequal rights, equal fightâ€ is used satirically. But I kinda mean it here. If a dude is being an all around creep and stuff like that to girl, and she defends herself and society doesnâ€™t  think twice. But if a girl hits/slaps etc. a guy and he makes one move to defend himself, everyone in the immediate radius of the conflict tackles the guy and he ends up with charges. It makes me sick. Iâ€™m no MRA but câ€™mon... anyone with more then 4 brain cells can see the issue here. Sorry if something similar has been posted before, but just wanted to get it off my mind.
We sure do live in a society.
