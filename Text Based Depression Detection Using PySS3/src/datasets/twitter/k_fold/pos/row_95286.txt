I'm very depressed now So my school emailed me saying I have to stay off until the 16th and self isolate again last time this happened I was so lonely and couldn't see my friends and now I have to do it again Why me why is it me again it's happened already I want to see my friends but Covid is just like F#ck ur friends ur not seeing them. It's worse that my friends are the ones that help me whenever I start to breakdown and this is just going to break me down even more F#ck 2020
