Help canâ€™t sign into Steam I canâ€™t ask for Steam help on r/Steam so Iâ€™m doing it here because fuck them

Anyway, changed my password to the exact thing four times, Steam confirms it to be the right password because it sends me to the sign in screen, sign in with that password, says Iâ€™m doing it incorrectly, despite putting in the username and password correctly. Please help I have like 100 dollars worth of games and like 50 dollars worth of DLC with about 2 years of progress on here and I donâ€™t want to be locked out
