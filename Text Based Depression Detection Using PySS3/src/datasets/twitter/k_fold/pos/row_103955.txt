My (19) older sister got stood up by her only "friend" Im ready to punch a b#tch. So my older sister (19) is autistic and has very little friends and shes sensitive. Her and her mate maria decided to meet in the town yesterday but maria moved it for today last minute because she 'was busy' and today my sis is waiting for maria at the town, she was supposed to arrive at 2. Its now 2:38 and my sis still waiting. A while ago her and maria had a problem (maria was abusing alcohol) and my sister befriended her again because her only other 2 friends are engaged and have a KID.
