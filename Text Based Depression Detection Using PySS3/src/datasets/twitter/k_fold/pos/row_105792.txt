Happy Labor Day Happy Labor Day fellow teenagers! While other people are relaxing and enjoying the day off, I have to go to school. My school is doing a hybrid schedule where we go to school for two days and then we do online the rest of the week. So instead of giving us today off, we have to go to school. They say we have Wednesday off, but that is useless since I donâ€™t even go to school that day and only ever really have 2 hours of online work. Anyways, have a nice day!
