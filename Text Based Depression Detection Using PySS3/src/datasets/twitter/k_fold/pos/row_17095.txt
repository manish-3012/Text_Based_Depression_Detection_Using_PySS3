Well I guess my days of cheating on math tests are overðŸ’© So my school has been online most of the year (except a few weeks in November) but closed down again bc of rising cases. I'm supposed to go back the (20th?) Of January and ngl I have been using connects q &amp; for a lot of my assignments and tests (yes ik it's bad). But oh well I guess, wish me luck
