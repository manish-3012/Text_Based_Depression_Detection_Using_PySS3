I'm silently dreading Valentine's day. I can't get over my Ex and I don't know why.  I was only doing what was best for my mental health. I wanted to help him with his issues, I really did... but the codependency kept on getting worse and worse and I had started dreading talking to him, even though I loved him so much. I still feel so stupid as to not giving a detailed reason as to why it wouldn't work. I should have given a more detailed reason. But I was scared that I would only make everything worse. I couldn't act like everything was ok anymore. I just couldn't. He broke my trust. Directly on Christmas eve. And trust is something I believe is extremely important for any relationship.  hh, Valentine's day is going to suck.
