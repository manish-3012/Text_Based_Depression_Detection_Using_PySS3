I want to be with my best female friend so bad man but I'm friendzoned It hurts when I here her talk about guys and when she says I'm just friend 

One of my friends said the reason I can't just move on is I love her but idk that's such a strong word

I'm still hoping that the time we spend together will lead to feelings hopefully
