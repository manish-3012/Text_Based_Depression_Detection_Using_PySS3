My parents are suddenly doing all this fucking church shit for the first in like 10 years. They're Mormon and it's all absolute fucking bullshit. My sister is getting baptized tomorrow and I'm so fucking glad I'm not going it's at 2pm and that's the only excuse I had cuz that's so early for me And yea plus this other bullshit that is annoying I hope I don't have to do it
