Am I an incel or am I just lonely? Hello, now, before you go ahead and shoot me down because I'm 13, let me explain. Now, quarantine has really fucked us in the balls, and it certainly has for me. I've lost connection with most of my irl friends (so basically like 2-4 people), and I'm starting to get this feeling, like I just sometimes think, "man I wonder what it would be like to have a gf" and then I would go on a fucking day dream. Most of my friends are in a relationship, and whenever I go into a gc or discord server with all my online friends, everyone is just saying some cheesy, romantic shit. Like "oh bb, I love you so much", and i'm starting to get sick of it, its just I don't like how they're acting, but I don't want to be an asshole. It's like the world is telling me "hey go get a relationship you stupid fat fuck". I mean, cmon. Why does everyone I know suddenly have a relationship, is it too hard to ask for a girl that has the same interests as me? I guess it is too much. I'm not really confident in myself, I feel overweight for my age, and I can be skeptical sometimes. My social skills are fine, I just feel lonely, and I just want a SO to comfort me and just be there when I need them. I just, don't know if i'm dealing with this right, every time I get the feeling that I need a relationship, back into the vault it goes, and I feel like an incel whenever I think about this stuff. So, am I an incel, or is quarantine really fucking me deeeeep in the ass?
