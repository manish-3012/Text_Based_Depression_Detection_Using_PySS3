I feel empty Iâ€™m not depressed I just feel empty 
I haveï¿¼ have plenty of good things happening in my life I'm healthy im set for life as soon I turn twenty but when I do something enjoyable Iâ€™m depressed 
you could make every request i would not change
I donâ€™t know itâ€™s strange 
i would exchange any thing to get rid of this feeling
there no kind of healing and a way of dealing this
