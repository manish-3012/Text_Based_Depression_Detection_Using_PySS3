Appreciation post for my mum Look, i know I already posted one of these, but seriously man thank you. Thank you for letting me dress the way I want, thank you for understanding the way middle schoolers talk to eachother, thank you for letting me be honest and open around you, and thank you for letting me be me. And although I prey to any higher power that may be out there you don't find either of my accounts, know that I love and appreciate you &lt;3
