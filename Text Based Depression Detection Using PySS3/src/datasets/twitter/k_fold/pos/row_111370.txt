iâ€™m suicidal and i need friends. iâ€™ll try keep it short- my parents work requires them to shift places every 2 years, so iâ€™ve always been a perpetual new-kid in every school iâ€™ve been to. iâ€™ve never had any good friends. i used to be bullied for a while, verbally and physically. since then, i stopped trying to get close to people. i developed social anxiety. felt suicidal and i started to cut. and then i somehow saved myself.

recently, i have been having suicidal thoughts again, i had a breakdown and i confronted my parents. i go for regular therapy now. i think itâ€™s about time i find some friends and like-minded people.

if know any forums or communities of creative people ready to accept me, please let me know. iâ€™m lonely to a point where i canâ€™t function.
