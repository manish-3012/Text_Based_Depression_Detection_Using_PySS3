So twice a year we have this "social survey" where you write the name of someone who has been "making life difficult" with bullying or some shit Long story short, someone wrote the teacher's name on their sticky note and so the entire class got a lecture from another teacher, and we all had to write some patronising af sympathy card saying "you're an amazing teacher omg".

but we all know that if a student had done nothing wrong but was called out for being an ass nobody would care. I should have just not because it wasn't me who "uPSet" her lol

^also ^just ^a ^side ^note ^we ^were ^instructed ^to, ^if ^nobody ^was ^"making ^our ^life ^difficult", ^write ^down ^our ^favourite ^cartoon ^character. ^I ^said ^Dr. ^Doofenshmirtz
