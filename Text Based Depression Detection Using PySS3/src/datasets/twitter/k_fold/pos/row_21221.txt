All right guys, deep thought (kinda) We are all maybe a part of a really good, well coded game and the 'gods' are the players that control the game (like GTA) . The weird places on earth are just places where the Devs code got wrong like the Bermuda triangle. Weird weather changes are just the 'player' going creative mode changing it.
