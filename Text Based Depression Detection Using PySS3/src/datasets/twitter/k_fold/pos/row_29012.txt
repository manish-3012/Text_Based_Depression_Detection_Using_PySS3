11 days. 11 damn days into sobriety. And now I feel like I will never be the same, so... why not tell you about my journey so far?

The first 4 days were easy. No urges, no cravings, no hardships. That I remember, I donâ€™t care checking what I typed here. It was going great. I was proud of myself.  

The rest of the first week wasnâ€™t nearly as nice as the first. Do you know how it feels to crave something so badly in the middle of class that you need to grip something, to do everything possible to stay in one piece and nearly break? Probably not. And I am very, very happy that you hopefully havenâ€™t ever felt like this. But yeah, that happened. Not fun. 0/10 would not recommend. THEN the weekend came along and I was alone the entire time. Alcohol all around me. And I still somehow didnâ€™t budge.

Yesterday and today have been unbearable. All I want to do is drink. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m going to snap soon.

GG everyone. I most likely wonâ€™t even make it to 2 weeks. And thatâ€™s okay. As long as I donâ€™t end up like the rest of my family.
