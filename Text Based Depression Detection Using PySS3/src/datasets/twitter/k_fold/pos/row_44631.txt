I finally fucking learned how to ride my bike After almost a whole decade of barely going outside, sitting on my ass and playing video games, just today I finally managed to get out and learn something new. I know bike riding is a basic ass thing for most but this is a big deal for me. I'm so fucking hyped right now.
