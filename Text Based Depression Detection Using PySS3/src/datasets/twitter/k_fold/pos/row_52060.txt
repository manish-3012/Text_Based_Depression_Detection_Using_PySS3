Put Yourself Right in the Middle (138) Anxiety, Depression, Pain, Sadness, Joy, Happiness, Peace, Love........**Life.**

**Up until recently I have always wanted to figure out the answer, figure out the way to make it happen, missing the journey, missing the process. I am unlearning, relearning.**

The moment is right now &amp; thats all I have. Breathe in, breathe out. Everything has already worked it self out, **goosebumps.** 

If someone hasn't said this to you, then I will say it to you, **I am proud of you. I am proud of how far you have come, I am proud of your dedication, I am proud of your constant work, I am proud of how hard you have pushed through everything; the darkness, the pain, the sadness, the evil that has tried to overwhelm all of us during these times.**

I want you to keep going, please, please, please, **keep going**. Everything is meant for something **greater &amp; i know its hard to see why everything is happening, but just know its happening for the right reasons, right timing, greatness.**

Keep pushing.

**I love you.**
