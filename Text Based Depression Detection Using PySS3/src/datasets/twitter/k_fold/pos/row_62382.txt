Adults fucking suck They told me that I would hate adulthood and paying bills and that I should enjoy my childhood while it lasts.

I believed it until I became an adult myself and had no problem paying my bills on time and taking care of myself because I'd been doing only that for the past 18 years. 

The ones who tell you about how shitty adulthood is are just overgrown toddlers
