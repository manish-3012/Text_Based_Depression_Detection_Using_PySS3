I just found out something that could possibly end any class So I just found out the links for live class my teachers send on google classroom are copy as paste able.

We donâ€™t use zoom but instead this shitty shady site. Literally anyone can join. They teacher doesnâ€™t even have to approve you or anything. Your also able to have sound/ video on as well.

Imagine if I was like â€œyou know what. I donâ€™t wanna do mathâ€ and I posted onto here. And a bunch if teen from around the planet joined. 

Or I posted this on a furry subreddit and a bunch if guy in fur suits joined and weâ€™re doing crazy shit.

Imagine I posted this onto 4chan Or something.
