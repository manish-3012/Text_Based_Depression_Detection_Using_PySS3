My brother and dad are antimask So we are in this store where you are for ed to wear a mask to enter. Half way through my brother says he cant breath with the mask on and proceeds to take it off. 2 seconds after my dad does the same. I just think its stupid that im for ed to walk around with 2 people not wearing a mask, and it embaresses me.
