So this guy had a crush on me, I turned him down, two years later and I think heâ€™s kinda hot now He said he liked me in freshman year. He later said he only really liked me because I was into the same religion as him after I told him I really only wanted to be friends... And now, two years later, heâ€™s pretty attractive now. Not model attractive, but an awkward attractive, like he doesnâ€™t know what to do with his extra height and build. It suits him *really* well... someone stop me ajdbahsjshks
