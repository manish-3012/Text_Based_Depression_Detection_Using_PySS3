This is officially the worst year for me Iâ€™m just so done with this year first once quarantined started my parents started abusing me more than they did before then the good thing that happened is I got out of that abusive household but then like 4 months after I start getting super emotional and like Iâ€™m depressed, angry and whatever other emotion 24/7 and then I hear my dads gonna put my dog down which Iâ€™ve had since I was a little kid and then to make matter worse my grandpa went into a coma and then died the other day and his funerals tomorrow and Iâ€™m going through two types of therapy right now and itâ€™s just so much  like I just wanna be happy and have a normal life
