I need your help please. In the uk the government is debating whether transgender people should be allowed to self-identify as transgender without the need for a medical diagnosis, they are also debating whether non-binary identifies should be legally recognised.

As a non binary person with multiple trans friends i implore you to sign this petition if you are a BRITISH CITIZEN ONLY. I should be allowed to be who i am as a person without the need for this.

I thank you for reading this and i thank you in advance for taking it into your heart to sign this.

TL/DR: the uk government is debating whether trans rights are valid sign the petition BRITISH CITIZENS ONLY.
