This is gonna get downvotes but, In school where I see alot of stuff talking about students mental health not being a priority, or lack of sleep, all I can say is this. Go with the flow, if you need to get up early the go to sleep early, and with the large amounts of work, do it immediately and don't wait until you do. But, I don't know what your living situation is, or what your environment is, but just pull through, it does get better. Stay strong out there, things aren't good with covid, I know it can be stressful, but stay strong, and never give up.
