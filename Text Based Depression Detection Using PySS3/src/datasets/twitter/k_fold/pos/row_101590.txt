Does any one else feel like they canâ€™t rebellious 

Like the title says I feel like I have to do whatever my parents say.

Like my friends are out drinking and whatever but I feel like I canâ€™t even go out and ask a girl out because thatâ€™s not what my parents would like is there something wrong with me or is this just who I am and I need to deal with it?
