I dont know why ppl hate on TikTok so hard My little cousins love TikTok , and even though I don't use it they wanted to do a TikTok with me and I did it cause I'd knew they have fun. Idk, to me it's like if you enjoy something, it kinda sucks to have somebody spit in your face just because u like it. If ppl are having fun, wgaf?
