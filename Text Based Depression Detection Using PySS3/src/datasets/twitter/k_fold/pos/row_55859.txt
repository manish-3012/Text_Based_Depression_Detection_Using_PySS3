I think a classmate likes me, but I don't have the confidence to tell her I don't feel the same way So me and this girl have been in the same class since last year and we sort of became friends, but since the start of this school year I've seen some changes in her general attitudes towards me and it's starting to make me feel uncomfortable.

She's been progressively trying to get closer to me. For the last 3 weeks I've been eating lunch at her house everyday, and even though I don't think this is normal behavior, especially during a pandemic, I'm also afraid that I would offend her if I just refused to go.

One day we decided to hang out at McDonald's with a group of friends and also grab a bite. On the way there, we passed by some sort of factory, so naturally there were a lot of trucks coming in and out. Knowing that, she told me that she didn't feel comfortable walking by those truckers that are probably rapists "

by herself", so she made me hold hands with her and pretend we're partners.

Today I had P.E and after that class I was feeling a bit of pain in my back and shoulders, so, she just decided TO GIVE ME A FRICKING MASSAGE! It felt good, but it was completely unsolicited and made me feel a bit uncomfortable.

I told all of this to my mom and she simply told me this girl has a crush on me. I just can't accept that fact, even though I know it is a likely cause for her unusual actions.Â  So here I am, asking for the opinion of a bunch of internet strangers. Why is my friend behaving like this and of she really does like me what do I do, since I really don't have feelings for her but also don't have the guts to tell her that?
