The world is a bitch and people suck I mean seriously. The world, especially people, demands perfection from each living being and will tear you down for the slightest slip. Nothing is forgivable by anyone's standards. People are such assholes about it, too. They never let you forget. They make sure that your misgivings are all that people see of you. Like wth man. It's so infuriating.



The longer things go on, the longer this happens. Nothing ever gets better. I'm utterly convinced people have forgotten decency or human kindness. 



Who knows, maybe it's just the side of me that doesn't have any friends talking. Idk at this point.
