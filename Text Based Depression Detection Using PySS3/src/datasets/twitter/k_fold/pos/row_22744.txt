What should I do differently? Looking for advice from younger people on parenting... Hear me out.
My kids (9, 5) are my (40M) everything. I'm not always the best parent. I had abusive parents and am trying like hell to break the cycle. I don't have any role models and am flying blind. I could use your help. 
This morning, my 5 year old threw away a Christmas present (a science experiment book) that arrived late (yesterday). It's from his uncle. He tossed it because he thought it was boring and didnt like it. I was crushed to see this, because it was a thoughtful gift intended for the family (we 3) to use together.
I told my 5 yo that what he did was wrong. I told him to bring me his 2 favorite stuffed animals. I intended to put them in 'time out' and let him earn them back w good behavior.
He instead brought down his two least favorite stuffed animals to outsmart me.
I then confiscated the 3 stuffed animals in his room, and reminded him that these 3 were his least favorite so he shouldn't care. I threatened to throw them away, like he threw away the book. I haven't, but now I'm stuck.
I don't want to take away all his toys. I've seen numerous posts on this sub about how doing so is counterproductive and eventually I'll run out of stuff to take away and he'll just resent me.
My parents would have beaten the shit out of me and screamed insults to shame me. I did neither, but I don't know what to do. 
What would you like your parents to do in this type of situation? How can I help teach him a lesson without screwing him, or our relationship, up? Did your parents ever do something in a similar situation that either worked really well or backfired? Thanks in advance.
