Iâ€™m Waiting for a Call Back 
I applied for a job in retail about a week ago. I called them back two days ago asking if they had time to look at my application, but they said the individual I charge of that is still on leave, as they hurt themselves a few weeks ago. 

There is not a lot of options where I live. There is a lot of fast food. I worked at two different fast food locations, and hated both of them. 

I need this job. I did a few things differently from what would be considered average to have a better chance of getting hired. 

- I created an application form that I handed in alongside my resume, as they did not have one.

- I will not be payed as much. Due to my age, minimum wage is lower for me than those above the age of majority. I was the only student that applied there. 

What else could I do? I want to work in retail, and this is a perfect opportunity. I am very anxious waiting.
