what happened to mufasa's body in the lion king. we all know mufasa dies in the lion king. but where did his body go to? 

you would think that the bodies were eaten by the hyenas, but, [hyenas don't usually eat leftover bodies](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63455/12-wild-facts-about-hyenas)  [when they hunt in groups](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/).

and since no animal eat lions, who ate mufasa? according to this [very trusted source](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071020082849AApvkN5), lions eat other lions.

lets take this scene from the movie.

My conclusions that scar ate mufasa and kept the bones
