I have a funny story One time while on vacation me and my family were getting fries and vinegar and my mom walked a way for a second which I didn't see. I go up to a stranger thinking it was my mom and hug their leg. I look up and see it's not my mom and I become embarrassed. I hated everything in that moment. It still haunts me til this day....

Don't say r/storytime or I will literally sleep
