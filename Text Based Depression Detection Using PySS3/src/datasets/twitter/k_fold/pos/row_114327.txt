Yâ€™all finna be mad but us 2002 babies are not the same generation as 2005 babies. Generation Z doesnâ€™t exist and Millennials are 1982-2004 and the Homeland Generation is 2005-2027. You can leave now. You grew up in the 2010s &amp; 2020s and are Fortnite, Tik Tok, &amp; COVID Kids. Bitch Iâ€™m 17 turning 18 in December and Iâ€™m grown. Go away you 14 &amp; 15 year olds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
