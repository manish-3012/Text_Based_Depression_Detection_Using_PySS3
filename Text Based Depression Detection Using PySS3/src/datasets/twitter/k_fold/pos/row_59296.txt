Every chance I get I sit at my desk and I cry Knowing for a fact that I just want to die
To alleviate the pain that is sitting in front of me
An experimental mess so bad they can't even hide

Virtual school is becoming a drug
An unescapable force being forced upon us
Virtual school is a terrible thing
Like the alarm in the morning
That disgusting ring

Jingle this, jingle that
Waking up in the morning has never felt so drat
I lay in my bed
Browsing social walls
There's something about it
It feels so calm

Sometimes I wish
That this all didn't happen
A year of events
We can't even reverse

Do you like when I suffer?
Do you like when I cry?
Do you like when your system
Is so bad I wanna die?
Do you think that it's fine
That I have no emotion?
Work and no play is exactly the issue

When there's a towering pile
Homework and regret
Pushing off all the assignments
They're so easy I guess
Do you think that it's fine
That we have no emotion?
I just wish that I didn't have to...

Be a lifeless "human."

A rant about virtual school in the form of some shitty song lyrics.
