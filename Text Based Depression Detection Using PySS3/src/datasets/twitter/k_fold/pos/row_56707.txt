The start of a song I'm writing. What do u all think so far? I still remember the look in your eyes like it was yesterday 

And the look on your face when you heard what I had to say

And I still remember the words you said to me

The ones that wounded me, changed who I would be

The words I didnt expect to hear, the ones that broke my heart

But I guess it was something I shouldve known right from the start
