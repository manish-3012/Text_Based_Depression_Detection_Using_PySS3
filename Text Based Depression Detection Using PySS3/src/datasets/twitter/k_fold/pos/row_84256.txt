Why the fuck Do you guys understand how young we are, like Iâ€™m thirteen, I have absolutely no say in anything I do. I am to young to even decide my sexuality! I like to act like an adult but I literally canâ€™t do anything. I keep hearing about whatâ€™s going on in China and about the blm protests but I canâ€™t do anything to help. I feel so useless. Ugh
