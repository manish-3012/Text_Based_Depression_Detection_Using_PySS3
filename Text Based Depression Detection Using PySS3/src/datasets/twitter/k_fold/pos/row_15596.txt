Everyone seems rude?? Idk whatâ€™s up with me but I always assume people are thinking the worst about me and it makes me not like them. Iâ€™ve been really annoyed with random people working at places(this lady I saw at the dmv today.) I just keep thinking â€œWhy the fuck are they talking to me like that?â€ I know theyâ€™re working and thatâ€™s more than I can say about myself rn but Iâ€™d like to think Iâ€™d put a little more effort to you know make the other person happy since theyâ€™re the ones spending money. Also itâ€™s just really hard in general to see people in a good way since Iâ€™m thinking about how rude they are all the time. I guess one benefit of it is if they do say something nice to me then Iâ€™ll be really happy because theyâ€™re nice for a change. Itâ€™s more rewarding than a nice person being nice because theyâ€™re always like that. If an asshole is nice to you it makes you feel special
