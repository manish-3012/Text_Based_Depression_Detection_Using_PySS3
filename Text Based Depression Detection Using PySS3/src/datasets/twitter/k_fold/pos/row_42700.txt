No, I don't have cancer Nor did I ask out my crush (I don't have one... Yet? I may be aromatic I don't know) but I was told by my friend from a school I had to leave when moving over seas, (after I said I wasn't having the best time) that she was there for me. I hope you guys and girls find a friend like that and can be that friend, that you can joke with, speak with naturally, without awkwardness, and go to when you need help. Because even when someone says that they're here for you, it already helps.
