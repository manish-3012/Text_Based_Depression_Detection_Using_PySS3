Old story from school It was lunch and I saw a group run out of the boys bathroom laughing. Eventually multiple people started circulating in and out of the bathroom when me and my friends took notice. We decided to check what the fuck was going on in there. Turns out it was a piece of shit in the sink just floating on top of the murky water. Everyone went in to check it out like a fucking museum exhibit throughout the day. I remember It took about 2 days for someone to finally clean it up. Good times. Good times.
