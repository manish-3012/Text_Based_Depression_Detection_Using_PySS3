How do I write a best man toast/speech? Basically title. My dad is getting married tomorrow and he had asked me to be the best man and to do a speech/toast. I'm only 18, I don't have enough knowledge of how to do this lol. I know y'all are teenagers too but hopefully similar minds can come up with something reasonable.
