was that a childish and rude move? before 2months i got a friend(internet friend but we are from the same country) we talked a lot and i told her that im suicidal and such, and yeh she helped me a lot with it. and somehow i got addicted to her. but damn lately she been ghosting me a lot, like watching my stories in seconds after i upload them, but on otherside she didnt replied my messages, like wtf. whenever i felt bad i writed to her but still she continue to ghost me and reply my message after 1 day or so.

i fucking hate when peoples do that shit, they say u can talk to them whenever u not ok but still they push you away. anyway she sent me some last voice message and she said that she is really busy with college and she cant talk to me, but idk i think she said that just to push me away. or maybe im overthinking a lot, well i just wanted to be friends with her but she actually never consider as one, also ghosting hurts a lot so i thought she doesnt care anymore. and i decided to remove her from followers. do u think that was childish or smth? do u think if she really cares for me she gonna write to me, even tho i removed her? or now everything its over?

sorry guys dont judge or smth, i just got addiced to her and her pressence hurted me so much thats why i decided to remove her, but somehow im regretting it now :(


(also sorry for my english)
