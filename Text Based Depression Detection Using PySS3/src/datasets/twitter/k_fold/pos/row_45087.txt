I had a random thought today So, I was listening though the Hamilton soundtrack for like the 50th time, and in the last song Eliza asks if she did a good enough job of telling Hamiltonâ€™s story.

The thing is tho I barely heard about him until the play, and all my friends said they hadnâ€™t either. So my thought process is Eliza did a pretty shitty job. 

Idk what this post was but I wanted to say this somewhere
