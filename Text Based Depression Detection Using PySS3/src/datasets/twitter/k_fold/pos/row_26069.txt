My brother (16M) is having a really hard time adjusting to the idea that he won't be able to have in-person schooling for his junior year. I (21F) don't live with him but I want to do anything I can to help him, what do you guys suggest? Just as the title says, my brother is having a lot of anxiety and disdain for the current schooling situation, which is online only right now. He's very worried he won't be able to get good grades while schooling from home because it's harder for him to focus, and this is his junior year so grades are important this year.Do you guys have any advice, for either me or my brother? I appreciate y'all!
