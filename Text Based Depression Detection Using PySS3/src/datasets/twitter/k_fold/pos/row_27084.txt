I'm probably going to pull an all-nighter. Should I? So life is shit. My room is messy. I'm a 4.0 GPA student that has fallen into the lowest of lows cuz like pandemics aren't that good for your mental health, ya know? So here's my thought process: new room, new me.

Right now it's around 5 pm EST. I'm going to have dinner and finish my up night normally. I always take like an 1.5 hr walk at night cuz I like to get 10k steps every day. So I'll do that. Then, around like 9ish I'll shower so it's like it's the morning. I'll have a cup of coffee. Maybe another one around like midnight or something. So here's the plan:

9-11pm Ill clean my room

12-5 ill watch movies, do school work, play video games

5-7 debate whether or not I should have coffee or take a nap

7 start last day of school this week.

Am I being stupid or what?
