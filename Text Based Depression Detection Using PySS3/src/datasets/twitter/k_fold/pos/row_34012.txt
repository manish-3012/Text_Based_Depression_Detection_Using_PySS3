My entire family now thinks I'm a porn addict, So I was watching youtube in the living room today and decided to watch a video from my recommended, completely normal right? What could go wrong? Turns out the youtuber uses the pornhub intro as his yt video intro. I had the volume super loud cuz the previous video had shitty audio.

I freaked the fuck out and turned off the TV so fast. 

Big fuck up.

My parents slow walked to the living room and they think I was casting porn on the TV and forgot to connect headphones. since I turned off the TV no one bought my story.

And that people is why my parents want to talk to me about the consequences of porn addiction and grounded me from using electronics without surveillance.
