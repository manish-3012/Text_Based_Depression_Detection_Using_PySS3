My mom wonâ€™t let me get the vaccine Hello! Iâ€™m 15 and my family is very at risk for COVID to a point I canâ€™t go to school because of the risk. The vaccine recently came out but my mom refuses to allow me to get it, saying Iâ€™ll just be a Guinea pig for testing. I really want to get it so I can go back to school, and sheâ€™s slapped me any time I try to convince or ask her if I can get it. Any suggestions?
