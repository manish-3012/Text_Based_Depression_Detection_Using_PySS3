(vent post) My only friend group that I'm currently apart of just kicked me out of their discord, and its fucking crushing. I've genuinely never felt this deppressed in years, I really liked these people man. Everyone I become friends with eventually pushes me away because I'm an annoying twat. I don't know what to do anymore. I have noone to talk to, play with, or just sit in a vc with anymore, whats worse is that they probably wished I was gone from before they actually did it. I feel like I'm nothing but a nuiscanse.
