We should seriously ban awards on things with the â€œSeriousâ€ flair When I go on this sub I commonly see people expressing their feelings and some serious topics. Some of these things are like rape, abuse and cyber bullying. And every time, no exception the number 1 award is always F, wholesome seal or another quirky lol reaction that just spots in the face of the people trying to get their message out. 

Things with the serious flair are for people who are seeking on advice on an alarming topic and people completely fuck it up by putting their shitty awards. 

Ban awards on serious posts.
