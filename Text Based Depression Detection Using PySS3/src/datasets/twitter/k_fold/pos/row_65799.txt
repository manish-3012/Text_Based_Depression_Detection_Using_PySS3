I pissed my parents off I didn't feel well so I told them and they didn't care so I told them again making sure to point out that I'll still be doing school just online so then they budged a little and things proceeded well then at the end my dad said "why don't you just come talk to us like a young adult." And that made me a bit angry because I did and I try to talk to them about my problems but they either never believe me or never care so I started yelling and then we had an argument so now I'm doing online school for the day.
