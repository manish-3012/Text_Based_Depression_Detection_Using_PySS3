Any suggestions on a novel to suggest for my summer reading this year (Junior going into Senior year) If it helps, I *really* like dystopian stuff and adventure. In middle school I loved the Maze runner, Hunger games, Divergent, and the Theodore Boone mystery books (idk if you guys have ever heard of that one). Thereâ€™s a very low possibility that my book gets picked but Iâ€™ll still probably keep it in mind to read.
