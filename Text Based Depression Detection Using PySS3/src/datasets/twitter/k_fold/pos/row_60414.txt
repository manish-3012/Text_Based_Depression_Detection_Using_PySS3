Last checkup post for tonight This is my last checkup post tonight! 

Makes me feel really happy when I make others happy. Just posted about this but Iâ€™m doing again because sometimes people wonâ€™t see my post, and those same people might really need a pat on the back.

Are you all doing alright? I enjoy doing this little checkups because seeing you guys happy makes me feel good. You deserve to be happy. If you need a compliment, some encouragement or just a pat on the back, leave a comment or DM me depending on your comfort level. I just want to make as many people happy as possible. It always sucks when youâ€™re going through hard times, and I want to help, at least just a little, because sometimes we just need that little push to get us going.
