You donâ€™t need to lie in order to make friends. Nobody should feel as though they need to look â€œimpressiveâ€ to others if they want to be their friend.

Saying this because I knew someone who lied about surfing, snowboarding, among many other things in order to seem like they deserved attention or praise and was likely feeling lonely.

Thatâ€™s all. Thank you.
