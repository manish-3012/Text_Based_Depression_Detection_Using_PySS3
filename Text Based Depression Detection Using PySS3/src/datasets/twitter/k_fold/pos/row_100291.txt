Whenever I seriously consider the fact that my life/childhood isnâ€™t any worse than average personâ€™s, I experience intense, almost intolerable, shame and psychic pain. This is deeply disturbing to me and I promise Iâ€™m not proud of it at all but I for some reason I feel like I NEED to prove to myself and to believe that I have suffered more than most people. I know this is a major victim mentality and not to people who actually suffered and itâ€™s just a horrible thing to want but thatâ€™s part of what I feel so deeply ashamed about. Self pity is the worst. I genuinely donâ€™t want to want it if that makes sense? 

At the same time, shocking myself into reality and self-awareness, as I try to do often, by practicing gratitude and putting things into perspective elicits hugely painful and intense feelings of rage (and self-rage) and shame that make me want to hurt myself for being so awful. 

Itâ€™s mostly shame about accepting myself as the cause of most of my problems. In theory I truly believe that and think itâ€™s a wonderful thing to believe and act on, because it means you have control over your life. But in reality when I begin to believe that, I canâ€™t stand to accept it, itâ€™s so incredibly embarrassing because I have so many mental weakness and am so miserable, knowing itâ€™s my own doing, I just... every bone in my body feels repulsed by that. 

When I read online or in books about people taking control of their life they seem to do it so gracefully. As though they have this epiphany which liberated them, but they do not talk about the crushing guilt and shame and anger towards the self that naturally accompanies that self-awareness. All the frustration and pain Iâ€™ve ever felt is instantly just turned inward. An acute awareness of your worst and most despised characteristics. All of the things you arenâ€™t happy about â€” your fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault.
