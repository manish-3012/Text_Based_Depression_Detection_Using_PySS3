don't you love it when your mom has their friends over and you haven't eaten all day but she tells you she is cooking food but she ends up cooking food only for her and her friends so you try to cook something but she gets mad at you because she already cooked even if she didn't let you have anything then she continues to yell at you in front of all of her friends making you rightfully mad at her but you can't do anything because she's your parent and she loves you and shit like that
