What should I do? I've not heard from one of my best friends of mine for quite a few days, which is unusual. Usually she takes no more than a day to reply to me.

 What's weird is all day her IG account has said "active now" which can't possibly be right. See, she's always, always busy. As in never has time for anything, so she obviously never checks social media that much. It's said the same thing for about 7 hours now and that's kind of worrying me. I'm worried something happened. I think she's probably alright physically, but maybe not so much mentally.
