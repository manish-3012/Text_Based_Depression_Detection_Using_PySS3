I am sad for no reason I am known to never be sad, normally Iâ€™m happy playing any game but I just get bored now, I try to forget the fact that Iâ€™m sad but I think itâ€™s mainly because I miss the past, none of my friends play video games, I hate that, the ones that do are in America so whenever I sleep they are awake and I never get to actually play with them, we keep saying we will though, and even if I did have friends to play with, I canâ€™t use voice chat or anything like that with my dad watching my every move, I hate it, Iâ€™m legit scared my dad wonâ€™t let me do something because he think that their boomer way of life is the only way, I could be gaming for like 5 hours and he would be like â€œyou been staring at screen too long no wonder you sadâ€ but when I do it on a school laptop heâ€™s like â€œas long as itâ€™s educational itâ€™s good no matter whatâ€ Iâ€™m so tired of it boomers literally only think technology is bad until education is involved he always asks what Iâ€™m doing on my phone if itâ€™s a game or something he tells me to get off if itâ€™s social media he would ask me to show him whatâ€™s currently on my screen and start scrolling but noo if itâ€™s Duolingo or something then â€œoh yes keep doing that for another hour thatâ€™s good healthâ€ I just want comfort boomers are dumb sorry I had to vent somewhere Iâ€™m probably overreacting
