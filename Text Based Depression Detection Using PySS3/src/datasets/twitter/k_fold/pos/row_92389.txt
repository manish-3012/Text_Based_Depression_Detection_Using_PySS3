I love my dad but... My school year is about to end, and Iâ€™m looking forward to doing athletics and band next year, but my dad wants me to drop band to free up my schedule. I thought heâ€™d stopped thinking because of him â€œfeeling terrible for making me do it,â€ as he stated at the scheduling meeting with the high school counselor, but after picking me up today he went back to not wanting me to do it. This is very confusing! Please help!
