Parents occasionally assholes to random people? Anyoneâ€™s elseâ€™s parents generally chill for the most part but every once in a while theyâ€™re complete assholes to the most random people for absolutely no reason? ITS EMBARRASSING. 

Feel free to share your experiences - Iâ€™ll go first 

  Earlier today I was at the store with my dad. He wasnâ€™t in a bad mood, we were just window shopping (in this fairly small store) and this lady with a small child and like a teen around my age says â€œexcuse usâ€ to him MULTIPLE times and Iâ€™m not sure if he ignored them or what but he didnâ€™t budge. So she just went ahead and walked behind him AND MY DAD FELT THE NEED TO YELL â€œweLL eXcUSe MEâ€ WITH SO MUCH ATTITUDE and she looked at him like he was                 I N S ANE. And on top of it he walked away like nothing happened. At that moment that man was no longer my father. It was so  E M BA R R A S S I N G.
