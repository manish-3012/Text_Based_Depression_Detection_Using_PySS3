My standards in eighth grade haha In eighth grade, I was 90 pounds and 5'2. And I found out that a guy in my class was also exactly 90 pounds and 5'2. And get this; we were the same shoe size too whooaaaooa what a match eh? Anyway he was a clueless little b who basically embarrassed me like  every single time my 13 year old self made a (stupid stupid stupid cheesy ass) move so ugh.

Anyway he's like 6 feet tall now but I grew up
