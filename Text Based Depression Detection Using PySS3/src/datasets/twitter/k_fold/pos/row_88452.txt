My mom got mad at me today The main reason was because I didnâ€™t smile. 

But the real reason why I didnâ€™t smile is simple: I donâ€™t like sudden events without warning. 

I was chilling in my room when my mom suddenly called me out. I didnâ€™t know what would happen until she told me. Now I usually will never back down from a getting my picture taken, yet ON CHRISTMAS EVE my mom had to suddenly FUCKING FORCE me into taking a picture. At least give me a warning!

For the first few minutes everything was going fine, until the bickering started. I smiled, but in a way that convinced my mother to think I hated having my picture taken. She criticized my EVERY TINY flaw I had in posturing. Unfortunately, I also moved in a certain motion that further made her think Iâ€™m not willing to get my picture taken. 

We took a couple of images, which was all okay until the breaking point. I moved to the front row, and took our picture, my dad said everyone looked okay except for ME. I felt like I was a FUCKING misfit, and since Iâ€™m naturally emotionally sensitive, I cried.

Yes you read that right, I CRIED. Iâ€™m 14 and Iâ€™m not supposed to cry that much anymore, but it was too much. I ran to the bathroom and hid, but suddenly I had a nosebleed. I stopped it with cotton balls and Vaseline. 

When I came out again, my mom said I wasnâ€™t ready, which may sound good but IT WASNâ€™T. I was FUCKING ready and I insisted on getting the rest of the pictures taken. But mom yet again said I was a stupid child who was rebellious and hated family. We were Asian so thatâ€™s why she said that in the first place. 

We stopped taking pictures, and everyone did their own thing. I went onto my phone and watched YouTube videos. Everything was good, even though I ranted about not having enough screen time for my PC as the cause for my â€œnegativenessâ€.

Dinner was uneventful, until mom yet again attacks my weakest spot with â€œBEcaUsE of your BeHaviOr, SaNtA wOnâ€™T gIVe you prEseNtS.â€ 

I mean, how do you end up on the naughty list if you didnâ€™t want to FUCKING SMILE. Not choosing to smile is a choice, not a law. I walked into the guest bathroom (which is where I usually do my business) and wrote this post.
