A lot of you teenagers here seem very anxious and stressed, so... I found [a song](https://youtu.be/UfcAVejslrU) that is said to be the most relaxing song of all time, sleep inducing, make people feel calm and not worry about anxiety, a lot of you probably know this song already, but give it a try anyway.

It's said to be so relaxing that you can't listen to it while driving, and it has been creating by a musician and some therapist and more.

P.s this is serious, none of that rickroll bs.
