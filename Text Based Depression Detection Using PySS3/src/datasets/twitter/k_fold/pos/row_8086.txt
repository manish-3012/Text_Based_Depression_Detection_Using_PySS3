"Digital art isnt real art" ok so i was reading about people who call digital art not real art, their explanation is basically that digital art is easier to do than standard art. Well, people used to draw with rocks during the early age, as the age progresses we have found many new ways in which art can be made. Do you think wall carvers accepted it when papyrus came along? no, they continued to do it anyway.
