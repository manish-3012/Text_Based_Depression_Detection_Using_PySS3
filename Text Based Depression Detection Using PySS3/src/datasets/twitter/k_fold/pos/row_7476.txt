I just got yelled at for bringing an empty cup into my livening room. Ok so it all started earlier today near the afternoon and I noticed we had some apple cider in our fridge so I grabbed a mug and poured it and then put it in the microwave to heat it up ( I used to do this a lot when I was younger and I still love even as I am older ) so I heat it up then I drink it in the kitchen when I am sloshed to drink and eat things. However when I was done with the drink my sister called me over to help her and her friend, so I set my drink and the counter in the livening room and go to help her out. So my day goes on and around ten minutes ago I heart mom yell my name and itâ€™s her and her boyfriend just sitting there and she ask me about the cup I then explain to her how it got there and her boyfriend then yells at me saying I am lying like a little kid and that this isint the first time he â€œcaught meâ€. Ok the first time was around two months ago when I ate a popsicle while standing on the floor in the livening room. So now heâ€™s pissed and my mom took his side and now they want to turn off my phone so wish me luck boys.
