(drugs) My school conselours were awful So in 8th grade I overheard weed operations and naturally I went to a counselor I had to go to 5 different conselours just to talk to someone about it, and when I did they didn't even know what weed was so I just gave them the name, then one day the kid was high as balls, moronic, and bloodshot eyes, and he even had weed in his bag but the people who talked to him saw nothing, EVEN WHEN HE WAS HIGH AT THE TALK, and then at my current school there were so many kids vaping that it was almost coming out of the bathroom so I tell a teacher (who was a counselor and vice principal of the same bathroom gender and 10 feet away from the bathroom) that they were vaping, and you know what he did?, Nothing. Literally nothing conselours don't even have anything all they do is eat lunch all day, they suck at their jobs
