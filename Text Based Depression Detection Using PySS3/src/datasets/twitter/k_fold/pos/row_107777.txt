Politics piss me off Politics genuinely piss me off. I canâ€™t go online or talk to anyone about what's going on in the world without politics being involved. Being raised in the south, I was taught Conservative beliefs and I continue to identify with being a Conservative. Problem is I basically have to keep my political beliefs â€œIn the closetâ€ so to say, for the pure hatred that people will hold on me. Even though I do like Trump for president. I do NOT believe the election was stolen by Biden. He won and I accept him as president. As a matter of fact, I respect all presidential candidates for the people they are, not just what they say politically. Yet, everytime I say something political within earshot of someone, I get bashed with â€œOh look, another MAGA F\*\*â€ and Heaps of political insults. And even on my side, Republicans bashing Biden for â€œBeing Senileâ€ and calling him a pedophile. Just completely disrespecting the man who is trying to make the country a better place. Noone deserves to be bashed for their opinions, especially with what some of these candidates have been through like how Biden lost his entire family to an accident. It makes me sick to see how people are so quick to dismiss someone just based on if they are red or blue. Why canâ€™t we all just accept that political opinions arenâ€™t that big of a deal and move on with our lives
