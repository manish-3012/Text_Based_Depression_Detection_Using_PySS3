Corruption has become the biggest, ruthless and most visibly invisible business ever. Millionaires own 12 storey houses for 4 family members, while the poor starve. Seriously, hear me out..since the onset of the pandemic, Mukesh Ambani AKA Asia's Richest Man has had a net value increase of around 22 Billion Dollars (US). Yet the people working under him as well the extreme poor such as farmers, milkmen etc who give us BASIC NECESSITIES have been pushed to a limit where some have to LITERALLY LICK spilt milk of the road.
