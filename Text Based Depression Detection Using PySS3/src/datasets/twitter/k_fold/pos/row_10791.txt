am i a psycho? when my grandma died i just didnâ€™t feel anything, no sadness just completely nothing. i felt bad for not feeling anything but i cant help it. its got me questioning if im even capable of caring about other people if i am unable to have empathy or anything. guess i can just mirror other peoples actions though
