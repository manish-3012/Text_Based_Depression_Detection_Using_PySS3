Is it weird Is it weird for a 16 y.o to be exchanging nudes online with a 19 y.o. I found out of my (the younger one) friends did that with a 19 yo online and I wanted to know if that was questionable behavior. 

Honestly not my place to lecture them but I would like to know what yâ€™all think about this stuff. And yes they got mad when I told someone else and they brought up the topic. 


Unfortunately I had seen one of their stuff when they shared it to group chat. Was very traumatizing for me
