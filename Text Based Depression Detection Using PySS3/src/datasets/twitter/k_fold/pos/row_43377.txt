What the frick youtube (Spoiler for second hand embarrassment) I have to get this off my chest and I don't feel comfortable telling my parents. So let me spin you a tale. It was science class, I was quietly listening to the home depot theme (Idk why, I just like it, hypes me up), And then, AUTOPLAY MAN COMES IN TO SAVE THE DAY. Video finishes right? "Top 10 n-words" comes out of my speaker, quietly enough but everyone hears it, luckily I mute it before it gets into the... "list" but the whole class is staring at me. Teacher comes over, I semi-calmly explain that I left auto play on, and a certain slippery video snuck past school moderation. The teacher is like "ok then" and we pack up and leave. I can't stop thinking about it. This was 5 minutes after an ad for weed shows up on my friends screen while studying on quizlet (which is illegal where I live). So the school really has to work on what gets own their own issued chromebooks.
