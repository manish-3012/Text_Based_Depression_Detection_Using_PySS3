Talking to girls I know this sounds sad but for most of my life I've been going to an all boys school and havent had very  much social interactions with girls. I just dont know what to talk about when with girls? When im around boys I talk about football or games, but girls? Not even to go out with them just as friends. Please can I get some advice so that when I start at my new school I'm not the wierd kid. 

Thanks.
