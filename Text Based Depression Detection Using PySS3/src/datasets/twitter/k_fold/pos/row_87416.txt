If you are feeling sad and want to feel good, Iâ€™ve got just the thing for you This YouTube channel, Puuung, has an animated series all about what love is. Itâ€™s a really charming, non-voiced story all about this couple just living life to the fullest. 

Itâ€™s honestly one of the most heart-warming video seriesâ€™s Iâ€™ve watched in a long time and I suggest you check it out.
