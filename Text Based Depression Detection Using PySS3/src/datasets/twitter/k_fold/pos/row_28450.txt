Day 12 of posting my favorite bit of lyrics from a song on my Spotify playlist. "I'm not one who's fond of always being alone, but tonight, it feels right, my mind is like my home. And I feel kinda bad, you were nice-ish, but what I want, is for me a death wish." from Walk Home Alone by Nihilist Cheerleader
