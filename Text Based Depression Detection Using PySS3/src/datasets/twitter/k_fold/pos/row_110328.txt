A point beyond the freindzone. Hey yall. (Im swedish forgive my spelling)
I just need some advice about a thing here. 
Ive had a crush on this girl in my class for almost a year now, i know for a fact that she doesnt feel the same way about me (i havent told her but i am still sure about it for reasons i dont wanna explain) and ive accepted that nothing will ever come of this but i cant shake of my feelings towards her.
We dont realy talk at all and arent realy friends either. But ive talked to her more than to most other people in my class that arent in my main social circle.

Anyone got any advice how to move on from this?
