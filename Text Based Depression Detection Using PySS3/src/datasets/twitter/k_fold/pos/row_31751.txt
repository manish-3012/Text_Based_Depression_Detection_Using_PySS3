I just feel empty..... I just feel like sh*t. Everything feels like a pain in the arse , even living does. I mean what is the point? It takes everything i've got to stop myself from breaking apart completely. I just while away my time playing games, reading manga. I've stopped studying at all. I just ignore every class going on and just read manga or do nothing at all. I'm scared of what will happen to me if this continues. I'm worried but at the same , I feel nothing. Sometimes I even cry myself to bed. It's just too hard. I don't even feel like talking to my parents about anything. Reason being i'm not that close to them, even though we share the same roof, I never that close bond that people do. I just feel so alone, I don't know what to do. I'm even fighting off my suicidal tendencies, I'm scared of everything. I...I..just dont know what to do? Why even bother? If i'm just gonna die in the first place? These kinds of thoughts haunt me day and night. Then I feel like studying is useless and just go on whiling my time away. It's frustrating, scary and despair inducing. I dont know what to do with these feelings, talking here does feel like taking a weight off my chest. These pent up feelings are so hard to carry, I feel like im going to break down one of these days never get up, I'm scared. Much too scared of this all. I need to get out of this abyss. But then I don't care at all. Whatever happens , who tf cares.
