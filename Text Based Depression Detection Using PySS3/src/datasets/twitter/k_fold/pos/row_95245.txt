Get yourself a friend who can point out all your flaws and still be a friend Obviously donâ€™t get into a toxic relationship with someone. If youâ€™re being abused in any way, contact help and leave the abuser as soon as you can.

I mean make sure you have a friend who is close enough to point out mistakes and help you learn and grow as a person.

Example: Yesterday I said something unknowingly offensive to some friends. This morning one of them confronted me. Harshly. I made someone upset due to my ignorance and social awkwardness/inability to explain myself (which I shouldnâ€™t blame but it did play a part in it). Thankfully we are all still friends and Iâ€™ve promised to learn from my mistakes.

When someone points out your mistakes, accept their criticism and try to learn from it. Itâ€™s natural to act defensive but showing someone you care and that you want to be a better person to them means a lot and could strengthen the relationship.

I wonâ€™t say what offensive thing I said. It was just an awkward comment that I explained very badly.
