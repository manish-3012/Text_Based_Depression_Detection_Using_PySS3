Too many people make a joke out of suicide here. As someone who has had two friends attempt suicide, one who is now passed, and the other who is now paralyzed, itâ€™s extremely upsetting seeing edgy 13-14yos (mainly) commenting shit like â€œLol iâ€™m gonna go kmsâ€ and even using it as an insult to others. Itâ€™s infuriating. This shit isnâ€™t something to joke about.
