A bittersweet 20th birthday today I turn 20 today (26/02) and Iâ€™m not sure how to feel. I went through some of the toughest things as a teen and also the best days (so far) of my life. 
Iâ€™m not sure why I am making this post but mainly it is to say that it is possible to reach 20, for the longest time I didnâ€™t think I would see 14 or 16 or 18 let alone 20. I did not think I would make these milestones, being diagnosed depressed at 12 and feeling suicidal for the most part of my teen years I never thought I would outlive being a teen and yet here I am. 
For the most part I am happy. 
I have made it this far and I have learnt a lot, I have lost people so dear to me and I have gained a few people I will never forget. 

Iâ€™m going to tell my story and explain why it is important to keep going even if it feels impossible. 
At home I had a rocky life with my stepdad being in and out and loosing all connection with my real dad which was a mind boggling struggle I have now accepted. 
My school life was no easier, at 13 I was sat down and was told I wasnâ€™t welcome in my friend group. I was devastated but realise this has taught me not everyone has your best interest at heart. 
At 14 I came out as bisexual and was scared to admit and face it to my peers.
At 15 I lost my girl friends because I couldnâ€™t cope with the negativity they brought and chose to leave, this taught me itâ€™s okay to loose people for your best interest and to be selfish.

At 16 I made the best friends I have had. I had the most wild year of living, the childhood I missed out; playing in the woods, trying new things, having sleepovers and walking for miles, it really was my best year. Then suddenly I lost one of them (to suicide) and really mourned that, understanding that it would easily have been me and seeing the repercussions and realising the effect it had. 
From 16-18 I was in a relationship which I cannot sum up into words but thought would be never ending as I loved hard and gave my absolute everything. To realise it wasnâ€™t meant to be and was harmful. I never thought I would overcome that but now am in a stable relationship.

I went through moving schools and collages, gaining friends and loosing them to experiencing some of the worst traumas (sexual assault) a person aged 60 hasnâ€™t gone through. I have lived wildly and beautifully, sometimes tragically and painfully for 20 years. 

I want every teenager to know that it will get better. There will be a time that you leave home and escape abuse or poverty, you will grow and succeed and sometimes fail and that is okay. 
You will find friends or loose friends (I have no friends) and itâ€™s okay, itâ€™s better to have no company than bad company. 
You will flourish and fail and thatâ€™s normal, no one has any idea what they are doing so keep going with no plan, a good plan, or a failure of a plan.

My life is not good but itâ€™s better than it was. Itâ€™s a few hours since I turned 20 and I still know nothing but I promise 14 year old you will survive this and you will learn and grow and loose and fight and it will be okay. 
I am terrified of my 20â€™s but I am grateful to have had my teen years. 

Please reach out if you need help, to me or a teacher or anyone.
