If you see an angry looking kid at school, don't judge Maybe they're taking a bunch of AP classes

Maybe they're getting bullied

Maybe they lost their car keys

Maybe their best friend died

Maybe they failed a test

Maybe they're just super emotional or just have trouble expressing their emotions

Maybe they got rejected by a girl or just had a breakup

Maybe their parents are getting divorced

Calling people like that "school shooters" isn't cool and neither is making fun of them for their emotions.
