I think I kinda rejected my crush Ok, so I was talking with my crush and outta nowhere she asks me if I'm interested in dating and we in like 8th grade. I told her no, cos we're too young and there's no point in that extra stress. Then, one of my other friends told me that she actually had a crush on me too. So, we are still good friends and l don't even know why I'm telling Reddit this. But rarely have I seen someone kinda reject their crush, being a male, which is such a dumb stereotype.
