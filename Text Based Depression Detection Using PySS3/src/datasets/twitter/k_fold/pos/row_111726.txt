I hate how uninteresting and boring I sound Itâ€™s not even the shit I say, something is wrong with my VOICE. I have a monotonous boring voice and I feel like it makes people sleep. Sometimes I try to say crazy shit to make up for the fact that I could be making people fall asleep. I hate how I come off to people and I feel bad for anyone that has to be near me. Itâ€™s so stupid because I just want someone to actually like me and then I screw it all up and if I were them I wouldnâ€™t wanna be around me either
