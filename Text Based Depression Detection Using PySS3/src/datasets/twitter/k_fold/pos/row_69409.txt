Please don't be a coward I am sick of those cowards on the internet that insult me and tell lies about what I believe in, only because they wouldn't be punched in the face when they do something like that. I'm sure they won't have the nerve to tell me that face to face. And having my hands tied infuriates me.  and if I try and debunk their lies they run away from the conversation and people do not listen to or read the truth because people only see what they want to see. The furthest I can get is to advise you to not be a coward. Don't insult people or harass them if they didn't harass you.
