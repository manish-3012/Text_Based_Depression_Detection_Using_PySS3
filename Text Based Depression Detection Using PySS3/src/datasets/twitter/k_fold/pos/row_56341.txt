I needed to vent and get this off my chest, and I didn't know where else to go I've been in this cycle for a long while of where I keep making friends online, have a blast playing with them, only for things to slowly deteriorate and fall apart, and we all end up going our separate ways a little while later. Yet I always stuck by said game (the game in question is Warframe), and kept playing it, one day hoping to come across another person who would eventually become another friend. I thought I had finally broken this cycle when I came across three people in particular. The chemistry between us was something I'd never thought I'd experience. It was the friend group I had always dreamed of having. Almost every other day, for seven months straight, all four of us would come online at some point and play together, and have an absolute ball. I have to admit, I never thought some of the best friends I've ever made through a game would be some guys in their twenties and thirties. The third one was a girl who was just a little older than me. I thought I had finally found those friends that I wouldn't lose. But I was wrong. It just happened so suddenly compared to all the other times, that I never saw it coming. Guy in his thirties left to take care of his family, and the girl left to go to college. Which, I'm happy for them, don't get me wrong. As for the guy in his twenties... He just disappeared off the radar. The other two said that they'd stay in contact with me. Well... They never did. They just ignored all of my messages. Even if I was just checking in on them to see if they were doing okay. They've all just moved on... Left me behind, and forgot about me... Yet I still stick around, being the stupid sixteen year-old I am... I still hope that they might come back one day...
