Why tf am I so.... doubtful? Or anxious or stuff? I fucking question every single action i do. No matter what. I don't got any fucking courage. 

Seriously I just can't say screw it and do it anymore. I used to sometimes but now it's just gone. Fucking hell i hate this. I hate that i can't fucking trust even myself in doing things.
