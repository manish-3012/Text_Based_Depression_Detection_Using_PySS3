I hope you are ok... Long story short, my best friend has been restricted from any form of social interaction with the outside world. (where we live they they forbid minors to go out without a special permission to override it) The sad thing is that the relationship she has with her family is bad since they always treat her like trash, while her younger brother is spoiled and gets away with accusing her of things she didn't do in the first place.

And it has been almost 3 months after the last time she managed to speak to me, and I am extremely worried because she has been having suicidal thoughts during last year. And I was part of â€œthe reasons of why I haven't done itâ€


I don't know what to do anymore, the only thing I can do is to have hope.
