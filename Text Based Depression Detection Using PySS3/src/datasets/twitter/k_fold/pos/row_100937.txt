What do you guys think about older people on the sub? I was at an amusement park with my friends and one of my friends dad who is in his 40s started talking about the subreddits he used and he said he loved scrolling through r/teenagers. What are your guys thoughts on the fact that a lot of older people watch this sub and are active in it?
