I feel like shit Ok so I got four days of holiday from the school (Friday and Monday were given holidays plus the weekend) and I could've used it for studying for my tests at the end of the month and completing my assignments but I haven't  

And when I actually pick up a book to study, I always start flipping and not really focusing and eventually I put it down and start doing something else. I have wasted 3 days in this and I've got one more day, but judging by how these 3 days have gone, I don't think the fourth will go any good

And I haven't completed my assignments which are due 19th

Hope you understood what I was trying to say
