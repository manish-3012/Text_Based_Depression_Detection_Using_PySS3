I'm extremely hurt. ok so yesterday I was vibin doing my school work and stuff and my Father comes upstairs and takes my phone, and I'm like ok..- then I go downstairs and I see him reading through the messages with me and my boyfriend and after a few minutes, he reads through the messages with me and my friend Sprite. After that he forced me to block them on everything, insta, messages and ps4-. After that I starting crying knowing that I hurt them. My dad asked me 'What's wrong" and I said "You hurt me." And then he didn't respond and I went back upstairs and did the rest of my school work. A couple of hours later I finished my school work and played Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League and Minecraft with one of my friends. Once we played for about 4 hours he left and I got off, then I started remembering all the good times me and my boyfriend and Sprite had- I started to cry and shit and my dad came upstairs asking me what's wrong and I'm like "IT HURTS, IT REALLY FUCKING HURTS" then he proceeds to give me a lecture on how it's not his fault. Then I have a 2 hour long mental breakdown, and now I really want to die. This is not the first time he has done this, he has done this 3 other times. Idk what to do..-
