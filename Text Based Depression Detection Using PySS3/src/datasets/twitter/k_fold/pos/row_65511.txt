Absolute Bullshit I have a lot, and I mean a LOT of Lego sets, I've been collecting them since i was 2.
Most of them take a minimum of 3 hours to build except for 4 smaller ones which take about 1 hour.
My parents hired someone to clean our house, and they destroyed most of them

THIS BITCH COME TO MY HOUSE TO DO HER FUCKING JOB AND NOT ONLY SWITCHES AROUND EVERYTHING IN MY ROOM SHE OBLITERATES 30+ HOURS OF WORK BECAUSE SHE'S FUCKING LAZY.

My Milenium Falcon wich takes around 5 hours to build? WRECKED

My Lego Ninago Temple from season 3 wich takes 7 hours to build? OBLITERATED

Kylo Ren's ship, a 6 hour build? FUCKING DESITEGRATED

My original X-wing, wich is a 4 hour build at least?
DELETED

These aren't all of them but they're the harder ones to rebuild.

They hadn't been built for years but I had some time during the last summer break and that's the only time when I'll be able to again.

End of rant.
