Most native English speakers are Americans that refuse to learn a second language Wtf Americans, technically I think I would be in the speaks a second language category, I was probably an a1 in German at some point but I have Since forgotten everything about grammar and like half the words so I donâ€™t really 

Iâ€™m trying learn Swedish though, I was learning Norwegian but I realized it would be completely useless and itâ€™s mutually intelligible with Swedish, the us sucks and I want to move ASAP and Sweden seems great (relatively, I have family in Switzerland and Germany and I want to be as far away from my aunt as possible, being close to the other 3 would be nice but itâ€™s not worth being close to my aunt) so my only options are Northern Europe, Canada or Australia (sorry the rest of Europe your either not freedom enough, thereâ€™s a slim chance I could run into my aunt or your the uk or Ireland) so either way Iâ€™m going to be either in Australia or cold
