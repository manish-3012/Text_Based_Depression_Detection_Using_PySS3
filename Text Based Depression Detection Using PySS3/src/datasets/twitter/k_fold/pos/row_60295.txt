I should like calm down perhaps I saw one of my friends' status saying that they are not feeling good at the moment and they might not respond to any texts. I don't know how many hours it has been since they set their status to that but I reached out to them anyway, asking if everything's alright.

It's been two days and they haven't read it or respond to my text, which I'm fine with it since they said they might not respond to texts, and they probably just need some time to themselves.

However, I can't stop worrying for them because what if they've already done something to harm themselves??

All I can do is to wait and hope that they are okay, i guess.
