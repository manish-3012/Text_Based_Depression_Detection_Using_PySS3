Arrival is a beautifully made movie I never really appreciated it for what it was when I saw it in 2016, and after reading [Story of Your Life](http://raley.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/Reading/Chiang-story.pdf), the book it's based on, everything made so much more sense. The [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8hV_8a8y0), is so incredibly beautiful, it somehow encompasses the stages of life and it's subtlety and somber tone makes it akin to funeral, birthday, and wedding music all at once.
