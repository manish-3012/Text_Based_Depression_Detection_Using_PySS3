Childhood Is A Strange Thing I woke up this morning to multiples messages from the girl Iâ€™ve been seeing on/off for the past year.

She moonlights as a stripper on the weekends in the city  (19, Australia, legal).

Sheâ€™d been trialling at a new club, gotten a little too drunk, and forgetting where sheâ€™d parked her car.

After walking around for 3 hours trying to find it, she ends up (due to some poor decision making, some stress, and some inebriation) crashing with 2 of her clients who sheâ€™d never met before.

So here I am, busting my ass driving into the city to get her out of this situation.

Who knows if she can trust these guys? Sheâ€™s never met them, they donâ€™t even know her real fucking name. 

The city is huge, thereâ€™s dozens of car parks within a 3 block radius of the club she works at. Are we even going to find her car?

Amidst all the anxious thoughts flying through my head, one prevails.

Where did my childhood go? 

Iâ€™m a goddamn teenager, why do I find myself in these situations?

Iâ€™m turning 20 next year
I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m turning 20, I barely even feel like Iâ€™m 19

Everything is so complicated, I go to sleep thinking about how I can afford the next service on my car, whether I can still hang onto my friends from high school, and how foreign the concept of moving out of my parents house is to me, despite the fact that another one of my friends moves out every week.

As the day progresses, luck seemed to have it out for us that day. My friend was safe, we found her car, we went home.

Never in my life would I thought Iâ€™d have to rescue my stripper pseudo-girlfriend from a night of semi-drunken amnesia and men sheâ€™d never met before.

Am I still a kid? Am I an adult?

The world feels so different then it did 4 years ago.

Thereâ€™s no moral here, youâ€™ll all experience it.
