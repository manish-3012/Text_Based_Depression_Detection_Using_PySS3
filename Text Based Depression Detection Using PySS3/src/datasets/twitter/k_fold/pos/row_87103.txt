My teacher's handwriting just made the entire class laugh, and she's clueless why So our teacher wanted to write '4 whorls are arranged on the Thalamus'. But her cursive made the L look like E and everyone thought it's '4 whores are arranged on the Thalamus'. Everyone burst out laughing (or it's digital equivalent - spamming LOLs in the chat). 





She was soo clueless lmao.
