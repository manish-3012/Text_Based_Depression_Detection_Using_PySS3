Im leaving home tomorrow no not like abandoning. I live in Hong Kong and the political turmoil got worsen. By that i mean the national security law made public critising of the government technically illegal. its intentionally made vague so they can arrest you for darn near any critisism you say. Fortunately my family is wealthy enough and have enough backgrounds to send my brother and I to study overseas and ensures my parents a home at my mother's country.Im leaving for the flight tomorrow so thats dope time to suffer in a dry seat for 13 hours.

that said i found out you people don't use grills made from oil drums. like seriously wtf they are big, durable(my family used the old one for over 5 years, then replaced it with an identicle one) and CHEAP. Like 50 USD. apparently a small micro grill costs 90. the fuck. 

Also what the fuck does the UK people do i want to know beyond fish and chips and white chocolate from that 1 tea chain store
