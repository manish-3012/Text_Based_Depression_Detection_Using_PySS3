I fucking hate newyork and all these fucking Democrat mayors. I went to a Walmart upstate where they sell guns and we (me my step day and mom) bought a .223 rifle in April, anyway we ran out of ammo for it (we were using it at the range) so we went to Walmart in Sunday and my step dad isnâ€™t a huge gun guy, he just wanted it for self defense, so he didnâ€™t remember the caliber but I know the caliber of the guns because Iâ€™m basically a gun nerd, anyway I asked the lady (store clerk) for .223 rounds (my step dad was right next to me) and she gave us a attitude and said â€œnot for youâ€ so I said â€œyeah Ik itâ€™s for him, itâ€™s not my gunâ€ so she responded â€œwe canâ€™t help u because u asked for the ammo, itâ€™s the lawâ€. So I asked what law and she said â€œI canâ€™t sell ammo if a kid asks for it firstâ€ (no such law in newyork). I fucking hate this state, I want to move to Texas so I can buy a ar-15 at 8 years old with no questions asked. If Iâ€™m with my parent u have no right to refuse your service, especially if u donâ€™t own the store.
