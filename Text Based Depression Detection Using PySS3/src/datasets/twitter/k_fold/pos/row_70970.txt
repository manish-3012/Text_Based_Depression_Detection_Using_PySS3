Alright, another pedophile. This one started off with a red flag, he asked me if I'm interested in adults. Of course I responded with I'm up for chatting but nothing else, I'd rather confirm what the guy is after. We talked for close to two hours, mostly about issues in our lives. Casual enough. (the guy is 33 &amp; I'm 13) Somehow the conversation turned to being about paranormal stuff &amp; he asked how old the house I live in is. Not a weird question for the topic. Then he started saying things like fuck the toxic people, which is agreeable. 

I had mentioned to him that I didn't have a family before, which after a while he went on to say "I can be your daddy. I mean that sexually and nonsexually). Then he said he saw pictures of me and that I'm a cute little boy &amp; " Daddy likes his little boys tiny".  I asked him why he doesn't think about getting in trouble for being a child predator, of course he answered with: 'You can't help who you are attracted to, of course I would never want to make you uncomfortable I wouldn't force a child to do anything.' After that he started describing what he'd do to me, so I reported him. (I didn't block him, I get the feeling I'll need further evidence of his behavior.)
