how much more do I got left in me life is a chore that I'm procrastinating. an event I dread. I dont find things fun anymore. just boring. all I'm doing is consuming time until I go to bed. I never talk to more than one of my friends and I've become very antisocial. the kid who sparked up conversations with the cashier is now the kid who thinks people are laughing at home for breathing weirdly. I ask the question how much more do I got left in me every day, but I never have a response. I'm in a relationship but I never talk to my girlfriend. she doesnt usually talk to me. I still love her, but does she love me? these are the questions that drag me farther down into depression. 

I make up fake conversations with myself where I'm liked and popular. but it's to mask how empty I feel. nothing makes me feel anything anymore. I could cut myself untill I bleed but that wouldnt even do anything. why even do I get out of bed?

I never want to spend a day doing anything but sleeping. nothing in the world gets any better anyways. more bad news everyday. it's gotten so bad I've neglected my hygiene. how much more do I got left in me? I dont know. but I can tell you it's not enough.

on the off chance you read through this, thank you. I really needed a place to wright down everything on my mind. I needed a place to put my thoughts. so thank you for reading through them. and have a wunderbar day
