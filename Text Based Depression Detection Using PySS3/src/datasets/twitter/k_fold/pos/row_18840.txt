Favorite thing to do during a zoom I love to watch my friends lean in when I private message or text them that they look cute/nice on my zoom screen. Then they smile or laugh all bashful and their responses are so cute. They always go from looking bored and tired to smiling and itâ€™s just the best feeling.
