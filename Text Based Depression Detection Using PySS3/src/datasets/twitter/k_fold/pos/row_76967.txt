A bit of a rant I'm a fencer. I've worked out hard every day since I was fucking 6 years old, all so I can train to be better. I have a trainer, I have a home gym with weights and all that shit, stationary bike, etc etc etc (technically my parent's but I'm the only one who uses them regularly). However, I just can't seem to get into fucking good shape. I'm fairly muscular (at least my legs are) but even though I work extremely fucking hard it just seems to be for fucking nothing. I eat healthy, I've cut back on what I'm eating and how much, and I still can't get shit done. It pisses me off and embarrasses me to see that I'm not in the same shape as my peers- While I can win against them in fencing, fitness-wise I cannot match up. I already know I'm lacking in the looks department in general, and this isn't helping at fucking all. I'm not sure what to do at this point.
