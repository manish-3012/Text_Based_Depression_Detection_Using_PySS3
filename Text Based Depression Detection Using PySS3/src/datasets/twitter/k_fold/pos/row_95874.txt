Damn! Iâ€™m going through a crisis! Iâ€™m 18 by the time Iâ€™m writing this and Iâ€™m about to turn 19 on April. Which let me thinking, damn... my youth has been wasted indoors recently... Iâ€™m having thoughts about once Iâ€™m an adult, I have to maintain the basic necessities, and the restrictions in my life, and currently about any fictional crush I have and some of them being called underage, worrying that in my future I could be a pedophile. Leaving my high school friends and teachers behind, knowing that I wouldnâ€™t say a last goodbye rather than just closing the zoom app, and still Iâ€™m feeling stressed about things like not completing some video games or finishing writing up fanfics.
