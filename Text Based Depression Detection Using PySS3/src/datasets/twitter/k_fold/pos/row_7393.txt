I feel like things are falling apart. And its my fault. It began when my brother got angry at him for picking him up for a mistake he made while talking to my dad (me and him do it alot to each other). Then my friend text to say they had found the love of their life and I was super happy for them. Then my brother and dad kept trying to cast a video of me to the TV even though I kept asking them not to.

They then both said they weren't very happy with me so I decided to go to bed early. My dad said that if I went early I couldn't go on my phone and I basically just said to him that I can do what I like and he can't stop me.

I'm in my room now and I feel like I have done everything wrong although writing it all down makes it seem otherwise. I can hear them all lying to my mom about how I acted.

I need help. What should I do.

Sorry if I ruined your day with this post its just I feel like reddit gives me support. Have a great rest of your day. :)
