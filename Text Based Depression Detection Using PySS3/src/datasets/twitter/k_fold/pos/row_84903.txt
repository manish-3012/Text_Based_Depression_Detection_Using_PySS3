I got a 0 on my test at the worst time Due to Covid 19, all the high schools in my area are not requiring us to take an entrance exam; instead, theyâ€™re judging us solely on our grades. Mine were good until Friday. My teacher told us that if we didnâ€™t follow the directions we will get a zero. Her directions were vague and i got a failing grade. I donâ€™t know what to do now and I feel like Iâ€™m not getting into any schools because of it.
 
Here are the directions if youâ€™re curious:
-Copy the test 
-Fill in the blank
