My mom can't take constructive criticism and it INFURIATES me. Like just now I was called into the kitchen because I forgot to put my dishes in the sink. Harmless right? So she did it once. I was going to say I was coming, but she yelled again within 3 SECONDS and asked me to do it again. So I came into the kitchen and did the thing and made a simple request.

ALL I ASKED was that she wait a little bit so I could say I was coming. Then she tried to turn it around on ME and said "WeLl If YoU hAd JuSt DoNe It In ThE fIrSt PlAcE i WoUlDn'T hAvE hAd To CaLl YoU" Which was in NO WAY important and then she said "you're trying to make me in the wrong" and I WAS JUST SO FUCKING PISSED.

Like she could've just said "Yeah sure I'll remember next time" but NOOOOO she had to make this a huge deal. As if a simple request that she wait a bit before calling again was like me telling her to go fuck herself.

Like she's a good mom, there's worse out there and she's never hit me once but god DAMN is she annoying
