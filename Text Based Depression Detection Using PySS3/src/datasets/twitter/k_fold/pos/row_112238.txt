I dodged a bullet. So it's like 6 AM where I'm at and I figured I'd share a story. So in 8th grade I had to do cyber school for a good half the year because I had missed a fuck ton of school. So while I'm just chilling and procrastinating, I get a call from a girl I didn't really know.



I pick up and it's a different girl I knew even less about. She asks if I know anyone who could love her. My response was immediately a "look, you're asking the wrong guy. I haven't been to school in months."



She sounds noticeably disappointed, so instead of awkward silence, I say "alright, well I'm gonna get back to doing whatever it is I do on a daily basis." To which she responds "alright, you go back to masturbating."



Like *fuck*, never have I heard someone so passive aggressive. I'm 100% sure I dodged a bullet because I found out from a mutual friend later on that she was toxic as hell. And I know she was planning on asking me out too because that same friend mentioned I was single and the girl immediately wanted my number.
