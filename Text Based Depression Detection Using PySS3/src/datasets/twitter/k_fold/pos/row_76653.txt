An Explanation Regarding The Current Discussions About Boys and Girls, Especially Statistics Should I put Trigger Warning: Rape? This post talks about some statistics and how some people ignore them.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I go at this subreddit, I see people arguing about rape statistics, And a lot of people seem to not know what they are talking about. Some people suggest that the rates are '1 in 4' to '1 in 71' (women and men respectfully) while some people argue that it is more like 1 in 38000 for both sexes. Both of these stats are wrong. The correct numbers are as stated in the CDC, which is 19% to 17%, women and men respectfully. The study that says only 1 in 71 men gets raped defines rape differently than what you would expect. To be honest, the CDC defines it the same way but at least they tell you their definition and then include "forced to penetrate" stats afterwards. And about the "only 1 in 38000 gets raped" thing. That's straight false, no explanation is needed.

Thank you for reading this, I know not many people will see it but I hope at least 2 people get to know what to say when the next time they see somebody talking about how "rape stats are inflated and actually should be 1 in a billion".

Edit: These statistics are based on a survey, so they account for cases that never went to court.
