Bruh I literally got called a colonizer for saying â€œI was born on American soil so iâ€™m a Native American but not a â€œNative Americanâ€ Like damn bro sure I worded it wrong but I had a bunch of people flaming me for no reason. Saying â€œyouâ€™re on stolen landâ€ like bruh I may be white but I had no choice of being born here and because of that have a birthright to be here. Not that hard to understand although I do wish Native Americans were given their own country a LONNNG time ago.
