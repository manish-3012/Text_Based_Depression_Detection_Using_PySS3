You have 3 buttons. Which one will you choose? You have three buttons. One will stop the world from imploding. Next will make it instant. The third has a chance of both. But if you use the first button, youâ€™ll endure many inconveniences and unsolvable minor problems, and will die in a week and will NOT go to heaven or hell. If you push the second, you wonâ€™t die, but youâ€™ll spend infinite pain and suffering while everyone goes to heaven and laughs at you forever. The third has a 75% chance of the second, and a 25% chance for the first, but youâ€™ll be able to time travel and change of history (Youâ€™ll still be suffering greatly if the first was picked). There are no loopholes that you can take, you must only choose one. Everyone is a lifeless robot that does not matter, and your fate is all that matters. Which will you choose?
