help im sorta panicking so i went on a website that was blocked by my internet service provider (sky) and it said it was blocked so i clicked away and closed the tab. Will my parents get a notification telling them that i went on a blocked website or will anything at all be said from my internet service provider of what i have searched? im in the uk btw.
