Ok kinda gotta share Ok so I was walking home with 3 of my friends, and one of them I have a crush on and have for a while. The thing is there is this fruit tree in my school that she sees if there are any ripe fruits on. I, cause at the the didn't know, asked what she was doing. This got us into a conversation about it then we started talking about something else. She near the end of the road where me and my 3 friends split up, mentioned it again and we stopped to talk about it. Now the thing is she asked if I wanted to go fruit picking with her. At that time i was just idly chatting. When we split up I went on my phone. Then I froze and thought: "wait does that count as a date?" And asked my mum. (Also asked for 2 book series that I would recommend being thrown of glass and crown of thorns) she didn't know. What does everyone here think?
