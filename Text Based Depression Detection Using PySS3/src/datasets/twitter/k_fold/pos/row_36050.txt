Does anyone on this subreddit that's around 17-19 also feel like they wasted majority of their teenage years? I'm currently 17, turing 18 in September and tbh I'm just realising how I wasted the majority of my teenage years. Yeah I still got a few months left till i legally become an adult, but I didnt do much until I was 16. Honestly, I've only been fully enjoying my teenage years for a year; which is depressing if you consider the fact they last for 6 years depending on your culture (some countries you're classified as a teenager since the age of 11). But, I'm lowkey grateful for the last year and even this year if I'm honest , I was able to enjoy being a teenager to the fullest. I started going to house parties, getting in and out of relationships, making new friends, finding a proper hobby, finding interests such as getting into fashion and lots more. However, I still can't stop feeling like majority of my teenage years were wasted because I was insecure, lacked social skills and had an incel phase. Still though, I'm glad I fixed up and started working on myself, but I just wish I done it sooner.
