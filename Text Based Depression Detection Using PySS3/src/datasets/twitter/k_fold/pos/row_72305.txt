So uhh my parents and I decided to go to a beach We do it itâ€™s fun
Now we go to the top of the building behind the beach
We are there
A Christian priest shows up on the beach (currently talking about the rapture)
And there is some people eating near us
Then we smell a smell, a smelly smell
weed
Some people near us are smoking weed
And the place with the priest is far away (a 5 story floor tall and another long)
Then the priest starts saying
â€œMarawana, it may give you happiness now but only god can give eternal happinessâ€
