Blue light + Insomnia =/= happy me I almost came out to my dad today but I wimped out but lucky me I had a 3 hour panic attack. Now my side hurts so much and anytime I move it stings. Its 4:10 AM for me and I have to wake up at 9 to do yard work and take care of a giant dog that isnt well trained. My last chance to come out to my dad is saturday because im going back to my moms on sunday.
