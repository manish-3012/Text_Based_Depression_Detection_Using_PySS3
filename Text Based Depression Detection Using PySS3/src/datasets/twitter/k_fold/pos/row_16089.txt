Google family link Am i the only one that thinks google link is bad i dont have it but my friends mother i stalled it on my friends phone and it makes the battery shit and it cant even be removed. Also why buy a expensive smartphone if you're gonna block all smart features of the phone ? To all the parents who think it is an amazing program you kid wont have a good relationship with you when they grow older.
