Shopping IS AWFUL Finally was allowed to go out to London, a place other than trees and forests (Iâ€™ve only been on picnics for 5 months)

And I have to say... shopping is terrible.. before you walk in, thereâ€™s these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in, and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning.

Then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you (also very uncomfortable), you canâ€™t actually touch any beauty products, like perfume etc... (why would I go shopping if I canâ€™t touch or try anything on?)

I had the same experience at every other shop, and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask... it was not a pleasant experience.

I donâ€™t think I want to go back to shopping ever again if thatâ€™s how uncomfortable itâ€™s going to be, I think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores, the future will be completely online, and social distanced... and itâ€™s scary.

Anyways, I donâ€™t think anyone would care enough to read about what I did today, but if you did, what do you think the future will look like?ðŸ˜‚
