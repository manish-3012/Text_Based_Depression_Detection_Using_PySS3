Y'all ever get hyped to draw something, you think it will look awesome, then you go and draw and it looks like ass? yeah, it sucks. I'm a pixel "artist" (i say it like that because im dog shit at it), and i have all these cool art ideas for games, and then when i go to draw them, they are the art equivalent to a pile of dog shit
