My friend lost her phone for months for an absolute bullshit reason, any advice? Okay so basically, my friend lost her phone because she couldn't keep her grades up, which is reasonable, but then she got all A's and B's on her report card, and they won't give it back yet. They gave it back for Christmas, but they're gonna take it again tomorrow when the break ends, and they've taken her phone for a year before, so it's not just gonna be for a week or something. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her phone back? Her parents are very unreasonable, she's told me stories. This sounds like I'm being dramatic, but I have no ways to contact her apart from school inboxes, which the school can monitor, so that's kinda my last resort. Does anyone have advice on how  she can convince her parents to give it back?
