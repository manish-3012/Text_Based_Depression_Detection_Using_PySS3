A thought experiment on racial slurs I wondered this morning why certain people are allowed to say racial or sexist insults, for example black people saying the n-word, and males saying "Oh us men are just dumb haha." I'm sure it's fine in most cases, since it seems to be socially acceptable, and it's not gonna change anytime soon. 

But, I thought, would there be a way to make it seem wrong to say such things? This is what I came up with

So, the n-word is a slur against all black people yes? So that would mean that if a black man were to use said word, he'd be insulting every gender within that race (besides males, since he is a male). Which means that a black man saying the n-word could be considered him attacking all black women, bisexuals, homosexuals, etc, meaning that the word is both sexist and homophobic.

Same thing with sexist remarks. If a white man says "Ahaha, sorry, us men are dumb" apologetically after a mistake, then every single race besides white people would individually drop a tactical thermonuclear warhead on his location

I laughed when I thought of that haha, hope someone else finds it funny
