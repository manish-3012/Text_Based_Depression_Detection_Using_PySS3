Not again ðŸ˜” I got teamed up with someone in a lab. So what that means is we we work on the lab doing sciency stuff and in a week or so we have to give in a lab report

So far I've been doing all the work . He's not a slacker, he's actually a good kid but he ain't helping me on this lab report. 

He left me on read today (again)

I have a math test, history test and I have to write some weird article,  somI just can't be able to finish *all* this lab report stuff lol

What should I do?
