A message to the mods (discord mods) Can I please be unbanned from the discord server? I've literally been banned for the past 2 months even though [the message that I got said that it was a two day ban](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/755066925024804873/798961760295977020/unknown.png). I've messaged two mods about it. One said that it was an IP ban and that they could do nothing, and the other one said "to our stuff you ain't banned".
