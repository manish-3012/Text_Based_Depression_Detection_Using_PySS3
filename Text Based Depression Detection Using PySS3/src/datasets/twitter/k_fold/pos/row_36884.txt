Does anyone have a Musescore pro account? I know this isn't the best subreddit to ask on, but r/music and all the others couldn't help me, and I thought some of you people might be composers who use Musescore. I really need music downloaded ( [https://musescore.com/user/31117075/scores/6040235](https://musescore.com/user/31117075/scores/6040235) ) for editing in the Musescore application but I don't have a pro account, could anyone help me out?

It's for a project I'm doing with a bunch of friends (from the orchestra I play in) and I need to re-arrange it for the appropriate instruments.

It would be a great help if someone could help me with this :)
