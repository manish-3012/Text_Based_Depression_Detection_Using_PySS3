I've saved over 3k! I'm 13 years old and have not spent over $200 of my money ever. I have managed to save up to over $3000 and I am really happy. I don't know if this is a lot for you guys but it is a lot for me :\]. I'll probably keep saving but maybe I'll buy something big one day idk.

I've gotten this money from relatives for holidays and birthdays, occasional neighbor pet care, busking with my banjo, a health study, and I had like 3 years where I probably made $50 of allowance a year. So yeah!

If you guys really want something that costs a lot, just try not spending any money for a little while. It gets easier and easier the longer you do it. It definitely helped me that I live not a walkable distance from any malls or stores too...
