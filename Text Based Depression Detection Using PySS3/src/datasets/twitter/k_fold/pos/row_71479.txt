redditor doesn't do shit about their life, complains anyway i accidentally met a girl i used to go to elementary with â€“ my friend was doing an instagram live with her, and when she mentioned who i was(i left a comment under the live) that girl from elementary started screaming and saying hi and all that shit. 

i used to be really weird in elementary school, i didn't talk at all and couldn't even fucking walk properly, so the fact that she remembers me as that horrendous little creature will be haunting me forever. 

also it hurts to see my previous classmates, yk, succeed in their lives and all that while I've just grown up to be â€“ well, not that horrendous anymore, thank goodness â€“ a mediocre creature that complains on reddit for a living:)
