I know this is very stereotypical shit but I really need some help So one of my greatest and best friends just admitted to liking me and I donâ€™t know what to do. I mean I like her too and sheâ€™s an amazing person but I donâ€™t know if I should admit it back to her. I recently got out of a relationship roughly 3ish weeks ago because of reasons Iâ€™m not going to disclose( it was peaceful not anything bad). Iâ€™m worried about not being enough or having things change or us growing apart or not being able to really be together because of the virus and the quarantine. You donâ€™t have to help me if you donâ€™t want but if you have any tips or pointers please tell me. 

Btw- we are both 14 years old and freshman in the same high school

And yeah yeah I know â€œ14 and already starting a second relationship, weâ€™ve got a player on our handsâ€. No, no Iâ€™m not my previous relationship was with a friend who I had known for less than a year and it just didnâ€™t work out and the last thing I want to do now is hurt one of my best friends. And anyways Iâ€™m already calling myself out on the whole player thing because thatâ€™s how I would view myself and I really donâ€™t like that feeling
