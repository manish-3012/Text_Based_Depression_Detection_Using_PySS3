How it feels to get rejected a lot of times So me and my crush have been texting each other everyday for almost 2 years now. We started texting on February 2019 and i told her that i have feelings for her on august 2019. Then on September 2019, I first got rejected and it hurt a lot. We didn't text each other for 1 month. Then she texted me talking about school and stuff and playing online games. It lasted until March this year and rejected me again. She told me that she feels guilty for not having any feelings for me and told me that we should stop texting because dhe doesn't want me to be hurt anymore. It hurt again. But it didn't feel like the first rejection. The first rejection felt more heartbreaking. Then she came back again texting me saying "yo how's life?"  So I was happy. We started texting each other again everyday and sometimes I tell her I miss her and shit like that and got rejected everytime. Then today, i just got rejected again that made me stop saying the i miss you shits. This time it made me feel scarred. But it also feels like it didn't hurt at all. I've been getting rejected almost everyday. These rejections doesn't hurt me anymore. Its like i have a heart of stone now. Too many rejections can actually change people.
