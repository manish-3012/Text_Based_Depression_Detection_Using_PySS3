(Poem) â€œLearning how to walk againâ€ 
It was second nature, not that long ago,

on auto-pilot 

Doing what needed to be done

With a fire, burning and raging inside 

A fire that settled for nothing less,

Always chasing perfection 

A constant, fierce, raging, fire 


And then, something switched 

Its fuel, diminishing 

Its ferocity, turned tame

Its luminosity, decreasing 

Its heat, dissipating 

Its flames, dead 

And all thatâ€™s left, 

Are ashes 


A cold, barren, lifeless field

With winds, bringing more chill 

A place where one can get lost in 

If heâ€™s not careful 




But thereâ€™s a spark,

A spark that will always be there,

No matter how small 

A spark that wants to be ran with,

That **needs** to be ran with 

And I...

I havenâ€™t forgotten about it 


Iâ€™m rekindling the fire 

Iâ€™m learning how to walk again
