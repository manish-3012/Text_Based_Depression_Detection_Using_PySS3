I should not have my permit right now Got pulled over for the first time today in about 6-7 months of driving? Was driving my dads SUV with a weird ass steering wheel so it looked like I was swerving in between lanes. Officer flashes his lights behind me and Iâ€™m signaled to pull over to the right. In doing so, my nervousness gets me and I hit a god damn curb. To add to all this, my sister is in the back who I legally cannot drive. Officer is cool as hell and just looks at my permit and says youâ€™re fine and letâ€™s me go. I think Iâ€™ll stick to driving my Camry
