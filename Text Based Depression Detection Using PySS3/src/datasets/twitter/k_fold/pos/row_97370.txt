Well... this goes down as one of the worst days of my life. Alright so the day starts off with my sister waking me up 3 hours before I normally do telling me something not important at all, then after that I had to work around the house for 5 hours, then I lost like 6 hours of progress in subnautica due to my game crashing, and THEN my bully decided to hop back into my life, AND THEN I lost more friends because of him AND FINALLY I got friend zoned by a girl Iâ€™ve liked for almost 4 years now.


this day sucks.
