Parallel Lines (109) Healing. Different Layers. Different times of life. Am I ok? Yes. Months go by and then Bam, full circle. I know I have grown, but as I always tell myself, growth is radical, this is solely release. 

Release comes unexpectedly, it comes in flashes when it paralyses you for moments, minutes, hours, the timeline isn't determined. 

Life is truly beautiful, the moments of happiness, the moments of sadness, the moments of joy, the moments of pain. Embrace. Feel. Be present with. Release. When we feel something that is wanting to come out, we have to allow it, cry through, be present with it and even though it might question, have we grown? We have to look at everything that has been done, focused on, changed since that moment of initial cause. 

Breathe. Crying is powerful. Sitting in emotions is powerful. Being with yourself and giving that time for yourself is powerful. Healing comes in the form of accepting all emotions, not just "being happy". Goosebumps. Wide awake. 

I love you.
