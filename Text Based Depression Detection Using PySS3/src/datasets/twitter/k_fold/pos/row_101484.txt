been sober for a month now so yeah I've been so sober from weed for about a month, it's been kinda hard tbh, I've been thinking about it here and there but ik I shouldn't, it never ends well and I just become a lazy ass, and it's a waste of money, I do miss smoking tho, it was fun and idk relaxful, it would help with my adhd a lot, would slow down my thoughts and shit but it's not a great way to help it in the long run, just feels good in the moment, but yeah been sober for a month, don't know when I'll be smoking again, idk if I should or like when I do I'll be smoking like maybe once every two weeks not everyday like I how I did before
