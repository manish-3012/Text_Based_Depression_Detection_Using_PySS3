Just occurred to me that technically Iâ€™m one of the old ones here, so hereâ€™s some wisdom. 1. Exams donâ€™t decide your life

2. Just ask your crush out, better to get rejected than to spend years torturing yourself

3. See a therapist 

4. Hug your family/friends

5. Get a dog, if you already have a dog - get another dog

6. Donâ€™t do hard drugs/smoke

7. Donâ€™t rush to have sex/get in a relationship - wait until youâ€™re ready. Itâ€™s not a race

8. Donâ€™t be a dick

9. Have a good day!!
