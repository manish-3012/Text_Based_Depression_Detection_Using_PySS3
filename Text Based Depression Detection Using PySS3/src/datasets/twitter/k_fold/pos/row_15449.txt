Recovering from depression caused by a Video Game Community So I know this may get downvoted but Iâ€™ve been a huge follower of super smash bros e-sports the past 2 years. 

When I heard the news in July that prominent smash players could be pedophiles, it put me in a bad state of depression, where I didnâ€™t leave my house for about 5 months and I didnâ€™t want to play smash. 

However today I took a big step and walked to the shop to get a chicken sandwich and even played my favorite game again (smash) for about 1 hour. Things are looking up for me it seems and I just wanted to share story to get this off my chest since I have no one else to talk to. Thank you.
