Day 14 of posting the phrase liquid whales until I get a girlfriend (or more likely forget to post) Iâ€™d do anything  

In my power 

To see you see you just smile 

I want you to come prosper 

And come proper 

Even if that means I ainâ€™t by your side 

Devil on my shoulder tellinâ€™ me Iâ€™ll die soon 

I donâ€™t really want that to impact you 

But I donâ€™t know, maybe Iâ€™m just paranoid 

I just want whatâ€™s best for you, I just want whatâ€™s left of you 

Oh, youâ€™re telling me youâ€™re sad inside 

Iâ€™m sad that I canâ€™t satisfy 

Yeah, I pray I get it right this time 

Maybe weâ€™ll be alright
