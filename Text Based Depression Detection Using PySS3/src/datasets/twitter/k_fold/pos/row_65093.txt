I took my gameshare back so my ex doesn't get my games Title says it all pretty much, she and I were long distance for 2 years, we broke up about 2 weeks ago due to her getting upset about me telling her what hurt me, and her being controlling. She no longer gets my xbox live gold or my games I have, and I feel pretty cool
