Why do people tell lies just for some karma points and awards. Few months ago a guy faked cancer just for karma and awards and recently someone faked that their father passed away and they repeated that yesterday by faking the death of their dog and their friend(Though no one fell for the trap this time)

It's pretty bad because people will stop believing the ones who are really going through such tough times.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
