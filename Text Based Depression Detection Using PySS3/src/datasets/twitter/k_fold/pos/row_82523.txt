A reason to ask your crush out. Clearly if you have a crush on somebody, youâ€™ve probably spoken to them for long enough and had a relationship on some level. If you were able to develop feelings for them in the amount of time that you did, itâ€™s 100% possible that they developed feelings for you as well. If youâ€™ve spoken to your crush and youâ€™re generally friends, you viewing them in a romantic way means that you felt something in the relationship with them. And they might feel something in the relationship with you. Also thereâ€™s no harm in telling somebody that you have feelings for them. Itâ€™s perfectly normal and you shouldnâ€™t be ashamed for feeling emotion towards a person. Ask them out.
