I want to be in charge of something I'm always taking orders from people doing as people demand it gets old but I'm the youngest in my family and I don't appear to be very effective at doing much really. I don't mind working in teams that's not a problem but I'm always being told what to do as if I'm just a robot following it's code I'm annoyed. It would just be nice for people to respect me for once at least a little. I'm sure you guys can relate
