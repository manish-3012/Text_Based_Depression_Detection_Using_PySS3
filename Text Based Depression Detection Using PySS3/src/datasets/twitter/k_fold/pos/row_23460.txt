Why do people hate overweight people? Iâ€™m overweight, Iâ€™m trying my very best to lose it but I despise the fact that we judge people so easily on looks and appearances. I used to be such a confident person until I realized that many people (and Iâ€™m sure a large portion of this sub) wouldnâ€™t talk to me simply because Iâ€™m the â€œdisgusting lazy fatsoâ€ that deserves to be laughed at. 

End rant, Iâ€™m just frustrated is all. No such thing as skinny shaming.
