Asked a friend his preference and he responded with this. Large boobs take away from the body, boobs are supposed to compliment the rest of the body, just as the rest of the body is support the boobs. Each thing has their own eroticness, but if it become too large, it ends up stealing the attention of the eyes. No one enjoys larges boobs, the enjoyers nor the retainer. The same thing can be applied to thighs. Yes, large thighs are great, but if they end up being larger than the butt, it no longer has the appeal of thighs, nor does it complement the rest of the body. This also applies to the butt. However, my main preference is not the size, but rather the shape. Again, it's needs to compliment the rest of the body, asking with complimenting the body itself, without stealing the attention of everything else. The can be applied to everything else, wether is be the nape, feet, or stomach.
