Making the most of your life I just made a post asking for your help, so now I will explain. For my AP language arts and composition class, I have been assigned to make a â€œpassion projectâ€ in which I find something Iâ€™m passionate about and make a â€œthingâ€ based off it. Thatâ€™s about it lol. So I need your help in answering the question above. What have you been doing to make the most out of your life? This is especially important right now in the midst of this pandemic, itâ€™s important to appreciate the little things and take time to enjoy the things you love as well and take the time to step out of your comfort zone. My main goal is to inform others on the importance of making the most out of your time, but also to help explain HOW to do so. So this post is designed to have a discussion about what youâ€™ve been doing to make the most of your time, as well as help others who may be struggling right now. Thank you :)
