No such thing as a fresh start with school Do fresh starts even exist if you keep fucking up the opportunity? It's always the same old bullshit when it comes to school. I get to school after a long break feeling refreshed and somewhat confident, then I fall behind on my work because it's all useless-ass, boring shit. Then I lose my mind because all I have all this dumbass work to do all at once, then comes the extensions and the excuses because I go crying to my councilor like the little bitch I am, and I somehow manage to pass the semester. I fucking hate myself. I wish I was my sister. She gets A's because she works hard, I get A's because I break down and people feel bad for me. I'm not gonna fucking make it in this world if I don't improve some shit, and I don't even know how to do that.
