Been doing homework all day i still have more to go, Iâ€™ve been giving myself breaks because Iâ€™ve been doing good, I was starting to feel better about myself and my mom comes into my room and asks me if Iâ€™m just too lazy to vacuum the living room and clean the tables and then clean the dishes. Today is a rough day for my mental health, Is anyone else having a tough day today?
