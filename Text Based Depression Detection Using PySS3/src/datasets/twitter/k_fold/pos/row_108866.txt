Flirting/Girl help I feel like an idiot for posting this but I don't know what to do  


so in my class there are about 12 of us, and out of the 12, there is no-one I can relate to. out of everyone, I am the most backward, so its hard for me to relate and talk to normal people. There is this girl that I have liked for a year and a half, and i'm tired of having these feelings and not being able to talk to her because I feel like I cant.  


How do I flirt with people, and let her know i'm interested.
