Am I the only one who loves country? I know it kinda has a redneck American stereotype but I find that country is one of the most entertaining and interesting type of music.

I got stopped by a random dude and he make me listen to â€œGodâ€™s Countryâ€ by Blake Shelton and I just fell in love with the song.

So, whatâ€™s your opinion on country?
