Would it be alright to talk about the stuff youâ€™ve got in songs if youâ€™re not flexing, but rather just proud of your accomplishments I wanna do music at some point btw. And I donâ€™t mean like â€œrolly on my wrist Iâ€™ve got more shit than youâ€ I meant more like â€œrolly on my wrist cause I wanted it then earned itâ€ (I donâ€™t care about Rolexes btw, itâ€™s just an example)
