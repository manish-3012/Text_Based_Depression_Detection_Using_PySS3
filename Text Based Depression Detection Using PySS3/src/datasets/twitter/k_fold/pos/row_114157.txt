Malware from clicking the image ads on YouTube? So I was on my iPhone on YouTube and I clicked one of those annoying ass ads beneath the video which shows up as an image and redirects you to a site. I donâ€™t remember the site but seemed to be a sketchy news article or something. Is there any way that my iPhone could have gotten a virus or malware from clicking on the ad and getting to the site?
