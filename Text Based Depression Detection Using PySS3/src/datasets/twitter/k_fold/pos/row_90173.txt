I care about my money and I think I can't go to a psychologist because of this so waste your time on me I fucked up 

my crush is a lesbian (i don't have a problem with her orientation)

 but I loved her and I think I will never find a girl that is normal for me

just can't understand do people of my age have a real partner

or I'm just unlucky 

P.s I met one girl cute one but she has an addiction to TikTok.

we had chat, so realize 2 teenagers going to watch a movie but before the movie starts they starting talking about their relationship. she gets a telephone from her pocket and start dancing

and I had a face like wtf we are talking about our relationship and u are dancing. I said that something happened and I need to go
