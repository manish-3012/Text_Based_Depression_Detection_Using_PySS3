It be one of those days Last night, I tried to talk to my girlfriend about about a worry/feeling Iâ€™ve been having and I just feel like in an attempt talk to her more and explain the problem my brains been having I pushed her further away. I just wanted to talk to her about how I feel but because I suck at talking about my feelings, I made things worse. 

Iâ€™m not even really asking for advice on what to do, Iâ€™ve just been down about it because I feel like I ruin everything I try to help
