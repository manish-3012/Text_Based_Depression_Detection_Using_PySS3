Going into hiding now. I had a dream that me and my biology teacher engaged in ritual combat. I had two daggers that could conjoin at the handle to create a one-handed, double edged blade. She had a massive meat grinding hammer. 
At the center of the arena, she tried to get me in the knees. I jumped up and slashed her across the face with my dagger. I stumbled when I landed, causing me to fall onto my knees. Mid-way through getting up, my biology teacher stepped on my foot and broke my left shin with the hammer. She hit me in the nose with the back end causing me to fall over into my back, and she finished the battle with a downward strike to my right shin, breaking it instantly.

I told this to my biology teacher in class, and she said â€œHahaha, thatâ€™s hilarious!â€ 

Iâ€™m going into hiding now.
