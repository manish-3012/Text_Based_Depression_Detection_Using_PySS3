My body craves that quick dopamine shot, but I donâ€™t need it. No I donâ€™t. Nope. I wonâ€™t masterbait. I. Donâ€™t. Need. It. I can live without it. I can survive without it. My body is sad just because I donâ€™t have dopamine. I wonâ€™t give it to you, brain. Do not even think about it. Maybe Iâ€™m going crazy, but I still donâ€™t need it.
