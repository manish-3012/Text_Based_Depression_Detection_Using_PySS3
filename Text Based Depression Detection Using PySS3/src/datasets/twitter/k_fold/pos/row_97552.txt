I am learning about Islam for my World History class. I am not religious myself, I just have to say, I was ignorant about your religion. But, now, I have get respect for Muhammad and your beautiful religion. The message of helping the poor is a great message, and I hope Muhammad goes up there as one of the. great prophets of history with Jesus, Moses, Abraham, and Buddha.
Love from America guys!
