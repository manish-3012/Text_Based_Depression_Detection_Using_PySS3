Hold up I gotta rant for a quick sec I work my ass off for 2 weeks straight, buying a journal, writing down my goals, working hard everyday. Hell, I haven't even played a videogame in 2 weeks. But the moment I take a break for 2 days just to get some rest, my dad rides my ass about how I need to start fucking self improving. What the fuck!? I'm not looking for praise, but I get ridden for taking a small break? Dude wtf? Anyway. Thanks, I just wanted to rant. Love y'all.
