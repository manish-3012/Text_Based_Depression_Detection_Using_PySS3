Part.3 to the saga Tdlr: for the other pieces, i met this girl and im confused if she likes me or not its a mishmash long story short.

Onto this part. Well wednesday im supposed to meet up with her for bubble tea. But yesterday i asked where should i meet with her so we could go to the shop. She told me she'll let me know tommorrow night. I am a bit afraid that she might just either a. Just stand me up or b. Ghost me. Reason being she hasnt really been talking to me since i asked her if she wanted to get boba with me. Welp uh, ill stay posted.
