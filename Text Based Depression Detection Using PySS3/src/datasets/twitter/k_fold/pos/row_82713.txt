I seem to be a more feminine guy. But not necessarily in the way you would think. I dont try to be feminine. Or want to be. Like I dont change the tone of my voice. I dont wear makeup. I dont wear dresses. I dont have long hair (well, it's a bit shorter version of something similar to jim morrisons hair) ect.

I have muscles. I like alot of masculine things.

But I dont like watching sports. Though i like working out. Or beer. I dont like beer, I prefer hard liquor. Those are stereotypically masculine things.

I guess the main way to describe it would be to list off the mainly stereotypically feminine things I like. I live nature. I love animals. I'm fascinated with bugs.  I like clouds, sunsets and sunrises. I read all the time. Love books. Obsessed with self improvement. I'll buy the healthiest and best soaps. Best foods. I make art. I'm a photographer. I'm emotional, though I can still control my emotions. 

I guess I'm just the type of boy that would take a bug outside rather than kill it. That would admire a sunset. Pick flowers. Spend all my time reading a day dreaming. I'm not going to explain everything on depth. But yeah. Also, I know many men like these. It's just more common for women.
