Ladies ladies If you man can make the lights go out 

Can make the wooden boards go ra ta ta 

Can make the world seem slow

Tickle your nose and after that 

He can make your teeth fall out 

He can make you go bling as a bat 

He can make you feel dizzy 

And while your sleeping heâ€™ll feed you to his cat 

Then be careful thatâ€™s not your man thats a pumpkin
