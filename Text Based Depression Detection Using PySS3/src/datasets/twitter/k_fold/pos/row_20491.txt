Reached a whole new low today I think all of us have experienced rejection and being friend zoned,  but I found a whole new low today. A girl Iâ€™ve been hanging out with rejected me today before I even knew I liked her! She was like I know you like me and Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t feel the same. I was gonna say I donâ€™t like you to her but I stopped myself, realizing I did/do like her. :/
