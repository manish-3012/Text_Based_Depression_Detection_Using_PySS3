I need some serious help out here 

I dont know what to do with myself. 

I need help. I may just be your average 15yr old from London but i have a lot of issues. I dont know what to do- and no clue on how to type this out. Simply, i dont want to be alive. All I experience is pain. Im depressed. I feel like im failing school due to lack of focus which i cannot control. My parents are no help as theyâ€™re not great. They dont let me be â€˜meâ€™ and it really affects me. I dont really have friends as everyone turns out fake. Although, i have a good â€˜girl friendâ€™ but sheâ€™s tired of my bad thoughts as sheâ€™s experiencing a lot herself. I feel alone, without anything or anyone in this world. Everyone around me is living better- i wake up without much food in the fridge while theyâ€™re getting new phones, dogs, their parents are supportive etc etc. Which makes me jealous. Obviously making me a bad person. All i do is sit here, overthink and cry everyday. Im not allowed outside and my days consist of staring at walls for hours. The lockdown stuff isnâ€™t helping my mental health at all. Im not happy with how i look at all, i just get compared to my old â€˜friendsâ€™ which surprisingly look great. I dont know what to do anymore, im genuinely lost. Im scared for my future- im certainly wasting my own time and im not getting anywhere at all. I just dont know what to do or how to feel at all. The days go by so slow and it just gets worse as time goes on. Ive tried working out and eating healthier recently but Iâ€™ve just lost motivation (i tried â€˜improvingâ€™ myself). Help?
