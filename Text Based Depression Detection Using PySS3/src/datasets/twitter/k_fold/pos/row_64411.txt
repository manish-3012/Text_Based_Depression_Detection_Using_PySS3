Anyone else keep thinking what people would think if you died This is gonna sound really selfish but I just wanna know how everyone I know would react. Iâ€™m legitimately just living for my family because I wouldnâ€™t want to do that to them. But with everyone else?? I honestly canâ€™t say the same. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d care because they donâ€™t care right now. What are they gonna be sad all of sudden because Iâ€™m gone but not give a shit when Iâ€™m here? Fuck, I canâ€™t stop thinking about this. The thing is, if I died I wouldnâ€™t even know so then whatâ€™s the point. If Iâ€™m not even conscious to know then why??
