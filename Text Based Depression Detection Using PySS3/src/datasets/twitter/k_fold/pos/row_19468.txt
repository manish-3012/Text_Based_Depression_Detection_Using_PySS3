I debunked the bone marrow So basically bone marrow apparently you can make sperm  with it, so men are useless right, nope. Matter fact a man found it out, and plus it has nothing to do to cater  those KAM pos, it was made to help people who canâ€™t get their partner pregnant, now I seen women on TikTok saying the baby would always be female thatâ€™s complete bullshit, and KAM is just childish, I know they are also going to make bone marrow eggs for gay men and men who have wives that canâ€™t get pregnant genetic kids. So bone marrow doesnâ€™t exist for only one gender, it exist to help lgbtq+ and infertile people have biological babies. I might be wrong on some stuff but thatâ€™s what I think bone marrow reproduction is going to be like.
