uhh... what happens if your dog eats raw egg ok so basically we leave our chicken fence open, and it turns out our dog was eating their eggs (donâ€™t worry, she doesnâ€™t attack the chooks)... no wonder we couldnâ€™t find their eggs to take inside ðŸ˜‚

but seriously, would our dog get salmonella? according to the internet it does, but my mum said that because theyâ€™re home chooks it might not be a possibility but idrk. i just want to make sure our dog is safe and that she wonâ€™t get sick (so far she hasnâ€™t been acting weird)
