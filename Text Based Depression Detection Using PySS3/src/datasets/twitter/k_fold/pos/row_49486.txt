2020 destroyed me 2019 is the year I was improving my social skills. I started having the courage to speak for myself and everything. Then 2020 came, the entire year of 2020 I hadnâ€™t socialized with anyone around my age. The entire time I spent home, I feel like my social skills were destroyed. Iâ€™ve lost a lot of progress. I start in person in fall this year. Iâ€™m screwed if I donâ€™t improve until then.
