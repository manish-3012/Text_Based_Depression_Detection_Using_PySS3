This grocery store encounter was a little too ironic and must be shared So i was in a grocery store near the house, when a old man, most likely in his late 40s, wearing a MAGA cap with the American flag on the backside of his electric wheelchair. Heres the ironic part, tho. He was wearing a face mask.

 a. face. MASK.

Im not sure if he was wearing it so he can grab what he needs without a fuss, or if it is for self preservation, but this boomer, with patrioticy coursing through his veins, wearing a face mask while Karens claims that not only do face mask take away american freedom, but also suffocates people and does nothing against the virus

Does anyone else find that ironic or is it just me?
