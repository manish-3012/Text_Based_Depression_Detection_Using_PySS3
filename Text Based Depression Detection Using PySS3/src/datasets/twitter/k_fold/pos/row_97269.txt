I am so clueless at some social concepts that im questioning if I'm even nuerotypical like, I have no idea what a date is, besides eating with someone at a restaurant. but at this age i can't imagine many teens are having dates at restaurants. I just have no idea what a date as a teen would be

I also have no idea what flirting is, like, none

I also have no fucking clue what 'signs' are, or what am example of one would be

idk im just bad clueless when it comes to some social concepts
