Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman The only reason Iâ€™m posting this is because I want to honor him, and it seems that no one else on reddit has. If you donâ€™t know Chadwick Boseman, he played Black Panther and Jackie Robinson in 42. Not only did he put on such iconic performances, he was a great guy. Chadwick passed away recently at the age of 43. Rest In Peace king, you deserve it.
