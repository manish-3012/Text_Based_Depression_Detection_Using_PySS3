It all feels pointless As the title says, everything i do just feels like it doesnâ€™t matter. I have a job, my classes this year are classes iâ€™m good at, Iâ€™m getting back into learning a second language after a few months of no motivation and my home life is good.

But ever since me and my girlfriend broke up, it all feels like a waste of time. Everything in my life for an entire year was geared towards working hard to get to Japan so that we could finally be together, and now all that time and energy is wasted. I feel like shit because i know its my fault we broke up too. But no matter how much we talk about it, and no matter how much we talk about other things, were always in the same kinda â€œweâ€™re friends, but not great onesâ€ kind of relationship. 

I just wish i had one more day with her, you know?
