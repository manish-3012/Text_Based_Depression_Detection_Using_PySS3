I might go to Japan Last year my uncle was planning to take me to japan for me graduating 8th grade but mostly because he also wants to go there. But now we might not be able to go next year because corona virus will most definitely be a thing the way America is handling it. Screw you karen if u just wore your mask and stayed quarantined we wouldnâ€™t be in this situation.
