So Iâ€™m mad and need some hope in females So in March I this girl I knew from school texted me and we started talking. It got more serious and ended up in a relationship a month later. She seemed so perfect. She was pretty, had an amazing personality and was so funny. I always tried treating her with love and making her feel important as she always had issues with self importance. I genuinely loved this girl. But one day she went to a party where she hooked up with some random guy. She then proceeds to always ignore me and when i asked whatâ€™s wrong she said Iâ€™m worth nothing to her. I only found out she cheated on my through the guy she cheated on me with and she still denies not doing anything. And not just that, but she waited to see if it works out with that guy or not. If not she would come back to me, and if yes she would brake up with me. Now as you can all imagine she broke up with me three nights ago and now Iâ€™ve lost all hope in females. I really thought she was different...
