I don't like dogs. People always says that a dog is loyal, brave, and a man's best friend. One day my family got 2 dogs and they were both stupid and kept being a hassle. One dog kept jumping over the fence and escaping, while the other kept pooping every where and always finds a way to get into my room just to poop. Society is wrong, and always idiotic, never contributing. Cats have severed much more of a purpose to me, as they don't want much from life and they actually stuck to their hunting tactics, sometimes gifting mere humans a free meal, like a rodent. In short dogs bad cats good
