I just fired an egg That's it, nothing special, it is however the first thing (exciting hamburger helper and the like) that I cooked on my own of my own initiative because I felt like eating, I feel so mature even though all I did was fry an egg and I'm 15, I dunno I just did something on my own and it feels nice I guess
