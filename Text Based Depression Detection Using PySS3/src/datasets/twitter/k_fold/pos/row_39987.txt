Iâ€™ve had a bad day I know this probably wonâ€™t get seen since there are thousands of members on this subreddit, but I need to get this off my chest.

My bad day started when I was in science. Keep in mind that my teacher barely teaches us shit, and we have to rely on notes in a format all of us hate to survive. I recently took a quiz, and failed it. My teacher called us illiterate yesterday since we â€œdidnâ€™t read the instructions properly.â€ Today we got it back and I missed most of the questions. This made me feel very bad, since I usually get straight Aâ€™s. 

In the middle of class, he got a phone call and answered it. They told him to send me to the office and to take my stuff. I put my things in my locker assuming I was going to get talked to.

I got to the office and my momâ€™s coworker (she works in the kitchen)  was there talking to the secretary. She told me to get whatever school stuff I need for the next 2 weeks.

My momâ€™s other coworker had tested positive for COVID and my mom had gotten herself a rest too, which turned out positive. 

Now, I have to quarantine for 3 weeks, at the beginning of a new quarter where my classes are going to get harder, and my teachers barely post anything on google classroom, so Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s going to happen to my grades.

In my opinion, the worst part is going to be breaking the news to my friends. Weâ€™ve been best friends since 4th grade and had plans for Halloween that we were so excited for and now we canâ€™t do anything.

If youâ€™ve made it to the end of this post, thank you for listening. Iâ€™m not asking for anything too fancy or a huge pity party. Iâ€™m just asking for some advice or comments to make this crappy day better. I wrote this post to vent, and since Iâ€™m done, I hope you all have great days.
