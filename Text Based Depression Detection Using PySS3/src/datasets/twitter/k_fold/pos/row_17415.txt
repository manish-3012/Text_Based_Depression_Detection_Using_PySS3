I found someone- but he lives an hour away. Sooo Iâ€™m 14. Young ik. Anywayssss, I started talking to this guy and I really really like him, and the best part is, he likes me back! Except for the fact we live an hour away from each other. I originally met him through his best friend who I met at a basketball game in his hometown. Now, we both like each other but canâ€™t do anything other than FaceTime and snap. It sucks. Heâ€™s a year older than me and he gets his license next year but idk.
