I can't speak to my best friend anymore One of my best friends, Jas, can only speak to me and my other friends through discord and yesterday his mother said he wasn't allowed discord. He made a new account, and he signed off last night saying "I'm going to sleep, speak to you guys tomorrow :)". And this morning we learn he's banned off social media forever, and we can never speak to him again. Only one of us lives near him and goes to his school, and me and his boyfriend have just asked her to hug him for us. Our entire discord server spent the day holding a memorial for him, we know he's not coming back. Not for a while at least. 

It's only been a day but it's so different already. He's my emotional support, he helped me through so much. He's like a brother to me, we'd have the best conversations and we'd swap cursed images. 

I miss him so much already. Everything's changed. I made him the new email so he could come back but it was for nothing.

I'll miss you, Jassy. I know he doesn't have Reddit and isn't allowed on social media so he'll never see this. But I miss you, Jassy.
