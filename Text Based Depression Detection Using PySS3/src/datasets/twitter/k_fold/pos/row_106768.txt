I want to get rid of my "fake" friends! What should I do? I'm in 8th grade and i think my friends are "fake". I want to get rid of all the toxicity in my life (fake friends etc) but i'm scared of the fact that i'll be lonely! I don't have any real friends i can rely on. We're only "playing" to be friends. In 1 year i'll go to highschool and most likely never see them again. But i'm scared of me being lonely for 1 whole year. How can i make real friends? Im so anxious and depressed right now because of this. 

P.S. i don't live in a big city so everybody knows everybody. it would be hard to make new friends...
