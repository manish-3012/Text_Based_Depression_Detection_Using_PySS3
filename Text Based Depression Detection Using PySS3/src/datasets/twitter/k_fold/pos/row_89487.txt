If you laugh at a story online your a psychopath I said it, if you are sitting alone in your room, or at home, then begin laughing while reading a story on r/tifu or something else, you are weird. I cant understand anybody who laughs out loud, at a story. I can understand a chuckle, be it from a meme, story or video, but a full on laugh? hell nah.
