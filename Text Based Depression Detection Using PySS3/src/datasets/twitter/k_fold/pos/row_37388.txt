I hate my RE teacher! So first off, I think someone in my class might read this, if so, hi Charlie, itâ€™s jody, pm me. Also, Iâ€™m using fake names (apart from Charlie) just coz my class isnâ€™t meant to know who this is

aight. So in RE today, we were focusing on why we might/might not be religious. Our teacher said on of the reasons we might not be is because a lot of religions donâ€™t agree with being gay. But he didnâ€™t say it that way. a kid at the back (letâ€™s call her freda) who I know has a girlfriend (and Charlie, if you read this, no you canâ€™t ask every girl individually if the are gay, you call them gay already), just curled up. She looked at me slightly distressed and forced a laugh. She then acted really wierd and upset after school.

sorry freda, that you had to sit though it.
