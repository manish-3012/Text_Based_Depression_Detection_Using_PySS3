Running for class president, anyone have any tips? Title pretty much says it all. If there are any high school class presidents on r/teenagers, please donâ€™t feel afraid to speak up. My campaign mainly revolves around jokes and humor, and itâ€™s worth noting that I go to an all boys school. With that in mind, any jokes to add to my speech/posters would be greatly appreciated. Or if you have any general tips it would do me a favor. Thanks!
