It's night and instead of sleeping, I wonder what to do I have a huge crush on this girl from my class and I regret that I didnt become friend with her when there was an opportunity to do so a few years ago.

She can get a boyfriend every day and I know that I'm wasting my time. And everywhere I looked for advice, everyone says "just talk to her". But someone who hasnt been in this situation will not understand that it is not easy.

So, right now I'm just self-pity but approach to my crush who I barely talk to even though we go to the same class for few years and who constantly talks to her friends, is fuckin impossible for me. 

Although that I would like to do something, I can only hope that a miracle will happen and somehow there will be an opportunity to talk to her.
