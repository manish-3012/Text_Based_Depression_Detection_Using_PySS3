My grandma screamed at me because of my clothes and I'm trying to not cry So backstory Im living with my grandma and my Uncle. My dad is dead my mom idk where is she I haven't seen her in 9 years. 

Anyways I'm living with them.

So today me and my friend wanted to go shopping because most of my clothes is from middle school and now I'm in high school. I asked my grandma for money and she gave me. 

I bought baggy pants and a jean jacket (a little big).
And some accessories. Those clothes felt like me. Idk how to explain it it's just felt right to wear them. 

So I went home and show them to my grandma. She started screaming and calling me an idiot and she won't give me again money. She told me if I wear them in public I'll be ugly. I left , I locked the door and she bang on my door to tell me those things again. Now I don't feel myself and I'm trying not to cry so she won't hear me. Overall my grandma is a sweet grandma but she only wants me to wear dresses and idk why she reacted like that.
