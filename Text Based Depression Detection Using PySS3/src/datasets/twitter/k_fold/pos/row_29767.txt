People that hurt animals Listen, im not playing games but i would commit very bad things if anyone would hurt my dog or whatever, this is probably for many people.

I just cant comprehend why some people feel the need to hurt a pet(didnt happen to mine tho) like whats wrong with u, if u see a lil puppy who would hurt that.

Oh and where i live dogs have been stolen too and its normal to not leave ur dog outside. Mostly happens to people who leave their dog outside of a store. If i where to walk with my dog and any mf tried to steal her i would be the last thing that person ever sees.
