I also recently got my first BJ, but gay. It sucked :( So my boyfriend texted me the other night while I was doing homework (first week of college and I have *three* papers to write, the fuck?!), â€œwanna come hang ;)â€. And I was like â€œyah!â€ ofc.

So we hang in his dorm for a while and it starts to get late and tbh weâ€™d had a couple drinks. We werenâ€™t drunk but we were a little tipsy. So he pulls me in real close and whispers in my ear, â€œhey man, wanna BJ?â€. And to be honest, I was so ready for this moment. Iâ€™d wanted it the whole night. To say I was excited was an understatement. I was so hungry for it.

So he gut up, went to the kitchen, and made me a butter and jelly. I was so excited, I had been hungry the whole night. I took a huge bite out of it and, tbh, it was way underwhelming. Gooey and just yuck. 0/10 would not eat again.

Itâ€™s the thought that counts though :) Iâ€™m glad to have such a caring bf.
