Guys I really don't know what to do (Serious) There's this girl, idk what she look like to you but she a 10 for me, I'm really falling for her but we talk on snap. The thing is, I've been on delivered for like 3 hours and she was last active 34 minutes ago, and this isn't a rare occurrence. Should I keep trying or just give up on her?
