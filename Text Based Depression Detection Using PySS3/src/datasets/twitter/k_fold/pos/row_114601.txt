who agrees? i hate school most people do but i know its not USELESS because later in life we won't use all of them but they will help like being an engineer of naval ships you need math and geology being a computer technician you need math and science music and art are almost useless but it keeps the place fun and you need P.E. for being an athlete if you have any job in the military navy army or marines you need history  to not make the same mistakes who agrees?
