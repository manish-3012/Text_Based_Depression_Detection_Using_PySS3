My dad is an asshat My dad is forcing me to come down for 35 days this summer, which I will obviously not be complying with because I have to get a drivers permit, fix my truck, and save up for things I want to buy with my job, and I WILL loose my job if I go down for 35 days and if he does force me to come down I will forever resent him and not want anything to do with him, and he has in the past neglected me by not taking me to the doctor when I was at his house for the summer, and not taken me to the doctor even though I sprained my wrist and actually made fun of me for it, and has called me stupid multiple times, aswell as him asking for me to stop posting things on social media, so naturally Iâ€™m posting it on every social media site I currently have. If you can, please contact somebody to help or help out yourself. It would mean alot.
