My friends suck A week ago my best friend told me that she thought we werenâ€™t compatible anymore, and that we shouldnâ€™t be friends, I said ok I understand. And that was that

The rest of my friends except for 2 of them have been ridiculing me and finally today the one I didnâ€™t like, said that he will never talk to me again,  and that I suck with a throw up emoji, I was like ok whatever this is the second time, after that, they still where saying bad things about me, Becuase apparently I messed up 4 times, the best friend has tried to cut ties with me 3 times already, so this time I said fuck it, tried to apologize, and it didnâ€™t work, so fuck her, Iâ€™ve gotten in my knees and begged for forgiveness long enough, Iâ€™m sick of this this, yâ€™all wanna be my friends for 8 years and then decide, oh I donâ€™t like you anymore bye, fine by me, but if you want me to apologize then fuck you, you just want attention. 

Sorry, anyways my friend who still hadnâ€™t cut ties with me was agreeing with the one that did, saying that Iâ€™m toxic, and I rely on them to much to help me do my school work, like Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m dumb I guess, then they ridiculed me on how I didnâ€™t write a whole essay trying to apologize to my best friend, they literally said I half assed my apology and they would have done so much better if the best friend have dropped them, like have you been dropped 4 times already? I donâ€™t think so.

So fuck you, basil (fake name)  I know you have Reddit so fuck you, even if you didnâ€™t cut ties with me you still ridiculed me for no reason and choose her over me. So fuck all of you, and if you show the group chat this, they you are really begging for tea about me. I hope you all have a spring in your mattress break so itâ€™s uncomfortable, and every day things shift to the right by 1 cm so you donâ€™t notice. I donâ€™t need yâ€™all in my life,and you donâ€™t need me, clearly. Good bye.
