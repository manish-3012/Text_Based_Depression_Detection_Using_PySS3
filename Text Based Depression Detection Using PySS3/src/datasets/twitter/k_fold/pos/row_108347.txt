Finally managed to get my graphics card! ... after waiting for it to be in stock...for 4 months... Ok for people that aren't pc nerds, recently through covid and the wave of scalper bots, getting a graphics card (gtx 1660 super btw) is practically impossible. Nothing is ever in stock but when it is, only in about 20 second intervals. Plus im broke af so i wasn't about to pay crazy money to get it earlier. So catching one of these while in stock, is crazy lucky.

Luckily god was on my side (for once) and i managed to get one! Ik its not that big a deal to most people but for me this is huge given how long it took to get it.

Anyway just thought I should share. Have a good day :)
