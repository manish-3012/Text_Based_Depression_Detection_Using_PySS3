Does anyone else get sad at seeing people with their friends? So I was on a zoom today, and this kid had his friends in the back of his screen. They were all joking around and having a good time, and it made me really upset. I havenâ€™t had a group of friends in a while , and now every time I see someone with their friends I get so sad. All I want is to meet some people who care about me. Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me?
