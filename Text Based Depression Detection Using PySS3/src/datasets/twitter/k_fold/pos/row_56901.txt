Hey guys, this is my first post So i have a skin diesease, called Neurofibromatosis. It is a set of complex genetic disorders that affects almost every organ system, causing tumors to grow on nerves in the brain and throughout the body. ... Diagnosed most often in children and young adults, NF occurs worldwide and in all races, ethnic groups and both sexes.

I have type one, which causes tumors, and i can go blind

You donâ€™t have to say anything, i just needed to get this off my chest. 

There is no cure.
