Anyone wanting to try weed or curious about it? Iâ€™m 16 and been smoking every day for a year. Finally decided to put it down 3 days ago, itâ€™s been hard but what makes it easier is talking to other ppl about it. 

I dont think weed is bad, but when itâ€™s at a point where youâ€™re like me smoking 24/7 then it takes a bad turn. 

If you wanna know what it feels like, what it does, etc. ask away!
