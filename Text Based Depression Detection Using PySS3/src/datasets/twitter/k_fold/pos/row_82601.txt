Bruh, I just messaged my crush and she ignored me when I say sheâ€™s cute She was going on about Levi from attack on Titan than she said heâ€™s cute, I replied with a list of people I find cute i said her name in it and she went omg. I thought I was gonna have a girlfriend when she started going on about another anime character.
