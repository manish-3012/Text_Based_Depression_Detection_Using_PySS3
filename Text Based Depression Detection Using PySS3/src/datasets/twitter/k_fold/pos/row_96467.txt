I'm seriously getting tired of these Twitter memes ruining anime Ok so if you have Twitter or Instagram you might know there are meme pages where they take clips of anime and put some kind of rap music on top of it with a caption and they think what they made is good and deserves likes and follows. And well at first it was cool and all but know its almost everywhere I look I see it and it always ends with a follow this person. But tbh your kind of ruining the scenes and spoling the animes their from for peole who haven't seen it and making it sick with music that doesn't even go with the scenes.
