Okay I know I might get some hate for this, but Okay so Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and loneliness and I feel like whatâ€™s the point in doing anything, but now that Iâ€™ve ignored my depression and loneliness I feel so much better, I still feel depressed and lonely from time to time, but I usually put on some really good music and just chillax and about 20-30- minutes later bam I donâ€™t feel depressed or lonely, and now I feel like thereâ€™s a point to certain things in my life and Iâ€™ve realized two things

1: no matter what your going through it could be worse. 

2: no matter what you believe or who you are, the only person stopping you is you.


Just felt good enough to spread some love, I hope everybody in the world has an amazing day/night and please stay happy and healthy, I know itâ€™s hard to be happy right now, but at least try.
