Battle of Wits I'm hosting a Battle of Wits between two of my friends. They are not the people who you'd consider academically smart but both of them claim to be the smarter one.  When we were talking one day we decided to do a Battle of Wits to find out which one of them is actually smarter.

This is not a very serious thing but I am supposed to prepare the questions and stuff and I'm pretty much out of ideas. All I have thus far are three rounds:

1. Wikipedia Speedrun - the first one to get from the Wikipedia page of Danjaq to Plastic surgery only by clicking on the links is the winner.

2.Flash questions - both of them have to answer as many trivia questions during 1 minute as they can. Whoever answers the most questions correctly is the winner.

3. A drawing competition - both of them have to draw something using MS Paint and whoever's drawing the crowd deems best is the winner (we're gonna have some people watching as well)

But this is all so far. I'd like to make around 4 more rounds so whoever wins the most rounds will be considered a bigger brain. Any input is appreciated. Thanks :))
