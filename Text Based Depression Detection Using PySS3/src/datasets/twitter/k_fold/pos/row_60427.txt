Just needed to rant somewhere I just became a teenager a few months ago and I feel like reddit is like the place where I can anonymously talk about my crap. So yeah lmao
First of all, why the fuck do my classmates take the time to type out â€œwhy didnt u pay attention in classâ€ instead of â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€. Like jesus christ man instead of lecturing me, you could tell me the answer to my damn question. For some background, my class and I are going on a field trip tomorrow. I just joined the class last week so idk them very well. So I asked if weâ€™re gonna stay home for the rest of the day or continue with school. Well they answered with â€œpay attention in schoolâ€ or something. I mean why man canâ€™t u answer me ffs. 
Anyway, let me rant about something else. 
Today, I came back from school and said that we had our photos takes today. So my dad said well u didnt dress all â€œfancyâ€ so ur mom will have a heart attack lmao. So there is this thing I do with my hair, like I think u call them bangs and I leave them out at the side and my parents hate it. So I said I put them out like always for the photo and my dad said â€œnow the photo looks like trashâ€ ah shit dude. Idrc about what people say about me but my parents and my looks? Jesus dude. They said that I look like trash. Iâ€™m already insecure as it is so I have no idea why they have to do that. They always say that shit about my hair and it really hurts.

Anyway, Iâ€™m sorry I wrote so much and I know 90% of u guys dont care but I had to write shit down. Thanks for reading
