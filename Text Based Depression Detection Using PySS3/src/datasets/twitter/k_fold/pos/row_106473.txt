Is this an addiction to porn? Everything I see turns me on. Like I was at work and someone called me mam and I seriously had to leave because I got turned on.ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ and once someone handed me something and they had rings on and GUYS I LITTERALY HAD TO PUT MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH AND WALK AWAY. Whenever I get bored I watch porn or read bls/gls. I think itâ€™s seriously a problem. Once I went to google to look sum up for school and the first thing to come up in the recommended bar was hentai. I donâ€™t even watch hentai like that but it was there mocking me taunting me. I litteraly watch porn like itâ€™s a movie and laugh at them... like I saw this one and the girl stood up AND PISSED ON THE FLOOR then the other girl did it and I laughed I thought it was funny. Porn doesnâ€™t turn me on I just find it funny but I canâ€™t stop watching it. HELP ME
