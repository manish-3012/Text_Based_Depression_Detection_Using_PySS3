Hey guys. So today I was coming back from school and on my way, I saw a tiny little dog. So usually whenever I see stray dogs, I avoid them(cause I'm scared) but this tiny little doggo had something about it that made want to go near it. As I'm going closer to the dog, I hear this very familiar tune which annoys the shit out of me. That's when I realized we hadn't had school in 7 months.Anyway, the doggo in my dream was cute.
