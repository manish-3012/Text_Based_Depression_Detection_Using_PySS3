Obligatory post about a girl I like. So there this girl in my class who's caught my attention and I've known her for about two years now but up until very recently we haven't talked much. One of her close friends while tolerable doesn't get along with me much do up until now we haven't really talked much. She recently gave me her snapchat as we're considering hanging out with some mural friend over fall break. While I can't say I know her super well but I've been getting her attention with my charming funny ways, we have an inside joke where at a random point in the day I will offer her half a banana ripped straight in half with no prompting and it always makes her laugh so I keep doing it. Idk I wouldn't say I have a crush but she's definitely caught my eye, I don't know what to do next as 1. How long should I try to befriend her before asking her out. 2. I don't have a car so I can't really take her anywhere. Advice or questions welcome!
