10/16-17/2020 MC Server massive railway grief Today the minecraft server's overworld western railway has been massively grief, and maybe considered unfixable, unusable probably forever. 100 redstone torches missing throughout the railway and all are gone, yes it maybe crafted but due to the grief that keeps happening everyday for atleast 2 weeks and all the time I've wasted, I probably won't come back to the server atleast 2 weeks. Maybe I'll quit forever.
