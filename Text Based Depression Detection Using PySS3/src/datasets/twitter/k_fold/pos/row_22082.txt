My mom doesnt understand im trying my best in school but i feel like my best isnt good enough. So i decided to tell my mom about what happened with my school work last night when i literally turned it in at 12:00:03 she was mad because she said i shouldnt leave my stuff last minute. The thing is i didnt. I had to go out to dinner for my sister's birthday and do cake once we got home and even before that i had homework from other classes to finish. So i told her i was working on it for like 2 or 3 hours because it was a lot of writing and she said she didnt care and that it should have been turned in on time. I was literally on the brink of crying though because i was trying so hard to get it done and i really feel like my best isnt ever good enough and she said she was a about to leave and by the time she said that i was already in my room and she didnt hear me the first few times i said okay and i didnt want to go out there since i was crying so i tried to say alright but it was shakey and it just sounded like i was being mean and now im scared she thinks i have an attitude when i dont. So now here i am just upset and crying because i feel like i didnt do good enough at all and i dont understand why my mom doesnt get that.. i told my dad this morning but he said that its okay and i should have extra time (im an ese student and have an iep) he took it better than my mom and i guess i forgot why i dont open up to my mom.
