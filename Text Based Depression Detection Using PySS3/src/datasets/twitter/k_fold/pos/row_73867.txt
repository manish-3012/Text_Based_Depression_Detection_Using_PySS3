If you laugh from a guy because he wears a pink sweater - you are a moron. Seriously, most people don't care about people being unic or individual. They stick to stereotypes and ridicule everything "what is not normal" for them.  


Yes, I am a guy. Yes, I wear a pink sweater. So what?  
I honestly don't care about "guys can't wear pink clothes because they are guys" and "girls can't kick guy's butt because they are girls". I enjoy women being stonger than me (not only because it's my fetish lol) and I am glad guys do what they like even if sex stereotypes say "it's wrong".  


My pink sweater is warm, it's a present from my mother I love a lot. And it has a hood!  


My brother was laughed by some people and he still gets some bullying from girls because he wants to have long hair. Such children need to learn how to respect other's individuality.  


Consider that as rage post or something but it contains some truth.
