I am bored UwU So, every day I wake up, I eat something and join all the online lessons, then I eat again and I study until the end of the day and finally (thank God) I sleep. How can I spend better my time? I think I am losing my time and my youth, I don't know how to tell... Hope you understand...
It is really bad doing this every day! I want to change my days, so I ask you teenagers! Help meeeee...
