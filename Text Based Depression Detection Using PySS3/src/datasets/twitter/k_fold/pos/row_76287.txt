I'm having a terrible day make me happy. My mouse isn't working, I still have modules to finish, my little sister is listening to K-pop on the TV at loud volume, someone made a cringy gacha life video of Llamas with hats, and I regret looking at comments of videos for little kids. So how is your day?
