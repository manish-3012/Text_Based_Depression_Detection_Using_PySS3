What if I taught bullies a lesson I would go to school wearing a tactical vest and carrying a rifle and a shotgun slung over my back. Instead of hurting anyone I would just say this is what happens when you bully people. Then I turn myself in without incident. I have a Mini-14 5.56 with a red dot sight, and a mossberg 500 tactical shotgun.
