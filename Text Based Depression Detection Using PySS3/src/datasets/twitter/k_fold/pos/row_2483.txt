getting tired of my parents complaining about and controlling me, want to learn to drive and have freedom my older brother left his old chevy cobalt and i think i know where the keys are, but i have a fear of driving on roads. i can do well in parking lots, but it seems scary. i want to get my license but i dont know if i could with my parents... i'm also very short 5'4 but can fit in the car fairly easily though.
