Just lost my Dad. I just lost my Dad a few hours ago.

I am still in shock and am mostly confused. Is this even real? 

I am grateful to have amazing friends and family, and my whole family came over hours ago and helped comfort my mom and sister (18). I am currently 16. 

I guess just value the time you have with your family. As common as this statement is, I myself did not truly value my time with my dad as much as I wished I could have.

I guess all we can do is take it day by day.
