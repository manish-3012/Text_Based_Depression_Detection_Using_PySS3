Everbodyâ€™s got all kinds of shit weighing them down, especially right now. Share whatâ€™s keeping you down and we can all talk about it. Add to the end whatâ€™s keeping you going. Here, Iâ€™ll start.

Iâ€™m kinda failing my own expectations and know that Iâ€™m not operating at the level needed to accomplish my ambitions (Lawyer or Firm Owner). I have dreams of success and I want nothing more than to shatter my expectations and help make the world a better place, which I need money to do. I also love cars and traveling, two things that require money. Plus law is something I find incredibly interesting. Right now I just feel disillusioned with my own effort and wish I was doing more.

The biggest things keeping me going right now are my girlfriend, friends, and family. My girlfriend especially just loves me such an insane amount and despite her own issues, offers to help me at any chance she gets. I love her so much and donâ€™t know where Iâ€™d be without her.

So what are all of your stories?
