My problems I am 14 Australian male on the autism spectrum and my brother 15 Australian is like my superior version 
he gets every girl he wants and never gets rejected 
 I feel my parents love him more 
My parents split when I was 3 and I barely see my father 
the girl I love said Iâ€™m like a brother to her and then tries to kill her self 
The girl dating my brother kissed me before they got together and now sheâ€™s told me she never loved me 
TLDR: life sux
