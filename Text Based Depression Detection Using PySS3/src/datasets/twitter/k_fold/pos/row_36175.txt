found this fucking anime bitch on tiktok who sent a hentai to her art teacher so this bitch goes, "omgg my art teacher gives us so much workk and always says my work isnt good enough", so i think, "oh ok maybe she can show us her bad teacher", nope, she doesnt show us any comments the teacher has made, and doesnt show us any work. 

but then, for a split second you can see the work shes been assigned on google classroom, and theres like two documents for a two point perspective house, one im assuming is how to draw one, and another is probably a diagram. i did two point perspective house in year 2 of secondary school, which is about 12 to 13 years old. and from her other videos she looks about 15 to 16. and if you look it up two point perspective houses arent that hard to draw with help. so this bitch is doing barely any easy work and complaining about it. but oh no it doesnt end there. the fucking anime bitch goes "haha oop tiktok im going to send a fucking hentai to my teacher cause im so quirky".

so this bitch complained about work that people younger than her do, theres barely any of it, doesnt supply proof that her teacher does the things she does and sends a hentai to her teacher like what.
