Ok wtf is up with my weight So Iâ€™m 16 (as my flair says) and since I was 13 Iâ€™ve weighed the same. 115 lbs. I never gain any weight I eat a lot. And Iâ€™m healthy with excessive and the food I eat. 2 of my younger brothers ages 13 and 14 both weigh more than me currently. What the frick is up!? 

Should clarify I like my body n stuff just wtf Iâ€™ve stayed 115 for the past 3 or 3 1/2 years.
