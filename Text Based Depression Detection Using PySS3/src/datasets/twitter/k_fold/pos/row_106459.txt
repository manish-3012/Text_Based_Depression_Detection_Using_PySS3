Why I want trump to be president. Ok so without trump the world would go into war because if Biden wins China will see that usa has a president with dementia and then go to war with Taiwan as this will cause a 3rd world war because one attack on a nato member means an attack on all member so China will see that we have a weak president that what to focus more on the people not the military Because that what Hitler thought president weak go to war and also thats what kaiser Wilhelm the 3rd thought so guess what democracy causes war there has only be one war with Republicans in power and a ton a wars with the democrats in power i hope this will change you mind
