A conversation I had with another teen In my Econ/gov class we had to post on a specific stream about our political beliefs in order to get teens more involved in government and politics. I usually donâ€™t care about politics, but I just said something about how I really
Didnâ€™t like Trump and something about him contradicting himself in every speech. The stream was for students, specifically made by my school board.

I get a comment on it saying that I was young and should wait until highschool to post about politics (but if I didnâ€™t make a post there I wouldâ€™ve gotten points off). 

Iâ€™m a senior Iâ€™m highschool. I donâ€™t want to start arguments but Iâ€™m really getting mad at this person calling me a middle schooler.
