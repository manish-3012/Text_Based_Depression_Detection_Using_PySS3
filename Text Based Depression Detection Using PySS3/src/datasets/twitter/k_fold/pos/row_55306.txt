Trump tested Positive for covid-19 So this is legitimately a big deal and the chances of Trump dying from this are pretty big. Covid-19 is a heavy hitter in the baby boomer age demographic,  not to mention the fact that his younger brother Robert Trump just died from corona just a month and a half ago.


This is a big deal and whatever happens will change the course of the entire election.
