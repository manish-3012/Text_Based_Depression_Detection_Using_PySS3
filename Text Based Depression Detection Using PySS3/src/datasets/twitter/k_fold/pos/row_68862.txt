I miss someone. Itâ€™s been a few weeks since Iâ€™ve heard from them. We used to talk every night. But they got grounded and now I feel all alone. The ungrounding is going to be soon, but I just wish I can hear their voice. And have them tell me itâ€™s all going to be okay.

Is it bad that Iâ€™ve gotten to a point where Iâ€™m struggling to function without them? Weâ€™ve always been there for each other in tough situations, but now I lost that. I hope itâ€™s going to go back to normal after, but I donâ€™t trust myself when I say that.
