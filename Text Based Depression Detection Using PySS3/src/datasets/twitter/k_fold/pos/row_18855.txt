My classmates suck In my Humanities class (I'm Australian) I have to do a presentation on E-Waste. On the school website my teacher put it for Thursday, which is fine. But because of some dumbass in my class, she changed it to tomorrow. He was complaining that we didn't have enough time even though he spends most of his time doing stupid shit instead of working. I guess she was in a bad mood because now it's tomorrow. My presentation in no where near done and I am certain I am gonna fail. This also goes to 50% of our grade. It's just so unfair that because of some idiot I'll most likely fail.


Thank you for listening.
