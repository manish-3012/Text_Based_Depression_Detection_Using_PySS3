Ok exsplain something to me Ok I'm going to be talking about how something idesnt exist so if you still belive in the childhood lies your parents told you this post isnt for you.

Now

The tooth fairy isnt real right and today I aasked my mom where she put my teeth  (She doesnt wanna say) but then my dad comes and says that a guy bought them. This isnt true ofcourse but it isnt only a lie either. 

When I was five I was talking to this guy from my moms work. I told him that I had a loose tooth and then he says that a friend of his could buy it. I ofcourse got super excited and wanted to talk more about this, but he just kept talking about other stuff because he didnt want to get involved with BUYING CHILDERS TEETH.

THERE WAS A GUY WHO WANTED TO **BUY** CHILDRENS TEETH! THATS CREEPY AS HELL!

Why tf did he want to buy my tooth like wtf
