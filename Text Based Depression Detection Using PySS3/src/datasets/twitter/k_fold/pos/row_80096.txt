Coming clean. I am here because I saw that my sister had posted something about me to this subreddit (I will not show her name to keep her anonymous), and it was a rant about me. I read through it and saw the things people had to say about it, and was humbled. I wanted to say that I am sorry. Some of the things she said were:
I am making fun of her stuff and getting offended when she makes fun of my stuff.
Quoting and singing WAP; making her uncomfortable
Blaming her for things
Being a dick in general.
I just want to let everyone know about this and 'come clean' to what I have been doing. Discussion in the comments is entirely open so say whatever you want. I am so sorry for what I have done, and I really do feel bad. I am her older brother by 2 years so I should be the one to set a good example and treat her with the respect and kindness that she deserves. She is my sister and the things I am doing/saying are not respecting that. I am sorry for what I have done, and I am going to work hard on changing it. Thank you for reading â¤ï¸
