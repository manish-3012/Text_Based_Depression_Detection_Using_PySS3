I want a hug I am not talking about someone telling you â€œhugâ€ like ppl here do 
I mean like a real hug , I want someone to look at me 
I want to have someone to talk , someone to trust ,yknow?
I feel like hugs are underrated overall , ye everyone says they 
Are the best but they are beyond the best , like it feel so good 
Having someone in your arms , I have hugged 2 girls (who werenâ€™t my fam) 
In total ,and it was the most awesome feeling I have ever had , 
I swear Iâ€™d give anything to cuddle with someone 
The problem is I feel like everyone I know is so immature 
Like 13yo are like living on kisses and sex ,but I just want to be loved
Also there is itâ€™s hard for me to fall for someone because ik Iâ€™ll never make it like I donâ€™t love anyone ,ye sure there are some people ik that are cute and nice But those are just crushes 
Tbh itâ€™s kinda hard , if anyone wanna talk (which I appreciate because I am a bit lonely and saddened),you are welcomed
