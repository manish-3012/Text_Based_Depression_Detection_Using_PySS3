Why canâ€™t people understand Iâ€™m not constantly horny? I broke up with my gf of 6 months in March.  I have been socially awkward for most of my life and decided that I need to work on myself.  Over the last few months I have made new friends, solidified my relationships overall and become more confident.  Thereâ€™s one important thing to note here -  as part of this I became friends with the girls next door.  Theyâ€™re nice people,  Iâ€™ve been to their parties, Iâ€™ve invited them to mine etc but Iâ€™m not attracted to either of them.  I know theyâ€™re attractive to many people, but theyâ€™re not my type.  Iâ€™m just happy being friends and they are too.  The problem is that everyone around me has decided that I must want to fuck them, since Iâ€™m single and not particularly attractive myself.  I can tell itâ€™s stressing the new friendships with them when they wonder if im only talking to them to get some hole.  I just want friends, why doesnâ€™t anyone understand that?
