Work scheduling me on school holidays? First and last time this ever will happen went like this. 

Me: "Why'd you schedule me to work all day on Wednesday of next week?"

Boss: "You guys have school off, right?"

Me: "it's outside of my availability tho..."

Boss: "but you have school off so you should be able to"

Me: "if I wanted to work that day because I had no school, I would've told you"


Like fr man I'm tryna hang out with friends if I got school off, not be stuck up in a little grocery store drinking monsters just to try and summon up the energy to deal with customer's shit all day.
