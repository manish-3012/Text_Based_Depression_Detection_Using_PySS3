I'm gonna delete this by morning, so, you can read my rant for now It's so late, I should be asleep. But I can't. These thoughts are keeping me awake. 

Why am I so sick? Why do I have to take pills everyday? Synthetic insulin 4 times a day? Eat so much? If I would be dead, I wouldn't have these problems. 

Why do I harm myself? Slowly killing? Cutting, throwing up, thinking of jumping? Why blaming me? Why am I not okay? If I would be dead, I wouldn't have these problems. 

Why do y'all brush it off as a phase? No, I won't grow out of black. No, I won't grow out of suicidal jokes. No, I will always be closeted. No, I won't open up to new people. Yes, I would die alone. If I would be dead, I wouldn't have these problems. 

What have I done to everyone? I'm so sorry I'm me. I'm childish in your eyes, not enough, too fat or too smart, labeling me everywhere I go. I'm not the smart kid, I'm not the quiet kid, I'm not the nerdy kid. Why won't you listen, why do you keep shutting me down?

Oh, I get it. I'm not valid to you. I'm so sorry for my mistakes. I'm so sorry I'm not the way you imagined. I'm sorry I keep bothering you, I'm selfish when I ask for help. I'm sorry I let you down. I'm sorry I turn down your help when you offer me online talking.

I'm sorry I always promise Imma get better, but I never do. Maybe lack of courage? Motivation? Too scared? Okay, you can kill me, you can stab me I won't care. At this point I just wanna die and not bother anyone even more.

Would anyone irl even care? Some classmates, would they react? Or would I be one of many? Would he miss me? Would she cry for me? Would they be alright? 

^I'm ^so ^sorry, ^I'll ^fix ^this, ^I ^swear.
