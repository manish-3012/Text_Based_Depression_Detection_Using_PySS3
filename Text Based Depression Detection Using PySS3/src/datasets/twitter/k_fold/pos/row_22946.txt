Just something out of nothing I don't think anybody knew the emptiness of the so called smile that I used to wear.
The same one i left behind when i left you there

Not a single soul ever noticed that I used to cry
They didnt even saw my tears.
 they were just thinking I am laughing, while i was praying to find you somewhere

 Nobody knew how unbearable the experience was for me.
All of them seemed to think that I am strong.Â 
They used to say grow up, this is a simple thing, it won't kill me,Â 
But I do wonder if they were wrong

Nobody  will ever know I once loved you, not even you 
They will just say there was nothing between us 
But this feeling makes me feels like being held in chain
Trapped in the mystery, like it was you, just you all along

Nobody knew I needed you.Â 
They thought I can do everything on my ownÂ 
But they just didn't knew I was cryingÂ 
When I was all alone.

You used to say you have flaws and i used to compare you with moon, 
Even that have flaws but there is nothing compared to its beauty.
Thats all i have to say for now.
