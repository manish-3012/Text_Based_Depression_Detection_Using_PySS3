Is this a date? So recently a friend of mine told me they wanted to treat me out and walk around town with me and we've been talking for a while and I don't know if it's a date or not and they're picking me up tonight and I'm so nervous and I've had anxiety since yesterday about this.  Also I'm a lady that has no idea what to do on a date with a guy and I'm not putting out too much info because he could be on Reddit.  Honestly,  I really like him but I don't know if he feels the same.  Any help would be wonderful I'm so nervous.  He is the most genuine guy I've ever met and with having some really bad exes because I wasn't a saint myself until I turned myself around and it's been really amazing talking and hanging out with a guy as sweet as him.  Anything would be helpful. Please.
