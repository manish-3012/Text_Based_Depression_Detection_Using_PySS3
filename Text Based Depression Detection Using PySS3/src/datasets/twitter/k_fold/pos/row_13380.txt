Now is a good time to send that letter to grandma we all probably have those older relatives that seem to love getting letters, and with what is apparently happening to the post office, now is a good time to send them one. Ive always heard from my grandma how much she loves getting letters, and Im sure someone you know would feel the same. So why not make ol granny feel good inside AND support the postal service at the SAME TIME. It doesnt matter how old you are, anyone can do it.

While you are at it why not send letters to friends instead of a text every so often. theres no other real reason than to support the postal service, but hey, why not. At the same time you can check out the USPS [merch](https://store.usps.com/store/results/gifts/_/N-nnxamr).

if you really want to support our drivers in blue, start a mail based pyramid scheme to get higher levels of traffic.   (dont really)
