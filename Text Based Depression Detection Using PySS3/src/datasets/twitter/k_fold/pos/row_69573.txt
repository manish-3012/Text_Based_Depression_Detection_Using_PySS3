My Geography teacher might just be the worst teacher on the planet Okay so context: first year of high school, 3rd day. We take bots in Geography class, and the teacher says weâ€™ll have a test on the notes in two days. Pretty standard. Two days pass, itâ€™s test day. We take 10 minutes to study our notes before the test, and now itâ€™s time to take it. Now, we all thought it was gonna be a standard, fill in the blank quiz. NO. We had to write EXACTLY WHAT WE WROTE IN OUR NOTES WORD FOR WORD. There were 5 thing we wrote down, each with two or three subcategories, all of which we had to remember and write down IN ORDER. THE ORDER HAD LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS, SHE JUST WANTED TO MAKE IS SUFFER. AND WE HAD 3 VOCABULARY WORDS, ALL OF WHICH HAD 2-3 SENTENCE LONG DEFINITIONS, AND WE HAD TO WRITE THISE WORD FOR WORD TO. Before the test she said nothing about having to memorize two pages worth of notes word for word. THAT ISNT TEACHING US THE THEMES OF GEOGRAPHY, THATS TEACHING US HOW TO MEMORIZE PAGES WORTH OF NOTES. ONLY THREE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PASSED, AND NOW THANKS TO THE WORST DESIGNED TEST EVER, MY FIRST TEST GRADE IS A 40/100!!!!. You think that she would learn from that and change the test, but NOOOOO, SHE JUST SAYS THAT SHE SAW SOME OF US MADE A BAD GRADE AND SHOULD COME IN THE MORNING TO MAKE IT UP. THIS BITCH HAS 6 CLASSES, ALL OF WHICH FAILED MISERABLY AT THE TEST, AND SHE CANT GET THE HINT THAT THE TEST MIGHTVE BEEN A LITTLE UNFAIR? MANY OF THE GIRLS IN OUR CLASS LITERALLY CRIED IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS OVER IT AND THE TEACHER DIDNT GIVE A SHIT. AND THIS WAS THE FIRST WEEK! 

thank you for letting me vent my mom wonâ€™t listen to me
