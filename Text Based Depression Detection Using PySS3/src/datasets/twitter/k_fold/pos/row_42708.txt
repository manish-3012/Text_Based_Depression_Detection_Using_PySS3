Anime and Kpop fans yet Anti-Asian? I see a huge trend of Gen Zs being huge fans of Kpop and Anime, jumping on the trend, yet seem to be blatantly racist to Asians or ignore their issues? I see this all the time on TikTok and Online, in a way, Asian culture has become a key part of Gen Zs identity, with TikTok (a Chinese app), Japanese dances and trends, Anime, Kpop, manga etc. Yet with the recent events that are going on, most of my friends seem to be indifferent or not care at all about the racism that is happening despite being fans of Anime and stuff.
