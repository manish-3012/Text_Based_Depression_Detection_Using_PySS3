We need to cancel cancel culture Cancel culture has ruiend so many lives, even outside the media and internet. 

_________________________________________

First off all, if someone gets accused for something, everyone should take the rule in mind â€œinnocent until proven guiltyâ€ 

When actors and content creators are accused for doing something unacceptable, everyone is canceling them. Like how jhonny depp lost all his work and how YouTubers lose all their income. Wich obviously ruiens their life. 

For everyday people this is a problem too, if a female accuses a male for rape, the male will automatically lose his job, and probably his wife too. Even before the courtcase happens. Ofcourse most of the accusions are (hopefully) rightfull but if its a false accusation a female can basically ruien a males life by simply saying he raped her, this is what cancel culture does to people

Also, the media will automatically choose a side, in the pyrocynical case most people automatically chose iveryâ€™s side because they provided an big amount of â€œevidenceâ€ and they know it would work because pyro had to defend himself with making his kinks public. And their evidence is based on things they specifically picked out to fool the people

Even if a celeb is automatically guilty, like when pewdiepie said live the N-word we shouldnâ€™t screw them immediately over, yes what he did was wrong but we shouldnâ€™t screw someone over because of a mistake. And even YouTube chooses sides, like logan paul when he showed a body in his video, he lost revenue for just a few weeks and further nothing
