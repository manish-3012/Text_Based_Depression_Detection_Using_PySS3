question:Hi Aliot. I have been a hardcore fan of various Hasbro products such as monopoly and connect 4.It gave me and my family plenty of fun time and divorces. Godamit Jerald why did you bankrupt me. Anyways, I have been wondering if the Nerf Dart Tag series. the whole gimic of velcro-tipped darts is a really fun idea,as the darts will stay in on the vests and we can easily confirm if the darts landed on the target or not. it has been a majpr part of my childhood, amd seeing the 50th amniversary of nerf brought us the icon series, releasing fan favourite n-strike blasters such as the stampede andthe longshot, would there be still a chance for it to come back? Also I really appreciate the work you've done for the company. All the monopoly twists are very interesting and highly replayable, allowing my family tobond together up until Jerald bankrupted me. I own a collection of every monopoly board piece to ever releaseand I'd be willing to share some photos with you.
