Day 6 of checking in on r/teenagers Good afternoon everyone I hope all is well and if not I wish it gets better soon

If you are reading this at late night and you canâ€™t sleep, try eating a bowl of cereal. The sugar will calm your nerves and help you get some rest. Anyways I donâ€™t wanna make this too long but Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow, cheers
