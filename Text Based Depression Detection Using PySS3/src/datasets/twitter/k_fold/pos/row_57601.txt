A loner just wanting to rant Just wanted to rant so thanks for bearing with me.

It absolutely sucks when you're that one guy who no one cares about. People don't hate you or love you and have no opinion about you because you're irrelevant. 
It just doesn't matter if you're there or not. No one will care you died.

About myself: I'm an 18 year old highschooler with self confidence issues. I would describe myself as more physically attractive than most males in my country. However, I struggle to make friends and I'm absolutely lonely. I belong to a decent family, compromising of only my mum lol (I have had a lot of family issues) but I live in a backward locality (in a third world country) with people I can't relate to.

I would say I have no talents, I'm academically very average and have never been in a relationship. I honestly don't have anything to look forward to. I don't know what I should do with myself. I want to develop as a person and make a lot of friends.

You're probably wondering why I wrote this but I just needed to get this outta my head because I have no one to talk to and it absolutely sucks living with this burden in your mind 24/7. Thank you.
