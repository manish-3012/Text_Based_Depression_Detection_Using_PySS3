Covid on 18th birthday... Just why???

Ive planned my birthday to 6 different groups on different days and now 4 days before I get Covid. 

So i have to cancel everything and celebrate my 18th birthday alone...

Like ffs why does this have to happen to me... why not a few weeks earlier. Its stupid that these things always happen to me
