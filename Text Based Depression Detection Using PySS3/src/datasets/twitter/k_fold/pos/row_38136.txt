Making decisions I'm in my last two years of high school and the time has come for me too make a choice in my carreer path i want to take and i honestly dont know what i want. Everyone i know is already clearly set on a goal on what they wanna do so i feel really left and and i feel like i'm just stuck in time not knowing what to do at all. Any people who has this feeling aswell or am i really the only one strungling a lot with this? And too the people who had this before, how did you make a choice?
