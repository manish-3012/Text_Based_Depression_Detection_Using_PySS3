Posting random stuff about my life #8 - Before the Dragon I'm beating Minecraft tomorrow and I wanted to share this brief excerpt of my Minecraft world.  *Stephanie was almost done. All she had to do is enchant just a few items and brew some potions. Fortunately, she has access to kind people who give her the things she needs. Although she was scared and knew it was possible for her to die, she knew that it would be worth it when she learns how to fly. "Just a few more pieces," she thought. It took a couple of days, but she was finally done. After getting last-minute preparations, she was ready to go to the end. She threw the first eye. She followed the eye with great intent. After a  long struggle on figuring it out. She dug down and found stone bricks. "This is surely it!" she thought once more. After searching the stronghold for a bit, she heard the silverfish. She followed the sound and there it was: the End Portal. She put the Eyes of Ender in, and the portal lit with an ominous melody. She ate one last golden carrot and jumped in.* I'll post a follow-up tomorrow.
