I obviously don't have anorexia because I'm fat but I somewhat kinda understand a part of it Like I think I'm so disgusting and worthless and I don't think I could even physically be skinny and slim enough to ever love myself. Except I have a problem with overeating where I just can't fucking stop thinking about eating. And lately I feel so depressed and gross even after eating my first meal of the day etc. And just I'm crying right now and wish I didn't have to eat anything anymore.
