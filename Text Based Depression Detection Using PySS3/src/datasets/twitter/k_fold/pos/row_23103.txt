I'm done trying I dunno I keep trying and trying and trying but it's never enough. And I try to talk to people and make new friends but I'm so awkward and terrified (of nothing) and can't loosen up no matter how hard I try. I just feel deep pain when I talk to someone because I know I sound boring to them. I try everyday but I'm exhausted now and I would like to die. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm trying to get the confidence to talk to my crush, but I've already given up. It's just not worth it. Nothing's worth it anymore. Usually I often get to a low point and the determination quickly comes back, but this time around I don't think I'm getting up again. Not a slight glimpse of hope, nothing. I feel so much hate for myself that I don't think I can bare living in this body anymore. 

This isn't a goodbye note don't worry, just trying to pull myself up but it's really hard and I think I'm already losing my grip
