My nightmare group project So, to begin with, Iâ€™m the new student, and my partner came to the school Iâ€™m at last year, and in the beginning of the year, when i barely knew anyone, the school forced us to do groups (Iâ€™m in a private school so there arenâ€™t that many kids) and immediately Iâ€™m left out and so is him.

Fast forward to the end of the first trimester, quarantine just began, and i still dont know this kid, then he made the whole project ( i did some stuff, but not much) then he did a good job, and we got good grades, fast forward to right now and apparently this subject is still part of our grades, which makes no sense because of the fact that i dont have classes on the subject because of the IB

Apparently the project is worth 1 full point out of ten in three subject, in the day we needed to send it i dmd him saying â€œthe teacher is asking for the projectâ€_x000D_

Fast forward to right now that my teacher said i failed his subject with less then a point missing, and now i need to do the work, but no one did anything


I guess Iâ€™m failing the subject
