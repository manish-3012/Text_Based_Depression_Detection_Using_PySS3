My streamer friend Watch Looswaffle with me on Twitch! http://www.twitch.tv/looswaffle?sr=a

So, I don't know if this is even the right sub, but my friend is a college student and she's really trying to get her stream channel off the ground. She's funny and nice, and I would really appreciate if you just give her a chance. I'm honored that she invited me to game with her because I never considered myself that fun, but apparently she does. Thanks, guys.
