The girl I really loved blocked me I started to develop feelings for her three years ago when we did all our projects together. We had the same schedule. I struggled to talk to her because I was crushing but as high school went on I started to opened up to her, Iâ€™ve never opened up to anyone before. We started to be friends and it was all good, she never wanted to hang out because she has social anxiety. Never hangs out with guys outside of her family. Her parents are strict I think. She knows how much I value her, she really helped me get through school. Then I started to get depressed because Iâ€™m in the army and will be gone for 7 months with little communication. She started to ignore me, and then I brought it up and she blocked me. A couple days before she did that she said I need to see my self worth. Iâ€™ve been nothing but supportive and caring towards her, but Iâ€™ve been depressed. I am also friends with her best friend (they are like family). I told him the situation he didnâ€™t have much to say. We hiked a couple days later though didnâ€™t mention anything about it, now heâ€™s kinda ignoring me. Iâ€™ve been sending her sweet, supportive, and understanding messages on alt accounts (from my heart, not like a crazy man). She hasnâ€™t blocked the account but also hasnâ€™t responded to them. I have never cared so much about someone and really want to talk and be friends again, Iâ€™d do anything.
