I'm scared that my dad's tesla gets stolen I have new soccer club and those teammates are immigrants that are theft-sensitive. I accidentally said that my father drives a tesla while those guys are all pretty poor. So they listened to that. I maybe have said my address but I am not sure. Now I hear it from more people instead of the only person I told it to. I'm in a group chat with him and his friends who are also from the club and 2 of them suddenly know about the tesla. Im afraid they gonna team up make a heist plan and steal the car. They are that kind of people. What should I do.
