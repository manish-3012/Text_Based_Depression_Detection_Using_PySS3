A kid had a gun in his backpack So it was lunch time, and the teachers were talking about covid and all that stuff but before that a kid dropped some of his food. So after that he threw all of his food on the ground. He later went to go get more food. So while all this was happening this kid finally sat back down and one of the teachers said  "Who ever threw all this food onto the floor needs to stop acting like a child." The kid got so mad and he started digging through his backpack. The whole time the teachers were talking his hands were shaking as if he was trying to decide whether or not to use the gun. Meanwhile I was sitting on the stage and watching him. One of my friends had told me it was a pellet gun or an airsoft but the gun didn't look like a fake. After the teachers were don't talking he took the "gun" and put it into his lunch box only to put it back in his backpack. I don't really know whether or not it was a real gun or not and I don't understand why the kids with anger issues are just allowed to do what they want. The teachers didn't do nothing. I'm writing this as I'm in school.
