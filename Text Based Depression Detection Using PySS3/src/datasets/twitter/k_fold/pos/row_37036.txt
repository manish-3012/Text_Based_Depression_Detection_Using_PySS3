I didn't sleep a wink last night I wasn't on my computer. I wasn't on my phone. I was thinking about something that my brother told me about- vanishing twin syndrome.

Apparently, in some cases of twins being born, one of the fetuses absorbs the other. That's all well and good, and causes no difficulties with pregnancy and all. The real problem starts when the baby grows into a kid.

This kid sometimes feels like someone else is controlling his hand, or his leg, or any part of his body. These are the traces of the "vanishing twin".

How terrifying is that.
