Why must school recipes be such shit Today we had home ec, and we were supposed to make some kind of pasta based food. My friend and i decided to make chicken pasta because its just good af and not all that hard to make.

So we needed a recipe, and we looked through our home ec books. We found one, and my god, the recipe is awful.

First off, the only spices that the recipe said to put into the chicken was salt and pepper. God no. Second, the recipe said to make a sauce with the chicken, and said to do so by adding *2 dl of water.* Just fucking water. 

And so of course i said fuck that and we improvised pretty much the whole thing and that pasta was by far the best non-sweet food i've made in home ec. 

Schools, please. Give us actually decent recipes.
