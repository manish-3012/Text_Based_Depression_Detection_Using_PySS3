My sister spoiling videogames for me Ok so I prefer playing video games blindly, but my little sister does NOT.

So I always have this problem where I want to play a game and of course so does my sis, except she has a boatload more free time than I do since she's not in highschool.

And I end up never getting around to playing the game whilst my sis is playing it 24/7, and no matter how much I try to stay away from spoilers, I can't avoid seeing my sis playing the game and her dragging me into whatever she wants to show me about it.

I'm like: "I'm sorry but I don't want to spoil the game for myself." And she says: "WeLL wHo CaReS iF i SpOiL eVeRyThInG fOr YoU?? yOu CaN sTiLL PlAy ThE gAmE!!!" And she'll pester me about whatever it is she wants me to see. 

It's ruined MANY games for me.
