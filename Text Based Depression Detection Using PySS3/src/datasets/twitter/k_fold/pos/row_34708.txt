My dad made me a cup of coffee this morning. It was great, but... This was the first time coffee has had an affect on me. Like, the caffeine, I mean. I drink coffee sometimes and I never feel it. But today I didn't have breakfast and I woke up super tired, so I had to drink that coffee. But now I'm in class and I'm super jittery. This has never happened to me before. Kinda freaking out
