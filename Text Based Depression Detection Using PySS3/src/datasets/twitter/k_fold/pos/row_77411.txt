Today it hit me how much better my life could have been. Half a point And I could be in such a better highschool with much better perspective and probably friends and classmates. Its been two years and only now did it hit me this hard that I want to cry.  I cant even say at least I get some friends because I know they will leave me like last ones. I usually would talk about it with my only friend but he sent me a snap that he is hanging out with his friends and I know the last thing anyone would want to see is his depressing couisn who needs to rant. I just need to talk about this with someone
