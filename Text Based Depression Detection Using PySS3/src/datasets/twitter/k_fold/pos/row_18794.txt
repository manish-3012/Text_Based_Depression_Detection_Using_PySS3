Idk if any of my uk gang can help me here Iâ€™m looking for a certain music video and I canâ€™t find it It started with the lyrics playing and  two lads sitting in a park rolling a joint and the police walk up to them and they both split and run then meet up again

There was a scene where theyâ€™re pushing each other in Trolleys and fighting

I donâ€™t know what the music video is called but it was well funny

I think one of the lads might of had a red jacket on but Iâ€™m not quite sure
