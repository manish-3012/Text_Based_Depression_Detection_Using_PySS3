I get bullied for being bald and donâ€™t know what to do. I have alopicha which is a hair loss auto immune disease that fights hair and pushes it off the body. Iâ€™ve had it for almost 8-9 months and am now completely bald. I wear a beanie so people donâ€™t see my lack of hair or eyebrows. On the first day of school someone ripped the hat off and people were laughing and staring. Ever since people would walk by and rip the beanie off, slap my head and say â€˜I like your cut gâ€™ which after the 1000th time just hurts and isnâ€™t funny. People will also ask very personal questions like if I have hair down there and shit like that. Iâ€™m sick of it but donâ€™t know how to get it to stop.
