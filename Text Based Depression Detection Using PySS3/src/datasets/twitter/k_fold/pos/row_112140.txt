I'm having a flashback Flashback to the time where I was concerned about a classmate who I sort of liked. I messaged them and they didnt respond to anyone for a few hours. She replied to everyone saying she was fine and fucking blocked me. Ever since then, i haven't been in contact with my old class except for close friends.
