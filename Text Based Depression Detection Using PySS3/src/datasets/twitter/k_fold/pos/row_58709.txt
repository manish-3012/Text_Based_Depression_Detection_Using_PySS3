How do I respond lmao Some girl in my English class asked what we did the day I was absent. I helped her and she said â€œyou are a blessing thank you so muchâ€ I responded with â€œhaha npâ€. She then sent ðŸ’—ðŸ’—. How do I respond to that? Idek what that means. I donâ€™t wanna be mean and just leave her on delivered.
