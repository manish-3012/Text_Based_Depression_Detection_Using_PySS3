I need some help 
For the past week or so I have been talking to this person maybe 2-3 times a week. Letâ€™s call this person HG. I kept my space and didnâ€™t bug HG all the time as I knew they were busy. I thought everything was going fine but on the weekend things changed. On Saturday we planned to call and chat for awhile but it didnâ€™t happen. On Sunday I asked if everything was alright and HG replied by saying their phone is broken and they are unable chat. However HG did go on to say that they are using their laptop to chat. HG then said that theyâ€™ll get back to me after they go and run a quick errand. I replied and that was it. Itâ€™s Wednesday now and no message from them. I follow HG on Instagram and see that they are active quite a lot and views my stories. 

Sooo what should I do? Is it worth it messaging them or should I leave them alone? I am confused and a bit hurt. 

Thanks for reading.
