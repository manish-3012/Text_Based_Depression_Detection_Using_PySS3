What should I do?  So basically I have had a crush on this guy for like 6 months. I think I finally have the balls to ask if he likes me back? Only problem is I want to do it in person because I want to say it to his face so I dont come of as a coward towards him but I will have to wait at least a month or maybe longer to see him at school again because they are closed. But I also dont want to wait for long because that would make me anxious plus Im worrying that he will lose feelings for me if he has them. What do I do?
