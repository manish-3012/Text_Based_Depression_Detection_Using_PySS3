Porn nearly ruined my life Throwaway account because I have friends who know my main.

Here's something I gotta say: I love to jerk off. I do it almost every day, it helps me sleep, and generally helps me clear my mind. Yet I've been jerking off to porn so much that I've become desensitized to actual things that are attractive and sexy. I struggle to get an erection unless I watch porn or think of something depraved like incest or rough sex with a girl that hates me. My testosterone levels are almost at an all time low and I'm struggling in building muscle mass and stamina. I'm constantly tired and unhappy, and my motivation is struggling to stay high. I'm gonna start going to rehab this weekend, I really need some help with my condition.

To all of you guys here: have some self control. Treat porn like any addictive substance, know that it's not a real portrayal of sex, and make sure to limit the amounts you take.
