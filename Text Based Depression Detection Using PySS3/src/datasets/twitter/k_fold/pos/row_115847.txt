Alright trying to get my life into something I can actually feel like is worth it, here's a list because I want some level of responsibility and I'm a flake at this kind of thing I need to put this somewhere because I feel like someone needs to see it so I scare myself a bit into actually getting things into shape

1. I want to talk to my parents, I want to help my dad get rid of things we don't need and stop getting things we don't need in the first place, I want to get him to be calmer when he's stressed or in an argument with my mum, I can't talk to her, so I'll talk to him

2. I want to study more, and better, and like it like I used to, it's going to be hard to get into that space again but I really do want to

3. I want to do more with art and coding, I love them and I don't think I give them enough time and commitment, I want to do that, properly, and grow them a bit

4. I want to write consistently, I want to finish my story, I don't want to forget it and leave it, I want to get it done and I want to have someone read it and like it

5. I want to get some weight on, I'm so fucking tired of being underweight, I want to make it stop and get it together, I don't want to hear about it from someone else again fucking again when I already know it. Just say I'm not fucking hungry and have people not point that out, fuck metabolism I don't care I'm going to try as hard I can (yeesh I don't think I've sworn that much in a paragraph in a fair bit sorry)

6. Fix my sleep schedule, I don't want to be scared of it anymore, it's bad when my head comes up with the most freaky horrible things, but I want to *not* stay awake for a week straight sometimes thank you

I think that's about it pretty much, for everyone who bothered to see this, have an internet hug from me and thanks
