yo anyone here from a country that's struggling rn that would be willing to talk about it? I'm in a global politics class and our assignment today is to talk to two different people who don't live in the US. We're currently talking about power struggles so stuff like Crimea, hong kong, Iran, things where there's a struggle. If anyone is able to help me gain a perspective of something happening in your country that would be great.
