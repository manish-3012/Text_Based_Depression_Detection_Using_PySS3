My cat is a fucking freak of nature So I wake up and walkout of my room this morning right? I see my cat chilling but something is in the chonkers mouth. I figure it's a thing of catnip but no it's a GODAMN BIRD. FIRST OF ALL, I WANNA KNOW HOW HER FATASS WHO GETS WINDED JUMPING ON THE COUCH COULD CATCH A BIRD, AND SECOND, WHERE THE GODAMN BIRD CAME FROM IF ALL THE WINDOWS ARE CLOSED. Anyways my mom said to tell her shes a good girl. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
