So... the one year mark has been reached. To celebrate, I had the idea to host a pizza party with quarto fromaggi pizza's with blue cheese, but blue cheese on a pizza is a really dominant flavour. So to solve that, everyone can choose the pizza they desire and move on with their day. Cheers mates. Enjoy the digital pizza!
