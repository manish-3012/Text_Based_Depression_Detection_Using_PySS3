I just realized how wierd I am I was thinking about my interests and realized that at this point in time I'm a space nerd, logger, harley davidson biker. I like painting, woodcraft and knife making, I enjoy being out in nature, I'm always happy and I refuse to where shoes most of the time. I'm shit in math class but realy good in chemistry and physics, and I'm a masive stoner, wut is wrong with me.
