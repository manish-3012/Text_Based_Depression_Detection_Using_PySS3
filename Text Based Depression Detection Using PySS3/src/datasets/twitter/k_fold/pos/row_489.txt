The thing happened We had to work with partners today. A girl asked if I wanted to work with her, being the natural charmer I am, I said sure. While we worked on our assignment she laughed at my jokes, and we finished the assignment early. 

Needless to say, I have advanced in life.
 Obligatory, "Later Virgins" lol.
