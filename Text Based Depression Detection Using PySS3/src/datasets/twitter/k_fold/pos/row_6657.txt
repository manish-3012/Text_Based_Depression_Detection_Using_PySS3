Help, I need to know if I'm weird or not... Do I have a good taste in music? Since last year, once I heard a song that I liked, I'll put it in this playlist, it has 286 songs in total.

[Here's my Spotify playlist link. \^\^](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0PWe0MtdMaH2klhA6oV5qZ?si=1xB-tLIQRN-UJ4RNLuxi5w)
