Motivate me yâ€™all I am studying for my college entrance exam that i am desperately trying to qualify. But lately my marks and motivation is extremely low. I keep on getting distracted by YouTube or reddit or creating imaginary situations in my head.


I am trying to get a good college to support my family and my non verbal autistic brother.
