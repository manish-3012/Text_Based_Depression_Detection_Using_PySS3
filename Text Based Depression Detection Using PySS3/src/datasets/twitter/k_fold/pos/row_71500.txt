Ugh boys You guys are soooo cute...until you start saying youâ€™re horny and all that sexual stuff. That shit is a turn off. Whereâ€™s the fucking romance. Iâ€™d be more thrilled to give someone all of my attention if they give me AFFECTION instead blatantly stating that your little hotdog has woken up. You could be a 10/10 and all of a sudden youâ€™re a 4/10 because youâ€™re just...ugh.
