can someone make me feel better I just failed a math test and Iâ€™ve never failed before but Iâ€™m doing so badly this year and I just donâ€™t know what to do guys. I want to cry but I donâ€™t have the energy for it. I learned 4 new math topics over the past few days and I thought I understood them but I was wrong and it was too late and I just feel so hopeless. iâ€™m scared about what my parents are going to do. I worked really hard and I still didnâ€™t make it. I want to drop out and go back to regular hs. maybe i will.
