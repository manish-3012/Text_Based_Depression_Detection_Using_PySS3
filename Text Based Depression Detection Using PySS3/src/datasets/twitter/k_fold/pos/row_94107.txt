Last Christmas This is my last christmas as a teenager. I turn twenty come 2021, and I am so happy. My mother is single and disabled, and never could afford presents or anything for us, this year I can finally tell her embarassment is gone, and we are all finally just happy to be here with 
each other. In our age, we have grown apart as I have moved states to support myself, and so has my brother. The best christmas present I can think of.
