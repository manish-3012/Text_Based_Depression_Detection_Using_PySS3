Am I in the Wrong? ðŸ¤” I am sixteen years old. I am currently in high-school. I have been working at home, with a lot of free time.

I wanted to save up for an iPad. Seeing that my parents did not have any jobs for me, I decided to apply for jobs elsewhere. I wanted to put half of my pay check towards post-secondary.

I applied for a job at a local supermarket, and I got it. I (for whatever reason) accepted the job as a dishwasher for the deli/restaurant/bakery. It was he##. 

I want to make a note that I was fine with getting dirty. That was not the problem. I had three problems with the position, that pushed me quit. Firstly, they wanted the dishes done in such a way - they were not clean at all, but it saved them money. If someone where to complain, they would get investigated - and I would get in s###. It would give me a bad reputation. Secondly, they lied about my wage. They promised me fifteen, but when I got my first check, I was making only thirteen dollars an hour. Thirdly/finally, the new employees (the second week - ones I have not met before) kept calling me (yes, more than once) a furry f#g###. Couple that all together, I went on break and never went back. This job lasted two weeks. 

I got a second job at Tim Hortons. I want to start off by saying they did not give me training. They started giving me training, but never finished. I got in sh## today because I did not know how to do something, but was never taught it. The expectations the manager has for the employees is unbearable. I am worried that I am not going to pick up fast enough, and let down the team/get fired. I do not feel right working there - it does not seem for me.

I wanted to work in retail. I do not want to work with food. My sister told me to apply at Tim Hortons. I jumped on both opportunities as I thought having a job would be the best thing in the world/something very difficult to get. 

I do not know what I should do. Should I stick it out? I cannot say much about the second job - except for the fact that I do not like it very much. I do not know if that is good enough, as I have not been working there for long. At least the pay is good. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Am I just an id###?
