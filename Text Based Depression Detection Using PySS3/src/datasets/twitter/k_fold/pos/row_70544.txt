YoU sHoUlDn'T gO oUt WitH yOuR cLaSsMaTe I rarely hear this everywhere I go or anywhere I ask that going out with your classmate is weird/bad. Their reasons are:
-what if you break up? (First of all, why would you think immediately about breaking up? Second of all, after a break up you are not some kind of 5 year old to start shouting at them as soon you see them.)
-it's the rules (SINCE WHEN IS THIS A RULE? IT'SO DUMB)
Can somebody change my mind about this? I totally think that you should be able to go out with a classmate. I'm curious if anyone can change my mind. Good luck!
