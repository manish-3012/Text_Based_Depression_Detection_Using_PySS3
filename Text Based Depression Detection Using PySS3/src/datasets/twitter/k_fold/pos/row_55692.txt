My classmates plan to cheat on a test should I tell the teacher I heard one of my classmates talking about cheating on the test and then I also found out that on the last test before this one they copy my answer without my permission and that make me really angry because if the teacher found out I would get in trouble so I kinda want to tell the teacher about their plan now but if they found out they would probably bully me and I donâ€™t want that should I tell the teacher?
