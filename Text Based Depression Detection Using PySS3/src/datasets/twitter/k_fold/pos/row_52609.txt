I just can't come up with good nickname for me help! im trying to come up with orginal and easy to say nickname for games and social media profiles but i cant come up with anything  


i want it mainly to be quick easy to  pronounce  


my name is Olaf so i tried to come with something that starts with O but cant find anything  
my second name is Robert but also nothing really interesting  
i like gaming mostly shooters and turn based strategies, and i do art often  


and i tought that maybe reddit can come up with good nickname ideas?
