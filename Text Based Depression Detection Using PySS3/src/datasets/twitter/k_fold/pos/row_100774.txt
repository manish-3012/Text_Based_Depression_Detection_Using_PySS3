Just came here to rant about how screwed I am. My mom didn't take the time to sign me up for online classes. She didn't take the time to go school shopping (schools on the 30th) not only do I have to go in a large public area for 8 hours but I have to do it with nothing. Fuck my mom and fuck life honestly
