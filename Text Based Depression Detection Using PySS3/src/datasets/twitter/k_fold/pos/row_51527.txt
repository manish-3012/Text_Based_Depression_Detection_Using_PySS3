The one time I almost had a heart attack. On Halloween of 2016, I sleep walked out the door and somehow locked myself outside. This was like 3 am during the â€œClown Purgeâ€ that everyone was talking about. I was absolutely terrified sitting in the corner of the porch after throwing my shoe at the door repeatedly. Eventually, I was let in and we have brought it up every Halloween since. 

Probably not that scary to many people, but, for a 12 year old, it was terrifying.
