Dudes with big egos will eat the spiciest thing in the world and be like â€œI actually like it. It tastes goodâ€ And I just have a hard time believing that. I like spicy food. I *can* eat some extremely spicy things. 


But nobody eats overly spicy things for â€œenjoymentâ€. Its merely to show off. Like chugging liquids super fast. If the food is so spicy that you canâ€™t even taste any flavor, fuck that. Iâ€™m not eating that because i like the food. Spice is GOOD as long as you can actually taste what youâ€™re eating.
