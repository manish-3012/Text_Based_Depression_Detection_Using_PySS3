Iâ€™m so fucking dumb Yesterday, my friend was on the ground grunting from pain.
I ran over and asked whatâ€™s happening.

He said 
â€œI think I broke something in my leg.â€

To which I said,
â€œGot a break? Have a kit-Katâ€
I thought he was April foolsing me.

He was not.

I am the dumbest girl alive. The joke barely makes sense. Save me
