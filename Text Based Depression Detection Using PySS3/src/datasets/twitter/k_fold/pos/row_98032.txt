Your music taste does not bother me I have seen a number of people asking to judge their taste in music. Who cares? It is what you like. I know I am not going to stop listening to a certain band because some people on Reddit told me they do not like them.


Share your music as much as you want, but whatever it is you like, don't bother what someone else would think.
