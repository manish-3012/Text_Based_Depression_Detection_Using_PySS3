My cat just did the cutest fucking thing she was on my bed and as i was walking in my room  she had her head slightly turned towards me. Then when i got closer she turned around and looked like she was sleeping or some shit. Then when i put my hand on her head to pet her she turned and meowed at me. This mf just trued to scare me. She has learned well.
