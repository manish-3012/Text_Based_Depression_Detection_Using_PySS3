Does anyone know what Iâ€™m feeling? I donâ€™t know Does anyone know what Iâ€™m feeling right now?

Yesterday my father had said he pretty much does not consider me one of his children Anymore. And the feel I got, and I have now is confusing me.

When I remember the words he said in the moment, a feeling in my chest, stomach a bit and as strange as it is, my â€œprivate partsâ€ ðŸ˜ like it flushes as if Iâ€™m aroused but I am not. It it definitely negative as I can get my mind off what was said to me. I really want to know what this emotion is, please help? I am a girl if you are wondering, the pain I felt was something different and itâ€™s still longing in me
