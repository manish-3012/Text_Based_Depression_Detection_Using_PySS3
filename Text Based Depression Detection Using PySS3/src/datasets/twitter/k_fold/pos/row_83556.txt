I somehow managed to sleep through my alarm for online class again and I have no idea what to do. Do I lie about my internet connection or tell the truth. I've done it too many times and I don't know how. I have enough sleep too. I just keep sleeping through it somehow. Do I lie and say that the internet was bad or tell the truth.
