I dont like myself I would say hate but then I'll sound like a emotional teen.

I dont like to socialize, I hate how people change who they are to comfort those around them. Smile at jokes they dont find funny, make fun of others so they wont be the target of humiliation, lying to yourself and others so that no one tries to find whatever your hiding from people.

I hate that about people, dishonesty. And yet. . . .I became what I loath, a liar. I tend to smile when I want to cry, laugh when I want to yell and when someone asks me what's wrong I concede and lie and say nothing.

It's a bad habit I've developed and can't change, and even if I could. . .I think I would be too afraid to.
