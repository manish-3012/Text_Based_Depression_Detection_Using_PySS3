I hate my math teacher so much This man has made the last 2 year's of math hell. He just doesn't care and it reflex in everything he does. He is an ass about everything late work test retakes and just in how he teaches.  I missed the test due to being sick 2 days ago and  I just learned today from another kid that we could use notes he never told me. I just wished he cared he is just a selfish guy who hates teaching but yet still does it. Smh wish me luck tomarrow dudes and thanks for letting me vent.
