Wake up samurai After all of these years of doing it I came to realize that all I do is to trick me into thinking that I'm loved. I try to make myself believe for a few seconds that I'm actually somewhere, with someone, doing something as an act of love. But after that reality is hitting 10 times harder. After all of those thoughts you are left empty. A void starts creeping into your soul and sooner or later you'll realize that it no longer brings you any joy, but rather pain and despair. You are left hoping that some day you'll meet someone you could love, someone that would love you back. Wake up samurai, wake yourself up before life does it.
