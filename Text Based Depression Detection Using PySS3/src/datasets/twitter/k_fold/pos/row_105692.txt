Why do people think mental illness is cute!? I am fucking fed up. Why do girls at my school go around and say â€œI have depressionâ€ or â€œ I have OCDâ€ and play it off like it is cute because it is not in my eye or anyone elseâ€™s that I know. It isnâ€™t â€œcuteâ€ or â€œquirkyâ€ it is downright fucked up to do that when there are actually real people who have these mental disorders. I think it is very disrespectful to people who have actual mental illness. All Iâ€™m saying is that it is fucked and needs to stop!
