So I'm writing a goofy story and I need suggestions It's about a caveman named Cedric, he's considered the hero of the tribe. then some sky pirates show up (in a zeppelin / pirate ship hybrid) and steal all the village's things, kidnap some cavechildren to train to be pirates, and take Cedric's pet ankylosaurus. Naturally, Cedric goes on an action-fantasy adventure to clobber some fools with his club

I'm trying to think of a sidekick to come along with Cedric. As fun as it is just having a caveman go \*bonk\* on some things, I want another character just so that Cedric has someone to talk to. I don't care about keeping the story realistic, so they can be something like a knight or a superhero or whatever

lay me some sidekick suggestions mi amigos
