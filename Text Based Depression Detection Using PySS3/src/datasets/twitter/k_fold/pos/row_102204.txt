Something that Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a while Iâ€™ve been wanting to cosplay my favorite video game character since October. However, my mom can see everything I buy with my credit card and I donâ€™t want her to know I like cosplay. I also donâ€™t want my friends to know about it. I just wanna see how fun it is.
