"Fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you." Rest in peace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you're my hero and the hero to millions of women, minorities, and oppressed people in the US and the world. She was a supreme court justice for 13 years and as a lawyer and judge, she advocated for women's and minorities' rights for over 60 years. She taught opressed people across the world to stand up for their beliefs and be strong and to colaborate with the people you disagree witht so that tyou can understand them and they can understand you. She will likely be replaced by a conservtive man who stands for everythings she faught against. He will likely do everything in his power to undo all the work in social progression for the past 60 years. She's stopped Trump from doing a lot of unethical, unconstitutional and unjust things but now she's gone and the supreme court will fall into Trumps favor. Fuck 2020.
