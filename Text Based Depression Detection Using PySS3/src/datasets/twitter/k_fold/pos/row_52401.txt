Too tired to study but not enough to sleep You ever feel too fired to study but not enough to sleep? or just can't sleep at all so you just sit there doing nothing? 

Have you ever felt that way before? 
if so have you figured out how to overcome this weird state of mind? cause I'm struggling with this rn.
