Stop saying donâ€™t do drugs Whenever I open this subreddit I always see things like â€œdrugs fry your brainâ€ and shit. Stop it. If used correctly, drugs can be extremely beneficial to people who need them. If we didnâ€™t have this mentality that drugs would hurt you, then we would be much better off as a society. Now im not saying do ever drug that you come across, like donâ€™t do opioids and other bad shit. But substances like, shrooms, LSD (somewhat) and marijuana have so much potential to help people. Do your research and donâ€™t be a brainwashed idiot. Lastly, this isnâ€™t a call to action for you to use these substances, but if you do, do it in a smart way and donâ€™t get yourself killed.
