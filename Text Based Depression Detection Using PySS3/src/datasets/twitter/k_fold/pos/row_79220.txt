Why me? Why the fuck am I depressed? Like for real. I know so many people with MUCH worse situations but they are fine (I talked with them and atleast with most of them i know they are not depressed) and even if they are/would be they atleast have a fucking reason for it. While my priviledge ass sits around all day not knowing what to do with himself. I dont want them to be depressed i just want to know what kind of sick joke my life is. How can I be depressed with a life people would kill for? I hate it and I know this is Ironic but I hate myself for it. Instead of sucking it up and dealing with it I make everyone else's life worse. Fuck this. Im not gonna kill myself cause I wont give whichever devil did this to me the satisfaction. Thank you for reading. I felt like I judt needed to vent this somewhere.
