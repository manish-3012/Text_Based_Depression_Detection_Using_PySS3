I have commitment issues and I like the idea of sleeping around When I say sleep around I donâ€™t necessarily mean hooking up with strangers so far Iâ€™ve just hooked up with friends who were willing to fuck.

One day I want to settle down but thatâ€™s scary to me because Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll disappoint me or the love will fade.

I also may be developing a sex addiction.
