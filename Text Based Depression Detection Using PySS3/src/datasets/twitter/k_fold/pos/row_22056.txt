I sometimes wish I was born in another country (15yo filipino)  I have a lot of ambitions but they all seem to unrealistic, when you live in the most underground city of the Philippines, chances are you won't get into anything in life. You can't get a job unless you have a college degree ( so telling me collage is not for everyone is the equivalent of saying I don't need to breath) even at 16 you can't get a job.
I really want to pursue art and music but it seems that my normie slowflake of a city is to small minded for that 
(I also hate that they always pop their phones on concerts it's fucking annoying)
I sometimes wish I was born in a first world country 
You guys had it good, am not trying to guilt trip anyone. Am just saying why there's no hope for me
No one understands what it's like being born in a third world country no one
No. One.
