Alright, I don't support underage drinking, but I know it's rampant at least in the U.S. so I'm here to make a quick PSA about safe drinking habits!  

1. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not rail drinks, your body can only process so much alcohol, and that equals out to roughly (per type, not total) 12 fl oz. of beer (closer to 8 if it's from a local brewery), 8 fl oz. of wine, or ***at the very most*** two shots per hour. any more than this can cause you to lose feeling and result in severe injury or death (not directly, but not being able to feel pain doesn't help impaired judgment or avoiding danger). 
2. For beer or wine, try to drink the same amount of water as alcohol at a minimum, and with shots, at the very least, 4 times as much water, as this helps to dilute and re-hydrate the body, it also helps to prevent horrible hangovers the morning after. 
3. If a friend is drinking heavily, stay with them, it may seem OK to leave them with a blanket and pillow next to a toilet, but this can and has turned out very poorly for countless people, often resulting in permanent brain damage due to oxygen deprivation due to choking on their own vomit, or from seizures caused by the alcohol (you donâ€™t need to have a history of seizures to have one while drinking), so stay with them, even if you donâ€™t want to, or make sure that they have someone to check on them every few minutes.
4. Drink as little as possible, period end of story, drinking as much as possible may seem cool, but it just turns you into a belligerent dumbass, donâ€™t do it.

Stay safe peeps, and please, make good decisions
