I fucking hate California â€¢ Leads the country in Covid cases

â€¢ Huge fires burning everywhere causing horrible air quality, loss of homes, and death.

â€¢ Its 100 degrees or hotter every day when the air quality is finally ok

â€¢ Homeless people everywhere 

â€¢ So. Expensive.

Anyways besides the beaches this state sucks ass and I'm planning to leave after this year for college and not come back (except to visit family here and there)
