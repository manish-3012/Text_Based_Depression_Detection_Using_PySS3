My mom keeps saying indirectly that i'm some kind of "p*rn" addict and possibly bring some kind of harm. My phone recently got wet and isn't working so i was using my mom's phone, i have been using her phone due to this reason for some days now just to keep up with current affairs, but every night/ everytime she snatches the phone away from my hands she always tells this strange vague lines like: "i know the stuff you see" "there's a reason why (one my uncles) doesn't let you near his daughters" etc. etc. i usually would'nt mind these sentences much, but today it went too far; talking about my (female) cousins feeling uncomfortable being around me is just shocking. The society where i live in is pretty conservative and orthodox about stuff like this, i try my hardest to not break that "touch barrier" (which actually haunts me later). this has now got me thinking that am i like the "all men are the same" kind of thing and women actually feel uncomfortable around me. i have no siblings and in part due to this reason i always feel that nobody will love me as their own and leaves me crying and desperate for some hugs. that sentence has now left me without sleep and thinking all weird things in my mind
