United States NNN For those Americans who emptied their seed on November 1st, 12:00-12:59, do not be frightened. Most states in the US follow daylights saving time, so the clocks were dialed back one hour on November first. If you masterbated during the 12:00â€™s on November first, you are still in the challenge. Since it was daylight savings time, you actually were masterbating at 11:00-11:59pm on October 31st. 
Congratulations, you are still in the challenge.
