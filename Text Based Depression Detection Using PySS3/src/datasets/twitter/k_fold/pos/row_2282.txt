Self love is so important; one of the important aspects of self love is knowing when someone is treating you right/wrong in a relationship. I see this happen a lot where someone will be stuck on someone that doesnâ€™t treat them right, such as always making them upset, makes them feel unloved, and other negative emotions.

Self love is important to gain so you can easily notice when someone isnâ€™t treating you right. Whatâ€™s the point of staying with someone when they make you feel like shit? 

Thereâ€™s so many people in this world thereâ€™s no reason to settle for someone that makes you sad and when can be with someone that makes you happy and treats you the way you want to be treated.

Idk, I felt compelled to write this because Iâ€™ve been talking to my friend about their situation relating to this for awhile.
