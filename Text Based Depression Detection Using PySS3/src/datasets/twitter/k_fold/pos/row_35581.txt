I will be holding a drawing competition. Read below for more information. I have decided that I will be holding a competition for drawing for those of you who would like to join. The reason I'm holding this competition is because it's something I've always wanted to take part in, so therefore I assume at least a few of you would like to, as well. 

TOPIC- The topic will be cartoon/anime characters. 

Post your submissions on your accounts and DM me the link to your posts. I will be doing polls to decide who the winner is.

RULES

-It must be your original art, no tracing or claiming something isnt yours is.

-I will not be accepting any more submissions on the 28.

-i will not accept NSFW drawings, depictions of rape, pedophilia, or anything else that might cause somewhat of a trigger. However, slight blood is allowed.

-Maximum of two characters can be in the drawing.

-Bullying is not allowed, and if I find out you are doing so I will exclude you from the contest.



Deadline: September 27
