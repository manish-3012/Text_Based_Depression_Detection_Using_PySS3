Finally told my crush I love him Well, I told him that I loved him, he said he doesn't feel the same for me, I asked him if I still could do something like touch his pecs(He has perfect pecs) but he told me he prefers me to not do it, but we still are friends, as good as before, I'll keep loving him, I hope one day he'll change his mind, but for now, I'm lonely and rn really sad
