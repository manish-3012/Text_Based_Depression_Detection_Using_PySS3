Being a closeted gay guy Iâ€™ve identified myself as gay for a few months, but Iâ€™ve had those feelings towards guys for a long time now. Iâ€™m out to a few irl people and some online friends but no one in my family knows. 

I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll tell them but I might wait till I get into a relationship (which would probably not happen till college at a minimum)  because high school is making me busy. Iâ€™m not interested in a relationship right now though because it would stress me out too much, Iâ€™m just 15. Plus idk how my parents would react jf I tell â€˜em Iâ€™m gay especially my mom. 

If anyone has any commentary or stories related to being in the closet Iâ€™d love to hear it.
