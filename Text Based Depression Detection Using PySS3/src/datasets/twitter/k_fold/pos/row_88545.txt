I need to convince someone this is actually a great anime pitch.  So there's this sassy French maid, right? She's employed in the mansion of the CEO of this huge international company. *But what nobody else knows is that this French maid is actually the current form a Lovecraftian terror who arrived in our dimension at the dawn of time itself.*  Well this CEO is a having one of his rich billionaire parties on the night of the Blood Moon, when this maid will take her true form as an Eldritch abomination. As the series progresses, the audience learns of the failed romantic past of the CEO. He has all these bitter ex-girlfriends that he cheated on who are trying to sabotage the party, but the maid always foils their plans, while trying not to devour the souls of the entire mansion staff. Well, come the night of the party, the maid assumes her true form and consumes everyone at the party, except the CEO. So the CEO is standing before this giant blob of teeth and eyes and explains that this is what was missing in his life. He thought he could fill his loneliness with money, but he really just needed an all-consuming, alien terror to fill the void in his life. And the series becomes a stereotypical romantic-comedy. 

Would you watch this?
