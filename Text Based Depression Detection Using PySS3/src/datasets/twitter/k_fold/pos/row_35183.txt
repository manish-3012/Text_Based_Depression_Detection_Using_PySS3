My crush complimented me. Last Friday she started talking to me as we were waiting to be picked up (we're both freshmen)  and she said that she had been wanting to talk to me since the start of school because she thought I was cool. She had been giving me looks across the room for the past few weeks, and I thought that she thought that I was creepy because I'm a really, really big guy (6'2 over 200 lbs.) that looks like an adult ( I have a beard too), but now I know that it was because she thought that I was cool.
