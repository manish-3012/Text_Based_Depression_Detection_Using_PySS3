So my mom made me cry (rant) (Idk if this adds anything but I'm a freshman) So I got a little progress update for my French class (the only class I'm talking rn) and I got 81% and I told my mom is was happy with anything about 80% but my mom said she would have rathered 85% or higher and kinda made a face at first. While everyone else said they were proud of me, she pretty much said it wasnt enough. Her reasoning is I've been doing french for 5 years but this is a Highschool class. And I'm in the advanced class. I've been trying hard just to keep up becuase everything has to go so fast but she doesn't seem to see that and expects so much of me. She gets upset when I cant spend time with her and I have to do my schoolwork which is hypocritical of her becuase she said that school work comes first over the summer. Last week I had this big project and when my mom asked if I was going to come outside with them I said "no, I'm doing schoolwork." And she made a face and said "ok." Super upset sounding with a hint of frustration.
