I messed up idk what to do. So yesterday I was kinds horny. And I met this guy here and we got to talking. He was openly gay. And I am a closeted bi at a ratio of 90% boys 10% girl attraction, sorry ladies. Anyways. I was talking to him and see were horny. We exchanged face pics amongst other things. I asked him about the G spot for guys and he corrected the misinformation I had by showing me exactly how to find it, we found the perfect sized object my posh XL vape pen. 

And I did it, I came. Without even touching myself. 
It felt amazing then but. Today. After the day was over and I started feeling horny and for some reason it felt like I  started feeling the vape pen in my ass. Nothing was there. But it felt like it was and it felt like it was rubbing my g spot which was physically making me horny. For no fucking reason. My prostate was vibrating. it stopped half an hour ago but it was scary cuz I've never felt that before. It felt like being horny but from my ass. This is not a troll post. I actually do my best to help suicidal kids and adults. But rn. I'm kinda scared.
