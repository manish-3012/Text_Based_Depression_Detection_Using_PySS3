I broke into my own house through a 8.6â€ (22 cm) window. Itâ€™s not the first time that this happens, butâ€™s without a doubt the most painful one. 

This happened because my dad forgot to ask my mom for his keys back before she left to go to her workplace after church, so when we came back to the house and figured there was no other way for is to get in, I had to push myself through the window into the bathroom in order to open the door. 

In case youâ€™re wondering how I did it: I am 5â€™3â€ (1.60) and 91.5 lbs, and this is the [window](https://imgur.com/x15ZjaE).
