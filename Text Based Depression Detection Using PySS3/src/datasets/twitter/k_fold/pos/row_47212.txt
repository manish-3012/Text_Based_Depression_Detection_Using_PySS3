I get flustered way too easy Itâ€™s annoying as hell, I canâ€™t take a compliment by the opposite gender without looking like a ripe tomato. Itâ€™s like every emotion is a â€œflustered + happyâ€ or something like that. I get more embarrassed as I start to stick out like a sore thumb and it turns into a fucking endless cycle of stuff like that, it looks cute but it doesnâ€™t feel cute.
