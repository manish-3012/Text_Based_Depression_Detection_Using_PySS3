Characters/ people that are huggable that Iâ€™m sad I cant hug (mostly jojo character yeah yeah jojo bad okay I know) Jean-Pierre Polnareff: big man, warm personality, would treat you as he treats Shelly (sherry? Idk), will adopt you immediately 

Bruno Bucciarati: very good hugs, will feed you if youâ€™re hungry, will adopt you and the price is joining a gang that they rarely get hurt in 

Tonio Trussardi: happy wholesome man, will definitely feed you even if youâ€™re not hungry, cares for your health

Gelato and Sorbet: will take you as their child, double hug, will do your nails whether you like it or not so you match them, you are their child no matter how old you are

Leone Abbacchio: will only happen if you gain his trust which is already a big achievement, will tell you not to speak of it, congratulations youâ€™re probably one of the only seven at most people heâ€™s hugged in his life

Robert EO Speedwagon: yes, good hug, will protect you and make sure you donâ€™t get into bad situations, will teach you life lessons, wonâ€™t be late to any event

The Pillar Men:  Idk just look at them thatâ€™d be a great hug- Kars wouldnâ€™t hurt anything (except Joseph) until he became the ultimate life form, Wamuu is proud- he would teach you things and hug you when you use/ solve them the right way, Esidisi would after you do something fun- they are the ultimate fathers 

Mikitaka Hazekura: alien or not- wholesome hug hes a good guy Iâ€™d hug him, I just wonâ€™t give him a package of tissues or let sirens be around him. He cares for animals too so heâ€™d be protective or something idk

Josuke Higashikata 2- Amnesic Boogaloo: he probably needs it (I havenâ€™t read that part yet but from what Iâ€™ve seen, yeah he probably does)

Gyro Zeppeli: pizza mozzarella
