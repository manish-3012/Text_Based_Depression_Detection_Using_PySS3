Please help us!! We live in the Southern part of New Jersey, in the Estell Manor area, in Woodbine. That is the area she lives in. She was last seen on the morning of September 3rd, as stated in the link/photo. And also as stated, local PD are now helping. Please if you see this girl, let the police know what's going on and where she was last seen and all of that. We need to find her! She has never been the best in terms of mental health and we are afraid of the worst, and being school starting back up, that could be a load of stress and a potential tipping point. Please help us! This is the link to her dad's contact info via Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/kevin.weisgerber.7
Anything helps! Please!! She's only 16!!
