Iâ€™ve just been rejected. The girl I like (Weâ€™ll call her Lauren) was livestreaming on Instagram. I watched it because I was hoping it would make me lose interest in her because I had been obsessing over her. So she was talking with her friend that was at her house and they were being boring. So far, so good (my goal is to stop obsessing over her). One of her friends said something about getting drunk and I said that they shouldnâ€™t be underaged drinking. She calls me a cuck and says â€œwell, noone askedâ€. Again, this is perfect. Iâ€™m losing romantic interest in her already. Then she does some cringey TicToc dances. She went from an 8 to a 5 in a matter of seconds. 20 or so minutes later, she invites another friend onto the live with her. He asks for things to do, I suggest making an origami swan. Sheâ€™s baffled (probably doesnâ€™t know what origami is). Then I tell her that Japanese soldiers used to practice making 1,000 origami swans to help them with self-discipline, if Iâ€™m remembering correctly. She blares out â€œnerd alertâ€. Iâ€™m a little hurt, but thatâ€™s what I want (thatâ€™s what she said). Then this guy with the same name as me joins the stream. She says â€œHey, Brendon (fake name), we should hang out sometime. Itâ€™s been too longâ€. She then clarified that she wasnâ€™t talking about me. A minute later, she tells me to leave. Before she kicks me off, her guest has enough time to say â€œLook at this dood, geekin out over japan soldiers and weeb shitâ€. Again, Iâ€™m hurt. But Iâ€™d say this was a success. I now see her as an arrogant bitch instead of sentient flawlessness.

Tldr: I watch my crushâ€™s livestream in hopes of losing interest in her. Mission accomplished.

Edit: I realised I didnâ€™t need to give her a fake name because I never even called her by name, but oh well. I did and you canâ€™t stop me.
