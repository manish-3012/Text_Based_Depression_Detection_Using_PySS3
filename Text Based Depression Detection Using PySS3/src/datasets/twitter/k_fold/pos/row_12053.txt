Somebody tell me one fucking thing How the HELL is r/AskTrumpSupporters taking the election results WAY fucking better than r/conservative? Non supporters for Trump canâ€™t make top level comments in the megathread in r/asktrumpsupporters, so itâ€™s clearly genuine. r/conservative is bitching and crying while r/asktrumpsupporters are just like â€œWell now I am a Biden supporter and he has my support until he loses itâ€ and â€œCongrats to him, I hope our country moves in a good direction.â€ Like what

r/asktrumpsupporters, I only wish I could take things as well as you.
