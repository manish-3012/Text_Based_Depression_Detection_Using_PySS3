Kinda need to vent about a lot of stuff Basically you donâ€™t have to read or respond to this but basically Iâ€™m failing every lesson at school and although Iâ€™m trying to concentrate I just canâ€™t take any of it in and I feel stupid and everyone thinks Iâ€™m stupid and I hate it. It was bad before but it keeps getting worse, everything does, like how insecure I feel about my face and my body, and how all my friends and people close to me keep becoming distant, and how I just feel like no one here wants me, and I know youâ€™ll all comment like â€œwe want youâ€ but none of your lives will change if I died, you wouldnâ€™t even know, and no one I know irl will care, so whatâ€™s the point?
