What to post on Instagram? My IG is empty and idk what to post. It's quarantine now and I rarely go out usually and when I do, it never occurs to me to take photos. 


I usually don't find photos all that interesting tbh so idk what people would find interesting. Maybe I can just randomly take a photo of myself that I think looks ok.
