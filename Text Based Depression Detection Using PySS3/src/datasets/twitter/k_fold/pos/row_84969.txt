Itâ€™s so soul crushing when you mess up during recitals. I didnâ€™t cry and have panic attacks and make my fingers so sore I can barely move them (piano) just to mess up during the recital. And then everyoneâ€™s like â€œJesus stop being so hard on youself.â€ I mean okay. You mean well. But youâ€™re also invalidating how I feel about this, painting me as some sort of crazy piano chick, when I just wanted my work to pay off.
