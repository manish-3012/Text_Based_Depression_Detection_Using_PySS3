goodbye reddit....for now goodbye reddit....for now

so itâ€™s only less than a hundred days to the biggest and most important test in my entire life. iâ€™ve deleted instagram and all my games except for Among Us a few months ago and i see little progress. i think that, in order for me to actually stop using my phone is to actually delete all social media, reddit included.

so i guess this is goodbye. within 24 hours i will delete reddit and if like to say goodbye to this awesome community that got me through this period of time. iâ€™m hoping for some farewells lol

and btw i am not joking iâ€™m actually leaving until January and i wonâ€™t even be here for my cake d :â€™(
