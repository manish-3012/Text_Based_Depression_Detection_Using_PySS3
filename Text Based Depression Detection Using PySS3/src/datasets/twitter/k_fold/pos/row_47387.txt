Iâ€™m super fucking dumb So Iâ€™m doing a mural in my bedroom. The whole thing is 4ft x 4ft. There are six grid boxes on either side, since itâ€™s a square. And I, for the past half an hour, couldnâ€™t figure out how big each of the grid boxes would be.

And I just figured it out. The answer is was very obvious. 

Anyways, howâ€™s all you guys?
