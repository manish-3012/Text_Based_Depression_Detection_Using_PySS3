I hate how politics tear families apart My mom is constantly mad at me because I do not support her political beliefs 

My brother constantly tries to start arguements with me because I dont support his political beliefs 

I honestly just wanna sit in my room and listen to music but they always bring up the orange man and praise him 

I honestly dont care if they support him or not but they honestly just need to shut up about it. I wish my mom stops showing me every fox news article that talks about trump. I wish my brother will stop showing me videos about trump on the Republican side of Tik Tok

Like they honestly need to stop shoving it down my damn throat 

Look support who you want but please dont try forcing your beliefs down other people's throats
