I cried today  This year hasnâ€™t been the best for me I found out my half brother died in may due to a seizure caused by a fight he had a year ago and my other half brother (me and my brothers are related through my dad who We havenâ€™t seen in years)brother is in prison I donâ€™t know why, and I get a call in the middle of school while Iâ€™m in the bathroom so answer it. My brother friend had snuck a phone into prison and let my brother borrow it and the first thing he did was call me. So I sat in the bathroom for 15 minutes talking to my brother instead of being in french Iâ€™m really looking forward to January 21 2021 because that Is the day I get to hug him again
