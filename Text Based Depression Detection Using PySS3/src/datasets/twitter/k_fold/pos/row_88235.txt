Honestly, I hate my life, hate myself, and I'm not really interested in life in general anymore. I don't have a single friend. I haven't had one since I was in 3rd grade, no exaggeration. My family is low on money because of Covid. We will probably need to move out of California, but we have no idea where. My grades are too low to go to a good college. My GPA is only a 2.9. I'm failing two classes and have 23 missing assignments .I will never find a girlfriend in my life. I'm underweight. I'm stressed out to the max in general too just because of how awful this year has been.

I'm losing motivation for life. And this has been developing inside of me for a few years now.
