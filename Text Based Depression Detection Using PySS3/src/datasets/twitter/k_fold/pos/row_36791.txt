I feel fucking powerful. It is not much but I feel like sharing cause it made me not only happy but powerful too.

You know how people delete texts, pictures and burn memories after breaking up? Well I had been going through a low for a few months now with exams approaching in two months.

I was telling a friend who was very close to me about my feelings and how I cannot manage to get out of it. This bitch told me and I quote- "I know I sound like a bitch but just don't indulge in such feelings" and there goes me crying after the call ends. I wish she didn't tell me that.

She has said/done a few things to piss me off and the last string was me wanting to actually self harm again after like years. 

I decided today that I'm done. I'll hardly interact with her and I'm gonna unstar all of our texts which remind me of a bittersweet time and pictures of us. I don't need a friend like her, I may not be strong right now, but I'm strong enough to cut ties with a person who is the reason I hate myself more.
