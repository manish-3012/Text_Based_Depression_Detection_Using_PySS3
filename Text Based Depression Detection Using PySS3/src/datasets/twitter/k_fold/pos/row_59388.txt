Sheâ€™s still in my dreams Last week my best friend died. She had purposely shot herself. Every single night since then I have dreamt of her. Their all nightmares too. I almost donâ€™t even want to see her, because when I wake up I know itâ€™s all a lie. 

I just want my best friend back. Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t save you like you saved me.
