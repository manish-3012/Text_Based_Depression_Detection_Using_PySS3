God damnit can I ever catch a break Heading into college and I registered for a mandatory orientation, right? Well, 3 days ago I received an email stating I have to confirm I was going to be there by the next day. One problem: I was out at a camping site and my service was slow so I couldn't access my college emails on my phone. Normally, I would check it out in my emails, but they sent it TO MY TWIN's email. i just shot a message back today since I finally saw the email apologizing for the late response (due to the spotty service) and that I would be attending, so let's see how it goes.
