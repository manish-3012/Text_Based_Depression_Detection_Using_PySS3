FUCK BRO FUCK I had a dream that I was talking to my crush that Iâ€™ve thought was a 10/10 with a 9/10 personality for 4 years. Like since 6th grade Iâ€™ve always thought she was not only a 10, but she was a nice person, funny, and understanding. She rejected me 3 years ago understandably, like I donâ€™t even like myself from 3 years ago, I was pretty weird, but I wasnâ€™t mad about that because we stayed friends and left this behind us. Then she got a boyfriend and I was a LITTLE mad because I knew she was with someone that wasnâ€™t me, and someone else was living out my dreams, which hurt, but I got over that pretty fast. I forgot about her for the last year since I never saw her, but last night I had a dream that we were talking and remembering middle school, like how I got rejected and how I started liking her because I would DM her every day after school and we would talk for hours, and how much fun she made English class for me. When I woke up it just got me pissed off. Her skin was always warm which made me feel good when we bumped elbows in class. I donâ€™t know how I didnâ€™t see it though, she was using classic excuses on me back then like â€œoh sorry my phone is about to dieâ€ or â€œsorry Iâ€™m with my friends right now.â€ I just miss those days and yes thereâ€™s plenty of fish in the sea but theyâ€™re not her man. Either way I gotta see my friends again this pandemic is fucking me up and I get back home for the first time in 2 months in a couple weeks. I wish I was the person I am now back then though because maybe then we would be dating. Who knows though
