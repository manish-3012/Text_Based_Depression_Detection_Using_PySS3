My best friend I need some advice. I really like a my friend elena. I've known her pretty much my whole life. I love her and I care about her very much but I don't think she sees me the same way. She says things like we wouldn't end up together and stuff like that. But she gives off small hints that she likes me. I really don't know if she likes me or not. I want to tell her that I like her but I'm scared of getting embarrassed and rejected. I need help. what should I do? I've liked her for the past 3 years.
