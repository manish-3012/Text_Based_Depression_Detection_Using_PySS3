I feel terrible in every way I'm exhausted from school stuff and I have a headache 

My friend won't respond to my texts 

I think I'm pushing People around me away for I don't know what reasons

I feel like my friends don't really care for me, they just want me when it's convenient for them

I feel empty lol I dunno why 

Can someone please tell me what I should do to feel better?

And I'm sorry for being this depressing, I don't like spreading negativity
