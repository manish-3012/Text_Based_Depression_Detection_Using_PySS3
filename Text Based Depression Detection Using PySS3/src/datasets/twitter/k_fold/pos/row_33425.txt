Doubting my choice of education Im currently in school for becoming an automatician, but im doubting if I really want to become one. I have started thinking about stuff I like. I would like to have a job where I can talk to people, maybe entertain then, but not talk about their problems. I dont know any jobs who has this as a focus. Any suggestions?
