my mom brutally hit me and i'm bleeding she scratched me so bad that my right wrist is bleeding a lot and it doesn't seem to be stopping. i didn't hit back of course, because she's my mother. i'm still being blamed for "raising my voice". if parents can scream at their kids, why can't kids scream back?
