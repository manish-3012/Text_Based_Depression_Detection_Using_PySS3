itâ€™s over Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for a month, I thought things were going good, I was even gonna ask her out and make it â€œofficialâ€ soon. But for the last few days shes been texting really dry, so when i asked her whatâ€™s up she basically said itâ€™s over and that she â€œfound someone that matches w her betterâ€. What the fuck does that even mean. I donâ€™t even want advice or whatever I just want someone else to hear this bullshit. What the fuck.
