What are your guys thoughts on the asian american hate crimes in recent news. Recently I stumbled upon a recent news article which was covering attacks on asian americans and I just found it horrible how teenagers we're taking part in these hate crimes as recently a Thai man in his 80's was shoved for no apparent reason and later died due to brain trauma. These action were later taken as not a hate crime since in the words of the defendant's lawyer "the man was wearing a mask and a hat therefore it's impossible for it to be a hate crime" this just seems wrong seeing as any unjustified attack should be considered a hate crime. Now this may just be my opinion but I'd like to know what you guys think of it.
