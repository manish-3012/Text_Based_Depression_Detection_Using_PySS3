Hot take: guys who comment "incoming simps" on girl's photos are just as weird as simps Like you're saying that you find this person hot enough for you to think people would simp over them so you decide to warn them? That's like saying watch out for creeps to a hot girl or something like that and at the end of the day is really weird and doesn't make you look any better.
