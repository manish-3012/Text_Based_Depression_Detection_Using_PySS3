Damn this shit is annoying The fucking superstraight bs is really starting to piss me off. I never agreed with it but I wasnâ€™t going to stop anyone. At this point theyre actually excluding transgender people for the LGBT community, and saying that itâ€™s the â€œLGBSâ€ community now and they say transgender people still are what they were born as. Theyâ€™re getting mad saying that weâ€™re â€œsuperstraight phobicâ€ when the entirety of their community is based off of transphobia.
