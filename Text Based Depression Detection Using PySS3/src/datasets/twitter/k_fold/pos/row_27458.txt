Want braces/Invisalign but parents say they can't afford it? Try Candid! I wanted Invisalign to fix my smile forever but my parents couldnt afford it and insurance wouldnt cover it. So I found Candid, a clear aligner company that works entirely remotely. You do it all from home, including the teeth imprints, scanning your teeth using your phone to automatically send progress pics to your doctor, and can meet over video-camera with your doctor super easily. Also - it's easily $2k cheaper than Invisalign, and super easy if you have a crazy schedule like me and can't go to the dentist's/orthodontist's office every few weeks because you do it ALL from home.

Follow my link for $250 MORE off and a free starter kit for your teeth imprints. They also have AMAZING payment plans! I wish I did it in high school but my first year of college is cool too lol

There are also other companies that are similar, like Smile Direct Club and Byte. Explore your options before picking one!
