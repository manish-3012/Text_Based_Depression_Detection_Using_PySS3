you ever just be nice to people because being nice is better than being mean. But then youâ€™re too nice and it takes over, and then they start liking you, and youâ€™re conflicted about youâ€™re emotions because like you kinda like them but itâ€™s literally impossible so you canâ€™t do anything. And then you also like a second girl and you talk to her both and both those girls are best friends and your scheming friend checks her messages and sees all the messages about you and heâ€™s upset because he also likes girl 1. yeah it do be like that sometimes. Like before i was a jerk and i recognized that and now that iâ€™m nice my emotions are all still up in shambles. It just isnâ€™t working out. There was a period of time where i didnâ€™t have any dumb emotions running through my head and it was great and i just had a good time. Now i tried being nice to people and my emotions just went and fucked it up. yeah so thatâ€™s fun. Whatâ€™s up with yâ€™all?
