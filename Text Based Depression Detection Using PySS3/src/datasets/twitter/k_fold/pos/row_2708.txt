With my art account, do I follow people from that follow me on my main, or do I just promote it with my story? So I have an art account I recently started and I also have a main. Should I first mass follow the people on my main, or just advertise it in my story on my main? I feel like not many people will follow me because me follow ratio is 49 followers to 3 following, so theyâ€™ll think I wonâ€™t follow them back...
