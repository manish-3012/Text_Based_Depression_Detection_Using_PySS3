A bit of advice for everyone So I have often thought about what I would say too a person who asked for some life advice, I have figured it out and Iâ€™m going to share. 
If you think that there is a possibility of you being happy with someone you should always shoot your shot. It doesnâ€™t matter if you think that they are way out of your league or â€œyou just know that they would say noâ€. I canâ€™t stress how important it is to always try. The worst case scenario is a little embarrassment, and I think we have all been there. You move on knowing that you donâ€™t have to be stuck on this person anymore. Trust me the best decision I ever made was asking out my girlfriend. I thought she was way out of my league and would think I was weird, but here I am today in a healthy loving relationship going on one year in October. And  I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better girlfriend. This is why I urge everyone to try, you never know when youâ€™ll find someone perfect.
