Alcohol is ruining my life. I'm not going to make a multiple paragraph essay on this because I really don't feel like it. However, alcohol has literally drove me to suicidal thoughts and depression multiple times now, and I'm not even the one drinking. People around me currently and in the past are absolutely terrible when they drink, and it normally ends up involving me when I'm already in a terrible state because of other things in my life. I'm not abused, and I'm fortunate for that, but it still fucking sucks. They always end up pointing out all my insecurities and talk behind my back even though they are grown ass adults, and they yell at me just cause they feel like it. I can't be myself in my own fucking house and I can't let out any of my feelings without knowing it will be used against me next time they get drunk. I just needed to let that out, sorry for wasting your time.
