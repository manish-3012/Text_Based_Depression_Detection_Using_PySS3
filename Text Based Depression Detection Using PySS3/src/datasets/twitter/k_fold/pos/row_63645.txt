Are there any webnovels similar to 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' ? I loved the novel because I loved the characters and the extremely well-crafted setting. The main character isn't handsome or talented but he maintains a cool head, winning only in situations he can win, and extremely smart in what he does. The other characters were also extremely well crafted and lovable. 

The REAL main character isn't even the main character of the story and the main character of the story has so much REALISTIC struggles and thoughts.

The other characters have their distinct personality and the setting, idea of this novel is INSANELY well-crafted, a reader as a bystander of the novel he is reading.

I'm almost done with the novel however, is there any novels similar? Thx.
