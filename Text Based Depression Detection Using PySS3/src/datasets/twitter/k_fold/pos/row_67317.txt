Would you watch a movie about 2020? Not a disaster movie or horror or anything but like a psychological horror/drama about someoneâ€™s dip into insanity and their inability to support themselves and their family and quarantine depression being sort of represented by some dream demon thing in their dreams but never in the real world other then in hallucinations?
