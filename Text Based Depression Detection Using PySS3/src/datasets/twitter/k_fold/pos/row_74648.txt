As a girl, what can I do about having a wide and masculine-looking jawline? Should I just wear my hair down or something?  I don't quite know what to do, supposedly my eyes and lips are feminine-looking but my jawline is very wide and masculine-looking (although even when I posted a vid here with my hair down some asshole still said that I had a weird head shape bc this is Reddit.)  Would makeup help too idk
