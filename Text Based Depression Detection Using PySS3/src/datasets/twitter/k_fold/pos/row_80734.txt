My step sister left her phone open She's 17, she went out to get something on her friends house, she was adopted on the age of 5, basically I'm older I'm 18. I went to her room to clean it and after that do laundry, I saw her phone just charging there open, I didn't hesitate to look at her secrets and I saw her pics wearing costumes or cosplays and bikinis and I'm like "wtf! Hahaha" I didn't spread it or embarrassed her because of it, I just looked and left it alone and move on. I mean im a curioused nice guy.
