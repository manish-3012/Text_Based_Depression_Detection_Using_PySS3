Fuck Masks, I can't breathe in them.... ...When I'm playing tennis indoors. Shit gets too hot and I end up breathing more CO2 than O2.

I wish the state would allow us to not wear them while playing sports, it really does make me lightheaded.

*Hopefully, I don't get downvoted bcuz of the title lmao, Im trying to be funny guys pls believe me*
