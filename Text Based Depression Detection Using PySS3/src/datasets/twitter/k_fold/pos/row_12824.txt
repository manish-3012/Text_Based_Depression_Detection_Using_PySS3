I hate how netflix ruined winx club not only did they whitewash the SE Asian character and the Hispanic character but the costume department made them look like 30 year old virgins. seriously, where is the glitter, where are the bright colours, where is the *taste*?

not everything needs to be a shitty Riverdale type teen drama. like THEY'RE FAIRIES JUST MAKE THEM FAIRIES.

it had so much potential
