We need to normalize male hugging Why is this not a thing? We ache emotionally, and we need support. But us males can't hug our friends without it being labled as 'gay' and 'inappropriate'. Yet whenever girls are in the same situation, they hug each other and it is regarded as normal and fine. I fell jealous because why the fuck can't males do that?
