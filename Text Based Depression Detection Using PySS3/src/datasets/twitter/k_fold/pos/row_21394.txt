I GOT THE JOB!! I got a job at McDonaldâ€™s, Iâ€™m 15 and I want to not depend on my parents for money and stuff so Iâ€™m so happy that I got this job. Yes itâ€™s a fast food job and I have herd a lot that working at fast food for your first job is HORRIBLE but I think I will do well. I start my first day on Saturday 

WISH ME LUCK!
