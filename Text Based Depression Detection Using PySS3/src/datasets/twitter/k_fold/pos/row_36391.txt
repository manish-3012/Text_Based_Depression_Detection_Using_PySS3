Help the earth by cleaning trash and getting some money for it! Iâ€™m not sure if this allowed but I really wanted to share it with yâ€™all youngsters.

There is a subreddit r/cash4trash that will pay you some money for picking up trash in your area (wherever you are on earth!) 

It isnâ€™t much money but if you want to help to clean up our earth and earn some money at the same time, go for it! :) 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
