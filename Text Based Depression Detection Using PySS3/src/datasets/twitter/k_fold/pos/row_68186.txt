I have decided that I am magical. Ok, here's what happened. I went to grab my phone, only to find it wasn't there. I looked around for a bit and couldn't find it, so I kinda gave up and continued watching youtube on my laptop. After the video, I looked around again, to no avail, and thought if I'd left the phone somewhere else in the house. I checked and didn't find it. Oh well. I watched some more youtube, and decided to browse reddit. I loaded the page up, started scrolling and suddenly, *bam*, I was looking at my phone which was loading reddit. What on earth? I have no memory of taking it or unlocking it... it means I must have absent-mindedly picked it up, looked at it (it's face id), and gone on to reddit. Wow, thinking is weird.
