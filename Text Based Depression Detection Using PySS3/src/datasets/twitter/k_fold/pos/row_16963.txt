Any one just wanna eat a raw carrot sometime...? It tastes so good and is healthy at the same time! Itâ€™s perfect! 

I also like to eat peas that have been cooked but then have gone cold... ik itâ€™s a bit weird but itâ€™s so good and I get to eat any that donâ€™t go out at work and Iâ€™m extremely greatful towardsmy boss for letting me do so!
