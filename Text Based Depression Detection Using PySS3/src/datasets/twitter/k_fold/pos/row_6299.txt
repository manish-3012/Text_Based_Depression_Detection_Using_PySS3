Why is no one interested in me I've really been trying to maintain friendships but it's hard now. Making/maintaining friends were so much easier before. I don't have any friends except my family. My family members are great friends, but I still need friends outside of family. No one talks to me on discord, snapchat or instagram. I have no one in my instagram in dms (like literally nobody). I've always noticed that I always tend to get pretty close to someone, and they just stop talking to me. As if I don't exist. This has happened 3-4 times. I always have to text first to even have a chance of talking to somebody, and even then they usually don't respond. I really hope that this changes next year in grade 10. In grade 10 I really want meet like a smoking hot girl, that's in my grade,who is really interested in me. Someone who will text me first (not all the time), and is interesting and fun to talk to as fuck. Someone who will stay up and talk to me late at night. Someone who has a special nickname for me. Someone who would roast the fuck out of anybody who'd bully me. Someone who'd always say something like "hey wanna go get starbucks" But yeah, I'm really hoping to make some friends soon, especially in grade 10.
