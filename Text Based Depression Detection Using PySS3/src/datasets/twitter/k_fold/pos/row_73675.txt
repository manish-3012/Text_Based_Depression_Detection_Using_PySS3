change with my humor and behavior  lately I've been changing my behavior a lot, the internet, especially  discord, has made me a bad person, I said the n word and the n word hard  r multiple times, I wasn't racist but you know it's the edgy humor, and  now I feel really bad for doing that, I laughed at really racist  "memes" and shared them, now I feel really bad for doing all of this  
do  you think I'm a bad person? I don't want to be a bad person but I've  done some things that I shouldn't have done. I don't know how severe  these things are so please tell me if this makes me an asshole.  
I'm  still in contact with people who still make these jokes and think being  racist and not supporting LGBT "humor", should I break contact with  them? they're cool people and the only flaws they have is that they are  edgy, they are my only online friends and they actually are cool and  good to talk to but I don't like the fact that they're so edgy. please  give me advice.
