what do yall think about antinatalism? to sumarise antinatalism is the belief that having kids is imoral because either, u shouldnt create consciousness without the consent of the consciousness or that existing is worse than not existing because:

if u exist, u expirience pain which is bad and pleasure which is bad
and if u dont exist u dont expirience pain which js good and u dont expiriencr pleasure which is not bad. 

is this a justifies idea? do u agree or disagree? why or why not?
