I can't believe this is my life. I'm currently on a video call with my boyfriend of 6 months, singing to him to help him fall asleep and I'm loving every moment of it. I love him so much. We're in a long distance relationship so video calls are the best we can do and it sucks but I'd rather be doing long distance with him than an in person relationship with anyone else. 

Sorry, I know people are sick of stuff like this, but I just am really happy right now and just so in awe that I get to love and spend time with him and he loves me. 

I hope all of you get to fall in genuine love and it works out for life. You all deserve to be happy and loved. You guys are amazing and deserve the world.
