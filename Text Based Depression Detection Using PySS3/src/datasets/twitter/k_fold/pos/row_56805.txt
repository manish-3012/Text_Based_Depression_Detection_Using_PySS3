My phone just fell in the fucking toilet Not even a meme or joke. My brother shat in the toilet, forgot to flush, and as I reached to flush the toilet for him as I was planning on using the toilet after him, my phone fell into the poopy water. It was disgusting. I had to grab my phone out of the poopy water and rinse it and disinfect it and perform an exorcism on it. Then I made this post to tell you about my struggles. 

If your reading this on the toilet rn, just do yourself a favor and be careful. That is all.
