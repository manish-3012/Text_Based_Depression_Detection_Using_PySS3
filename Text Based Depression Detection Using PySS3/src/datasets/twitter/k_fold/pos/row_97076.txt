I really don't fucking care about my health at all. I recently had a post about the fact that my vagina will be removed get a lot of comments. A lot of people mentioned my physical health a lot, I'm afab and I'm only eighteen so people care about that shit for some reason. 

I don't care about my physical health at all. I care that I'm mentally healthy, I care that I'm not dead and able to function as a person. But I really don't care about the quality of my body. 

I'll gladly starve myself if it means my body is sexy and androgynous. I'll gladly fuck up my body if it means curing dysphoria. Honestly, if given the chance I'd let a girl fucking torture me for sex reasons, even if it led to me being permanently disabled it would be worth it for the kind. 

I'm not saying this as advice for other people. I'm just saying its how I feel. I've felt pain before, it really just doesn't fuckinh bother me, emotional pain is way worse.
