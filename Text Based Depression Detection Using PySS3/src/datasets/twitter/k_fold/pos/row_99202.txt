I got banned from r/chonkers without warning for saying "shut your fucking mouth uncultured swine" to someone who was being toxic. So essentially someone was saying mean things to a cat on the Internet (like bruh, who tf would do that?) and then I insulted them for saying mean things to both the cat and people on the subreddit.

Without a single warning or chance r/chonkers permabanned me. I don't think this is reasonable at all as at the worst they should've given me a warning/ banned me for a day. Do you think my opinion is justified?
