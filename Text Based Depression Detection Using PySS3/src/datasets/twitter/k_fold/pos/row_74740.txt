I'M SORRY BUT WHAT?! (No gatekeeping intended by this post)

There is no way that this many cute girls exist on r/teenagers like what? It is just crazy to me that cute girls spend time on Reddit like wtf how are there so many of y'all? I feel like some are definitely not real and just using pics form the internet for karma. I'm not gatekeeping or anything (anyone should be allowed here). I'm not saying cute girls can't come here obviously; I just doubt there are this many girls on r/teenagers never mind *cute* girls. I don't mean to offend anyone by this post just a rant, if it offends you please let me know instead of just downvoting and we can talk and I can then edit or remove this post. Stay safe out there :)
