My crush responded to my message So, earlier this day I posted about my crush's birthday which is today, and even if she didn't knew me, I wanted to try initiate something. Since I am a bit anxious and shy, I thought it's a good idea to write her a message on Instagram to wish her a happy birthday. 
I texted her like 9 hours ago, but seeing no response I gave up and it made me sad. I was about to tell her if she would go with me on a date or something since is her birthday, but it was great if she replied immediately. 
15 minutes ago I arrived home from a walk and I saw that she responded. But since it's 9 hours later, my plan has failed. What I could do now?
I am a 16 years old male and she turned 18 today (i know it's shocking).
