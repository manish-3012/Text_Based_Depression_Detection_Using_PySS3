So umm, my moms car caught on fire. Ok, so I was in school when I texted my mom asking if she could pick me up, she agreed. A while later when I was walking out the doors to the car, I saw a fire truck, I thought nothing of it until I saw the fire fighters around my moms car. They said it had something to do with the fuel line breaking (or something like that). But everythingâ€™s fine now, we one of the teachers that Weâ€™ve known for a long time to give us a ride home. 


The bright side to this though, I got to see some cute fire fighters.
