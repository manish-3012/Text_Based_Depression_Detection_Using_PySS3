An amazing night of sleep I just woke from what may beone of my best nights of sleep ever, from waking up comfy as hell to not being blindin by light as soon as I open my eyes. Went to sleep at about 10pm, which is as rare finding an answer sheet online, woke up at 6am to the greyish blue sky and now im listening to music while sitting in orbit on destiny. I believe this to be an accomplishment for myself, and i hope you enjoyed my ted talk. Have a nice day everyone.
