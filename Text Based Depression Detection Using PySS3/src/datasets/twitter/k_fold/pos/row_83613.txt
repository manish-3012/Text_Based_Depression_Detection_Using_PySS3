Youâ€™re given 1 billion dollars to build an amusement park, what do you include? Iâ€™d personally include some of my favorite mobile games, like smash hit and geometry dash. Those would make for fun attractions. Plus itâ€™s not like any other theme parks will think of building something like that any time soon. How bout you guys? What would you include in your amusement park?
