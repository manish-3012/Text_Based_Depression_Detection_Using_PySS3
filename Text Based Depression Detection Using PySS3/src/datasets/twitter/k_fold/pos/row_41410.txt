I socialize and meet people through school and itâ€™s gonna be weird now Ok so I donâ€™t know how to put this onto the title but I get girlfriends through school (yeah I know I just made every simp, which is 60% of you guys, jealous) and thereâ€™s this girl who I havenâ€™t seen in a long time who I may like but donâ€™t know because itâ€™s been so long since school and weâ€™ve seen each other that Iâ€™m just not sure but just wanna talk about it here. If anyone else has this problem or something similar, just leave a comment or dm because thatâ€™s fun
