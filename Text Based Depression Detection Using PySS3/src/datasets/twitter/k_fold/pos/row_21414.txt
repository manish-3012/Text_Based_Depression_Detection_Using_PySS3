Quick tips for getting good grades in online school with no effort and getting work done Keep in mind that the school system is fucking you over by making you learn online so don't feel bad about doing this:

\-Screenshot all notes instead of typing

\-Participate mad early in the class so you can chill for the rest it doesn't matter if you know what your talking about

\-If you need to write an essay look at your old essays and find one that is similar and good, and edit it so it matches the topic

\-If you need an extension just email your teachers and say how stressful online school is, and how it's not your ideal learning situation

\-Copy and paste quiz questions and put it in google and put quotations around it's most likely a quizlet 

\-If your not paying attention and the teacher calls BS just say you went to get water (only works if your cam is off)

\-For group projects always divide the work instead of doing everything together

\-Turn your camera on but angle it so they can only see eyes and up so you get away with laying down
