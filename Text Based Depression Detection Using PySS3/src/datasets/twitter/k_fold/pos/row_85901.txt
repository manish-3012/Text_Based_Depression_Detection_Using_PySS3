Iâ€™m so bored of the â€œsurprising titleâ€ posts on this sub. Can we get some actual content in here thatâ€™s not â€œGuess who got a perfect score on their test! ... My friend Allie.â€ or â€œMy crush said yes! ... to the question â€˜do you hate me.â€™â€
Itâ€™s so repetitive and only a tiny percentage are actually original and funny.
