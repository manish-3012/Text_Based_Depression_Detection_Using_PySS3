I start physical school in two days :/ I mean, I'm kind of iffy on the whole situation, because I'm a little scared of covid, while at the same time, homeschooling/online schooling isn't the best option for my learning style. 

For context, I'm a college second-year because I don't know if I'm still a freshman or nah.
