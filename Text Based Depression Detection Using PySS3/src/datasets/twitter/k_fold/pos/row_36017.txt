Not very poggers I haven't smoked pot in so long that it actually kind of sucks because whenever I smoke it I feel immense creativity and motivation. I can imagine new ideas, and concepts that I would not otherwise. My imagination was wild, and I always loved smoking pot before designing something for my 3d printer, or learning about new scientific concepts. I haven't smoked in a month, and I've substituted it for wine and beer, but it's not the same. 

Alcohol dulls you, and it's not fun to drink alone. I don't have spur of the moment fascinations, and it's hard for me to read and watch science or history videos when I drink too much. Not to mention that alcohol and adderall do not mix well, but weed and adderall does which is why I have to be careful and do not get drunk.

Anyway, how are yall doing. Anything new?
