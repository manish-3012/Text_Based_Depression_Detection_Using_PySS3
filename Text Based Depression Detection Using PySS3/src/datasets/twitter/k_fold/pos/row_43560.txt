I want to help my friend but how? I badly want to help my friend's streaming career, but I don't know how I can help.. He loves playing Minecraft and lots of cool games, plus he's also great at art.. He's also aiming to have 200 followers in 2 weeks, I want to help him achieve that goal.. but I really don't know how.. can u guys suggest anything?? (Idk if you're already on this subreddit but this is the least thing I can do:))
