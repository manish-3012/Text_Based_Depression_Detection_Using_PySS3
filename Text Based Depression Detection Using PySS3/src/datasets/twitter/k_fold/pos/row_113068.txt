Speech I wrote on depression in men and boys for my English Class Hereâ€™s a speech I wrote for English. Iâ€™m delivering it tomorrow. Wish me luck!

(Note: Iâ€™m not trying to be sexist or anything. The speech doesnâ€™t ignore depression in girls, I wrote this because men and boys depression is ignored by society)
