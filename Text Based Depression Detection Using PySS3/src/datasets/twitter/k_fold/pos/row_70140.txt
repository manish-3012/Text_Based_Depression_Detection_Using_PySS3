NEVER BUY BLACK BEDDING A year ago or something I thought black bedding was cool and basically made my entire bed black, sheets pillows etc, but a month later it would always come out stained with white and it was awkward af but luckily no one asked. Seriously teens don't buy black bedding always go for the white bedding, besides you can see spiders easily that way and you won't have to feel awkward as fuck when you see literal cum stains on your pillows. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk, have a great day, I know I won't.
