My mom thinks I have shitty friends So 2 years ago I had a friend that vaped in the school bathroom and got caught. He left the school at the end of that year for unrelated reasons. So now he has started to go to the same school as me which is fine because we are friends. My mom thinks he is a terrible person and  is saying that I shouldnâ€™t trust his judgement. Heâ€™s learned his lesson and and Iâ€™ve told her that but she wonâ€™t listen. How should I tell her that heâ€™s a good person like the rest of my friends.
