My Crush of 8 years is leaving to another country in 2 WEEKS My crush of 8 years is leaving my school and province (it's like a state) and I only found out now and she's leaving in 2 weeks, apparently all my friends knew for months and didn't tell me and I have to go to her farewell party on the 30th and I am nervous, do I make a move? Do I just shut up? Idk
