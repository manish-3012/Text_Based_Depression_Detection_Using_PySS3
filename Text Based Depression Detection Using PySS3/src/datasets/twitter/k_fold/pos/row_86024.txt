What to do when a friend starts talking politicks? Like, I don't know shit about politics and they saying shit like "I hate that right wing bastard. Stupid pos" and I'm just standing there like "Yes I definitely know what right wing is :)" and I just slowly try to get out of the conversation or change the topic and each time I fail horribly. Like, tf I'm supposed to do?
