My gf is talking to her ex and i really don't know what to do Me (15m ) and my gf (15f) have been together for close to a month, with this being my first and hopefully only relationship I'm trying to not mess anything up. So close to a week ago, her ex (who she ended things with on bad terms) messaged and talked to her, about which she only asked me afterwards whether she should talk to him even though they had already been talking for a day. Knowing her ex i know he's gonna make a move on her, but i dont really want to tell my gf to stop talking to him because i dont really wanna seem like the type of guy who stops his gf from talking to someone and controls her. Any advice would be appreciated.
