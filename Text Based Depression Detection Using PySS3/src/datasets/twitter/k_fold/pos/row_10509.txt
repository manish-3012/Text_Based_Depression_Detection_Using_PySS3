How would you react? Advice appreciated~ My life is worthless, everything is pointless and I need to go.

But I've seen a few posts here about people's friends that ended it...

I'm shit at emotions and I'm a selfish failure, I didn't really think about my friends a whole lot,

I don't understand why they would be sad, I don't get why it would effect them but reading said posts I now know it would

But I also don't want to live for others, I'm tired. So tired.

I would be gone already if I'd done it right, but now I wonder what they would think about it...

I didn't leave any letters, I wasn't planning to, but now I'm thinking that when I do try again I should leave them letters

What would be your concerns if one of your friends ended it? What things would you feel guilty or whatever about?

I want them to know it's not their fault in the slightest, but like I said I don't get emotions so some advice/ input from normal people would be nice

Thanks in advance if anyone replies, probably not but yeah.
