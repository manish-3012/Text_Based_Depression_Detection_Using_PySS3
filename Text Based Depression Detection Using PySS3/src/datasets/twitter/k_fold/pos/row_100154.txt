Your sex, race, sexuality, gender shouldn't be something you can use as defence against criticism I dont know if my title explains my point well but I'll do my best here

I see that everytime someone say they dont like someone, that someone is a bad person I see a few people jumping at them for being racist, sexist, homophobic 

Which is dumb

"I don't like [Name] cause of this, this and this]", it's not the same as saying 

"I don't like [Name] cause they are gay/black/female"

You arent instantly homophobic, transphobic, sexist or racist if you say something bad about a person

If someone is a pedo and a bad person, the last thing I care about is what gender kids they touch, what race they are and what gender they are. I care about the fact that they touch kids
