I just heard my mum making me sound like a horrible person and I'm really pissed about it So my mum was on call with our relatives. My cousin recently got his results for an exam and he's scored 0.8 percent more than I had when I'd given the test. I was genuinely very happy about how good he did and was literally shouting about it. After a moment I decided to joke about something people would naturally assume I'd feel; jealousy. I said, "wow how could he score more than me!" With an OBVIOUS tone of sarcasm.    

Now when my mum was on call, she just talked about how I was pissed he's scored more than me and not at all about how happy I was. Also note that she said it like I was genuinely upset that he's scored better and didn't talk about how it was a mere joke that I said that.    

I know this probably isn't something to be upset about, but it absolutely pisses me off that she's done this to me; especially because I feel we don't usually appreciate other people's success and so I make a conscious effort that I'm actually looking at the good they've done, instead of being a moron and not appreciating them for their achievements.    

Also it's really annoying how parents HAVE to make their kids sound like poopy people, just because "they're kids"! (Not saying none of us are, but come on making stuff up isn't cool) 

Tl;dr: mum talked about how I was upset my cousin scored better eventhough I wasn't and now I look like a horrible person.
