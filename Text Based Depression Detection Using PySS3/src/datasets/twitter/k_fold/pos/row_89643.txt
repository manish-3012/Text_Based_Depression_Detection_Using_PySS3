I kinda hate how people put "depression" as their "quirky" personality Some friends of mine thinks that being "edgy" and "depressed" is their quirk or something. Even though there's tons of other people that are actually sad. All that while enjoying their social life with friends and family, a special relationship with someone and tons of money to back their ego up. And they're still insecure about themselves so they went over to some other students that is either; have no friends, no SOs, ugly or fat etc. and insult them for being that way. Like what the fuck? You think you're depressed? Bitch fucking put yourself in their shoes for once and see how it feels. I actually feel bad for some of them since some of them are my closest friends and they have really bad situations that are either social, financial, or a problem with their families.
