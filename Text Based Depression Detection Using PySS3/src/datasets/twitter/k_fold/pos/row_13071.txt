I lost 2 hours worth of work... I was trying to make a well edited video meme and I spent around 2 hours on it. While I was working on it, DaVinci Resolve crashed and I never had the chance to save. I have to start all over from scratch... I really want to make this but I have a 2 hour setback. I'm actually really upset about this. I turned autosave on which I should have done before, and I'll work on it in the morning... Fuck my life...
