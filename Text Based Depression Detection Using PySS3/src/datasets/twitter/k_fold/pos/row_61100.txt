Pee pee girl My little niece (1 year old) pee on my bed. I noticed the smell last night and told my mom but my mom said it might be just her milk that spilled so I just went to sleep still smelling it lol. And tonight I went to lay down and relax and I still smelt it so I made sure it wasn't me lol and was smelling around my bed and confirmed she did pee on my bed. My mom believed me and told me to just throw me sheets to wash. However my mattress smells like pee. Whyyyyyyy how do I take it out. My mom put baking soda but will that work???
