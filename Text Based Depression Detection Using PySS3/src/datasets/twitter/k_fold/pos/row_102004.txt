Something from while ago So for some backstory my girlfriend would hangout at her exâ€™s house, they would watch movies or go to the mall or something. And Maybe like a year ago I found out my girlfriend ended up cuddling with her ex one day (witch I find as cheating) she never said anything about it. I found a text she sent to him talking about it. As of the moment I just cried next to her (first time she saw me cry) I just felt like a horrible boyfriend, I didnâ€™t tell her to stop hanging out with him at that point with I should have. I just thought if I lose her itâ€™s probably my fault. A few days later I told her to stop hanging out with him. She got a little upset about it. Then a few weeks later I found out that one that day she was gonna break up with me but she didnâ€™t Because she didnâ€™t know what I would do. (I should mention that he was my best friends from 3rd- 9th grad)  

I still have dreams of walking in on her with him. 
I think itâ€™s really affected me more that I really say. 
Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s give me trust issues, I kind of always expect her to still be talking to him or someone even if I know she not
