The World Is Going To Shit, And Memepages Aren't Helping This memepage on instagram I followed posted a meme abt the at&amp;t girl (you might know it) and a comparison of her in the commercial and her in real life. Then the caption under the meme was "from housewife to whore", and I just commented simply saying "How is she a whore for wearing what she wants? Let a gal be a gal." Then I 1). get like 20+ simp replies because... duh... and 2.) The memepage admin replied back "No."

So that's bullshit but I don't really care... Then I see his story and apparently someone made a meme of Me and the admin. The one where there's one guy crying and whining and then there's the "king" character. And ofcourse I'm the whiny guy with my comment copied word for word underneath him. And he's the "king character" who simply says "No.". Honestly I get that they could be joking but this dude has so many posts and so many comments and yada yada where he degrades a woman for just dressing in exposing clothes or where they "don't act normal" and I can't believe so many people agree with him. It really sickens me.

Anyways... I wouldn't say I'm a feminist, just a rational thinker.

Bye bye
