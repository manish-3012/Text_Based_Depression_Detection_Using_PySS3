I dont even know what to say I was with my girlfriend last night and it was at a party so we slept next to each other for the first time. I ve been dating this amazing girl and she was extremely drunk all night. While drunk she was very sad about some personal issues and i was basically sober so i helped her all night. I was spooning her all night and holding her tight from what i remember trying to make her feel safe. Then i wake up in the morning and all day today she had been avoiding me. Today i talked to her and she told me that all night i was touching her boobs and that she kept pushing me away. She also told me i moaned all night and it was extremely uncomfortable. I dont remember anything that happened because i thought i was asleep however she says that i was awake and intentionally doing this to her. I feel like absolute dog shit and now she wants to take a break. I dont know what to do and feel extremely guilty and bad and confused because i cant believe myself for doing such a thing. I love that girl and want her to be happy and feel disgusted with myself for doing such a thing. I find it so hard to believe that i could do something like that and just want her back. Do you have any advice reddit? Because i am begging for it
