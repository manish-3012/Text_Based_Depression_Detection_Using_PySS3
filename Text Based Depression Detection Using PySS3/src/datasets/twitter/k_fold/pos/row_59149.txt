I just finished my first zoom meeting and it went swimmingly I've been doing online for the entire year so this is the first time I've ever seen my teacher. I mean, everything went good other than the fact I didn't understand what was going on because it was Spanish, but it's okay if you don't think about it.

I have another one in 20 minutes for psychology, so im gonna go brush my teeth now
