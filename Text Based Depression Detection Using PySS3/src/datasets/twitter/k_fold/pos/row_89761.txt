Throwback to the time my sis called me gay That was about 6months ago, me, she and our dad were driving into the city when I noticed he has a bad picture of me for when I call him. I tried to tell him to use a better one and gave him an example, showing him my best selfie. My sister in the back leaned in and saw it "Omg, you look sooo gay on that pic! Hahahahaha". I quickly deleted the picture and shred a tear...

Anyways we had a burger so it was alright
