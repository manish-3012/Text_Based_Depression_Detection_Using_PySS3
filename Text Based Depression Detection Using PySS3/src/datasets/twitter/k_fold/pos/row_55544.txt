will it get better?  It is uncertain if it will get better. The vague uncertainty actually holds both of the answers. I think the slight chance of getting better is what gets people going. But when u look at it ,it is not a slight chance., it is 50/50 if i make sense. It\`s how u carry what u mean by better. If you\`re hurting today ,you will never hurt the exact way you did the previous day. The effect of this might be the slightest but if you carry a sense of REALIZATION that it is indeed getting better. You possess an aura of positivity around you,you learn ,you realize,you are getting better. Now i know this does not apply to people facing traumatic situations daily ,but noone ever chooses that this is it,it won\`t get any better. You might sub-consciously have that sense of negativity . Your real thought process always has a glimmer of hope in you. All the what ifs and what not.Same goes with your worries,if you have a lot of distractions around you,the mental trauma u carry in the slightest is dissolved through all of the distractions. You don\`t get angry or worried about your dad hitting u when u were nine,do you? Not that it happened to me lmaobahshaaksjsah.  you will heal,so it will get better .one step at a time,until then
