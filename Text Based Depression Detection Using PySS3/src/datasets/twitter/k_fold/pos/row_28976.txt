Some questions about my crush I  have a crush, he's 13M, and I'm 14M (bi). But, we both go to a catholic  school, which I just started attending this year, and he's in the grade  below me (combined class). He once made a comment about something being  gay (not to me, to one of our friends), but he never said "I'm not  gay", just "that's kinda gay". And, already we have a good friendship,  he'll shoot smiles at me, and ONLY me, through his mask (which makes me  suspect he's bi-curious), and I returned them. Also, in class one we  (the entire class) literally talked the entire time about radios, music,  and some dude who hacked a local TV station in the 60s with a HAM  radio. Then I brought up Green Day, and he said it was an amazing band.

Also, I'm super tall for my age, 5' 8'" (1.72 meters), and he's only 4' 7" (1.397 meters).

Anyway, back to the point which I completely forgot to include earlier in the post: do you think we're compatible?

I like: computers, cars (namely Subaru), video games, rock,  HAM radio, and Linux

He likes: hunting, outdoors, country music, and apparently Green Day.

Oh, also forgot to mention: how tf we supposed to kiss? We both have braces.

Once  we get back to school (closed rn, someone caught COVID-19), how should I  ask for his phone number? I know he has a phone, he told me. We (are  supposed to) go back next Monday, the 7th.

Also,  how should I ask my parents to go to his house eventually? I'm not out  yet (and will keep it that way until I find someone who isn't female).  Oh and there's a massive lethal pandemic around.

Thank you for reading this, this post was mainly for myself to get my ducks in a row and see my main problems.
