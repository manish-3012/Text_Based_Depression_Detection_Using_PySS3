What would you guys be interested in? I was planning on streaming on my [twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/latenightbrioche/profile) and I was wondering what game would you like to see. Garfield Kart or Oxygen Not Included. Which one is more interesting for you guys. Iâ€™m going to go live in about ten minutes to play what you guys vote for.
