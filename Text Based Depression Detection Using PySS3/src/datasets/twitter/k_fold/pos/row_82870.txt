Being left handed is difficult Iâ€™m trying to learn to play the guitar, but my right hand isnâ€™t coordinated at all, so itâ€™s hard to place my fingers in the correct spot. I canâ€™t flip the guitar to the other side, because then the string order is flipped as well, which makes it incredibly hard to reach the correct finger positions.

Also, notebooks suck and I canâ€™t ever use scissors properly.
