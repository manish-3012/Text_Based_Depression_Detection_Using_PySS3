Thoughts on laws requiring everyone to call people by their preferred pronouns? I donâ€™t think laws should be mandated requiring everyone to call people by their preferred pronouns. However, I really want to hear different opinions on this and kind of get a better understanding of the other side. Iâ€™m super open to hearing what yâ€™all have to say if you have an opinion. 


If you take the time to respond, thank you for taking the time to do so. 

This is not meant to be offensive or hostile whatsoever. PLEASE DO NOT BASH OTHER PEOPLE FOR DISAGREEING WITH YOU. I want to have a civilized discussion.
