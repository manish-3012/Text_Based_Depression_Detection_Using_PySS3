Ok so idk where to ask this but do I lose anything when I delete reddit? Idk Iâ€™m deleting this for a while because reasons....I was just wondering if I lose anything or will it all be here when I sign back into my account, it should all be here right? Uhhh thanks if you know or at least reply. Iâ€™m not really sure where to ask this question
