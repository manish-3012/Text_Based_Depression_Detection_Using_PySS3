I need to know if anyone else does this. This might be a bit gross, but here it goes. Sorry mods if I don't need to mark this NSFW.

I hate using just toilet paper when I go to the bathroom (specifically, Number 2). Normal toilet paper doesn't make me feel clean. So I make a little ghostie with the toilet paper and my finger and dig around (yes, in *there*) until it comes out clean. Does anyone else do this? Am I alone?
