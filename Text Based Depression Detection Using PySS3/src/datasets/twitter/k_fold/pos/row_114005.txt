â€œIsnâ€™t she going to die soon?â€ 
I already was sad and under a lot of stress from school then It got so much worse. My cat of 15 years, my only true friend was casually walking up to me durning dinner. My nanny randomly said â€œisnâ€™t she going to die soon?â€. I knew my cat was old but that commented destroyed me. I canâ€™t stop thinking about my cat dying soon. Today I walked in to room and found her lying on the floor. I called her name several times and she would not respond. When I tried to pet her she did wake up but the thoughts wonâ€™t stop coming. The comment was so cruel. Every second I canâ€™t stop worrying. I wake her every few minutes to check on her. I donâ€™t know if I can handle school because of this. My cat has helped me get through so many hard times and to hear someone rudely stare that she is going to die soon hurts so much. I have started recording and taking videos constantly of my cat. I hope to gather at least 1hr of video memories from all my favorite things about her.
