Wanna hear a good story I broke up with my ex about 5 months ago after I wasnt happy in our relationship and I wasnt happy with him. Things were toxic and stuff. So my best friend Alex hated him and he hated alex, a few days ago Alex snapped him from my phone (my ex and I were trying to stay friends) and he snapped a pic of us hugging, he didnt like that.  Yesterday he threated alex with physical violence and I told him I wouldnt be his friend if he brought it to that level. He told me he was on his way to us (alex and I were at a park) he snapped me from my grandma's apartment and told us to come to him so I said "lmfao why would I come to you if ur threating us, ur not gonna do this" he took that as a challenge and smacked Alex really hard in the back of the head, alex stayed calm and that pissed my ex off, I  said "ok you proved ur point go away" that's when he grabbed alex off the ground and started to hurt him. I pushed my ex off and he smacked me in the side of the face and then Alex was being hurt. Some workers at the park pulled my ex off him. Nowwww my ex is saying I started it and I scratched him. All I can say is I'm happy I'm not dating that guy anymore
