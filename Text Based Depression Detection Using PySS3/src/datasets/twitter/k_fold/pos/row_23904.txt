I went to the house of the girl I used to like I already posted this on another subreddit but I wanted to post it here too.

This happened a few hours ago, earlier today I went to my friendâ€™s house to have dinner with some other friends, we prepared kind of like a â€œFriendsgivingâ€ dinner.

After dinner my friend said he was going to a family barbecue and be asked me to go since he didnâ€™t want to be alone or feel uncomfortable, so I went to the family reunion with him. Since it was already midnight my mother called me to tell her where the reunion was so my brother could pick me up.

As I open the map to see where I was, I notice is â€˜fairlyâ€™ close to the house of a girl I used to have feelings for (still do? Not sure), I knew where her house was because she told me months prior. And so I started to think about it, until I made up my mind, so I decided to walk over there.

And so I did, I walked for around 40 minutes just to maybe see her, and when I got there, I didnâ€™t do anything, called her but I hung up before she could even pick up, didnâ€™t text her or say anything, so I called to get picked up and left, first and probably only chance I had to actually see her.

So fast forward, Iâ€™m at home, eating McDonaldâ€™s, should I have called or said something? I donâ€™t know, she couldâ€™ve thought I was obsessed or that I was weirdo for going to such extent.

I think if this story were told from another point of view, I would be seen as a creep or worse, it was a weird thing to do, but hey at least I got nuggets in the end.
