Why do people, teens especially, brag about being mentally ill and taking medication? I recently was "apart" of a conversation where two people were bragging about how many pills they took each day and how horrible they are if they don't have them, they were allergy and sleeping pills btw. They kept going, oh yeah well sometimes I take [insert +1 pill than the other person] and they went back and forth for a bit and then they turned and started asking me. I responded 1 or 2 depending on the day and they scoffed and said that's it? I'm not hating on them for taking meds and being open about it, but it doesn't seem very healthy to show it off and brag about it all too much, like you could be helping other's get help but your just roasting them because you take more allergy pills than them. Has this occured to anyone else and why is it such a weird topic?
