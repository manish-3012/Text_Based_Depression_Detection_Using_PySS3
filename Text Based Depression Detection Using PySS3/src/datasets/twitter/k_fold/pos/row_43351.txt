I just found out that my 5th grade teacher just died :( He apparently died October 30th, but I just found out today. We look back at 5th grade and we all reminisce about how great of a year it was, mostly because of how awesome our teacher was. The saddest thing is that he retired in June...he didn't even get to live out the rest of his life, he was only 59. I'm so sad right now :(
