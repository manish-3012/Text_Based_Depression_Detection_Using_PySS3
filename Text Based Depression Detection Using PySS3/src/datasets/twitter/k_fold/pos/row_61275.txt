Big issue involving my little brother and a "Gang" Right off the bat let's get into it.

I'm a year Nine by the way. (Australian so 15)

I'm in a PlayStation party with one of my little brother's mates, twelve and a by half both of them.
He invites two year eights (Thirteen) who immediately start talking shit about my little brother and how they're gonna' kick his ass, which I respond with a watch your tongue or I'll beat the living shit out of you. (Which I must say is the only option which didn't involve me being called a pussy and another full on fight) They go off their heads, say how their mates are gonna' kill us both, which in total there's about nine, in response I say I don't give a shit and how they should go fuck themselves, I leave and tell my brother. Normally this would be fine, right? Not at all, my High School is really not a good place, although anywhere that isn't a city in Tasmania isn't a good place because of the bogans and shit. Back to the point, I know they're violent because of where I live, they out-number me and they know where I live.

Does anyone have advice?
