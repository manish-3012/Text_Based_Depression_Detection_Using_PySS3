Just needed to get this off my chest I've been trying my best and it isn't enough. I have a bunch of missing assignments and they just keep coming I feel like I'm drowning. No ones understanding that Im actually trying but im just not good enough. I'm working hard to get into the school I want but I feel like I'm letting everyone around me down and if I don't get in that'll just be another reason for my family to be disappointed. I know other people have worked under worse conditions so complaining about doing homework in my cozy room feel selfish. I've been thinking about putting my mental health on the back burner for a while . I just wanna do what will get me through this with good grades and less absences. Even if it means relapsing (I'm a cutter) . Im starting to realize that I'm falling behind. My friends are all doing so well and I know it's bad to compare yourself to others but compared to them I'm nothing. I just want to be good at something. I used to be so great at the things I do but know Im just a waste of air.
