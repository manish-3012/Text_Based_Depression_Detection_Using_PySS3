Guys help I feel like reality is slipping away! I feel that my reality is breaking, I don't know what is happening.

It started suddenly earlier today. I have never felt more helpless and fake. I have experienced some things before but it never made me like it has today and was always for like a minute. This has been happening for about two hours now. Whenever I open a YouTube video I feel that its back to normal but its not because suddenly I feel very disconnected. 

I hope what I am going through is normal.

Please help me get out of this.
