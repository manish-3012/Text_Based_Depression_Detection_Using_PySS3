Hey guys, rly serious and I would appreciate help a lot So I am 16, and from India. And now I am working on my college admissions for studying abroad (more specifically for universities in the US for undergrad), and I am absolutely confused about how to go about it. 

Not to mention I am also writing the JEE and I need help in writing resumes and compiling enough data for my resumes and applications. 

Could anyone help me how to go about all of this and also be a study buddy and help me concentrate on studying?

Any help would be appreciated (and DM me if you wanna help)

Anyone would be of great help, but any fellow students in India would be most appreciated. 

Thanks for helping me out and reading this. Have a great day.
