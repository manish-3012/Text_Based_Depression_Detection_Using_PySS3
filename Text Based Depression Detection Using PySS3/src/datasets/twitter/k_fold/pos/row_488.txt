Any ideas for an advertisement/commercial? Hey there fellow teenagers and and those who aren't,

I've recently got a project for English to make an ad/commercial during my autumn break. Now, I'm in a tough situation because I'm not the most creative person, and I know that there are many other that are much more creative than me. Thus, I was wondering if any of you creative people out there could help me with ideas that is good for an ad or commercial.

Thanks in advance!
