Any suggestions? I am in search of a song which is all about Man's life and struggles faced by them in their lifetime. It should be slow paced, not much of metal, rock or somethin. 

Needed such songs as I'm 17M studying straight for 8 hours daily. Need some motivation. Suggestions would be much appreciated.
