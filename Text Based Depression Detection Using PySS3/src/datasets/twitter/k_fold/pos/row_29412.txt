Just because I spend more time on it, doesn't mean you can abandon ne You guys know what the rpg not on discord is?

Doesn't matter if you do.

Basically, my friends have a group chat on discord, I'm in it, we're all actual friends at school. I happen to have more free time than the other 2 users of the bot, let's call them Richard and C (not real names). To access the next area ("level") you need 2 people to enter the dungeon, after which if you defeat the boss, you can move on to the next area, with harder monsters and higher rewards. We were on area 6, and Richard and C decided to move on to area 7 without me. Richard has constantly been complaining about me that I'm "too far ahead" I'm at level 50 while they're at 30+. They created a seperate secret group chat (I know, I've seen them do it) and decided to move on to area 7 without me. They are also the ones running the server.

BOI, I'm not too mad over the situation, but like. BRO, DO YOU HONESTLY CARE MORE THAT MY CHARACTER IS SLIGHTLY MORE POWERFUL THAN YOURS OVER A FUN TIME TOGETHER?

Maybe I'm the a**hole, but I just happen to have more free time than them, but they still wanna restrict me in whatever way they can.

I know them, they're the kind of people who are always prepared to fight to make them seem better.

When discussing about things in a casual convo, Richard will constantly argue back, I would listen to his points, but he argues in such a way that allows him to insult me, and when he starts to lose, he starts insulting me directly and laughs it off. Does this same strategy with other friends too. Only stops arguing with insults when talking to teachers.

Richard, you're a nice guy and all but WTF BRO, YOU REALLY VALUE A POSITION OF POWER **THAT** MUCH HUH?
