So a girl might like me idk So thereâ€™s this girl I have a few classes with and Iâ€™ve known for about 2 years (mostly acquaintances). She MAY like me but I got no clue. Hereâ€™s a list of stuff sheâ€™s said:

- Upon hearing that we arenâ€™t in the same mentor group for a school club â€œawwww your breaking my heartâ€

- Before our history class, her and another girl wait outside because they donâ€™t want to go in first. So I get to the class and they want me to go in first and she says â€œif you go in first Iâ€™ll love youâ€

- We had a good drive for the club we are in, and she was in the group before me. So I get there before her group leaves and she yells to me â€œHi (my name)!â€ 

- Asks me for answers to a lot of stuff in one of our classes and talks to me a good amount in the class we sit near each other (even though she has a lot of other friends near her), also teases me sometimes

This seems like minor stuff that just sounds a bit weird, but the wording is kind of weird so idk
