Quarantine StudCo campaign ideas? I don't know if this is the right place but here goes! My school's going to have Student Council elections soon and I've been considering running for Vice President. Unfortunately, it's a total lockdown so we're relying on online school (and online elections as well).

While I do know that a good speech can really make a difference, I wanted to know if you guys had any idea on ways I can campaign online since posters and things like that are completely out of the question. I would really appreciate your perspectives since it always helps to know what students like, and what they would find annoying!
