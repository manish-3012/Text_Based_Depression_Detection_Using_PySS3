Just talking a dream I just had now (I guess itâ€™s more so of a nightmare) Ok so I had to get this off of my chest and it literally terrified me to the point where I didnâ€™t wanna think about it anymore, but anyway here goes.


So I have Acrophobia, and my mum recently told me one of my aunties moved her family to a different flat in France and it is much better and bigger than their old one (If it helps Iâ€™m British-African, and the rest of my family is mostly in France but there are some in DC Congo). Problem is itâ€™s floor 13, so you could probably guess how scared I was when thinking about how high it was. Now to the dream itself.

I dreamt I was going up to her flat with my cousins and by the time I got to floor 5 I started freezing. My legs and arms felt numb and I didnâ€™t wanna continue on going, and by floor 7 I swear I thought the place was tilting. It kept getting worse until we got to floor 12. There was no other way to pass unless... we jumped over a fairly big gap. It wasnâ€™t as bad as to the left of me were rails and to my right a small fence. So I very very slowly (without looking down) traversed across the fence holding the rail for my life. And with one jump...         I made it (with everyone else traversing through it easily for some reason). Once we got there, there was a lift that took us to floor 13. I was relieved.

Thereâ€™s a part 2 but Iâ€™ll talk about it if requested by popular demand.

TL;DR My mum told me my auntieâ€™s family moved to a high flat in France so I got scared. I had a dream about going up to floor 13 with my cousins, I felt more and more scared as I kept going up. When I got to floor 12, I had to jump over a gap to make it across. I succeeded and we got to a lift to floor 13.
