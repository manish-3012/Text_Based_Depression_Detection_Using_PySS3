What I look for in a partner. Curious if others are similar. Interests: Preferably include reading, some degree of gaming, and some sort of physical activity.

Physical traits: Any height but I prefer close to mine (preferred range would be 5'4 to 5'10). I'm kinda picky about build, I really want a girl who's at least kind of fit. I don't really care about hair length as long as she isn't bald.

Personality: I like soft spoken girls who can still come off strong at times. I really dislike people who don't put effort into things, but I want someone who can have fun too obviously. I'd definitely prefer them to be smart, and while I could have a relationship with someone dumber than me I don't think it would last.

Clothes: I don't really care.
