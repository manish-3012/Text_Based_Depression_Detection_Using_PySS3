I wish I actually was on drugs and not just sleep-deprived. lol. I feel so slow, it's like I'm watching myself from the outside. Sure, I'm tired as fuck, but it's an escape. I like this feeling, even though my body really hurts when I move. I want this feeling without having to not sleep, because not sleeping hurts. I want drugs, too bad they're illegal where I'm at. Life's weird, lol.
