When I first came to this sub, I was worried about being openly trans. I had heard that this sub was really transphobic, so I was hesitant at first. But I met some really cool people and got a lot of support. I started to think that they were wrong about this sub. It turns out that I was the one who was wrong.

Seriously. This place is disgusting sometimes. I know it's not everyone, in fact, it's only a small portion. But it's so much worse than I expected.

Don't be surprised if I leave soon.
