I thought I was happy Every single fucking time I think Iâ€™m happy and everything is okay. It turns out Iâ€™m not. My mental health always comes back so shit. Why the fuck canâ€™t I just stay happy? I feel like Iâ€™m going insane, this has been going on years, this time I thought it was different and I was better. Apparently not. Itâ€™s driving me insane. I just donâ€™t want to be here right now. Itâ€™s not even like I have a shit life ffs Iâ€™m privileged as fuck. Whatâ€™s wrong with me???? Is this shit even worth the pain anymore
