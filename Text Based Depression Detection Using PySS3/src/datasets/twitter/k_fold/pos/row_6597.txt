Book that traumatized 8 year old me In 3rd grade, I got this book with a girl who mobed into a new house. There was a girl trapped in the mirror. The book ended with the girl getting pulled into the mirror so the mirror girl could be free. Stuck in a void of nothing. Forever.

I had to read it 3 times.

How is that not scary to an 8 year old.

**Who thought giving this book to an 8 year old would be a good idea**

But this was just one of your throwaway kids books made for schools. I think it was called "The girl in the mirror". Most generic shit ever.
