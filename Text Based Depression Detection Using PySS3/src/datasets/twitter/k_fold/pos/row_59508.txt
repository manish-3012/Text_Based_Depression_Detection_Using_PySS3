I think my teachers are incompetent They can't explain painfully simple concepts to students who've already learnt it in earlier classes and end up confusing them even more! I've been sitting in class for an hour and the teacher has been going on about the same thing. Every time I ask a question, the teachers tell me, 'I'll get back to you on that.' Every time! I usually end up learning things by myself as the teachers fail to cover things up efficiently in class. 

I am not usually for separating students based on their ability to learn, but I think it should definitely happen for our school. It's a private school with air-headed rich kids who are not really interested in studies as they have their parent's businesses to take over. They take up all the time in class discussing things which don't even matter and being so intolerably slow. And the teachers allow it!

I can't count how many times I've had to correct my teachers and they stubbornly refused even though I cited reliable sources. My parents think it is better for me to stay in this very school for high-school, but I don't think I can bear it. 

It's weird that I'm venting out my frustration online rather than telling my parents or teachers. Anyway.
