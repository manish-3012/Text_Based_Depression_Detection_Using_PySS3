Never will I bend never will you break meðŸŽµ So Iâ€™ve known her for 2 years now from school and weâ€™ve hung out a couple times, got drunk together, stayed up late with friends etc. and sheâ€™s really cool in person and I asked her out last year, got rejected big time but Iâ€™m fine with my position as friend (she was very keen on staying friends and not block all contact) and so because of COVID and school started we havenâ€™t had time to talk to each other irl and so Iâ€™ve asked her if she wanted to hang out or take a walk (easiest things to plan and get out of) because we live [walking distance] apart. But every time I try to suggest and plan these things she ghosts me. Then when I text her that Iâ€™m fine of being denied or rejected but please tell me the truth she always answers with something like â€œmb I didnâ€™t see your messageâ€ or â€œIâ€™m sorry next timeâ€.  Then I suggest dumb shit activities again and th cycle repeats making me feel needy when I know Iâ€™m not, just trying to hang out with a friend I havenâ€™t seen in a while and catch up. Iâ€™ve texted her about how we both donâ€™t like texting each other and Iâ€™m sick of planning these stupid activities she wonâ€™t answer to but she seemed really sincere in her apology explaining how she doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s been going on, sheâ€™s confused bla-bla-bla. I know how she is irl and believe that all her intentions are 90% pure. The rejection makes me feel like shit but that sadness keeps me making myself better, more in shape, less confident, more in shape etc. What should I do? Should I block all contact? Should I just go to her house and demand to talk to her? Idk guys... feeling stressed
