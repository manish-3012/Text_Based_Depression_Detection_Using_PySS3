I think I found out what the line â€˜waiting for one child; black, white, yellow, no one knowsâ€™ means in the song â€˜When a child is bornâ€™ Ok so I have autism, so Iâ€™m a really literal thinker. For 18 whole years, I thought that the lyrics meant that the child would be literally yellow. It only just clicked for me in my head that the term â€˜yellowâ€™ can describe some Asian people.... I could be wrong, but it makes more sense to me than the child being literally yellow
