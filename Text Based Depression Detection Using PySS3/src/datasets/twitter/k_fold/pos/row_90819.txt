Audio quality is fun to analyse I just wanted to say, I love how this 36 year old recording on a 34 year old CD that I'm listening to on a ~15 year old radio has noticeably better sound quality than a ~1 year old microphone on a 2 year old device. 

That 36 year old recording is Wake Me up Before You Go-Go which I'm jamming to right now
