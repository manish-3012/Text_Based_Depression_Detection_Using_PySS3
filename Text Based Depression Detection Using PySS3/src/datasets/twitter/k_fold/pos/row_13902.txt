I started ruining my social life when I was around 4, but it's going towards bettering. When I was in kindergarten (around 4 years old) I didn't want to meet new friends, because my cousin (that is the same age as me) was going to that kindergarten also, and whatever activity we did, I didn't want to stand out, and I was always behind him or alone (if he wasn't there), then when I started first grade (6 years old, and around this time the cousin I went to kindergarten with moved to another city, because his parents divorced), I had another cousin in my class and hung around him until the 6th grade like he was holy to me, then grades were remixed when we got seperate teachers for each subject, and there was I in 6th grade (11/12 years old) with no friends in my class and absolutely no social skills.

The whole year I felt alone and like the whole world is against me, I had arguments with teachers, students and attempted suicide sometime near the end of the year, 7th grade was an absolute miracle, so many things happened even though the probabilities were impossibly low (first we stayed at the same school because of excess of 8th and 9th graders and lack of 6th graders, then sometimes that year a girl kissed me (more on that later) and my cousin I hanged out in kindergarten was moved because his horrible grandmother was critically ill (more on why is she is horrible later), that year I stoped feeling alone and I got along better with some of my classmates, but worse with others, then 8th grade came, we finnaly moved to the other school, (to be honest I hate my 11, 12 and 13 year old self for many reasons, here are some of them: I argued a lot, I put the blame on others, I felt that everyone else was responsible for my unhappiness, I was racist, sexist, I disliked religious people, I attempted suicide, I almost set a complex of firewood shacks on fire, I hated exercise, I was addicted to videogames, I had no patience for my brother, I made up too many excuses, I got into fights I never should have started and much more)

Then around 2 years ago I started listening to advice I received from my father, and I am becoming the best person I could only have dreamt of in first grade, and if I started being like this at least 4 years ago, my life would have been different, but I try to never repeat a mistake I already made, no matter how small it is, because reliability, confidence, respect for others, support and guidance for others make a good person. And now, barely 5 months away from my small prom, I still have less than 5 friends, but I keep in touch with my classmates and some of them find me enjoyable, but some find me too neutral/introverted. 

Now back to the 2 things I left for later:

The girl that kissed me ended up being even more introverted than me at the time, but she somehow noticed that I was even somewhat interesting, because I did some woodworking projects in my yard at the time, but infact I was an idiot that had no idea about work, respect or conversation, so it never came to be really, but we became friends around the time my change for better started, but also around that time her parents divorced and she had to move away with her mother to a nearby village, her parents are nice, but her dad and granfather are really good people and I have a ton of respect for them.

Now why my cousin's (now dead) grandmother was labled as "horrible": She was a manipulative person who manipulated my cousin's aunt into divorcing her husband and lather they manipulated my cousin's mom into divorcing his dad and moving out of this "ViLlAgE" into a bigger city of "opportunity" and now she is dead and my cousin's mother is a single mother living in far away Germany in the town of Leipzig, meanwhile my cousin's dad (who genuinely loved her above everything in his life) remarried and now as a lovely daughter and never moved out of his house even tough his son is thousands of kilometres away.

At the end it all ends like this: I became happy with life, my best friend I didn't speak about moved with his parents in the same city my cousin lived in with his mom before going to Germany, my cousin from school also has divorced parents, but is still happy with life and has some cool hobbies now, the girl I kissed with now lives a few kilometres away and we rarely speak and I sometimes speak with some of my classmates.

Sorry if this was too long, I just had to vent the last few years in one post and thanks for reading this, and sorry for errors, it's 2 AM where I live.
