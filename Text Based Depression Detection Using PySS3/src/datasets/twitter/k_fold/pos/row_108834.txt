Perfect start I am going into the 3rd week of freshman year and I have 2 projects for one class due tomorrow, an essay due at midnight, geometry homework due tomorrow, history homework due tuesday, and science work due tomorrow. We use block scheduling and are online and I have been struggling to learn anything strictly to the fact that I have to be in person and idk what to do
