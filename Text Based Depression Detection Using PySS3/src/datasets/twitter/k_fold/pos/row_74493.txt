Iâ€™m getting sick of always helping others and never getting it back Rn Iâ€™m legit getting close to breaking down. Today all Iâ€™ve done is try to help support someone and all my friends are busy and another has just left.

Iâ€™m in a load of pain with my side and Iâ€™m stressed as hell about college. I have to shield due to the virus so all my friends get to hang out at college together and I have to stay home.. Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll end up falling behind.

I also think I may have something like ADD. I really really struggle to focus and keep getting distracted from my work.

I am getting better mentally but I seriously just want support. I wanna be able to be with my partner..
