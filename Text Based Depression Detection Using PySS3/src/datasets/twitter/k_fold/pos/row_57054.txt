Am I the only one who kinda cringes when the conversation is about love and such things? For example when I listen to a certain type of song which talks about love (let's say something like Dua Lipa's style) even tho I may like the energy and the rhythm and all of that the lyrics are too much for sometimes.

Also, when a girl asks me if I believe in love tbh I can't even understand her question. Love, as a word, has been so overused I can't even understand its meaning.

Love as a world can be replaced with so many other words such as appreciation, admiration, respect, trust and many other words I am certain you can think of.

I just really can't understand the meaning of that word. Is anyone with me here?
