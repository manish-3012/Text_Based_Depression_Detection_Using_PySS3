At I a bad friend? Ever since high school started my friends donâ€™t really talk to me much. They go to a different high school now too. Itâ€™s usually me starting a conversation or wanting to play with them. Am I a bad friend? Is that why they donâ€™t really talk to me much? Am I overthinking this? Maybe he is always busy?
