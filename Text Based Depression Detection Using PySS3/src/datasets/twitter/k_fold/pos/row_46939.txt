So I found out my ex, who Iâ€™ve been broken up with for a full year now, has been asking our mutual friends for pictures of me. What do I do? Sheâ€™s been asking this one friend multiple times, with a different excuse every time. One time it was because she had a friend who looked like me and wanted a comparison pic, another time she just wanted a picture of me, and so on and so forth. What do I do?

Should I go to her about it? Should I ignore it?
