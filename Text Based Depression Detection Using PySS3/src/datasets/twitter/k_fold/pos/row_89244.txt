I'm not really fitting in at college, even in my friend group Im still that one person in the friend group that's really just kind of there. The one person that people dont care as much about, the one that people rarely acknowledge or talk to. The guy that just kind of hangs out in the back and is just there and is tolerated. I hate it, but that's just how I am I guess
