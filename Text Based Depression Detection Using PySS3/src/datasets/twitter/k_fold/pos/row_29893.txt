How do I hide the huge fucking bulge in my pants??? I wish I was kidding, but Iâ€™m starting to get pretty embarrassed and self-conscious about an actual very visible bulge in my pants.

I already tend to wear tighter underwear and Iâ€™ve always worn baggy pants but itâ€™s simply not enough to withhold the schlong â€œhiddenâ€ beneath...

Canâ€™t wait for one of my friends to take a picture of this dumb post and bully me with it.

EDIT: without erection
