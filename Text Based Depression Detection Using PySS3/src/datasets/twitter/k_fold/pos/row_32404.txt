I hate reddit so much I hate reddit for so many reasons. Or more so I hate the community of reddit.
For starters if you people are so smart that they down vote the shit out of a meme with a spelling mistake do they not realise grammar doesn't fucking matter cause we are in an informal envirement.
For seconds if you dare use anything that's is not completely perfected the whole of reddit wishes death upon you. For example if you play fortnite people hope you get run over by a bus and if you play gacha while it is weird in my opinion, people hope that you die in a hole
For thirds there just so toxic all the name while thinking there all so cool

this will probably be down voted but I don't care I just needed to vent
