I put a cigarette on my mouth. A few hours ago i got a strong sensation to put a cigarette on my mouth, I sniffed through my dadâ€™s stuff but only found empty packets of â€˜em. After that i went to the living room and found a full pack I brought it in my room (VERY secretively and itâ€™s early morning) put it in my mouth and stood in-front of my mirror.

I felt scared when i did that and I smelled the tobacco.

After i put the pack in the place I found it in, i tested the lighter(it lights up).

I wanted to smoke but I didnâ€™t.

Iâ€™m only 14.
