Why do people claim they're not sexist but then complain about WAP and I'm back by Belle Delphine? Men have been making songs about their personal sex life for decades. Why is there so much controversy when women do the same? I remember when Lily Allen made the song "It's Not Fair" and it got a lot of controversy for basically being about a guy being selfish when it comes to her own orgasm. 

Look at Candy Shop by 50 Cent. 50 Cent was adored by millions of kids. Still wrote songs about sex. Whistle by Flo Rida... If men can do it, women can do it. No ifs or buts about it
