Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m being insensitive. Every time I scroll this sub, I see at least one post about depression and mental illness. I usually just ignore them because every time I read them I get uncomfortable. Everything in my life is going alright rn and I feel like ignoring those post is like ignoring a major problem. 

Am I being insensitive and negligent or is it okay that Iâ€™m ignoring those post because I feel uncomfortable.
