People who were bullies before but now regret it... We can never forget the past and we can't leave the past as past. We carry guilt but we should use that guilt to make sure we don't do that again.

I mean in 4th-5th i threw a kids glasses in a bin, made him cry and played (the kid) is invisible. 

But we had so much in common, espessical cartoons and superheros but he was more open about it and even imagined himself as iron man. And I fucking bullied him for it.

But we can't let them hurt us now or forget about it. We should make sure we've improved. And aren't a dick head anymore.

 And if you have a chance take that chance to apologize. I still remember the end of 5th grade where we talked but I never got to say that I'm sorry.  But if you have the chance. Take it u asshole.
