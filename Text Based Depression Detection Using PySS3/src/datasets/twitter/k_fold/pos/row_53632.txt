Stop by for a minute and let it all out If you have pent up emotions towards anyone, whether they be love, hate, etc, use me as an emotional punching bag. Just comment and pretend you're talking to them. I know I need this and I know other people do as well. Feel free to use names but you don't have to, also remember that this is a no judgement zone of course.
