Let's go through all of my loving family members Dad: Doesn't care about seeing me ever, I only see him a few times a year

Brother: We get along, but we just can't relate on a lot of things because he's 10 years older than me. That age gap is also why I was never too close to him

Aunt #1: Asked my mom when I was younger if I had autism because I was shy, lost all respect for her then

Aunt #2: Just left the family setting for no reason and I haven't talked to her in 3 years

All of my Uncles: Never talk to me or have been close to me

Grandpa: Passed away 3 years ago. I want to talk to him right now :(

All I have is my Mom, who is depressed just like me. And I can't see any of my friends because of the lockdown. They are pretty much my real family :(
