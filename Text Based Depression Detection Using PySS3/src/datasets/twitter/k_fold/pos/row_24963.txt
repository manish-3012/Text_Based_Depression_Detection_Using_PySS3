Friends forever? Since the lockdown started i got to know who my real friends are , and it breaks my heart to see how close we were and how distant we are rn its my birthday next month and i dont even feel like celebrating it as last year we all were wayy closer than we are rn it just hurts a lot to see close ones drifting apart , ill miss them definitely.
