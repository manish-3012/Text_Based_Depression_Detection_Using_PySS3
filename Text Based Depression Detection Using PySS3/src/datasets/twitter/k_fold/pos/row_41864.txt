My brother illegally drove my pickup and crashed it causing it to be totaled. So this is 2 days ago. I was in town getting my school permit with my dad. I'm assuming that my brother was mad that I was going to be driving and he wasn't. So in the hour we were gone he managed to drive it directly into a tree. The whole Right front part of my pickup is ruined, it would probably be a $1700+ fix and we got the 2005 Chevy Colorado For $2,200. So yeah we have to go to court sometime next week for other things he's done. The fact that he was jealous enough to literally break my pickup beyond being fixed is shitty and he better be in a large amount of trouble. (he's also been caught drinking, he's only 14, so am I, I haven't been drinking or anything illegal lmao). Hopefully I get a new truck.
