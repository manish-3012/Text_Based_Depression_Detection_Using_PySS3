does anyone else do this like i get an itch in my throat sometimes when iâ€™m thinking, typing, or speaking. it happens like when iâ€™m forming a sentence and thereâ€™s so many words to use but the itch forms when i need want to use a certain one. 

if i canâ€™t find the right word i need to do this certain breathing thing to make it go away. i canâ€™t explain exactly what it is. i dont click my tongue but itâ€™s something like that when iâ€™m looking for the word

iâ€™m going very into detail because obviously when i thinking about it it happens more often

this itch leads to my sentences being weird sounding because i have to use the word whether or not itâ€™s correct
