So I've realised I'm a complete pushover- I feel like I try to be overly nice to everyone, to avoid people disliking me, if someone asks for an item of mine, even if I'm using it, I'll give it to them, for example someone asks to borrow my only pencil while I'm in the middle of writing, I'd just hand it over. I do this all the time, I hold the door open for everyone, when most of the time I just get the door slammed in my face, people push me in the halls, I only have like three proper friends and in some classes I don't have any so I'm left on my own... Sorry for this weird af rant
