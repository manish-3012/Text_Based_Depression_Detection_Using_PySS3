My first year on reddit in my first year of reddit I have seen a lot of things some bad, some good, yet all of the kindest strangers i know come together and support one another, ik this sounds like an essay but still I am very happy to be in reddit and am looking forward to my next year of reddit
enjoy your holidays everyone
