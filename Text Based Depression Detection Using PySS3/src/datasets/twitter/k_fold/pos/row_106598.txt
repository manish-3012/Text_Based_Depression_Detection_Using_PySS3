Am I the only one who watches old 80's stuff like music videos and just adores the vibe from back then? The 80's seems like it honestly was the best decade. 2010's coming pretty close behind it I'd say. 

All I'm saying is that I'm totally here for an 80's vibe in the 2020's and there's no way I'm in the minority here lol
