I failed all my mid-semester exams and I'm going through depression. My birthday is coming up and no one in my family wants to talk to me... Reddit is the only place where I can open up. Hey guys! I hope ya'll are doing well. So, recently I failed literally all of my mid-semester exams, especially in the subjects I love the most. My parents expect a lot from me and now I've let them down. My birthday is coming up in a few days and my family thinks I don't exist. Reddit as I've known is quite supportive, especially this sub, so I can open up to you guys freely. Thank you so much for your support and hopefully, things get better (maybe not my birthday, but at least my state of mind).
