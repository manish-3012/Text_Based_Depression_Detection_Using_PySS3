WTF Grandpa! I was just minding my own business in the shower beating the meat. After that I started to take a normal shower. When I got flaccid and washed away everything my grandpa came in. Like what! You live half way across Stockholm and had not told beforehand that heâ€™s coming. 

Damn Iâ€™m lucky, if he came five minutes earlier that wouldâ€™ve been really awkward.

Edit: Apparently he was going to renovate the sauna. which we talked about two days ago but we hadnâ€™t set a date.
