realizing i have to pretend i am a fully functioning human being now that i have a roommate:// yknow it is probably a good thing to have a roommate coz a lot of the time im too depressed to get anything done so now the anxiety is forcing me to function at the bare minimum so she doesnt think im weird

ugh depression &amp; anxiety but im still sexc tho ðŸ˜«
