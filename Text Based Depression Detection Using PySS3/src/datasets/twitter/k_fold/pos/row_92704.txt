What would you guys consider the top 10 albums of all time? mine are as follows:

10. Toxicity - System Of A Down

9. Human Bloom - Radwimps

8. Holy Diver - Dio

7. Nightmare - Avenged sevenfold

6. In Rainbows - Radiohead

5.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - The Beatles

4.Demon Days - Gorillaz

3. Sailing the seas of cheese - Primus

2. Ok Computer - Radiohead

I could easily swap Kid A and OK Computer but this is how it stands today
