I almost died yesterday :) So I was driving on the interstate going like 85 mph in the fast lane. I was lookin down on my phone real quick and my car almost swerved over into the next lane and there was a car right behind me lol. It's ok dont worry guys im 19 and dont wanna be alive that long anyways.
