How I knew about gay ppl So thisis the story of how I first learned of gay people, enjoy

Ok so I remember I was 6, and I was in my mom's bed. And in the tv there was this morning show and they were talking about same sex marriage legalisation in Chile, and in the middle of this they interview this very homophobic priest ( if you wanna look it up search "Pastor Soto Chile") and he was talking of how being gay was an illness, and I watched that, and for the next 3 years I thought that being gay was an illness and a problem.

Very interesting story from my point of view at least
