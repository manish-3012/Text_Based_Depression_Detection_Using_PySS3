I finally fucking did it. After prying my ass off my couch I walked up to my dads office opened to door told him he was a terrible father for being extra abuse to my eldest sister, to nice to my other sister (still older then me), and neglectful to me for literally letting my sisters push me to suicide to get out of the family and not doing anything (he also happened to give me trust issues and acute paranoia when he threatened to get information from my therapist about my mental health, all because my sister needed attention and lied about me threatening to hurt her even though her story wouldn't seem to straighten itself out and was obviously bullshit). Then I said goodnight to him and walked out. Now he's watching TV. It seems his neglectfulness was more than I thought it was. Goodnight.
