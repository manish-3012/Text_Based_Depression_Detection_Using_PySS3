what is it with parents and talking back? so today my mom got mad at my brother for what she thinks is a good reason to scream to him.

i agreed 100% percent with my brother so i said â€žhe did nothing wrongâ€œ(we are the type of brothers that protect each other).
my mom scream to me to â€žSHUT UP U ANOYING SHITâ€œ
(i am like okay das it) so i say â€žwhy dont u?â€œ
any way, i am not allowed on my pc for a month.

oh, this was the problem:
my brothers friend didnt feel well, a few days latter my brother wants to hang with him.
my mom sais â€žonly if he tested negative on coronaâ€œ.
my brother texted him.
friend sais he doesnt have corona.
brother hangs out with him.
later it turns out the friend never did a test.

it aint my brothers fault right?
