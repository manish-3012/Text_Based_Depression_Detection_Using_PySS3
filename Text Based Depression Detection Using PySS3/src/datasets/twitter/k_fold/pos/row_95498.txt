what do you call this. I have had depression before and both of my parents have struggled with it.

The thing is i'm able to go out with my friends and have fun and laugh. but when I get home I don't feel anything. I just feel numb. I will stay up until 2 or 3 am just listening to music and staring in bed. 

I don't really know what to do, ever sense covid started I haven't seen my therapist but even when I was  seeing her I felt the same. I don't really know what i can do. I have talked to people about it but that hasn't changed anything at all. I have usually just fake a smile at school b5ecause school counselors are useless. I think antidepressents will help but I really don't know.

 I just want to feel happy again. Like I was when I was 6 or 7 and was excited about everything.
