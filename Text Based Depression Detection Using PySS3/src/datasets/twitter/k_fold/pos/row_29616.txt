Iâ€™m scared my cat will die Iâ€™ve never experienced death first hand or of someone close to me. Iâ€™m not afraid of dying myself.

But my cat is nearing her 23rd birthday and Iâ€™m starting to feel so frightened about waking up one morning and finding sheâ€™s dead.

Being 23, sheâ€™s been here my whole life. Sheâ€™s been as essential to my upbringing as my parents and my sister. 

I cry sometimes and Iâ€™m so fucking scared. I feel this need to pet her when I can, let her sit in my lap all the time, and appreciate her before she dies.

Iâ€™m also afraid Iâ€™ll regret not appreciating her enough. That when she dies Iâ€™ll forget about her. Or that I never will get over it.
