God Iâ€™m so fucking frustrated right now Some of yâ€™all really donâ€™t believe in science do you?? And then you have the audacity to tell me Iâ€™m wrong? WHEN IM GOING TO COLLEGE AND STUDYING THIS??

Iâ€™m so done with this sub. Some people just infuriate me and think Iâ€™m a loser because Iâ€™m going to college studying what Iâ€™m passionate about and telling them drugs are bad.
