I got a burn Not like a siq burn (pardon my french) but like an actual burn. I was playing with hot glue, like stupid adolescents do, then WOP I burned myself. But here is the thing. This happened MONTHS ago, yet the mark still hasn't gone away. The glue burned through about a millimeter skin before I got it off, and it hurt like a bitch. Turned into a scab, picked at it like a dunce, and now is just a piece of pink skin left. So..... does anyone know when this will finally heal up? Or do I forever have a reminder to not be a dunce? Its not like it hurts daily and causes me trouble, (I wouldn't post on reddit for that), but its still annoying.
