Ringing in my ears after taking a shower Just took a shower and I have ringing in my left ear, I think? I canâ€™t really tell, cause itâ€™s really loud. Itâ€™s kind of repeating the ringing in a pattern. 10 second ringing, 5 second break, 10 second ringing and it just repeats. I just wanted to share the pain Iâ€™m experiencing. Perhaps I got water in my ear or something and itâ€™ll stop after a bit, but I donâ€™t know. Thanks for reading my post.
