Anyone else got this So I got this mom right? Calls me down for dinner 30 minutes before itâ€™s done, I kid you not. Says itâ€™s time for dinner. I set the table then lay down on the couch. Next thing you know Iâ€™m getting yelled at for being a minute late for dinner, with my mom doing that stupid judgmental look.

Idk just felt like saying this
