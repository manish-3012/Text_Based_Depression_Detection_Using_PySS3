Question about Subway Surfers lol I started playing again out of nostalgia and I spend an ungodly amount of time on the game because itâ€™s a distraction. 

On â€œSeason Huntâ€ specials, you can unlock locations after collecting a certain amount of tokens, but what does that even do? Iâ€™m talking about the little graphic with the name of the city.
