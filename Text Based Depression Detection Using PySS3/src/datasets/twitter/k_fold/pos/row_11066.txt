I got a question Do any of you know a bot that is better at detecting reposts than repostsleuthbot? I am asking this cause people think that my most recent meme which is this https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/igcmtt/at_least_he_made_people_happy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb is a repost. even though the template is just photoshopped out of this meme https://www.reddit.com/user/heythereyouareok/comments/ignpn7/also_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb (I reposted that meme on my pfp cause idk where i got the original post)
