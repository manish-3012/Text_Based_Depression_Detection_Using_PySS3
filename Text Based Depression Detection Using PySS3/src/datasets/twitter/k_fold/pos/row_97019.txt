Meeting new people So lately Iâ€™ve been feeling kind of lonely and the quarantine isnâ€™t helping much. My friends play video games in which I donâ€™t own so Iâ€™m usually left out, so I though why not meet some new people online?

Anyways, if youâ€™re looking for someone to chat and maybe play some video games with, PM me and Iâ€™ll send you my Discord. Have a nice day!
