I swear to god I multiple personality disorder. I'm not drastically different, I'm just fucked up in different ways and levels. Rarely, I make a normal-ish meme, but right now, don't know why I feel the urge to type the fucked up shit that I type. I need fucking help. Quarantine revealed some shit about me that I wish weren't revealed. Wish I was out there doing things instead of being stuck here, wasting away at ineffective online classes that you are bound to forget by next year. I don't want to bust a nut anymore, I just want company bro.
