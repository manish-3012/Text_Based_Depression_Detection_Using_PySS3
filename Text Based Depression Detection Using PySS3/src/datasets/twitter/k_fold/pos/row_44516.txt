I need help to see if someone is being toxic or just passionate about their views  This guy has always posted memes, pretty good ones but now he has been mocking people that are oversensitive which is fine, but then he has been mocking the feminist movement. Not just the stupid parts (Misandry, justification of abuse, etc), but the movement as a whole.

He has also done the same with LGBTQ+ people and i know it could be satire but i can't be sure. If i ask he calls me a "fucking idiot", so it's pretty much a game of guesswork. He also only shares the memes, he doesn't make them so maybe this is a case of Schrodinger's douchebag? Like, he uses the fact that he didn't make them to avoid being scolded.

I might be reading too hard into things but i can't be sure, i hope second opinions help.
