LMAO, my guidance counselor just got caught in an affair! Apparently he's been cheating on his wife for the past three years and got the other girl pregnant. I hate the man so much already for being a guilt-tripping manipulative asshole of a counselor, I can't wait to see his life fall apart, better yet see if he gets fired or something.

Get fucked Mr. Johnson!
