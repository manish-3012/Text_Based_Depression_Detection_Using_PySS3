Anyone likes to read plays? What do you like about plays that differ from ordinary books? I'm a total theatre nerd, my school offers me the occasion to read tons of play and, before covid, see a lot of them. Any reccomandation? I read english and french, so if you got anything tell me, or share your favorite!
