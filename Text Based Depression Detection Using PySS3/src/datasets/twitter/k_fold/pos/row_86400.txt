Survey about Lunch Tables and School Benches Hello, I'm taking an engineering class in High School and was assigned in creating and sending out a survey. The survey focuses on the School's lunch tables and benches in order to see if students do have issues with them.  If possible, I would like if you could take the survey so that I could get a more broader perspective on what others think about their current lunch tables and benches situation. NOTE: The questions revolve around my school's arrangement of tables and benches so please ignore any questions that wouldn't apply to you.
