My Minecraft dog passed away today It was a normal Minecraft morning, I was harvesting the crops with my dog beside me when a creeper came up and exploded, I got knocked in the air and I look down while still in the air and my dog gets yeeted backwards down the hill and he died on impact...I wasnâ€™t expecting to lose him that soon it was so early he wasnâ€™t even a week old.....
