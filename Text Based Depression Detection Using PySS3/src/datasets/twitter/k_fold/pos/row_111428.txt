BRAND NAME IDEAS aight so i'm trying to make a brand. i'm a magician and cardist so i'm going to have playing cards as products, for now. more stuff later. anyways i have ideas, but not a good catchy name. i'm looking for something that you'll remember, but also relevant to us, gen z's. so maybe like a meme or something in the brand name? i wanted 'Virgin Playing Cards' but there are big company's with 'Virgin' as their name. so my fellow teenagers(fuck, that sounded cringe) any name ideas??
