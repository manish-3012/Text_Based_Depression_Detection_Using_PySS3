Honestly, I dont think half of the people on this website are stable The link down below is a thread discussing the snow killing incident. Be weary, because the video involves a couple getting murdered in cold blood on camera. Now, the couple may have been bullying shits, or whatever. Nobody denies that. Where there actions dumb (walking up and begging the guy with the gun to shoot them?) Yes. Where they assholes? Yes. But that's not what gets me. There are some extremely psychotic people on reddit. The comments on this thread even goes as far as to say that the killings where *satisfying*. This people is why everyone wants to stay away from reddit. Fucking losers like these.
