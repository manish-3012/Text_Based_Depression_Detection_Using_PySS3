I'm really scared guys. My best friend has struggled with depression for a while and suicidal thoughts and ideations, he's been inactive on everything I know him on for days (discord, text, reddit) and I am terrified he might have done it, I can't sleep. I hope he responds in the morning, I just need him to be okay.
