Just because you donâ€™t like it, itâ€™s not cringey The whole class was watching this video on verbs in French class, it was a parody of some random song and this one guy is interrupting the damn music every 5 seconds screaming thatâ€™s so cringe!â€

I just want to say this, just because you donâ€™t like something, it doesnâ€™t make it cringey, if you want to know what cringe actually means, look it up

I canâ€™t take this anymore, itâ€™s gotten so bad that itâ€™s gone meta, where people are saying itâ€™s cringey to say â€œthatâ€™s cringeyâ€ and I have a message for all of you people who feel the need to say â€œthatâ€™s so cringeyâ€ at literally every single thing

Youâ€™ve become the very thing youâ€™ve sought out to destroy

Cringey
