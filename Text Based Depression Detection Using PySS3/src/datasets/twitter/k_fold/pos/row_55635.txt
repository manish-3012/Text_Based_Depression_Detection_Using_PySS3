I just can't pretend to not notice it, I am just NOT okay. All I ever wanted in life was to have someone on my back to support me, be with me through my ups and down but no. I just cannot pretend to not believe that I am depressed, because I am. My parents won't believe me when I said that I got suicidal thoughts in my head a couple times before, they just shrug it off. I am really starting to think that there is no one made for me in this world and that I was alone, I am alone and I will be alone. I drifted my away from me because I always feared that I would hurt them in some way or another. It was my fault but I just don't want anyone blaming me for things that I did not do. I am just fed up.......
