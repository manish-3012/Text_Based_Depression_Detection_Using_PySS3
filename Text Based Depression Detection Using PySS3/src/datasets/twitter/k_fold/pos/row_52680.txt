I want to help her, but I don't know how My girlfriend just said to me that she always feel like i don't even love her and that everything i do for her and say to her Is just because I'm too nice to tell her I don't want to be with her.

I love this girl with all my heart, I tell her that a lot and I really try to make her feel that way but she has trust issues and I can't help her overcome it :(

I just want her to feel loved, I feel it hurts her and I can't help... Do you have any advice for me?

btw sorry for my bad English, this is not my native language...
