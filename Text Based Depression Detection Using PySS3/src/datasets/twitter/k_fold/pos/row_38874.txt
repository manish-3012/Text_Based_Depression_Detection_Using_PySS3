I about got grounded over a freaking energy drink So my parents are hyper-religious (Iâ€™m a believer as well) and my mom uses essential oils and stuff to help â€˜calmâ€™ â€˜sootheâ€™ and â€˜cleanseâ€™ you. So today I was walking home after school (tired, as usual) and I decided to stop by the neighborhood convenience store to pick up an energy drink. I drank it all and at supper tonight my parents found the can in the recyclables (save the brozone layer). My dad started yelling at me about how itâ€™s basically the devilâ€™s drink and stuff, and my mom literally sent me to my room with an essential oil diffuser so it could â€˜cleanseâ€™ me. Anyway thatâ€™s where I am right now and Iâ€™m a little peeved. 

Also Iâ€™ve only had like 3 energy drinks in my lifetime. 


TL;DR, my Karen mom found an energy drink that I had, sent me to my room and almost got grounded.
