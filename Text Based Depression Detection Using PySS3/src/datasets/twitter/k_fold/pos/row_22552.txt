Posting until I ask my crush out day 3/30 For those who didnâ€™t see it, sheâ€™s going on a date with another guy this weekend.

However, there is hope. This guy is apparently very stupid so he decided to take her to the movies. Thereâ€™s no shot theyâ€™re gonna be able to get to know each other and I think Iâ€™ve got a 50/50 chance of her not liking him after a possibly poor first impression. 

Worst case scenario, Iâ€™m asking out my 2nd crush, though she lives a bit further away.
