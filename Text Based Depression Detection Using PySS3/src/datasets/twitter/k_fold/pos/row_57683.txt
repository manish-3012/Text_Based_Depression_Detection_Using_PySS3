My biggest fear My biggest fear is that I may be pressured to do drags that will f me up to the end of my life. And if you think "just say no". I will but it's not ez to say no to a group of ten guys that surands you.

That's my biggest fear. I'm not afraid to do anything that will go away like physical pain cos one day it will go away. Things like some one running towards me with weapon isn't scary you just got to dodge attacks (this example has been tested by many homeless ppl and ppl who are trying to hurt me it never goes that way) but having some substance f you up from inside that gives me trust issues with some ppl from worst families (I'm not trying to be mean just saying).

Have a good day or night.
