The post flair speaks for itself RUFF RUFFMAN:
Life was missing its mystique
My sqeaky toys had lost their squeak
And then, out of the blue, I saw the phone and BAM! My destiny is calling me!

Pitched my vision for a show
They loved it! Thought I was a pro
They got my contract back to find
To their alarm a dog had signed

BACKGROUND SINGING CATS: Fetch!

RUFF: Oh, I like that name

CATS: With Ruff Ruffman

RUFF:
I didn't wait to renovate
Found 6 contestants, all were great!
And now, Iâ€™m on the road to fame
I've got a gameshow and its name is...

CATS: Fetch!

RUFF: It's very catchy!

CATS: With Ruff Ruffman

RUFF: It rolls off the tongue!
Can someone tell me why cats are singing?

CATS:
With Ruff Ruffman
Fetch!
