Unpopular opinion: Halo 4 and 5 are good games with fun campaigns and really engaging gameplay mechanics. Halo 4 has some of the most fun guns to use and some really nice maps in local multiplayer. Halo 5, while not having local multiplayer at all still is super fun to play. Great guns and interesting enemies.
