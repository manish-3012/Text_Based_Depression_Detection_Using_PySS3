How do I convince a girl to stay with me but also how do I learn to let go if it comes to that? Long story short, I met a girl on Reddit that Iâ€™ve grown to love over the past two months weâ€™ve been talking. I found out about after a month she already has a bf so we both tried to keep it friendly and I tried no to advance anything. There were times though in the middle of the night while we were talking Iâ€™d bring up how much I loved talking to her and that she turned out to be the perfect girl for me but already found someone. She often talks about the relationship she is currently in and itâ€™s never postive things. She said she wishes that she waited to get into a relationship because now she is unhappy. Yesterday she hit me with â€œCan I be honest with you?â€ to which I said of course. Apparently she made a post asking for advice because sheâ€™s starting to have feelings for me but feels guilty since she has a bf. I guess a lot of people told her to just ghost me so she asked me if itâ€™s the best thing to do. Whenever I ask on Reddit about this situation Iâ€™m always told to get a real gf. Let me be clear that I never intended to like a girl over the internet but after 2 months of getting to know her Iâ€™ve realized that I really do love this girl. I try to always be supportive of her choices but for this situation I didnâ€™t want to just let a perfect girl like her slip away to be loyal to a bf that doesnâ€™t care about her the way I do. I already know that Iâ€™ll get hate in the comments for loving a girl with a bf and trust me Iâ€™ve felt my own share of shame for doing so but all I want right now is for her to make the right choice. Even if that really does mean leaving me so be it, I just want her to be happy.
