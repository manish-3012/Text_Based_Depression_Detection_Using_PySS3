Quick PSA (not an April fool I promise) Guys I just found out about this awesome search engine called Ecosia which donates 80% of its revenue to organizations that plant trees. Every 30 seconds a new tree gets planted so if you wanna save Earth then switch ur search engine. Itâ€™s super easy just go to chrome settings and search for default search engine and change to Ecosia.
