am i in love with my best friend? we are both male. I would love to spend the rest of my life with him, I would love to live with him, i would love to spend all of my time with him, i wana be with him forever. But i also donâ€™t really wana have sex with him either (i wouldnt mind but not fussed). But i kinda wana wake up by his side and fall asleep by his side. I wana know everything about him. 

So wtf is this feeling? Is it love without the sexual attraction? Platonic love?

or maybe this is a phase other teenagers go thru?

ps: iâ€™m not even gay so itâ€™s quite confusing
