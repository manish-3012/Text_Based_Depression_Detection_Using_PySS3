The health department did not like that there were a lot of covid cases at my school End of W4(alternating schedule T/W, each class 70mins) class today, they announced that the UCHD got mad about the covid cases at my school and that school got cancelled for tomorrow and last names A-K to attend on wednesday, L-Z on thursday, and an additional week of holiday break. And apparently they are getting $4,000 of cleaning done during this time. I honestly am very concerned, but at least I have more time for that project that was due tomorrow
