Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all had this one teacher: You know:  that one teacher that was so blatantly sexist that everyone even the other teachers and parents knew it?

Yeah that was mrs. Bellows for me. She said no talking to everyone during a test, and all the girls (which sat RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER) were literally on Instagram and talking to each other while the 5 guys in that class sat together in the back were silent and she singled ME out and started yelling at me and told me to go to the front of the room and when I asked her WHY she said â€œIâ€™m the teacher donâ€™t talk back. Go to the principles officeâ€ and I got half a day of ISS because of her. 

In my opinion these teachers should be fired. Itâ€™s not just sexism either thereâ€™s racist and religist and all different types of discriminatory teachers and I think that especially the early school years when kids are impressionable that they should be fired AT LEAST. Itâ€™s left a scar for a while and now Iâ€™m afraid to actually talk to my teachers bc of her
