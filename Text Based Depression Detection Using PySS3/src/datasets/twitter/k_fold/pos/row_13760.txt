I accidentally forgot I already ate lunch today and let myself eat a bunch of chocolate on impulse and now I regret it. Is there away for me to undo that? Basically just the title, I thought it would be okay for me to have chocolate because I thought I didn't eat lunch but I just remembered that I did and now I need some way to fix that.
