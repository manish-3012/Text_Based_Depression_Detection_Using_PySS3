Im not sure what to do Tl:dr My mom calls me into the living room and ask  me where im going to live if she dies as a joke and it doesn't  go well and Now I'm  not sure if I want to kms or Run away


I'm  crying right now so Excuse me Grammar)


My mom calls me into the Living room while I was watching One piece and sje ask me where I want to go if She does Pass away before im 18 (Im 15 now)
I was joking and said not here. 

Context: I live with my Grandma and mom and my grandmother is really toxic and my mom doesn't  care about my side of the story.
 When I didn't  stand up for myself to her yelling and bickering I was Really sad and I didn't  want to live. Now that I'm  old enough and Can use my Big boy words I'm  a "Smart mouthing child".

My mom Kept saying g I was rude to my grandma and didn't  love her, So I guess They both don't  love me back.  I said I'd  rather run away or go to Foster care. My moms aware of how she treats me but she sucks up to her. My grandma never talks in a normal vpice she's  always yelling and I have Sensory  problems. 

She litterly  came in as I was typing this just to complain about  me taking to long to do what im asked, and thats the reason Im treated like  this I guess. I don't  have friends That im close enough to to talk about these kinds of things I also don't  like talking about myself either but I really need advice.
