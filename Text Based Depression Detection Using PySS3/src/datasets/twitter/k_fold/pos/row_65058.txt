Just trying to get some advice My son is into pro wrestling and he and his friends play wrestle all the time. Recently he had some friends over and they competed like they always do. For some reason they asked me, his mother, to compete against the winner. Since they're only 11 I thought it was cute and obviously safe but damn... The kid was stronger than I thought, I didn't stand a chance. I had to tell them I went easy on him but I doubt they believed me. Is it normal for kids that age to be stronger than me? It's so embarrassing
