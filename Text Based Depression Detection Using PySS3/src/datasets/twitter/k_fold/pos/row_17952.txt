Alright boys, this is our chance. As of writing this, 9 minutes from now will mark the beginning of the final 10 hour stretch that we must endure before our salvation. There are some who have lost their brothers, their fathers, their cousins, and their friends to this year's No Nut November, but we have made it this far and we are so close to succeeding. Join me in this final show of endurance, my comrades, for when we share a weakness no one else has, our friendship becomes brotherhood.
