Is it bad that I feel like crap for buying a ps4 Back story: so my dad and mom are divorced and my dad lives in another city but will be moving back to the city me and my brothers live at with our mother. I was staying at my dads house for a week like I do sometimes, to spend time with him because otherwise I would only see him twice a month.

So the other day I was playing God of War on the ps4 and a friends house and I thought it was really cool and a really good game. I wanted to keep playing but we had to go. On the way back home, in the car I was talking to my dad about how I really liked the game and wish I could play more. I kinda hinted at the idea of getting the ps4 but Iâ€™m pretty sure I didnâ€™t straight up say â€œwe should get a ps4â€. Also getting a ps4 isnâ€™t something totally impulsive I just thought of, Iâ€™ve actually been thinking of it for a while but never seriously. At the end we ended up saying if we find one cheap we could get it for his new apartment. I felt happy because I would get to play new games on the ps4 and just happy to get a new gaming system. A couple days later after we bought it and spent like 500 on not just the ps4 but also on a couple games and 2 extra controllers so I can play with my brothers. But like two minutes after the purchase I started feeling kinda crappy. I thought of what my brothers would say because we already have an Xbox one (but it is like six years old and doesnâ€™t work perfectly anymore but still) also theyâ€™re the kind of brothers who will spend 100 dollars on a pair of shoes but yell at me for wasting money for buying snacks at seven eleven. Now, a couple years ago when my family wasnâ€™t doing so good with money buying a ps4 was totally out of the question but now my dad is doing really well financially and now I keep telling my self that it was his money and his decision and that he couldâ€™ve said no if he wanted to but I keep feeling like I just made a huge mistake and a total waste of money. Also I want to add that I didnâ€™t just blindly buy one, I did a lot of research and wrote down the best deals and where the cheapest price are and watched tons of reviews and comparisons but I still feel like crap. So r/teenagers, do you think it was dumb of me to spend the money while we already have an Xbox or should I stop worrying and just enjoy this gift that our dad gave us?
