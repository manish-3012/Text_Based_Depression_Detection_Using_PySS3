Etc. You get the point. I am okay with raps but by eminem and logic only, No drakes aloud joyner is okay too, but no drake or tech nine or any other loud bois( not even ems and logics loud songs). And I am going to make the worlds most awesome playlist, help me at doing so by contributing one song at least.
