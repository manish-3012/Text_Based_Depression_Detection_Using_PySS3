I selfharmed after two months of being clean and I need your help A little bit of backstory, I'm 22,I was raped when I was 15, which lend to me starting drinking and smoking, I found a guy that was just as fucked up as I was. We got in a relationship and we were helping each other stop selfharming but when that relationship ended it just went downhill from there. I've done 3 suicide attempts, obviously failed, told my mom and sister about my rapist (not my dad because he would just go CRAZY and believe me I really wanna tell him) and they made me go to a psychologist. I did and she told me that she couldn't help me because I needed antidepressants and she sent me to a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression and was sent to a clinic. I was in and out of that place for about a year. I went in 5 times. I've been feeling better but the thing is that even though I have friends and a very supportive family I can't get over it. I feel alone all the time even though I go out and stuff. I need your advice. What can I do to stop selfharming? I've tried everything I could think of. Even searched some ways on Google but none of that helped. So I would really appreciate some advice from you guys.
