Please donâ€™t be those people who spam the meeting button in Among Us. It is beyond frustrating and a complete waste of time. Itâ€™s usually someone saying they were being followed and just spam the button until they get rid of the person they sus. (I do realize there is limits, so Iâ€™m talking specifically for those that have more than 1 meeting/friends who spam it with them)

But itâ€™s so annoying. It takes like an entire minute of my time and itâ€™s just someone throwing out basic accusations until they get what they want. And if they donâ€™t get what they want (kick sus) they spam the button UNTIL they do get what they want. Itâ€™s beyond annoying and I really hope future updates fix this.
