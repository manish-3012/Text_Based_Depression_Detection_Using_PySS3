Itâ€™s Spring Break! I could be swimming. I could be gaming. I could be browsing Reddit. But instead, Iâ€™m cleaning my dads entire office. Iâ€™m making money to buy my sister a 3ds and some PokÃ©mon games so we can play together, and Iâ€™m having a good time. What are you guys doing for your break?
