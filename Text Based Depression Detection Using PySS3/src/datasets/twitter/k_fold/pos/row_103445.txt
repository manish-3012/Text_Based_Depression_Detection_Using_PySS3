How to shave your ðŸ± Girls only! Iâ€™m probably gonna delete this after a bit soo read it while you can? This is also marked girls only but if your a guy and you read this, you literally donâ€™t gain much from it cus you donâ€™t have a ðŸ±. 


This is for the girls who donâ€™t know how to shave their you know what, this is genuine advice since I know that when I was a younger teenager I didnâ€™t know how and I had no one to ask so I made many mistakes, lost a lot of blood and now I think I know how to so hereâ€™s my advice: 


What you need:

-a razor ðŸª’ to shave with. You can get a cheap pack of pink ones at the dollar store or those pretty ones with designs from Walmart. Pro tip, use menâ€™s razors for a better and closer shave.

-Scissors âœ‚ï¸ if you have long hair down there, it needs to be cut before you can shave it or else it will be harder to shave and it will ruin the razor and fill it up with hair and then you need a new razor or you need to clean it which is hard to do. 

-Something to shave with such as shaving cream which you can get from any store but if you donâ€™t have that, you can use stuff like soap foam, body wash, hair conditioner or most oils like coconut or almond.

-Moisturizer for when you are done shaving. Lotion, moisturizer, and most oils work, I personally use lotion with aloe Vera or baby oil but never both as you only need one. 

-Bandaids. Even if you think you did a good job, once you hop out of the shower, blood may start pouring out and then you need paper towels and bandaids to patch yourself up. 

-A mirror which is optional but it really helps when you are new at it because you can actually see what you are doing, after a while you sort of figure it out and can do it without a mirror.  


Where to shave:

-the shower standing but you need to crouch down or lift up your legs and stuff so it can get hard in a cramped shower so maybe a bathtub with a shower in it. 

-in front of a mirror while sitting on a towel or something. This is if you need the mirror, which I suggest if you have not done this before. 


How to shave:

-if the hair is long, cut or trim it down with scissors âœ‚ï¸. 

-To start shaving, stand up and wet the front area of your ðŸ±, then apply shaving cream or whatever you are using instead, put it all over the front if you want to shave it all off or only put it where you want to shave the hair. 

-before you start shaving, pull the skin above your ðŸ± upwards, this will help shave closer to the root of the hair and wonâ€™t hurt because the skin is tightened and it wonâ€™t be caught on the razor. 

-Shave in the opposite direction that the hair is growing. If the hair is growing down, shave up, if itâ€™s growing on an angle near your thighs, shave up in an angle. This helps get all the hairs. Do not press hard or press at all, just glide the razor over the hairs, if you press hard or press on it at all you might cut yourself.

-clean off the area you just shaved, if youâ€™re in the shower just wash it off, if you are in front of a mirror, clean it off with a damp paper towel. You might have to put more shaving cream or whatever on and shave again if your hair is thick and didnâ€™t come off the first time. 

-to shave the hair underneath the front of the ðŸ±, crouch down and sit with your legs out if you in front of a mirror. In other words sit in a way that you can see your whole ðŸ± in the mirror. If you are in the shower, sit down the same way, itâ€™s easier than putting your legs up in awkward positions. 

-Apply shaving cream on the lips which are the two sides on either side of where you pee from. 
They are easy to distinguish as they will be covered in hair unlike the middle part which you do not shave because 1 it does not have hair and 2 that would hurt like hell. 

-before shaving either of the lips, pick a side you will shave first and pull the skin above it upwards to tighten it. Then shave in the direction that the hair grows. On the lips it usually grows at an angle so shave towards your thigh but still tilted a bit upwards 

-repeat on the other lip. 

-sometimes hair grows between the folds of your ðŸ±, in that case, dig around in the folds and check if there is any and if there is, keep the fold open so that you can shave it and go for it, you can do this one without shaving cream which I find easier since you can see the hair better but if itâ€™s a lot, you should use shaving cream. 

You think we are done there, we are not. There is one more part you have to shave. The asshole. Yes the asshole. If you are not aware, hair also grows around the asshole. I heard this story from one girl who didnâ€™t know that until her 30s or some shit and she had sex and everything but her bf didnâ€™t say anything to her until she found out thereâ€™s hair there and she shaved it and her bf was like oh you shaved there. So basically itâ€™s really embarrassing if you shave your ðŸ± but not your asshole cus itâ€™s like you missed a whole part. 


To shave the asshole:

-You wonâ€™t be able to see this in the mirror unless you bend down in front of it and look between your legs into the mirror. But if you crouch down, like when you take a shit in the woods, you can shave it better but you wonâ€™t be able to see what you are doing so itâ€™s all just feel and do. 

-put shaving cream all in the crack and around your asshole. If you canâ€™t see, feel where the hair is and glide the razor over the hair and then feel again if the hair is gone or not. 

-you donâ€™t have to pull any skin for this one because ass skin is usually tight until you turn like 35 and it starts sagging really bad. 

-once again do not press down or press hard, especially during this part cus trust me you donâ€™t want cuts on or around your asshole that shit hurts many many decades. And when you think itâ€™s gone or healed over itâ€™s back after you stretch your asshole to take a shit. 


Once you are done shaving everything, clean yourself off and donâ€™t forget to clean yourself off in between shaves so you can get all the shaved hair off and be able to see. If you are in front of a mirror and not in the shower, this is a good time to get in the shower and clean off. 


After your shower, get out and dry yourself off, blood may start appearing now so do your best to stop it until after you have applied lotion or oil on the shaved parts and then you can put on bandaids and stuff. 

Yes itâ€™s kind of weird putting bandaids on your privates but no ones gonna see that shit so donâ€™t worry and itâ€™s only to stop the blood so you can take them off a few hours later and clean off the dried blood and it will have stopped bleeding by then. 


I hope this helps someone cus I spent a good 15 minutes wrong to out and ik guys donâ€™t have vaginas but if you wanna shave your asshole, here you go.
