Okay why does everyone i know also know eachother this is scary Couple weeks ago when fitness etc was still open there was this guy that works there that talked to me and told me he knows one of my friends at my school.

Well it seems like that guy is family of another girl and she lives close to me(never knew) and shes best friends with my crush and after all my crush told me that she also knows who i am.

Why do so many people know eachother
