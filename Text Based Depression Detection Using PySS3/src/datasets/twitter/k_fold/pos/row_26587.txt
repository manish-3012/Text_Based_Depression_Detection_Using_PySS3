Fuck you, Mr. Hill. About 2 years ago, I was posting facts n shit from the Columbine shooting (I enjoy crime stories) on my instagram. Well, somehow that got around to my infamous asshole of a principal. This guy twisted my story, and essentially made the police believe that I was going to shoot up the school. Well, I had a nice visit from the cops like a week later, and they were kind enough to show my parents my entire instagram account, which contained nsfw jokes and other things you don't want your parents seeing. Now why would you want to do this to a kid that you think is going to shoot up the school? I don't fucking know. They made me go to the counselor every week, and searched my bag every morning. So, once again, fuck you, Mr. Hill.
