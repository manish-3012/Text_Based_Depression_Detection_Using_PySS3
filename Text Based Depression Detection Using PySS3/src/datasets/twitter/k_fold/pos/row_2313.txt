that moment when you get in trouble for doing an assignment early... yes i completed your 2 minute homework assignment before class started, no i wasn't expecting it to be the key part to class and for it to be an inconvenience. I WAS SCARED SEEING DUE TODAY PANICKED AND DID IT
i hate it here never again. getting in trouble because i got them right and the others didn't because i did it all before
