Good sao game for my little brother ?  Hello !

Im looking for a sao (sword art online) game for my brother. He is a huge fan of the series and I caught him almost spending 70 bucks on a shitty sao game on the ps4 store. I understand that he really loves the series and would like to play a game related to this series, but I would like him to not waste his money on a bad game.

So if anyone knows of a good sao game on the ps4 store or on the app store, please let me know ! He really loves the series and he would be really happy to have this kind of game !
