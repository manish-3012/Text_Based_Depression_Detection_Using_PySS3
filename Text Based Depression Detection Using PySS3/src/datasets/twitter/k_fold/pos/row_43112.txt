I'm going to give an award to you if you help me! So, I need to make something digital about Hamlet. I can do it with my hands but I'm not good at drawing, doing anything that involves my hands. Give me your best ideas and help me by suggesting me anything (programs, apps, ideas...). The length is no more than 10 minutes. It can be a movie, but not the standard power point presentation - this is too simple. Go on, earn yourself an award :)
