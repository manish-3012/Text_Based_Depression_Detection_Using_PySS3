I need help I have a friend online who is being abused but he doesnâ€™t realise it. Iâ€™m trying to get him to understand that his mother hitting him is not normal AT ALL. He told me that she will hit him if he doesnâ€™t do his homework or sleeps in time. Iâ€™m trying my best to help him and convincing him to look for help i wish i could be there for him in real life and force him to get help. 

Please answer this, is a mother hitting her son being abusive? Yes or no. Please answer so i can show him that itâ€™s really not normal.
