Hoping for surgery but who knows Itâ€™s not really a rant as much as a vent. Iâ€™m hoping I can get a stomach reduction by the end of the year cuz I have severe portion issues. My boyfriend tries to help me when I get really sad about it. I only end up being sad about my weight for a moment, threaten to not eat, remember that doesnâ€™t help, promise to eat less and better, but then I wake up the next day and eat poorly. Iâ€™ve had issues with portions since maybe 3rd-4th grade and Iâ€™m a senior in high school now. For 3 years my weight stayed stagnate only because I went to school without breakfast, didnâ€™t pack a lunch, and then went home and ate to make up for it. I know surgery wonâ€™t solve my problems but Iâ€™m hoping maybe I can not just mindless eat so often. I know what makes it worse is my lack of effort to exercise. I hope that now that Iâ€™ll be back in school Iâ€™ll be a tiny bit more active but I just wish weight loss was as easy as weight gain. I would ask for advice but I know I wonâ€™t follow through unless Iâ€™m forced.
