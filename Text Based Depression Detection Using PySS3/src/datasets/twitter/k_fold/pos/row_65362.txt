I'm gonna go crazy So near the end of April my weight was 76 kg(167.55 lbs), so I wanted to lose some weight and get in shape. I was on a diet for 22 days and I started working out. While I was on the diet I lost 6kg(13.22) and since then I lost additional 6kg (now I'm at 64.4kg (142lbs)). I've never felt better about myself and my body BUT basically all of my family is urging me to stop and put on weight because they think I'm too skinny and I looked better before I lost weight. They think I'm anorexic or something and they think I'm gonna end up in a hospital. They're not letting me work out which is completely mad to me and I don't know what to do. 

Also my height is 175cm (I think that's 5'9) and I'm 15.
