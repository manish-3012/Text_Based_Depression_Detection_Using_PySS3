Why do people get so upset when I talk about bottom dysphoria/surgery Hi, I'm an eighteen year old, afab, agender person. I have very bad bottom dysphoria and I'm trying to get surgery to completely remove my vagina and other feminine bits (leaving me with just a smooth crotch and a hole to pee out of). I've known I wanted these parts gone from my body since I was young (I tried to glue myself shut when I was thirteen).

I live in new york (which is a very queer positive city) and I feel comfortable talking about most queer subjects, but bottom surgery and dysphoria has always been something that I've been very causios talking about outside the house. I'm so afraid of what people will say.

I mentioned wanting to void myself of genitals recently with a close freind (who is trans himself) and he became super weirded out and worried about me. I thought he would be so supportive but he said some really hurtful stuff (it isn't his fault, I don;t hate him} I feel so cold and alone.

I don't know why people are so weirded out by dysphoria from enby people. Nullification surgery is a thing (even some cissys get it).

I still havn't even mentioned my bottom issues to the girl I like. I don't think I'll ever be able to get a girlfriend with my mind like it is.
