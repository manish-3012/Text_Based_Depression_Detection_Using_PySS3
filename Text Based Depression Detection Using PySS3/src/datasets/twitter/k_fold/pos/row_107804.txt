America - Call Me Karizma https://youtu.be/MAzteDOGBm4

I went to college now I'm broke

Took out a million dollar loan
But I'll be fine

Where do I sign?

No fucking wonder I'm alone

My only friends are on my phone

And my shit died

Oh well, I tried

Stress is building up inside of everyone

Blame my parents but their parents didn't get it done

I'm in debt so my life's over and I'm twenty-one

Are you having fun?

Are you having fun? 

In America you can go and be what you like

Dream of miracles but we don't believe in a god

Find out who you are

Whatever's on the T.V. tonight

We buy it

We buy it

In America guns are going off in the streets

It's a right so it's alright unless they're shooting at me

Nine to five until ya die is what it costs to be free

Welcome to the land of opportunity

In America

I'm feeling down prescribe a drug

I'm swiping right to fall in love

And I'll be fine

It's just the times

Did I mention?

They have us go to college just to make us alcoholics

While they fill our brains with bullshit

As they're emptying our wallets

Act like prophets just to make a profit

They must think I'm stupid

I ain't gonna fucking listen
I don't wanna face the music

These politics and racists only wanna just abuse us

Use their power to enslave us

Leaving normal people useless

I'm sick of being chained

It's time to rise up and refuse it

But it'll have to be tomorrow 'cuz tonight I'm at the movies

In America you can go and be what you like

Dream of miracles but we don't believe in a god

Find out who you are

Whatever's on the T.V. tonight

We buy it

We buy it

In America guns are going off in the streets

It's a right so it's alright unless they're shooting at me

Nine to five until ya die is what it costs to be free

Welcome to the land of opportunity

In America

Stress is building up inside of everyone

Blame my parents but their parents didn't get it done

I'm in debt so my life's over and I'm twenty-one

Are you having fun?

Are you having fun?

In America
