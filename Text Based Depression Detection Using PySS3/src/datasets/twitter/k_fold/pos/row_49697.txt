How would you feel if they made a movie about a military obsessed guy who fights off jocks and stops a school shooting set in the 90s? I heard there was an athlete glorifying culture in the 90s and that caused a couple of troubled kids to shoot up a school called Columbine. How would you feel if they made a teen movie about this good looking athletic guy. Instead of sports he loves astronaut stuff. The old astronaut movies "The Right Stuff" and/or "Apollo 13" inspire him to work towards becoming a fighter pilot and astronaut. During the movie he stops jocks from bullying and he ends up talking a school shooter out of shooting up the school. The movie ends with him being accepted to the Air Force Academy. He also gets the girl.

How would you feel about that?
