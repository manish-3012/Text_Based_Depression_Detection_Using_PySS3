Unconditional love is unrealistic The reason for this is that there are at least 2 conditions that are required for a healthy relationship: 

1. They should love you back. If your partner doesnâ€™t love you back, then the relationshipâ€™s already failed, 

and 

2. They shouldnâ€™t treat you like shit. Now, let me clarify: There are masochists and sadists in the world, and for them, being treated like shit and treating others like shit is their kink, but thereâ€™s a difference between being treated like shit as a kink and being treated like shit because your partner is just a garbage human being. It may not always be easy to tell when your partner is a garbage human being, especially if you really feel like you love them, but if you ever feel like youâ€™re not in a good relationship, then itâ€™s a good idea to leave. If that person really loves you, then theyâ€™ll try to fix their behavior for you. Now, that may not always be the easiest thing to do if itâ€™s become a habit, but if theyâ€™re trying to change, then itâ€™s a good idea to stick it out for until you feel like they maybe have stopped trying, at which point you should leave (and remember that second chances are good, but too many second chances can be very bad). If they donâ€™t try to be better, then leave them immediately. They donâ€™t love you and maybe never truly did. 

TL;DR: Make sure your partner loves you back and doesnâ€™t treat you like shit (unless youâ€™re a masochist, in which case: know the difference between being treated like shit as a kink and just plain being treated like shit)
