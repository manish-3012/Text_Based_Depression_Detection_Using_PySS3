Should i get back on my social media? I decided to delete one of my social media because i felt like doing something to remove contact eith my friends for the reason that i just gave up on life.

Now im thinking of getting back on just to be safe but im very adamant about giving up, i do not think ill try again but knowing me, ill try again because you know fuck me am i right?

So what do i do? Just give ur opinion on what i should do, you do not need to say yeah because i think i wont get back it anyway because i dont want to just get back on it after 3 days.
