Story time guys! So in my school because of covid we stay in one room all day so we don't have to wear masks
And there's desinfectant on teachers desk and my friend squirted some on my friends desk and lit it on fire. All good. And when it burned up he squirted more and my other friends desk and friend 2 proceeds to wipe it with a piece of paper and at the same time friend 1 lights it on fire and the desinfectant that is at this point spread on half of the desk and the sheet of paper catch on fire. The desinfectant burns up quickly  and the sheet of paper keeps burning so friend one takes the sheet of paper and goes for the sink but there is not a sink in the room so his dumbazz brain throws it in the bin. AND THE FUCKING TRASH CAN CATCHES ON FIRE. And he goes to throw it out the window but there is a net for mosquitoes so he goes to the other window and YEETS it.
I think I don't have to explain the rest the bin hit the ground and cracked and extinguished itself no one noticed and we went and got the bin and put it back in the classroom and the teacher didn't notice
