Madlad at my school played Coffin Dance, Giornoâ€™s Theme and Unravel for everyone in our year group in assembly At our schoolâ€™s assemblies, a student plays the piano or another musical instrument while everyone else enters/exits the hall. Usually it would be any appropriate piece of music to play in that scenario.

A student today decided to take it to the next level. He was playing normal music at first, but switched to coffin dance. Everyone started cheering. Then, it got even better as he started playing even better and even playing anime music.

Everyone enjoyed it, myself included as a big JoJo fan. It was nothing short of spectacular.
