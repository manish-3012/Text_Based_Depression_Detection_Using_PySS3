How is Halloween going to work this year? For some context, Iâ€™m eighteen years old and highly anticipate Halloween this year. I get some weird looks here and there because of my height and some are even reluctant to give me candy. What should I do? People think that Iâ€™m some creep. Granted, I do knock on my neighbors doors weekly. But still, they should be okay with it.
