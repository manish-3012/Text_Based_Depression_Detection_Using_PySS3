If you wouldn't mind me wasting a bit of your time then help me please Hi, I'm 16, and i don't care about girls. I'm introvert, and i don't like being in company of many peoples. So I get called gay, the silent kid (from memes), or just weirdo. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to change my opinions about getting a girlfriend or being introvert. If you know about something that could help, fell free to comment. If you made it here, thanks for reading about my problem, and I'm sorry for my bad english :)
