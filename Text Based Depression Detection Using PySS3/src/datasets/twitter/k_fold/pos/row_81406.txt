Tik tok weird Hello i downloaded tik tok last week and when they ask what you would like to see i chose comedy and the first says it was ok but after 4 says i saw People thinking it's funny to drive People over because they protest and girls around the age of 12-10 pretending to be raptors you read that right raptors. Then a girls talking about not needing men to reproduce. To flat earthers but all i did was choose comedy which is what i saw to but WTF.
