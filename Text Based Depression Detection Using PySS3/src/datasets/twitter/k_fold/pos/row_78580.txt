Getting treated differently So let me start off by saying I am in no way sexist, racist or any other -ist there is. So before you try to hate on me "I hAvE mAnY BlAcK fRiEnDs".

I saw a post on this subreddit (that you might have seen) about someone not wanting to be treated differently because he is a black man (in his words: " I donâ€™t wanna be a *dangerous* black dude to somebody i never met. I donâ€™t wanna be a *poor, mistreated black dude* to someone either. i just wanna be a dude.").

&amp;#x200B;

I completely agree what he's feeling and how it can be very annoying, however I think that this is simply impossible.

When you meet a tall muscular guy (whatever the color), most people would assume that he's dumb/hotheaded/etc..., because we subconsciously identify and classify people when we meet them, I'm not a neuroscientist but I feel like it's instinctual.

When you meet someone of the opposite gender you (almost) always act different than when it is of the same gender (simp or not), because the social norms and way of thinking is generally different. Only when you start to really know someone can you really start to let go of those classifications and assumptions that you had when you met.

For example, I look a lot older than my actual age (4years older, or so I'm told), and so in the first interactions with people my age they act as if I'm their senior. And I know what you will say, yes it is different than being classified as a thug because you're black, but it's the same principle.

&amp;#x200B;

So being seen as "Just a dude" is almost impossible IMO, not because of racism, not because of sexism, (except for those that actually are racist etc..) but because of our human nature, and the brainwashing the internet, the government, the judiciary system and the media brings upon us. When you see the news, they're always talking about "black criminal rob store etc..." in a more evil light than when it's a white man. So our brain unconsciously classifies them as a "danger".

Then again maybe I'm just overthinking and trying to find a logic in all of this.
