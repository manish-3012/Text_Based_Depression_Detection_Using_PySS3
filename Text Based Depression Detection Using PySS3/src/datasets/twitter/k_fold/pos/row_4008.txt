I don't feel real I feel like a ghost watching my body do stuff. I feel pain, but it's not real and I can ignore it extremely well. Emotions happen, but since I'm not "there," I don't feel the need to act on them... Unless it's suicidal thoughts. But that hasn't happened yet. I still wanna see what this body can take
