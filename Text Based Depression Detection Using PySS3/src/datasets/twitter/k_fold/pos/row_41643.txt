is it normal for parents to be teaching kids at 14 about forex and profit exchange? so my parents were talking about that stuff for about an hour and they said ''and we expect you to be using the knowledge you will get by learning exchange rates and trading once you become 15 and start gaining profit''(im 14 btw) and after that i was just like, ''what the fuck was that all about'' so here i am asking if this is a normal thing
