Just a thought for Suicidal people I donâ€™t know why people think suicide is the answer you have got to take a step back and evaluate what is wrong and why you think suicide is even an option  Youâ€™ve gotta work through your issueâ€™s. Think for a second death is forever you die thatâ€™s it so why waste a 1 in 400 trillion chance that you were even born, you already defined the odds so you can get anywhere in life you want in other word you get out what you put in Just think about how bad your situation is and think there is probably someone out there that has it 10x worseYou can overcome anything if you try had enough but it up to you to decide how your life goes not anyone else. You donâ€™t want suicide to be your what your known for when people think or talk of you. So if your considering suicide please take a moment to think is it really gonna fix you problems....NO
