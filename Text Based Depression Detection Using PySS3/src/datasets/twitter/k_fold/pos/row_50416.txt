Some complete strangers told me to eff off for some reason? So on my walk with my dog two guys (probably around 18-early 20s) drove close to me, slowed down, whipped out a phone, pointed it at me, burped loudly in my direction, and yelled "F-CK YOUUUUUUU" as they floored it?

Wonder what their deal was
