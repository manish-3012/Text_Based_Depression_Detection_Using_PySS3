Police think there could be a child predator at my house So basically an old friend thought itâ€™d be funny to have me act really weird on a group chat with some kids in his class. I made a joke about being a pedophile and they took it seriously it got reported to the police and my friend lied to them about me, accidentally making me seem more sus. Now the police are coming to my house to check thereâ€™s no pedo. Should I tell my parents?
