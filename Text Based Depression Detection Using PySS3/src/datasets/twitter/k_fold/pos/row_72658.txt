Something kinda ridiculous happened... So, this happened round the first week of December. I had no idea what I wanted for Christmas (A part  of one or two ideas). What my family does every year at x-mas, is that we put 3 things in the Xmas list, and Santa brings what he can. So, my two favourite bands are Skillet and Metallica and decided that some merch would be a good idea. I already got a bunch of Skillet things for my b-day, so I'll go with Metallica.

My favourite album is either [Ride the Lightning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeK1E1HaMdY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k4yeBNbCJLDBeqj_QsTlpRoncOxmGLQDo) or [Master of Puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17E-zFb-0aE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lHtcjdo7MU4A3Tt3MuErEdEOOqs4UgngE), but I can't really decide which I prefer. So I just chose MoP. My mum said OK, until she saw the album cover. My lazy ass refuses to describe the cover, so, [here's the link](https://www.google.com/search?q=master+of+puppets+album&amp;rlz=1CALFJO_enES928&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjegoHrrt_tAhXQVsAKHVYyBb0Q_AUoAXoECAQQAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=617&amp;safe=active&amp;ssui=on#imgrc=DVmbv3YfrUtMsM). So, she said that if I don't believe in god, or any religion, I shouldn't wear anything symbolizing it because, it's blasphemy (Or however you write it). So I chose RtL instead. I wasn't angry that I couldn't ask for the Master of Puppets one, just, I found that it was kinda stupid that I couldn't have it because of that reason. But, anyway, Ride the Lightning is cool anyway.
