My bee just died His name was leaf, I donâ€™t know why I named him leaf.. but I did. My mom had found a bee on the ground that seemed injured.. it was a little carpenter bee.  His wing was ripped and two of his legs werenâ€™t working, so he couldnâ€™t survive in the wild. I decided to take him in. I got a big green bowl and put some azaleas and lantanas from my yard along with a sugar water bowl and some socks on the bottom so he could walk with traction, I also put a fuzz ball in there so he could climb on that. He was really active the first few hours, he explored on my arm and wrist, walking about, crawling from arm to arm. I was doing school with him, my cat tried to eat him too. He started getting less active, but still able to grip onto me and walk. I put a water droplet on a lantana and finally watched him drink, I was so relieved. I honestly didnâ€™t expect him to make it though the night but I woke up this morning and he was there! Weak but there, he could still walk, a little wonky. He couldnâ€™t grip onto my finger anymore which made me worry.. I spoon fed him so sugar water this morning and picked him some fresh flowers. For him, he enjoyed that. I left him in his bowl for a while and then came back to give him some water and he was so weak, he was not moving his legs much, his body was slightly curved as bugs do when they die and they shrivel up. I feel a deep pit in my stomach for since he has survived the night my stupid brain mustered up hope that maybe, just maybe he would live a while. I tried to feed him water and I could tell he was trying but he just couldnâ€™t. His legs started twitching, he was responsive but only twitching. No head movements, no tipity taps or stomps, no butt scratching, just twitching as if he were having a bee seizure. I knew deep down he was going to die, but his movement gave me hope. I tried to feed him more sugar water but he just ended up falling onto the spoon since he could not hold. I sat there and watched him twitch until he eventually stopped seizing and turned into a dead-leaf, curled up, lifeless. I then knew he was dead.(I posted pics of him)

He was a leaf, a clumsy leaf. A fallen leaf, a fighter until the very end.
