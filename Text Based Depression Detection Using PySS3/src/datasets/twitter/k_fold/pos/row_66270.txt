in addition to my last post about the cd. in addition to my last post about the cd, I played the cd and found some extremely disturbing material that I cant show for reasons I think you can guess. I found pictures of cheese pizza. im going to go find my registration, or whatever tells me who I bought it from. I have a new phone and everything, so I dont have their contact anymore. when I took the cd out of the player it was all scatched so i took it out and blew on it and rubbed it to try and clean it, so if there were any fingerprints on it, theyre gone now. i dont want to get myself in trouble by reporting it. what if the guy doesnt have cheese pizza anymore, and im left with the cd. i think im just going to break it, or burn it, anyhting to get rid of it.
