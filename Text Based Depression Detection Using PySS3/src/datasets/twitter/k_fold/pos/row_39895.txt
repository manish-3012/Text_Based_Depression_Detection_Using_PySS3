I know why this sub is horny as fuck Puberty is the time where humans shrekshually mature. and it means hormones. 

Humans are animals, right? during mating season, Juvenile animals will do their deed. Humans aint no exception. The thing is, we have no mating season. So we're horny as fuck all the time. 

Maybe if you give a think about it, It'll never go away till you're forty ig. so, maybe, since we're basically juvenile humans, we're just horny. And, since society has laws, lots of people can't do the deed. 

Like, humans would get married at 12-15 back in the middle ages. not acceptable now but think about it. Throw two horny people into a house and you'll get more people. In 9 months. Plus science says the younger you get married the more time there is for reproduction, so more people to make.

And also frick whoever invented horny. You ruined a great, caring and supportive sub with a sense of humor with the dangerous horny disease.
smh.
