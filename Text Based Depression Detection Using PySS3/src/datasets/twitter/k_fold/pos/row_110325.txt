Ugh Iâ€™m stupid. Aight so today or I guess yesterday I was doing a craft project in my basement with a hot glue gun cause I live in a tiny house and thatâ€™s the only available space.  It is now 3 in the morning and I woke up and now canâ€™t get back to sleep cause I think I left the glue gun on even though I remember unplugging it then double checking to make sure it was unplugged before I went to bed.  I donâ€™t know why you needed to know any of that but I felt like sharing cause I cannot sleep.
