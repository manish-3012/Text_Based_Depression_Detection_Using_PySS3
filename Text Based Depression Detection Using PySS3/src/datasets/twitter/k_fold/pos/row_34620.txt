Ozzy Osbourne's song "crazy train" is relateable  

All aboard! Hahaha

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay

Crazy, but that's how it goes  
 Millions of people living as foes  
 Maybe. it's not too late  
 To learn how to love, and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing  
 Life's a bitter shame  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

 I've listened to preachers,  
 I've listened to fools  
 I've watched all the dropouts  
 Who make their own rules  
 One person conditioned to rule and control  
 The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming  
 Driving me insane  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me  
 You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah

Heirs of a cold war,  
 That's what we've become  
 Inheriting troubles,  
 I'm mentally numb  
 Crazy, I just cannot bear  
 I'm living with something that just isn't fair

 Mental wounds not healing  
 Who and what's to blame  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train  
 I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy train
