I can't I live in a world where memes last longer than movements I dont know if that's the right word. I mean when climate change was being talked about most people were saying how they were gonna do their part but now I haven't heard a single noise from it. BUT THE GOD DAMN CHUNGUS MEME HAS LASTED LONGER THAN BLM AND CLIMATE CHANGE TALK. idk another example because I cant think but still.
