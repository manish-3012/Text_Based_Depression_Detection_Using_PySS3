Fucking hate people who try to video call you in the night. Last night a stranger called my number at 1:00 in the night. At first I thought it was genuine maybe someone I knew changed their phone number. I picked it up and he started talking about how he was horny and could use some help. Immediately after that I cut the phone. He kept on calling me probably thinking I was a girl because I had a highish voice and then he started to video call me on whatsapp. I took my phone to my dad and I blocked his number. He kept on trying to video call so my dad blocked the camera and accepted to yell at him. The man was jerking off. It is very wierd and because I don't even remember my own number I know this guy called every single number before mine. It was so disgusting. If you are a creep like that, lurking on this subreddit, pls kindly fuck off.
