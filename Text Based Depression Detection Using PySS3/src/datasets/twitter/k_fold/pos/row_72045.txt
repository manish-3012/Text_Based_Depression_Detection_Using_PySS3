I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs, but I'm afraid that someone else will hear me Okay first of all context. At the start of this year, I liked a girl whose name is... Let's call her Isabelle, and she liked me back, the thing is that she also liked someone else apart from me and the things didn't go... well. Nothing exploded (surprisingly) but after trying to have a relationship with her well she didn't make me feel... happy. It was pretty difficult to talk with her, and after a lot of tries and hope I gave up.

Some months later I start knowing another girl, whose name is literally Isabelle without an L, and now I have a big crush on this "Isabel", she trusts me a lot, we share a lot of things (we have a shared playlist on Spotify and some songs she puts there give me hope) and well she's just nice and doesn't make me feel the same way that Isabelle did.

  
So what's the problem you may ask? Isabelle told me a month ago she STILL has a really big crush on me. And it kinda makes me feel bad? Idk I have faith in "Isabel" and knowing full damn well that I'm not the most optimistic person it's kinda strange? And the thing is if it end ups being mutual the feeling between me and "Isabel"... well... I'm kinda worried for Isabelle, she's a nice girl and I know if in some moment I post something with "Isabel" (obviously if it's mutual, although she has told me I'm not a best friend and knowing the things she has told me are very personal for her who knows) I know that Isabelle won't feel okay with that, not only because they have practically the same name, Isabelle also suffers from depression and that worries me a lot.

I do not know what will happen, the only thing I know is that I gotta have a lot of bad luck of having liked two different girls with practically the same name. 

Ps. And if you noticed, yes that's a FOB reference
