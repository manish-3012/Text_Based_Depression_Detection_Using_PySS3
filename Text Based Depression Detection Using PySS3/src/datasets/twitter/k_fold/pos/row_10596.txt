So, it's kinda late here and I went to the bathroom to use the thing I use for my face to not have acne (I don't really have acne but I use it just in case). And I saw my face in a different way for some reason. It felt more..."mature".

It felt diffent for some reason. Idk, I may be tired and everything I say now is just bs or I may actually be right. It's weird.
