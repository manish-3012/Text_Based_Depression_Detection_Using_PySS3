Day 4 of beautiful lyrics in songs ***Song: Sofia by Clairo***

" I think we could do it if we tried  
If only to say, you're mine  
Sofia, know that you and I  
Shouldn't feel like a crime "

another part of the song that was equally beautiful:

"Baby, you don't got to fight, I'll be here til the end of time  
Wishing that you were mine, pull you in, it's alright "

(p.s: i love this song i cry myself to sleep with this song omg)
