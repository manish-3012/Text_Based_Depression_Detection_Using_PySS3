Hello Fellow Teenagers of reddit. I need your help. So Right now my crush messaged me and said that someone decided to not be her friend anymore. And she said that it was fine for her because it was her fault. I completely disagree because the friend unfriended her for such a lame reason (she unfriended her because she was ignored) 
Should I not have interfered with it or am i in the right?

PSA. I really dont know if this should be posted here or in the r/AITA. And sorry for my spelling im on mobile
