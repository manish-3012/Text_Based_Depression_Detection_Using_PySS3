Snapchat talk A random girl that lives in my city just added me on Snapchat and we started talking. She was say the basics like â€œare you singleâ€ and â€œhow old are youâ€. We were going pretty smooth until she asked for a picture of me. Thatâ€™s when it went down hill. I sent it (Iâ€™m not the best looking person). She saw it and said she had to go to bed cuz her mom was telling her to so I have no idea if that went good cuz that was a first experience for me. Any advice in the comments would be great. Hopefully we can talk tomorrow tho. Iâ€™ll keep everyone updated if you want.
