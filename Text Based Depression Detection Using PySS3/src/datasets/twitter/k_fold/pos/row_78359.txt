Short story from last night So last night my friends and I were FaceTiming for absolutely no reason but then one friend added a boy from her old school so we were all talking and the other friend called the boy an emo for his long hair. And i said oh no donâ€™t play black parade (by mcr) because thatâ€™s like the most emo song. And as I was saying that I was putting in my mcr hoodie and the boy and I both like mcr so thatâ€™s pretty cool.
