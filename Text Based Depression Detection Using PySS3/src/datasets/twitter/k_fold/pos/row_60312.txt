My teacher did an informal poll on whether or not the class would take the vaccine and I was the only one who raised my hand. I honestly don't know what to think. I guess I should provide some context first:

1. International School in SG

2. My classmates aren't "anti-vaccine" in the traditional "American freedom fighter" sense.

3. Singapore is doing very well controlling COVID. One of the highest testing rates in the world, and the only positive cases are people who have entered Singapore from other countries, and they are placed in quarantine facilities (good conditions, don't worry) immediately upon arrival.

I guess I'm more surprised than anything. I was completely taken aback when only I wanted to take a vaccine.

What should I think of this? I'd love to know what you all think.
