dude it is so frustrating to know the rhythm of a song but not the lyrics like iâ€™m tryna remember the name of a song and i remember that it starts with like some soft bass and then thereâ€™s a vocalist and heâ€™s like â€œi didnâ€™t mean... for the rain to come.â€ idk man i just canâ€™t remember this song and itâ€™s gonna bother me for the rest of the day ;(
