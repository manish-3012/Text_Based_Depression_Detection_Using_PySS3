How do I turn on incognito mode? And if your logged in on another device will that one switch to incognito mode too? 

Iâ€™m what youâ€™d call innocent, and Iâ€™m trying to watch p*rn for the first time but my dad is logged into my google account on his phone. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll make his phone go in incognito mode too and he can see what Iâ€™m doing. Help.
