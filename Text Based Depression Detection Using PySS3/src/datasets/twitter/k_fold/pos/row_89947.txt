Ik this won't go big or much won't see it but I need help I'm stuck between a rock and hard place rn.
So I used to really love this girl bed tabitha and she like perfect irl but over texting (which if we were to get together would be a long distance relationship anyways) is not so great at all, she has ADHD which I can deal with but she's toxic and not very nice when it comes to most things which, when it comes to potential relationships, it's not a good thing for me, anyways I'm now looking at this other girl named jordan I believe, she's nice and cute but we just kinda met like last week, if me and her were to get together it would be a lil long distance but not much. I'm stuck because I still have feelings for tabbi and she still is in contact with me, I'm also taking a break from her entirely. I'm usually the one contacting her but I'm done with her rn, she's brought me nothing but pain over a lie. What should I do? Go after her or try something new? I'm at a loss, thank you for reading. I love you all
