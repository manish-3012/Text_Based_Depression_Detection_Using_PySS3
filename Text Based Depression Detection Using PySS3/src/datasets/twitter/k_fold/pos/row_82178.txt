My friend is getting excluded So my friend just got discord and my other friends donâ€™t want to add him to the server because he is â€œnot chillâ€ and â€œthinks heâ€™s the shitâ€ and no one but me wants to stick up for him and if I add him theyâ€™ll kick us both. I know this is just petty drama but his has happened before with our group chat and I seriously donâ€™t know what to do
