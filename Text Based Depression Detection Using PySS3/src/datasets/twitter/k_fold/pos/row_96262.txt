My gf wants to go out all the time but I'm lazy and likes to stay home what do I do (I'm girl she's a girl let's get that out of the way)

Now she wanted yesterday to go out to the movies after we were just at the beach all since the morning, but I told her i prefer staying home and watching a movie on Netflix with her, I just don't like going out all the time, she got mad at me and told me I don't care about her feelings which is not true, I'd like some advice on my situation here
