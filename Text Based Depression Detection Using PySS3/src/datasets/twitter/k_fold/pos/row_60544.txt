I weigh almost 200 pounds.. I am also 5'7 and 13, I pretty fat, my thighs are fantastic! a girl said I have "A size tits, probably" the problem *I'm a male.* Even tho, I barely get insulted, I get really self conscious of it, my dad, is pretty much the only person who constantly mentions it (even tho he is fatter) and I just want to know, is being me okay?
