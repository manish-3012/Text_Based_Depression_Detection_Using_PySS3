I'm in dire need of a laptop, even if it's second-hand :( Hi! I'm Dianne, a 17-year-old student in her last year of high school. I'm from the Philippines in the province of Batangas. 



Last July, my 9-year-old Macbook Air finally took its own life after years of service to me. I insisted my dad that it was still repairable, but he told me that because of its old age and outdatedness(I was only able to update the OS until High Sierra), he convinced me that it may be time to buy a new one. 



"Why not ask your parents for money?" you may ask. My dad lost his driving job due to the pandemic so he's practically earning zero. My mom's employer had to cut down her salary because they were affected by the pandemic too(we're actually glad she didn't entirely lose her job). So to cut it short, we can't afford it right now just when I needed it. 



You may then again ask, "Why not use your phone for your schooling?" I had a very old iPhone 7+ which barely does the bare minimum for me. I would be typing on a doc file for a minute and it would already heat up so bad. My uncle then decided to buy me a new Huawei phone but to make it worse, I CAN'T OPEN ANY GOOGLE APPS ON IT. We use Google Meet, Classroom, Docs, and many more in our online schooling, so I'm in a very tight situation here. 



$400 is going to be more than enough to buy me a decent laptop, even if it's a second-hand. I plan to study Architecture in college next year so I might also need reasonably high specs. 



Given that I'm from the Philippines, even half a dollar from you guys will already be worth so much here :) I can wait until I need to. Thank you in advance for your help!
