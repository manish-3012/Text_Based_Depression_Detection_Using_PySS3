I have a challenge for you all Find me a lil baby song or a song with a lil baby feature. I will try to respond and say if I like it or not. I think my expectations for a song I like is anything better than "Be Something" by polo g and lil baby. 

Now for the rant portion. I don't know why people like lil baby so much. He's the best at nothing and doesn't excel at much. In lots of his features his mic quality is poor, his lyrics are meh. He has some bars sometimes like any other rapper but nothing that I wouldn't expect from anyone. His auto tune throws me off because it isn't clean, and his words slur together a lot so I have no clue what he is saying.

Tell me if you disagree and why.
