I'm about to die from emberrasement. So I was having literature class and the teacher was randomly walking around while talking and grabbed my bicep. Now, eversince the first time I went to the gym, I have made some significant gains, and I have a bad habit of always flexing when someone touches me. Guess what I did. After I flexed the teacher looked at me awkwardly, laughed it off while I was holding my head and fucking dying. The rest of the class started laughing. They also know that I do training, and one of my buddies gave me the nickname "trinyÃ³" (just a reference to tricep). I have egocentric problems, pleases someone save meee.
