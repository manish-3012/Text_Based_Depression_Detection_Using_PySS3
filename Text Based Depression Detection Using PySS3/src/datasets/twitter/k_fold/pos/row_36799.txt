A list of tone indicators to use for talking through text: /j - joke, joking

/lh - lighthearted

now, iâ€™m not saying that anybody has to use these or anything, and most of these arenâ€™t too useful, but it might be nice if people started using them more frequently, just to avoid misunderstandings and stuff. if you are gonna use them at all though, donâ€™t use them in the wrong way on purpose or something.

also iâ€™m gonna log off now cause i have class so i wonâ€™t respond to any comments on this for a while probably.
