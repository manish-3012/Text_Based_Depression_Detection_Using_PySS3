Fun fact of how April fools day started(I think) So if I remember right someone gave this guy a letter and told him to give it to someone, The letter said something like "Pass this fool onto another person" and then that person would give the letter to other people all day until someone told them they had been acting a fool. I thought that was an interesting fact I remembered:)
