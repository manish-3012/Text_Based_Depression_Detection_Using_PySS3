To all you former bullies out there, what made you want to bully other people? I never bullied someone but Iâ€™ve been a victim of bullying since i was a kindergarten and for me I wonâ€™t forgive them what they did to me tho even some teachers are starting to act like one. People think bullying is just a trend, joke, and okay gosh what a disgusting people i think theyâ€™re parents didnâ€™t teach them well some people these days cares about drugs, alcohol and unprotected sex. are they trying to killed theyâ€™re health or people just wanna have fun? i guess thereâ€™s something is going on in this world
