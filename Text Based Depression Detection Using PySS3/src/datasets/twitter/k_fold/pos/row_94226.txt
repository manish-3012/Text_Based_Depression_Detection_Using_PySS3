I'm scared I might lose a friend again... My cat has been sick for the past few days and I'm really scared cause he hasn't ate anything since last saturday and his body temperature's going cold. I'm scared to lose another friend. He's one of the sweetest cats in this household and I can't bare to lose him. We planned on going to the vent but sadly me and my sister have work / school works to deal with and deadlines are getting closer and closer. I just hope he gets better with us making him drink water for his own sake. If he's a goner, his lil bro will be sad. I don't know what to think anymore... I guess I'll update this in maybe 2 or 3 days...? I'm not sure... I hope he gains his strength back...

sorry if its too long-
