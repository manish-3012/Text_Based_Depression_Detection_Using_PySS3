I don't get it, why do some girls try so desperately to now say my name? We were in economy class and our teacher was explain basic stuff about profits and losses and she picked me as an example and said that I have a cherry tree which I sell for 19 dollars a kilo and she sells cherries for 20 dollars a kilo. She than asked a girl what was going to happen and instead of just saying "{my name} is going to get more sales" she pauzed a bit and said "you(the teacher) will get less sales.". And you might be thinking "well it doesn't matter cause its the same message" but the teacher had asked another girl another question and she didn't have a problem with saying my name nor did anyone one else. I am just confused cause I pick these small details up very quickly and speaking from prior experience I know that she doesnt do this with other boys. Just with me.
