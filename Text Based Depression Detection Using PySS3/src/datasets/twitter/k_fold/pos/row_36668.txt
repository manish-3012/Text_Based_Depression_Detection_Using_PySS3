Parental restrictions bypass So I don't know how many of you guys have strict parents, but I kind of do, and they've put parental restriction on all my devices, If any of y'all have the Circle parental restriction thing there's a way to text your friends even after the time limit has been reached, your parents have paused your device, or it is your bedtime. You just use Hangouts by Google. Yep, that's it. I don't know why, but it works. However, you can only text, and calls will not work. 

You can also use a VPN, but that's only if your parents haven't blocked those sites. And even if they haven't, they can still find out. Trust me, I know. My dad came into my room one day and started beating me up lmao cause I had a VPN on (for the good stuff you know.)

Also, I don't know if this works with any other parental restriction things. If it does, let me know!

Hope this helped someone out there!
