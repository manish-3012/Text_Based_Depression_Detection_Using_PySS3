Help Iâ€™m scared! Guys itâ€™s almost 5 a.m. and my parents just discovered Iâ€™m still awake and they said â€œWeâ€™ll talk to you about this tomorrow morning.â€ Now Iâ€™m scared, all I did was study physics and listen to a webinar (thanks to the bad time zone) but they wonâ€™t understand because all they know is â€œtechnology=badâ€, doesnâ€™t matter even if itâ€™s studies. Idk whatâ€™s gonna happen to me tomorrow morning. Wish me luck and goodnight!
