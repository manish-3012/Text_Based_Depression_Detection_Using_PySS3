thoughts on teaching lgbtq history in schools it should be available in middle school thru high school  when kids are finding out who they are and going through puberty, however it should be an elective like band or orchestra. i feel like there should be some direct communication however to the students because some parents donâ€™t want their kids to learn about lgbtq because theyâ€™re either religious or homophobic.
