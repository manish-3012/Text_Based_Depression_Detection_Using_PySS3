Today I learned something disturbing It looks like the age of consent, in my country is 14. What!? How is this okay? In UK it's 16, I think it varies in USA but it probably is about 17. I heard  that the government has planned on changing that but I don't know when. But at least you can't have porn with people under 18, so at least something is good.
