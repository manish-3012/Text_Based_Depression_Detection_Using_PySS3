Ayo my name isnâ€™t Jeremy and Iâ€™m about to fail the fuck outta my Spanish final in like 9 hours. I gotta go to sleep for the next just under 7 hours then do my math class then do my Spanish class. If I fail this test, I fail the entire class. I am not a language person. I excel at STEM, Iâ€™ve always had great grades, but never as good in my language class. 
Also this teacher is supposedly super duper intense compared to the other. Tomorrow decides my fate.
