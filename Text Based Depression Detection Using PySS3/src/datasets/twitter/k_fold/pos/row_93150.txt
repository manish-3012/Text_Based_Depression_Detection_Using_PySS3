Why do I feel like everything I say is stupid I regret everything I say , and I feel like everything I say is dumb and doesnâ€™t make sense , I keep seeing myself as a toddler that doesent know shit 
I feel dumb , for doing things , and for not doing them ,for everything 
I look at people â€œliving the dream â€œ and then I look at myself ....
I know I shouldnâ€™t compare , but I canâ€™t help it 
I see people my age hugging . Something that I would give anything to do 
I see how I kill everything I have , how I ruin my own life 
My dumb ass keeps on asking ppl knowing that I am just losing friends
Now two of my former best friends wonâ€™t talk to me at all 
Even if I try to conversate , they wonâ€™t awnser , I hate this
