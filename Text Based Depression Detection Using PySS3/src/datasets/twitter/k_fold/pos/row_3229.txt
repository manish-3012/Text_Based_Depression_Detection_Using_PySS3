A girl in my class gave me her discord without me even asking Iâ€™ve been crushing on this girl so hard and I was worried I wouldnâ€™t be able to talk to her outside of class because Iâ€™ve been too scared to ask for any socials. Then my teacher puts us in another breakout room together and we just chill and as weâ€™re about to be pulled out she goes â€œhey do you have my discord?â€ And just fucking shoots me her account, Iâ€™m so fucking happy.
