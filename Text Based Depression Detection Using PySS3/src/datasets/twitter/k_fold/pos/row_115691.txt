Please donâ€™t let false rape accusers invalidate real rape victims. 
Women who falsely accuse men of rape are fucking disgusting. Of course they are! But you can hate false accusers *and* rapists. Donâ€™t pretend like men and women donâ€™t get raped just because some people are idiots and lie about it. 


I hate rapists. i think rapists are horrible people, but that doesnâ€™t mean I think all men deserve to get accused of rape. Iâ€™m a feminist, that doesnâ€™t mean I support pieces of shit just because theyâ€™re a woman. I donâ€™t like cardi b, and I donâ€™t like Susan B. Anthony. Because I have the same standards for women that I have for men.



So *please* stop using these victims of false rape accusations to push your anti-feminazi agenda. Why canâ€™t we all support rape victims *and* victims of false accusations?
