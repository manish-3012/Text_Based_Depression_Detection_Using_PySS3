A possible suicide happened when I was going home from school Just to be clear I live in japan and itâ€™s 6:28 as I write this.  I am in a bus and there might be typoâ€™s cause  Iâ€™m shaking 

I was going home from school when my teacher said that there was a äººèº«äº‹æ•…(accident caused by human) happened. It was on a nearby train station and most of our students ride the train.(I ride bus.) normally, äººèº«äº‹æ•…on a train station is someone committing suicide by jumping into a moving train hitting them and dragging them by the wheel.
I donâ€™t know who it is or what they did, but Iâ€™m pretty sure it was suicide. My friend said he saw blood on the rails on the track and an ambulance came along with like 50 police and a Japanese TV station. 
Iâ€™m posting here because teenagers are more likely to commit suicide (cause you know, hormones going crazy, puberty, etc) I simply want to raise awareness. So please, no awards.

Iâ€™ll update you guys as time follows. Bye for now
