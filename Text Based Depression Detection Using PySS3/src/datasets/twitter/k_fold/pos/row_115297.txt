Should I have to pay rent at 17? A bit of background: my parents are making me pay them Â£100 rent every month, and I only earn Â£200 per month. They're also expecting me to pay for my driving lessons and the test, as well as buy and insure my first car with no financial help from them, which will be about Â£2500. I also go back to college in 2 weeks, where I will be spending Â£35 every week to pay for my travel and food. I'm only asking because a bunch of forums online say that it's utter bullshit and I shouldn't have to pay until I'm 18, and none of my friends are paying rent to their parents. Thanks to those who read it.
