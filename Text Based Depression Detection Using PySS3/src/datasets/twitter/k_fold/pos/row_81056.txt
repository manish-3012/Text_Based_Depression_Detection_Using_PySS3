I make my coworkers feel old on purpose I am an EMT so I often work with people who have been in this career for many years. They're usually 23-35ish and I love to point out how much older they are than me. 
My favorite line is saying what grade they were in when I was born. For example a 30 year old was 12 when I was born, so I'd tell them they were finishing middle school when I was born.

Before anyone says anything theyre all cool about it, its just for fun. Its definitely cool being the youngest person in my workplace.
