Need to talk, please read if you want I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever posted here, but I just need to text some things here so someone out there can listen to me and not treat me like Iâ€™m a baby and how Iâ€™m â€œlearning all about lifeâ€ and that â€œthings will get betterâ€. I know itâ€™s all true, but I never found it really helped me.
Iâ€™ve always been a good kid and teenager. I never had mental health issues and and I was really doing fine. In the last recent months so many things have happened that have changed my entire perspective of how I feel day to day. I wanna start with my main area of anxiety, my ex. We had a great fucking relationship for four months and I cared about her and loved her. It was great. She tells me in December she doesnâ€™t really want a relationship at the moment and she wants to be friends still. She gets mad at me every time I try to exit and reach out. And because she left me with so many unanswered questions I canâ€™t go without asking her sometimes. I am an emotional guy and she knows this about me, but it didnâ€™t seem she cared. I know she told me itâ€™s nothing to do with me itâ€™s just the fact she doesnâ€™t want a relationship. Tonight I learn that she never really found me attractive (she did for first two weeks then she felt bad) , she thought I was weird and that I she felt obligated to say she loved me cause she didnâ€™t want me to feel like she didnâ€™t. School has been nothing but added work to the stress and intrusive thoughts I have going through my head all the time. None of my friends or really, family listen to me much because Iâ€™ve never had mental health issues in the past. Thereâ€™s more but I donâ€™t want to type it all out because I donâ€™t really have the motivation to do so. Iâ€™m out of carrots, Iâ€™m out of sticks. I have no idea where to go from here, because for the first time in my life, I donâ€™t see where it gets better, and I want to go to sleep and never wake up. IM NOT SUICIDAL. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live if itâ€™s gonna stay like this.
