We shouldnt be advocating for teenagers to post pictures of themselves in skirts. This is a big website with alot of creeps. Advocating and giving awards to these posts only increases the chance of the pedophiles seeing it. I'm all for body positivity and wearing what you want no matter the gender, however this place is not the place to post it because of the nature of this site. You post on your instagram page? That's ok, only people you know would see it unless you set it to public. Here however any 30 year old man can browse new and see dozens underage boys and girls in skirts.  I'm not trying to tell anyone what to do, I'm just trying to help. 

Stay safe frens


Tldr: Dont advocate or post yourselves in a skirt cause there are pedos here.
