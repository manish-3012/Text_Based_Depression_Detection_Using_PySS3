i came out :)! ok not that anyone remembers but i posted about me being confused about my gender last week a couple of times, and now i think i figured it out!

i realized a few things about myself and what they actually meant (like the fact that my self-esteem issues seemed to disappear whenever i did things considered feminine/when i felt feminina) and came to this realization, wich was weird because for my whole life i never saw myself as anything but cis, but i also didn't see me as anything but straight before i kissed a boy and realized i was bi, so i just have to get used to it.

so yeah, im a trans girl, and i feel really good about. i have already told some close friends who were really cool and supportive about. im still kinda scared about telling other people in my social life because i live in a small town and shit spreads and it would eventually get to my family and i don't want that. im just posting this here because no one here actually knows and you tend to be very supportive with this kinda stuff, and i just wanted to say this because it feels good to say it. ok thanks that's it bye :)
