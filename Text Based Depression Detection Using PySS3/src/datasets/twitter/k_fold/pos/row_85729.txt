My sister broke my fucking 100 dollar wireless PlayStation gold headphones and won't buy me a new pair even though she has the fucking money to do so. She stepped on them and lied to my parents "she didn't break them". BITCH YOU STEPPED ON THEM, HEARD THE CRACK, LOOKED AT ME, AND JUST KINDA WALKED AWAY. But nnooooooo. My parents said that she does not have to buy me a new pair. Excuse me WHAT THE FUCK. These are my best headphones, I used them every day, they are barely functional now, they are hanging by a fucking wire. What the fuck should I even do in the situation. I am saving up for a next-gen console so yes, I could buy a new pair, but I won't because my sister was the one who fucking broke them. They are my only pair of headphones that actually have a functional mic too.

You can see what they looked like on amazon. They could fold and stuff. (I had the legacy gold headset.)
