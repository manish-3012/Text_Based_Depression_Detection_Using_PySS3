I hate my step-mom's side of the family. This all starts back during Christmas, I bought MY DAD a photo frame FOR HIM with my pictures in it. He sent me a picture of the frame with all the pictures in it in the living room(I live at my mom's and can't see him cause of covid). Now here's when the story gets messed up. My mom has access to my step-grandma's facebook page. She has a picture of my dad's living room... With my photo frame in it. My mom zooms in onto the photo frame to see ALL MY PHOTOS EXCEPT A COUPLE WERE REPLACED.

PS: My step-siblings dad asked why I moved and my mom told him why and the day after my dad asked me for dinner tomorrow... I'll update this post if anything happens.
