to all my lovely teenagers, YOU ARE STILL MATURING! whatever you are going through (most things) is not the end of the world. im only 18 (born 2001), but even in my early teens i used to worry about the STUPIDEST. THINGS. especially in gross a$$ high school with all the weirdos. i dropped out in senior year anyway &amp; got my GED anyway so idc lmao past is the past. everyone is always maturing, learning new lessons everyday.
