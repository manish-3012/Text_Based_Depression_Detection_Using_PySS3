I am incredibly salty rn So i found this old ds game in My room, itâ€™s called pokemon conquest. I remember playing it for a little bit but leaving it halfway through the story. A few days ago i decided to Pick it up again. So today i finally got to the point where i felt ready to fight the Final boss. 

So i went in, and this bitch dodged at least 10 attacks. And those attacks had a 70-90% chance of landing. And of the 4 times he attacked me, he got _3 crits._ And the rest of his party members also dodged tons of My attacks. Not to mention the weird stage gimmick that inflicts status on you if you happen to land on like 50% of the Tiles on the map. Also him and one of his party members have moves that inflict knockback, meaning they can knock you onto the tiles that inflict status.

Iâ€™ll bouta die from sodium poisoning i swear to God
