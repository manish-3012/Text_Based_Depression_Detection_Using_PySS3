whats a cheap hobby to pick up? trying to improve my mental health lmao basically i just want to find a nice positive hobby that will help me to relax and cope with life :/// idk what to do tho so pls suggest cool stuff for me to do to help deal with being uber depressed and anxious

hobbies i already have: listening to music, playing guitar, writing, bike rides, drawing

i want to get into something new but idk what to do!! and my mental health sucks and my friends are leaving for college and im staying home for college and im mad depressed and i want to work on improving myself but idk how??? so also any tips on improving mental health would be VERY appreciated

other info about me if that helps: i dont have a gaming system or anything like that, and i cant drive myself anywhere. i can maybe spend a little bit of money on a hobby but not a lot.
