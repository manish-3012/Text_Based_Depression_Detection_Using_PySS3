I punched my bully For context i had previously farted and it smelled horrible and everyone in my class automatically assumed I'd shat myself. Heck even i did, so went to the toilet and went to try poop but nothing came out. I was in for a while and finally pooped. I went in and everyone still thought I'd shat myself. This was back in 2019 spring. 

Fast forward to a few months later and of course the people who bullied me most were there. And one hit me with his bike so i warned him. And not surprisingly he didnt stop so i grabbed his bike and punched him and threw him off his bike. My friend jumped on his back and threw him to the ground. We left after that and id never felt more proud of myself. Needless to say he left me alone after that.
