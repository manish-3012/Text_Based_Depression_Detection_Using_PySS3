I hate talking about college I donâ€™t want to go to college, In my opinion itâ€™s a waste of money to get a degree that doesnâ€™t even assure you a job. Plus, there are lots of successful jobs that donâ€™t require college. 

I just got into an argument with my step grandma. She wants me to go and look into going. I get good grades and do lots outside of school but that doesnâ€™t mean I want to be a lawyer or doctor. I simply just donâ€™t want to waste my time.
