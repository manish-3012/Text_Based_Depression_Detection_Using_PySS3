You know what pisses me off? Creep shots aren't illegal. Honestly I think any form of photography by a stranger without consent should be illegal. But it's not. And it's not freaking ok that sexualized, unconsented images are allowed not only to be taken, but to be posted on the internet for anyone to see. People justify it saying that things like oh, they're fully clothed, but you're still getting off to pictures of people who didn't even want their picture taken, and most likely didn't even know you were taking the picture. It's sick and disgusting, and if you participate in it, you need to stop. Just for those of it who do it and wonder why you don't get dates? It's because it's not cute, it's not flattering, and it's not funny. No one in their right mind thinks that it is. Grow up and get a job. There's no room for you in the real world. Unless you can give up all your creepy habits and start being decent to women, or anyone else you might be taking creep shots of, no decent person will ever respect you, and you'll be hard pressed to find someone to truly love you.
