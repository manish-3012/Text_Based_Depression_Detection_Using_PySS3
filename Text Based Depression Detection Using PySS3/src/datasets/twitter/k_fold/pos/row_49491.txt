A tale about me being stuck in terminal for 3 days, yay Hope you all have currently a wonderful day cause I'm not.  I'm currently stuck in a terminal unable to leave for 3 days and it exhausting. Tho I have a security guard that watches me so that I won't run away (he's a nice guy) but i have to Fucking SLEEP in those cursed chairs for 3 days. And they won't give me a voucher to buy food. It's like the movie terminal with Tom hanks but it isn't fun. So here I am with little money I have about to bear grills this shit but in a terminal. Sorry for my English an for the long post
