A cry for help. Jeez I'm really pushing myself out here. Okay so basically I'm obese for my age. I'm 15 and 295 pounds, at 6'1 I didn't think it really matters but now going up the stairs is hard. I try to lose it but I lose my motivation to keep pushing, I ask ppl around me and they don't provide the support I need. So I thought I could call upon my generation for help. I just wanna know what can I do? Some routines? Anything. I'm in highschool, just starting marching band. I don't need this weight. So if anyone sees this help a fellow in need. With that being said thank you, and have a nice day or night depending on timezones 



TL;DR: I'm fat and need help
