Iâ€™m so frustrated at myself an others I canâ€™t even put into words Iâ€™m stumbling over what to write. Probably because Iâ€™m just stupid. 

I keep comparing myself to others and it fucking. I canâ€™t just ignore those thoughts because Iâ€™ve been comparing myself to others for years and it essentially had an affect on my personality. Imposter syndrome type shit
