The new Pokemon they make are so infuriating and dumb which made pokemon dead to me now Like why tf is there a new Zapdos who is fighting/flying type that's fucking stupid. And the other 2 birds also. Like they just changed their type to something completely random and even tho their names literally are related to the original type they were, but nope these are the same and couldn't just be different Pokemon or something ðŸ˜ª
