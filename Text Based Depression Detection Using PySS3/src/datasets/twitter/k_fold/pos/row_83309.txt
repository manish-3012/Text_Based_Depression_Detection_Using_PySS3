it's ma birthday and i'm in quarantine no really, as an introvert, this is the best thing that could possibly have happened, other than the online school... i don't have to talk to anyone and the only people singing happy birthday is my family! i got sent memes instead of presents from my friends and i'm the happiest i've been in a while :)
