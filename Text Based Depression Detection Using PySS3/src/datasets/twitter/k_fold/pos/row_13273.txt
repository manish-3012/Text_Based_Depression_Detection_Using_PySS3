Time to commit not alive I have no motivation and no one irl to talk to. I crave human touch but the last person I talked to had lead me on for a long while and really fucked with my emotions. I don't have really any irl friends so I look for confirmation and love from those on social media which is very stupid of me. I used to love streaming and editing but now I just really feel like I can't get good content out of it - let alone enjoy it. I am constantly tired and my parents are the literal embodiment of r/insaneparents, so I don't get to go out of town often because they track me and control me. I want to be free. On top of all of this, I want to help out other people (most of my posts are me telling people to vent and me comforting others) yet I can't help myself. Sad boi hours
