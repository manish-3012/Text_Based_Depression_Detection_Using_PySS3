My teacher forced me to changed seats I fucking hate it. Now that I have to sit far right in the corner and I can't see shit on the whiteboard, I'm legally blind and my specs ain't that much of help. Things were perfect when I sat on the middle center table.

It was fucking stupid. The reason I was forced to change seats because I sat next to my friend. BITCH WHAT? I was quiet the whole time during classes, I only talk to my friends during recesses. And this fucking teacher sees this as a problem, so that's why.

And she didn't even change other's seats when they're the ones who are loud as fuck. WHAT THE FUCK
