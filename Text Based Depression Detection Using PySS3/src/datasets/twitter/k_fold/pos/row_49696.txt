Help, I want to go to online shcool, but my parents won't let me I have to go to in-person school, I absolutely hate it and I'm worried about getting Coronavirus, I kept asking my parents to let me switch to online and I've brought up these topics, but they won't listen to me.  Is there some legal service I can call or something else I can do that will resolve this quickly?
