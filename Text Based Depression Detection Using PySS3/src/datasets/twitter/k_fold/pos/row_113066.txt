For the first time in forever, Iâ€™m bored My brother, his girlfriend, her dog(chorkie), and his dog(German shepherd Labrador) moved in a month ago. And today they moved up to Illinois to live with her parents. Itâ€™s been so hectic because I have two dogs of my own who didnâ€™t get along with their dogs. So now itâ€™s, just empty and boring. Before they got here, I played my PS4 and occasionally Xbox. But my brothers dog broke my ps4 which is what all my friends play. Iâ€™ll miss them, but I canâ€™t be sad their gone, just gross they were here. I just had to get that it off my chest
