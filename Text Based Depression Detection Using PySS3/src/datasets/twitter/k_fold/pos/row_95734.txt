It annoys me Just because I screamed for a sec due to a big spider on my shoulder, doesn't mean I have arachnophobia. Having a phobia means having an irrational fear and I'm pretty sure shouting at 5 inch wide spider is very rational. If I did have arachnophobia I would've had a panic attack, chest pains, nausea etc. Clowns are creepy but that also doesn't mean I have coulrophobia. Most people just say they have a phobia to make themselves more interesting when in reality they just find those stuff mildly scary and uncomfortable to look at. People just butcher the word.
