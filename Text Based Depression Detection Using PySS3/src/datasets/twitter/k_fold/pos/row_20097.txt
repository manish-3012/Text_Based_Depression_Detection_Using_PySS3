I feel terrible Like I feel unclean even though I just had a shower. I have too much hair and its all over my face but I donâ€™t want to put it up because then it will just become all tangled. Iâ€™m sick of just sitting in bed in my phone but Iâ€™m too tired to do anything else. Why am I always so tired? :(
