How do I understand what she feels about me? I had a crush on a girl for 2 years. We were good friends, then we stopped talking much for like half year. After that, when we just started talking again, I told her about my feelings (a stupid thing to do in that situation). I've got rejected, but we remained friends with her. All of those "signs" people on youtube said, the body language, it all was nothing. After rejection, I still can see all those signs and feel like she might be feeling something towards me. Am I just being blind once again and there is probably nothing between us, or there could be something and I just picked the wrong moment?
TL;DR: My crush rejected me but I still feel like there's something between us

To be honest, I think the story is a bit too long to describe it here since I didn't write everything that happened, so if you have any questions, you may ask.
