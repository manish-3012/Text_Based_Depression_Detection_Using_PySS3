I'm having trouble keeping up with homework and other things. It's currently 914 at night for me, I have a ton of homework but am insanely tired. I need to do the work, but like I said I'm tired. I could try to push on and do the work, or maybe sleep hope to wake up in the middle of the night and do it, I don't know.

I have another problem I joined speech and Debate, we're doing it virtually I found out at like 12:30 that the speech was due today. I had no idea, in our meeting last Thursday I mis heard I thought I had a week not a weekend. I hurried and tried to get that done, but failed and that's what took all day, I have another meeting tomorrow morning I'm gonna have to tell my coach. Also, I'm not sure I even want to do speech and debate especially this year when it's so confusing, I'm the only boy on the team. I've been swamped with work since the beginning of school.

I think I'm gonna try to get some work done and see how I feel, but my back hurts I can't stay focused. I needed to say something, I'm glad this sub exists.
