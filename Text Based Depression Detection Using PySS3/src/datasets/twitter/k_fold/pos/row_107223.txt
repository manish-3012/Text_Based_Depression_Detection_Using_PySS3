I lost my best friends Two of them they lied to me 
They are now in a different class than me now weâ€™re in high school but normally at lunch and break weâ€™d talk together but there was a rumour he likes a girl and he did 
He didnâ€™t tell me when I asked him 
They were in a relationship 
He didnâ€™t tell me when I asked him 
Apparently he cheated on her 
He didnâ€™t tell me when I asked him 
When I asked every time he denied he acted oblivious and I couldnâ€™t take it anymore maybe Iâ€™m the douchebag I dunno but I feel like I canâ€™t take it anymore 
And my other friend was acting oblivious too 
The only way I found out was from a note that his girlfriend gave me when I asked her about it ( me and his girlfriend are friends)
And he still denied it 

They both lied to me and I needed up leaving our group chat when I came home from school and blocking them 
Can you tell me if I was in the wrong or if I was right to do that
