I wanna say I do have it bad but I wanna know if Iâ€™m â€œentitledâ€ in a sense Iâ€™ve been struggling for the past 3 years debating whether or not I actually have it bad, when I first had the worst thing in my life happen to me being the NWMS school shooting and NHS bomb threat my life started going down hill. Iâ€™ve had constant arguments with family and recently my parents got divorced and Iâ€™ve been left with the my mom who constantly complains about everything and yells at me and my other sibling. And then I look on the fact that she supplies me a bed and home and sometimes food but sheâ€™s absent on everything else in my life. She yells at me and just verbally assaults me and my sister when we do something remotely wrong and on top of that sometimes our grandma has to buy us food because my mom doesnâ€™t go to the grocery. So I wanted to ask all of you if Iâ€™m really entitled or Iâ€™m batshit crazy even giving my life the benefit of the doubt and saying Iâ€™m entitled
