Joking about suicide is not funny. If you aren't having suicidal thoughts dont fucking say that you want to die because this is why suicide is so unexpected Because of people constantly talking about it like it's nothing and then everyone else thinks that it's always just a joke and that they arent serious. 

I understand it is a coping mechanism for some, but for those some we need to be able to talk to them about it and them seriously so they can get better instead of being ignored and eventually turning to the worst thing.
