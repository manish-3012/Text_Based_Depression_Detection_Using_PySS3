A question for you all. Well o got 50-60 marks iny 9 grade SA-1 and my teachers and everyone's saying it's shit to me. Well i did get higher masks before but still you get my point. 

Well I'm asking this cause I've been hella sad and pretty much cried to sleep. 

So am i just an idiot or its just my parents are shit. And i kinda gave up on life too. 

So, just be straightforward and don't try to sugarcoat anything. 




Thanks.
