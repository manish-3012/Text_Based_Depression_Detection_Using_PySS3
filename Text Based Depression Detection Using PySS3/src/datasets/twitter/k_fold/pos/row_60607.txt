What do you guys think of my 2 poems? Do the scars really mean any less when you forget why they are there?

Do the feelings ever go away when i wish hard enough?

No, and it was never fair.

No, and they seem to like it rough.

Does the soul ever heal from the holes I made in it?

Will my demons ever rest when it done?

I Don't Know.
I Don't Know.

Why do i like to play doctor for five minuets?
Why cant i cut it out and finally heal?

The floors stained now pinot.
hope it doesn't anneal.

fuck this poem shit, its all just pain. My voice, my thoughts, my skin.
Get it over with and throw me away in the bin
I burn with a grin.



Cant you see its all a waste? 
Cant you see its all all in vein?

Its got a foul taste.
And hurts me against my chains.

Why oh why was i locked and made to bleed.
why oh why must i die alittle be to free.

head spinning and spinning, all i can do is reread.
fiending for some LSD.

please let me belong again.
hopelessly falling through this domain.
