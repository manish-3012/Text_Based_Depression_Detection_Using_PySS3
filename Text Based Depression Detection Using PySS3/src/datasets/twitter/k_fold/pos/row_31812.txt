Guy, please, I beg your pardon. Please ignore my last post that shows me making a very horrific comment on the r/insaneparents subreddit. It was wrong, EXTREMELY bad, and I do not want it to affect my relationship with you guys on here.

This is a very beautiful subreddit, as a matter of fact, damn it, itâ€™s the BEST subreddit on Reddit!

And I am not about to sabotage my relationship with this subreddit by letting that one comment taint my history with yâ€™all!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you!!!!!
