The school nerd As a Nerd I  really dont give a shit bout Marks or Learning and when I do get a 28 or 29 out thirty you may see me sad or disappointed. It may seem like a douche move but it you know the behind the scene you'll agree with me. Ima get whooped man I am in a middle eastern household and this 1 or 2 Marks really get me whooped so that's the reason and I really hope you dont bully or make fun of other nerds, we are really like you but under different circumstances. 

P.s. Lol I really need to go study before I get whooped.
