Do you guys like your weight? So like Iâ€™m 5â€™8 and Iâ€™m 165. There was this girl who I went to school with and she was 5â€™7.5 and she was like 120. And like she was super skinny and Iâ€™m not like overly fat, Iâ€™m just average. The lowest weight I ever was was 119 because I starved myself during wrestling. I look back at all of those pictures and I looked so skinny. To think that this girl was .5 inches shorter than me and 25 pounds lighter just really gets to me. Iâ€™m tired of being fat.
