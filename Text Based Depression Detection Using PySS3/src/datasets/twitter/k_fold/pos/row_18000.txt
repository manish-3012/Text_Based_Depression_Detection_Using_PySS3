my two favourite subreddits got taken down I remember being bored and fed up with the usual cancer content of reddit, then I decided to lurk in the r/shortcells sub. I'm not an incel or anything like that but some posts there were comedy gold. Then shortcells got taken down and I moved on to lurk in r/celmates, shortly after it got taken down as well. 
can anyone show me a good comedy subreddit?
