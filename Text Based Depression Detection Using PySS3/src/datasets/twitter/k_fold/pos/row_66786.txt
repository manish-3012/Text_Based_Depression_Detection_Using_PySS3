I just discovered a community on youtube of kids acting out stuff with sonic plushies. I don't know what to say honestly.

It's great that they're trying out making videos and films, but at the same time I can't bear to watch them as the acting is pretty cringy (what do you expect tho? They're kids.) although that's kind of what makes it alluring. It's like watching something that's so bad, it's good.
