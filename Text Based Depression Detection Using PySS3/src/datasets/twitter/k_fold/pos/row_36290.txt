My grandma has COVID 19, Pneumonia, and horrible Asthma. And Iâ€™m completely lost My grandma is practically a saint, sheâ€™s never told a lie to me or my family, she always keeps her word on EVERYTHING, sheâ€™s the biggest Christian I know, sheâ€™s pretty much perfect.
So, around March or April, my grandma was diagnosed with cancer. They never told me which cancer, my family just said it wasnâ€™t a serious cancer (which doesnâ€™t matter cause sheâ€™s almost 70 any cancer could pretty much kill her at this point) so after that everything was okay she went to her chemotherapyâ€™s and all that. So it was pretty much smooth sailing, until last night. Last night my mom called my downstairs to tell me that my grandma caught pneumonia, so at that point everythingâ€™s already falling apart. Asthma alone as an old person is horrible, let alone Asthma AND cancer, so I cried for a lil in my room and then went to sleep. My mom called me downstairs AGAIN 30 mins ago, just to find out my grandma AND grandpa caught COVID, both of them are 70. I havenâ€™t been told anything since, Iâ€™ll keep you updated
