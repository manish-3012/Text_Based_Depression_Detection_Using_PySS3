Hi, lonely and about to go to sleep, anyone want to be my bf/gf/nbf 17, M, bi, Pisces if you care, 6'1" I think, brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, messy hair, skinny, weak, and pretty unattractive, though not too bad. My name is Milo.

I like MTG and animated shows, especially gay ones, currently obsessing over The Owl House, but also a big fan of Infinity Train, She-Ra, and JoJo's. I have a shit sense of humor that mostly involves saying shit that isn't funny. I like talking about video games, but I don't play them very much. I spend most of my day browsing reddit, twitter, and youtube or reading fanfiction. I'm kind of an asshole and really bad at small talk. Like, REALLY bad. 

I would prefer if you shared at least some interests with me.

There's basically no reason to like me, but if you do, DM me and I'll message you in the morning. I would prefer for DMs to be in a format similar to this, with description of appearance (or selfie if you feel comfortable with it), and any interests, not just those overlapping with what I've listen here. 

Also, like, I'd totally be fine with you responding just to be a friend. I need more friends with overlapping interests with me.
