This isn't allowed on r/amitheasshole so im putting it here Me and my girlfriend were having a discussion and somehow it turned into us talking about abortion. I told her that if she was raped, and got pregnant, then I would still want her to have that child and let me and her raise that baby as our own (BC even if its not blood related I would still treat that child like its mine). 

Its the same with if I were to adopt a child, which she is totally for. I would raise that child like it was my own blood, no matter how it came into this world. 

Her reasoning (to my understanding) is that she wouldn't want to remember being raped, everytime she looked at that child. I say that's bs. My mother had me at 17 to an unknown man. She doesn't know who my father is out of a few men. Regardless of the fact that she was a stupid teenager, she doesn't think if all of her past mistakes when she looks at me, and about all the bad guys she was with. I want to give my child, yes my child because if I am the one that is raising that child and taking care of it on my own accord, then that is my child, the beast freaking life possible, just like I would if that child was mine. 

If I were to be raped (BC big surprise guys get raped too) and the person who raped me had a kid, I would fight for custody over that child like they were the last thing on earth that I could ever love. I'm honesty curious to see weather or not my girlfriend would dump me for me wanting to have that child.
