How do you look at heavy makeup? What do you consider one? This is a genuine question to anyone with attraction to girls! Lately I heard my friends say that they do not like the darker alt styles due to the heavy makeup that is present (eyeliner, bold lips). I understand it, but do you realize a lot of people outside alt or even on the softer, cuter side of alt wear heavy makeup? I am into a mix of grunge, goth and more softer, harajuku stuff and I, honestly, felt rlly rlly hurt by what they said. 

So how about you, what do you see as heavy makeup, do you prefer girls with no makeup or heavy, but "Normal"? And not even girls, even alt boys, how do you feel about them? Do certain people find alt ugly or are those people just scared because it isn't a norm? Please let me know your opinions but keep it respectful! All opinions count!
