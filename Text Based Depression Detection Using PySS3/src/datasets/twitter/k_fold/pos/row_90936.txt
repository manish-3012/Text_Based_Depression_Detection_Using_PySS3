I'd like to wish goodluck to everyone who (like me) is getting their Leaving Cert results today. Today is the big day, the day of our nightmares, the day we wish for, but dread simultaneously.

I'd like to remind everyone, no matter your grade, class rank, or overall points, it's not a reflection of who *you* are as a person, nor is it make or break in regards to your future. No matter your chosen CAO course, apprenticeship or any other formal education, the results of today bears no impact on your ability to persue the aforementioned education paths.

You may log on at 9am and be dissapointed, or you may log on and be enthused, but if you distegard every other word in this post, remember these; *today's result doesn't reflect on you as a person or how your teacher remembers you* 

Despite not wanting to rank students, and grade them on things we mistook as irrelevant, they had to. So whether you come out with a H1 or an O7, the teacher will remember your participation, your cooperation and your respective attitudes, for better or worse. 
The teacher will remember who you are as a person, and hold that to a higher esteem than your "calculated" grade. 

Don't be disheartened by what you see today, there is *always* another path. Whether you get your 1st, 5th or even 20th course, there is ALWAYS another way in. I read a post from a user who had recieved 298 points, and they took a course (akin to BIFE I believe), and after which they got into (presumably) their prior first choice which was nearly an ADDITIONAL 200 points above their LC points. 
So whether you're 2 or 200 points away from your desired course, just remember you CAN achieve it, you CAN succeed, and you CAN be successful. 
All you need is the motivation and will to succeed.


Goodluck to everyone, I wish you all future prosperity, and every subsequent sucess possible.
