Making a Diary like thing on Reddit Day 230 So... It is that date again. Not too great, but suprisingly, i have really not heard anything about it. People dont Seem to care a Lot anymore. I didn't really think about it alot either. Idk, weren't even talked about in school. But one thing i did notice at school was that there were this girl who got a new jacket. This jacket is pissing me off so much, because it is so god damn shiny and is so hard to ignore. There is also that she is wearing it during class, and because of the material, it makes so much fucking noise any time she moves. So that is just great. 

Anyways, i had a Lot of a single teacher today. 4 out of 6 hours to ve exact. He is a fine teacher, but he can be really exhausting. I am not a big fan of his way of teaching. I dont learn a Lot by it. He talks a Lot, but he never really shows what he says in any way. But that is fine, as Long as i can understand the basics.

See ya tomorrow.
