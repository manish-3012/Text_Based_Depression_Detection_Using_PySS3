So you know AC Valhalla? Iâ€™m pretty sure Eivor is a closeted transgender male At first I thought the whole â€œanimus detecting two memory streamsâ€ was just an in-universe excuse to let the player choose Eivorâ€™s gender. But after playing for a while, Iâ€™ve noticed that whenever characters use pronouns when talking about Eivor, they use she/her pronouns, even though I play as male Eivor. Also, Eivor is a female-gendered name as well. So, perhaps the animus detects two memory streams because one is for Eivorâ€™s physical appearance, and one is because of his gender dysphoria? And as far as I played into the game (and as far as I remember from what Iâ€™ve played), itâ€™s never brought up once by the characters, which is unfortunate for Eivor, but I feel is an improvement for modern day entertainment, because instead of shoving â€œhey look, this character is transgender!â€ in our faces, Ubisoft Anvil just letâ€™s them be transgender, if closeted. Which I believe is more progressive, as it makes the fact they are transgender look normal like it should be, and not a spectacle that is to be milked all itâ€™s worth for representation points. Itâ€™s also being realistic for the time period Valhalla is set in.
