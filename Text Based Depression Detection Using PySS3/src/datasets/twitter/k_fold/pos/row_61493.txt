how to convince my mom to leave me the house for the weekend so i live with my two parents and my brother. we own a cottage and go there every weekend but i have homework and wanna stay at my house. my dad and brother are going to the cottage but my mom want to stay at the house with me. i want to be able to spend my weekend alone (iâ€™ve already done it multiple times) but donâ€™t want her to know that i want to be alone cause sheâ€™ll be suspicious. so what should i say to subtly convince her to go to the cottage with my brother and father?
