Iâ€™m nonbinary and I just want to be able to tell someone, so hereâ€™s to this getting lost in the mess of this sub So hey, if your reading this, Iâ€™m nonbinary and..

But, Iâ€™ll never be able to come out or use different pronouns unless I want to be disowned, so, telling whoever happens to see here is good enough for now :)
