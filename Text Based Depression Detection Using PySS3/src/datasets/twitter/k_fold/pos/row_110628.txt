I want to build a pc for a relatively cheap price but I have no clue what to look for. This might not be the place for this but I might as well post this here. As the title states, I want to build a cheap pc so I can play games that aren't on console but I have little to no experience with the hardware of computers. My main questions are, what parts are the best for the price, how long would it take to build, and is there a helpful tutorial that I can use to help me. Any feedback would be great because I just want a pc that isn't too crappy.
