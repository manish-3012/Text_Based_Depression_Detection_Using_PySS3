Iâ€™m scared and I canâ€™t sleep Itâ€™s 2:42 AM rn. I promised myself that I would start going to bed earlier, cause Iâ€™m only 13. But, I canâ€™t sleep. There is a really really big storm outside. Iâ€™m not afraid of storms, itâ€™s just that itâ€™s literally shaking my house. It sounded like the garbage men were outside and I was like what itâ€™s 2am but then I looked outside and I saw lightning and lots of rain. I keep hearing big thunder claps and the lighting is not that far away. I can even hear the wind inside my room. Itâ€™s really scary. Idek why. Iâ€™m still a kid, but Iâ€™ve never had this issue before. Iâ€™ve had a bunch of anxiety lately, which is prob the reason why but idk.

Today, I logged into my old discord account. I was with my best friend Lucy and we were in my room. I realized that my friend Ruby still used her discord server and that it was still active. 

Some background knowledge, me and Ruby have been friend since kindergarten. I met Lucy in 5th grade. Me and Lucy didnâ€™t get along at first, as she was more outgoing and â€œgirlyâ€ then me and  Ruby who are both introverts, so me and ruby paid no mind to her. In 6th grade we started middle school. Ruby and I had no classes together where as me and Lucy had about 6 out of 10 classes together. As they say, opposites attract. Even today, me and Lucy have nothing in common but we are still friends. She is outgoing, and talkative and has a good personality, where as I... donâ€™t. Me ruby and Lucy all were best friends in the middle of 6th grade through the beginning of 7th grade. After that, Ruby and I still ate lunch together, but we didnâ€™t hang out as much as I was always with Lucy. Me and Ruby used to play video games together, but I donâ€™t play the same games as her anymore. So me and Ruby still text sometimes and see each other sometimes because our moms are friends, but we arenâ€™t as close as we were.

Back on topic, on Rubyâ€™s discord server, I was snooping and reading the chats, when me and Lucy came up. Ruby was saying how she doesnâ€™t understand how I can move on so quickly from her to Lucy and how she is so happy that she has Even and Liz as her new best friends. Even, though used to be known as Zoe, I have known since 2nd grade. He and I stopped talking in middle school though. Liz I met in 6th grade. She and Ruby both have a crush on each other but they donâ€™t want to be in a relationship yet. I thought that Ruby still thought of me and her as friends but idk anymore. I donâ€™t feel bad though because I honestly like Lucy more then Ruby but I still like Ruby. Lucy feels really bad about it, though. Lucy has some issues and she also has depression so Iâ€™m afraid she will cut herself again. Maybe. There was just a big thunder clap omg lol

Sorry for the rant... it kinda got out of hand.
