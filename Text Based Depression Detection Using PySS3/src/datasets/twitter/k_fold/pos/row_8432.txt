So I had a good day I was able to get my Rubikâ€™s cube solve down to 28.99 seconds

Iâ€™ve been getting kind of excited and accepting that I may be trans

Funding was approved to help my town, which is pretty awesome

I got Red Robin for dinner

Just some smol things but they matter to me.
So yeah Iâ€™m happy, and I really hope you guys have/had a good day too :)
