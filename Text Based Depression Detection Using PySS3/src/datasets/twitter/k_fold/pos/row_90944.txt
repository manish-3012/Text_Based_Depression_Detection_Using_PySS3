The N-Word is only offensive depending of how you use it So I'm a 16 year old Mexican boy (I say this so that yall dont say I am an 11 year old white boy). I don't know if im the only one that thinks this but saying the n-word is offensive depending on how you use it, for example, if you are angry at anyone an you call them a N-word, that is extremely offensive and that person should get punished, but if a person just goes to his friend and says something like hey, wassup my \[n-word\], that wouldnt be so bad because its just a friendly person saying hello to another person. I could totally be wrong and I'm open for people to correct me, I'm not one of those people that argue to win, I argue to understand. so anyways, tell me what you think because i want to see what other people think :)  
note: i didnt say the actual n-word, not because I think its offensive but because some people can get offended because they dont have the same opinion as me so im just going to avoid that type of confrontation
