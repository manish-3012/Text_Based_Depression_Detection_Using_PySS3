Ranting about something &amp; myself 2nd Post in this subreddit, I'm gonna rant about something, I'll be surprised if anyone sees this.

I'm a 13 yr old boy &amp; I feel like I made so much drama because myself. I think im insecure &amp; I have a lot of Anxiety &amp; low-salt esteem &amp; confidence &amp; possibly depressed. Here's the story.

I was walking my dog on the sidewalk next to a house &amp; I saw a car pass by &amp; the car was coincidentally enough, their house. My dog finished pooping and peeing and as I saw going back to my house. A woman in the car. Got out told me to go pick up the poop. However, it wasn't even my my dog's poop. If was someone's else's dogs poop. She told me. "Hey you forgot to pick up your dogs poop, I do not wanna see your dog on my lawn ever again." And in my head I knew it wasnt my dog's poop because I picked up my dog's poop before. My dogs poop was on rocks not grass. But since I'm so disordered with myself. I accepted it &amp; picked it up even though it wasnt mine because I'm timid, Aniexty, low self-confidence, overweight, &amp; insecure. The poop was hard &amp; dry and they said. "Thank you" and then I said "Sorry" I knew in my head it wasnt my fault. In every way she said something I knew it was mad &amp; annoyed. I got framed for something I took it as if I really did it. I went back to my house &amp; I felt so sick, dumb, &amp; hatred for myself for not standing up for myself. Then my dad heard all of it. I went inside &amp; my mom asked me what happened. I explained to her and she got really mad &amp; scolded me &amp; started calling the woman, curse words. I felt like I could have stopped it if I was more confident in myself. I stared to cry &amp; realize the situation &amp; I didnt want to start or be in this situation. I then started to ball up all of the problems &amp; mistakes about myself. I'm over-weight, insecure, I have anxiety, I have low self-esteem &amp; confidence, &amp; social skills. I then buried my self in my blanket to think about it. I really hate myself.  

That's the story, thank you if you see this, whether you care or not about this. I just wanted to vent to something. 


TL;DR I Picked up someone else's poop that wasnt mine &amp; Got in big trouble.
