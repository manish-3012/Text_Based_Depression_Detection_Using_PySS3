Hey there! I made a new subreddit for everyone of you who's bored  It's [r/TheStrangersGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheStrangersGame/). It's a subreddit to play my game with the same name directly on Reddit. Here's some quick things how it works:

People  can post and make their own fictional characters by putting the name,  age, gender and location into the title. Then, others can ask these  fictional characters whatever question they want and OP has to answer -  impersonating their created person. You can freely post or comment or  simply do both.

Have fun with it!  (I hope I get some people to play, it would be embarrassing if I created  this subreddit and nobody plays this lmao)

(Btw, have a nice day and stay hydrated, guys, gals and non-binary pals)
