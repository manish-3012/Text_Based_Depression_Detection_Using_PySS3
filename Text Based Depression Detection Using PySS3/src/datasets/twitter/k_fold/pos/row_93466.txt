Addition to my last post that I forgot to add Potential tw for some!

Made a rant post about how some adults in my life are trying to bring me down and shit, this is another rant. 

I fucking hate it when adults tell teenagers that its "gonna get much harder" or "these are the easy years" or "you'll regret wanting to grow up" like we glorify the fuck out of the teenage years so much that people be thinking somethings wrong with them cause their lives aren't playing out like a movie. 

Does it get harder? yeah, in a sense it does, because we are given a lot more responsibility. But it doesn't have to be miserable. Like what a stupid thing to tell a highly suicidal and depressed demographic that its only gonna get worse. 

Btw, it fucking doesn't! I can tell you that me graduating, attending college and working, I'm at the happiest I've ever been. Its hard, its exhausting, and yes the depression still is there. But I'm no longer craving death at my every hour. 

It gets high and low, you get happiness and sadness, you will get your heart broken and fall in love. Its what life is! I hate these damn people who keep feeding this idea that your time for happiness is running out and its only gonna get worse.
