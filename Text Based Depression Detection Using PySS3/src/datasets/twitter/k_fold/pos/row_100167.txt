Going to Rickroll my Class So it was dismissal and there were around 5 people left and I had a water bottle with a rickroll QR code. Then I thought we could put the rickroll link under homework so the rest of us did it (with the permission of our teacher) The plan is to tell our DL+ (We are on IPads)teacher that our home room teacher wanted us to watch it. I am very excited and I hope it works!
