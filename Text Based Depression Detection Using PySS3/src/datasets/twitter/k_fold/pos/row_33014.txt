How to suppress feelings? So basically, for the first time in a while I've developed feelings. However, I don't want it to be that way. In my opinion, I have too many problems on a personal level to even consider getting together with someone (plus I'm an unattractive nerd so it's just a useless endeavor either way). So I ask this: how do I get rid of feelings before it goes too far?
