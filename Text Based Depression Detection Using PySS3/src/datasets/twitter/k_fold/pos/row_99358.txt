Eminem these days and gangs made from the passion of a type of music I am a pretty big fan of Em and I like 90% of his songs. I m 16 and I heard stories from dad who said that music bounds people and he remembers afternoons with the 'gang' drinking a beer and listening to their favourite gendre of music. I never seen such things these days, so, I wondered, have u seen one? Also, do u like Eminem?
