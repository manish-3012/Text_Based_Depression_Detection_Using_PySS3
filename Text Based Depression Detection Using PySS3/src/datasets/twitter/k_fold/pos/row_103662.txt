(TW// weight) is gaining 30 lbs in a year normal?? hey. im a 15 year old girl, (im 5 foot 5 inches) and last year i think i was around 100 pounds, but i might have been closer to 110-115. either way, now im around 131. i dont necessarily look plus sized, but u can tell ive gained weight in my stomach, thighs, arms. i have stretch marks on my chest and thighs. this year with the pandemic, i havent been eating healthy at all, but ive also not done any sports or excercise. i used to have theatre 2 times a week, where i did conditioning, dance, excercise, etc. and during soccer season, i also used to have practice 2 times a week, and 1 game a week. so i was pretty fit and didnt really need to eat super healthy or do additional workouts. im scared of what will happen if i gain more weight, but i also cant find motivation to eat healthy and workout. this pandemic sucks
