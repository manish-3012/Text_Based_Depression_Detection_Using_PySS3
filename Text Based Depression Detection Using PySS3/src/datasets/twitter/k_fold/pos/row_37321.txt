My dad Said that i'm Putting makeup as a joke and i'm offended (Male) so i decided to try makeup i found It really beautiful, before this i did Put some nail polish and he got angry that i did and said i'm a man so i need to so i need to do "Manly things", i decided Not to Tell him anyway my mom brought It Up in an Argument to calm Things down he Just laughed It Off and didn't Bring It Up again until today we were at a small family gathering and i Saw some cousins that i didn't See in a Long Time i was really Close to one and we considered us like brothers. My dad brought Up me Putting makeup as a subject It didn't go far and everyone stopped talking for a moment i was angry but brushed It off since my cousin was Here we didn't mention It again but i was offended . What do i do
