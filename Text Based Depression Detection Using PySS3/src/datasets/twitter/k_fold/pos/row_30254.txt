When Mars is colonised, it will have it's own new Martian government, a chance to start anew. There are so many possibilities for laws we can make for the new Mars government


We could outlaw twitter on Mars, to keep that cesspit away


We could make taco Tuesday a planetary holiday


We could have a completely reformed school system structure so it isn't as screwed as the current ones


The possibilities are endless, guys and gals, welcome to the freaking future.
