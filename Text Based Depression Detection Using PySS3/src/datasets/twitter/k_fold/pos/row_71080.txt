Song Requests Lately, I feel as if I am getting nowhere. Whether that be in school, conversations, or music, it all feels the same. I figured maybe if I start doing something different with my music, I might be able to get out of that proverbial rut. I play acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and banjo. If someone wouldn't mind leaving some song requests, I'd be pretty grateful. I may record a cover and post it, if I like the song enough.
