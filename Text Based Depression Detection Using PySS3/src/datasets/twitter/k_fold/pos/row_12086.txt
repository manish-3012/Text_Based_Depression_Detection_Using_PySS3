I am 6 weeks straight doing pushups 6 weeks ago I started doing pushups, when I started I could barely do 5 at a time. 5 was like the absolute maximum. 4 weeks ago, I made a post asking why I was able to do 13 pushups so quickly, it was so unusual. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today marks the start of week 6 of doing pushups. Here are my statistics:

&amp;#x200B;

Average pushups in a row - 30

Max pushups in a row - 40

Most pushups done in 2 minutes - 60

Most pushups done in 1 day - 155 (over a 6 minute period, 5 minute break every 2 minutes)
