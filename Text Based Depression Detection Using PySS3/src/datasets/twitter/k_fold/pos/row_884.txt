Bruh why does sexism exist Why are males not "allowed" to hug but when girls do it it's okay. Like every time two men hug my brain just thinks "there's something between them". Is there any way to make myself normal because it's really bothering me and I don't want to be sexist or stereotypical. I'm a girl by the way.
