How do I get over someone I need help Idk how to get over her like ik there's plenty of fish in the sea girls way hotter then her and shit but there's only one her. She's real special to me cuz of certain things she did for me she truly is my hero and was a true role model to me and did things for me no one else did but she's rude and toxic now and a lot of stuff happened between us and as much as it stings knowing we'll never get to make up and I'll never get answers from her but I need to move on. 

I gave her my all but she pushed me away and hurt me so there's nothing I can do but everything reminds me of her. Every time I get on my laptop I see her online cuz she still got me added there and im to pussy to block her cuz I miss her, everytime I get on youtube it reminds me of her cuz she's the reason I made my channel and I helped her get over 100 subs, playing ark reminds me of all the fun times I spent playing with her, when ever I get on discord I remember when I used to see her in my personal server and I see all the memes I made for her to make her laugh, hearing certain songs and going to certain places reminds me of her too.

 I wanna talk I want answers but she finally blocked me after months if refusing to do it cuz I called her out hard on the way she's been treating me but it makes me sad she and I got along real well on new years I miss her I wanna know why she abandoned me and became so toxic after everything its all such a mess and idk what to do there's nothing I can do I miss her but idk how to get her out of my head.
