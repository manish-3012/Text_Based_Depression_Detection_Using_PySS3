Girls of this subreddit: are yall actually comfortable wearing 'clothes designed for women'? Like bruh if my shirt was a little more tight I won't like it and every second wearing it would feel like torture. And I'm not even that fat to begin with. Not to mention yall's pants got pockets that are virtually useless. I'm not tryna be misogynist here but yall need more comfy outfits. Also on a personal note here I hate shirts with wide collars, how yall cope with dresses that don't cover anything from shoulder-length up?

^(sorry if I sound like a caveman cuz I am)
