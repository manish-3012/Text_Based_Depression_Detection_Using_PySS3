I had a nightmare about an asian mafia It was in third person like a video game and i was being chased down because of my debts and eventually this guy caught me and brought me up to his house. We were alone so i tried to shoot him but i kept missing. Eventually i hit him and he got pissed so i ran to a room and barricaded myself in there and climbed out a window. While all of this was happening i was extremely terrified.
