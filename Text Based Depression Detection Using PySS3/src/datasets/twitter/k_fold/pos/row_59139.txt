I feel like a crappy person bc I don't know how to help my best friend with advice. Okay so my best friend has a pretty hard life and childhood. She's been through so much and I don't think I know all of it. Her dad's mean to her all the time and her boyfriend broke up with her a few days ago. I feel bad because I'm not sure how to help her. I don't know what to do. She moved to a small town this summer and I miss her so much, and we became friends so fast last year. We talk almost every day but when serious things come up, like her past I'm not sure what to say because I'd hate to be the inconsiderate person. Does anyone have advice? She's my best friend in the whole entire world and I wish I could do more for her.
