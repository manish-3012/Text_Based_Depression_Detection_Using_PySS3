Maybe it isnâ€™t so bad Got closure from an ex a great days ago, deleted her. Found out I got accepted into a university with a scholarship. I notice I donâ€™t sleep 10-12 hours anymore. Now, currently catching up with an old friend that gave me her number. Maybe there is hope this year. Thanks pepeâ€™s.
