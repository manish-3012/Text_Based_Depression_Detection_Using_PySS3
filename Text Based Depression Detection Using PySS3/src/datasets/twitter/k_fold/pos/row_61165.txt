My parents are getting a divorce Recently my mom found out my dad, who shes been married to for 25 years, cheated on her and had another child in secret, my life is kinda falling apart rn, because turns out I have a step brother I havent met, I'm moving back to Brazil soon as well, and theres just too much going on for me to handle and i just need to talk to someone.
