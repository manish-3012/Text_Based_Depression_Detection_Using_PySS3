Does anyone else feel this way? I was making a joke today about chik fil a and my director mentioned she doesnâ€™t eat it bc of the anti gay donation that happened a few years back.

Idk why but I think itâ€™s crazy to not eat somewhere bc of the companies ideals. Like if there was a restaurant that the owners thought all white people should die but had amazing chicken strips Iâ€™d still eat there

and fr tho have you guys ever put a waffle fry with a nugget, and had a fry sandwich?
