Not me figuring out if my crush likes me or not in a reddit post Ok so:
-weâ€™re eachotherâ€™s best friends on snap w. the red heart emoji
-we talk everyday online &amp; irl + goodnight texts
-She asked me if I wanted to go out to eat one night
-She sends me music to listen to
-we have nicknames for eachother + inside jokes
