Are my friends even friends? So I was on a vc with my friends and we were playing minecraft. Then my other friend comes in. I start lagging and I get disconnected. They start calling me trash when I was carrying them. I couldn't rejoin the game because of a glitch. Then later I join the vc on mute. Nobody notices me. I unmute start talking. No one noticed me. Are they even friends?
