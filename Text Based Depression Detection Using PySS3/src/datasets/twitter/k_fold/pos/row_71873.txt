Yesterday I had a weird dream I was trying to bring a ghast to the overworld for the advancement. After hours of trying I made it and went back to the overworld and saw a gang of spiders launching Jesus (yes, Jesus) into the sky with a TNT trap. The ghast tried saving him by fireballing the ground, the fireball made a hole into a cave and Jesus landed in a pond under the ground, but he died because he had frost walker boots (which makes sense because he can walk on water). The ghast then fireballed the spiders but unfortunately they killed him with Return to the Sender advancement. Is this a serious situation and I do need a therapy?
