Guy coming over and not sure what to wear? F17 Hey! So I have this guy friend coming over tomorrow and I'm so excited but I'm not sure what to wear! I've known him since middle school and we've been talking for a couple months now and, to be honest, I know he really won't care what I wear but I will. I don't want to wear a dress or something because that'd give a way too feminine impression. I like dresses but not often and I don't want to give an impression that isn't me, if that makes sense. I'm thinking of wearing my cargo shorts but my friends tell me no because nobody likes cargo shorts. He does though! He like doesn't own any normal pants that I know of, only cargo pants. Thing is, I haven't seen him in person since we were 13, so I want to make absolutely sure this is a good impression. I want to look nice but not like I put in too much effort but not too casual and like I just didn't care. I'm gonna do some light makeup and I've got a couple pics of the makeup I'm gonna do bc I did makeup like it yesterday. If anyone wants to see the makeup uh I guess I'll link it. Also if anyone has makeup advice hmu! I don't think I'll worry about my nails but if I do I'll probably do something pastel.[makeup look](https://imgur.com/a/QA0Orpl)
