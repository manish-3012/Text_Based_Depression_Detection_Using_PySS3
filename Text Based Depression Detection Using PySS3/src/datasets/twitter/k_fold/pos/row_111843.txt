Personal issue involving racism Guys I need some help. I feel bad when racism occurs in the world and when it ruins sports and stuff but that doesnâ€™t stop me from wanting to say nigga. Iâ€™m not saying it with a hard R or anything and i only use it to address my homies and stuff. Does that make me racist?
