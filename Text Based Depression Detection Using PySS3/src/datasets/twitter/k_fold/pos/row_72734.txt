Guys, the situation is dire Itâ€™s Saturday and I just realized that my boba tea is in my locker
*My iced boba tea is alone in my locker at school because Iâ€™m an idiot who forgot to take it home and now either cockroaches are having a party in there or itâ€™s just going to go stinky*
I freaking hate myself now
