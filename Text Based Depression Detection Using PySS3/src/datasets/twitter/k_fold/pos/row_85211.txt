Everything is slowly getting better. Be me: 

Has no friends

Plays video games to numb the pain

School starts soon

Gave up on ever making a good friend

Playing video games again

Dad walks in

â€œAre you winning sonâ€

No dad, iâ€™m losing. At everything.

Play cod one day

Random says he lives in my state

I ask where

He lives 30 minites from me

We both have no friends

Hang out with him

We drive around and I have the most fun iâ€™ve had in forever

Dad asks me while playing video games again â€œare you winning sonâ€

Yeah dad, I won
