[On TikTok] Can people stop commenting "These comments are so ðŸŒ FreshðŸŒ " and "So we're all here at the same time?" Cause it's not funny and it was never funny. I see these comments on every other post and I want to look at normal comments but I have to keep scrolling until they stop. Why do they get so many likes? They add literally nothing to the video.
