The Education System I would like to start by saying that this isn't meant to offend anyone, but this needs to be addressed.

The education system is so majorly fucked up. And frankly, I'm done dealing with it. I'm sick of being part of a system that doesn't care about me, or my mental health. I try to explain to the adults in my life that I'm stressed out, and that I have a life outside of school work, they hit me with the "WeLl WhEn I wAs A tEeNaGeR". We get it, you were a perfect teenager and everyone loved you. But education has changed in the 30-40 years you've been out of school. It's much more stressful, and we get a lot more work than you did. So stop trying to tell me that I'm lazy, or not normal, or stupid, because you know nothing about what we're talking about.
