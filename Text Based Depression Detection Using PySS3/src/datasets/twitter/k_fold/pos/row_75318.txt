I why I gotta crush on all my brothers friends.... I hang out with them when they come over. They're cool and cute and I could see myself dating any of them... Except one who kinda scares me but like other than that. There's one my age and the rest are two years older. I've mentioned two of them before on this sub, two brothers. One with long curly hair and one with a cute skinny inverted triangle body. Then there's a skinny dude who quiet but very chaotic. He and I make dirty jokes and see how sugar high I can get him because I like to bake and stuff. Then there's the very chaotic and loud one. He's skinnier than a bean pole but compartively his shoulders are very wide, and he has this grey jacket that brings that out and it's super hot. He says random stuff and he's a huge star wars nerd. He's kind of the black sheep of the group and I feel bad... I should probably stick up for him more lol. Then there's a girl who hangs out with us and the guy who scares me. That's about it. They came over today and I kinda had to rant about it. Thanks for "listening" lol.
