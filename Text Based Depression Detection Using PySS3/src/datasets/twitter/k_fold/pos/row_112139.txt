I saw my ex best friends in a dream and canâ€™t stop thinking about it. What should I do/what does it mean. I need to stop listening to my dreams but
&lt;I was in a school&gt; I was in my 8th grade hall. I saw all of my ex best friends . While shocked from seeing them J handed me a poster, &lt;apparently were working on together it together&gt;  it had anime characters on it. When I saw it I took it and hugged J in the hall. It really did fell like him I. I said I was sorry for all the mean stuff I had done to him I also said I loved him and was sorry and that I truly do care for him and always will.  It sounded like him when he said â€œhahaha this has escalated fastâ€ I kept hugging him till Another one of my friends separated us. And I pushed away and said â€œbut not in a gay wayâ€ and as I walked away my other friend said â€œreally? Him out of everyone? â€
What do yâ€™all think that ment? :/
In my dream I was thinking if I apologized and made everything right then I wouldnâ€™t be the way I am not and I would still have them. But we stopped being friends years ago . But every day I think about them. :/
