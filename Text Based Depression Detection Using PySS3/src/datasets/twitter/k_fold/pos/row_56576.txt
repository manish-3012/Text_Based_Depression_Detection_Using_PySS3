Guys guys guys Almost one year ago I got to know a person that helped me out of a depression and helped me with my drug addiction and then we came together and that whole spring and summer was so wonderful but in November we broke up and the following 4 months were so weird to me. I didn't really know how to feel in that time but now for almost a month I am finally sure that I feel pretty great again :D

Thanks for reading this if anyone did, wish you a great day :)
