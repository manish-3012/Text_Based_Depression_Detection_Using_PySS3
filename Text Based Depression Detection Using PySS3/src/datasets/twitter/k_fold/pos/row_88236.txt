I do not understand abstract art Like, I see people looking at a blob of paint for 10 hrs, and I'm like bitch what the fuck is there to see?

Btw, I don't hate art, I love materialistic, meaningful, and a painting that tells a story which is decided by the painter.

Maybe I don't know enough about abstract art, but fuck them.
