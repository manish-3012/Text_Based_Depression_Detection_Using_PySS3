[Middle Schoolers and Freshman] Coming from a sophomore Idk if itâ€™s just my area but people used to always tell me â€œfreshman year doesnâ€™t matterâ€ or â€œmiddle school doesnâ€™t matterâ€ IT FUCKING DOES, maybe not as much as 11 or 12 but it does. First if youâ€™re a middle schooler and in the process of getting put into a math class please do well on the test and get into an advanced course. Your 12th grade self will thank you when you selecting science courses.


9th grade: oh boy I was told it doesnâ€™t matter so I didnâ€™t pay attention, Iâ€™d go on my phone and ultimately I got a 3.29 gpa (which is trash if you want to go to a good college) and I could have raised it after realizing freshman year grades matter then covid came and canceled 2nd semester and they gave us free credits. 


10th grade, semester 1: online school reset my perspective and I though â€œsophomore year grades donâ€™t matterâ€ and didnâ€™t pay attention and got a 3.33gpa. 


Now I completely realized how much I fucked up and definitely trying this semester and have a 3.83-4.0 rn and took 3 AP/honors but it will still be difficult
