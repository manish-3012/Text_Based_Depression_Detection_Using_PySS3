Yo does anyone wanna chattttt? DM me :))) Wild potatoÂ species, originating in modern-dayÂ Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from theÂ United StatesÂ to southernÂ Chile.[3]Â The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated byÂ indigenous peoples of the AmericasÂ independently in multiple locations,[4]Â but later genetic testing of the wide variety ofÂ cultivarsÂ and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southernÂ PeruÂ and extreme northwesternÂ Bolivia, from a species in theÂ Solanum brevicauleÂ complex, potatoes wereÂ domesticatedÂ approximately 7,000â€“10,000 years ago.[5][6][7]Â In theÂ AndesÂ region of South America, where the species isÂ indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated.

Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are aÂ staple foodÂ in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world'sÂ food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop afterÂ maizeÂ (corn),Â wheat, andÂ rice.[8]

Following millennia ofÂ selective breeding, there are now over 5,000Â different types of potatoes.[6]Â Over 99% of presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands ofÂ south-central Chile.[9][10]

The importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, whereÂ per capitaÂ production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred inÂ southernÂ andÂ eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2018.

Like theÂ tomato, the potato is aÂ nightshadeÂ in the genusÂ Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxinÂ solanineÂ which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produceÂ glycoalkaloidsÂ in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[11][12]
