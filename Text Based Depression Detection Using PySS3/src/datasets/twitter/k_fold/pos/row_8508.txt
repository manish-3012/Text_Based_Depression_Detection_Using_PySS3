Just a warning on something Iâ€™ve encountered I got followed by this person (Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s a bot) and the only thing that they posted was a naughty website and thatâ€™s it. They did nothing before hand, never met them, never seen them. Itâ€™s a brand new account made in October 2. Itâ€™s 10 pm oct 1 for me so that raised a flag for me. I just want to get this out there and I will tell you not to click a link on an brand new account. Block them and leave it at that are my only words if you encounter this person.
