Fuck Covid and Fuck Trump The Covid-19 pandemic robbed me and everyone I know a year of out lives. Iâ€™ve missed school, friends, parties and a semester of the high school experience. All because of anti-maskers and the anti-science GOP taking months to respond and having lackluster responses which has butchered the economy and my life. Fuck Covid and Fuck Trump
