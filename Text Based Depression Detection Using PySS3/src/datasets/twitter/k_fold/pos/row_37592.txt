Can you give me advice on picking a college (Texas tech, WVU, or U of South Carolina)? Hi. HS senior and Iâ€™m at an utter lost deciding where to go to college. 

Iâ€™m from NY, and while I got into NY state schools, WILL end up being cheaper than any state school. I also just really want to get out of NY. It might sound like i just wanted to go to a big party school, but thatâ€™s not it. I wanted a big school from the get go, and private schools are way too expensive. Iâ€™m also basing my decisions off of what schools are DEFINITELY having in-person classes next year. NO WAY Iâ€™m going online. Also; all three of these schools have club swimming.

Texas Tech â€” was supposed to be a â€œdiscountâ€ TAMU. I got into TAMU, but they gave me dog poopoo financial aid. Iâ€™d most likely study chemical engineering, comp sci minor maybe. Got in state tuition and ended up being around 17K (with air fare and such). Good engineering school, Iâ€™d also be psyched about going to Texas. The school doesnâ€™t have the best reputation, but a good alumni network, and my field of engineering is pretty much centered in TX.

U of South Carolina â€” applied here for fun, beautiful campus. Got into the Capstone program. End up being around 26k. I think UofSC has a better overall reputation, but Iâ€™m not sure if their engineering schools is AS good. Iâ€™d also be psyched about going to South Carolina. Also be studying chemE.

WVU â€” I know some people who go here and they really love it, one of which is an engineer. WV is a beautiful state, and the final price would be around 21k here. Iâ€™d also have the option to be in a 5 dual bachelor degree program of mining/Civil engineering, which seems like a really cool field to me. Some cons are that the schoolâ€™s grad rate isnâ€™t that high (the others arenâ€™t much higher) and it has a huge party vibe, almost to a point where it has a negative affect on the schoolâ€™s rep (same with the others maybe?). Iâ€™m also not sure if Iâ€™d like to live in WV either.

Anyways. Iâ€™d graduate with 10k in student loans anywhere I go. Please give any insight.
