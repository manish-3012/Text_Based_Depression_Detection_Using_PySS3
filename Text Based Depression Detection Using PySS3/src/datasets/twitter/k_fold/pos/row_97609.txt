List of things I miss online 1. Having an opinion without being attacked.

2. When Xbox live parties were considered the most toxic thing online.

3. When people didnâ€™t put TW// on post.

4. When it was the simple â€œShe/Heâ€ type of thing on most social media platform. (No, Iâ€™m not transphobic or anything like that, I respect everyone for who they are. I just miss when it was simple and not as big of a deal as it is today.

5. Dream stans not existing.
