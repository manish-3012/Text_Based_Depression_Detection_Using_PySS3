Things in my house are dying The sink is leaking. The dryer stopped working. The washer stopped working. My bedroom window is stuck closed because the lock broke. The ceiling fan in my stepsisterâ€™s room wonâ€™t work. My mom messed up the router somehow and now my internet is all spotty.

Not fun. Do not recommend.
