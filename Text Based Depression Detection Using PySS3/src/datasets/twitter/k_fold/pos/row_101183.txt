I'm not LIKE the *other*Lofi girls I'm not Lofi enough, maybe. I've tried, but. I'm boring-unique and shit. I don't have a window for homework or a cat shedding on my lamp. I'm basically the one Lofi girl who's alone in a park, angling for fish as the sun goes down. You walk past me, you wanna say something. But a look in my halfsmile said, "I'm fine," the old lie. And no guy wants to be *that* pervert who approaches solitary lofigirls in the park. So as much as my face, body posture, and activity is BEGGING for you to come sit by me without a word and fulfill your fantasy of taking my hand in yours -- I'm sorry I can't. I'm that lofigirl you will never have. So you transform a wave into adjusting your hair and mute your smile as you walk by. But I know I'll be on your mind all goddamn night.
