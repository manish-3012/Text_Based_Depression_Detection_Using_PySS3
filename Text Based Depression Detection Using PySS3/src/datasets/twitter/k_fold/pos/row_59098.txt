Is it just me or are anime OPs better than most normal songs? Like seriously Iâ€™ve been listening to OPs from so many animeâ€™s for the past like, 2 hours. Like jojos OPs, citrus (Iâ€™ve finished it and Iâ€™m so sad that there probably wonâ€™t be a season 2), seven deadly sins, initial d, asterisk war, and many other OPs, and I vibe to that more than normal songs.
