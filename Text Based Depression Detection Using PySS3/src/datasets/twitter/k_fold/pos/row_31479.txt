Need some communication help guys and gals Alright, so I made plans to meet up with a girl before school so we can talk for a bit. This wouldn't be a problem if I knew her from before, but since all this corona shit happened and half of this year was spent at online class, I didn't really get to talk to her.

What advice do you have? I know I just need to go with the flow but is there something to do/talk about so that I can leave off a good impression?
