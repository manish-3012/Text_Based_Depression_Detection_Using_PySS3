I think I'm gonna delete Reddit when I wake up later. I'm getting kinda tired of it so I'm just gonna delete it. I thought I may as well say it. Most of the content and stuff on here is all mostly the same. And it's taking most of my time. So here is me saying goodbye to this app. Love you guys, drink water, and be nice.
