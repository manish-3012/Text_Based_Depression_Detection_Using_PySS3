i still have no wifi so short story whenever i took my dog out for a walk i wouldnâ€™t encounter many people, and when i did it was just a minor inconvenience as iâ€™d just walk past them with ease and went on, but earlier this year iâ€™ve encountered my neighbor also taking his dog out and it was not only awkward af, but our dogs went bananas each time, the worst part was that we would follow the same path as itâ€™s just a long street with no escape and it was really annoying. it started happening all too often and even when i changed my schedule a bit he would still manage to pop up. iâ€™m pretty sure he felt the same way as me cause we started having this unspoken rule of when each other would go out as we started marking our ground on each otherâ€™s time window and the few times we clashed there was this vibe of â€œugh i didnâ€™t think he would come out at this timeâ€. i started giving it a lot more thought and it was bothering more than it should, so after months of procrastinating i nowadays take my dog out somewhat late at night and it works like a charm, also enjoy the cold breeze at night so itâ€™s much better
