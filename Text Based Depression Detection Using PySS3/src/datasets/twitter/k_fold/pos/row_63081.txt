maybe I should stop denying my feelings I just want someone to hug me and play with my hair. I'm just tired of being lonely. I want a partner that would talk to me and understand me. But maybe thats asking for too much.

(also please dont pm or dm me. I find that incredibly creepy. I seriously mean it)
