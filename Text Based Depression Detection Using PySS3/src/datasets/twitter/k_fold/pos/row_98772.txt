Anti-maskers are a real threat I just saw a comment on a Instagram 9gag post encouraging not wearing masks, and its top comment with 400+ likes. Under the replies there's actually people who are defending not wearing masks. Anti maskers may be a minority, but there's still a significant number of them and their voices are being amplified by social media. There's alot of younger, naive teenagers who use these social media platforms and will probably believe this stupid crap just cuz they see people agreeing with it. My point is, all these anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, people who don't believe in modern science are a real threat and shouldn't be ignored and pushed aside.
