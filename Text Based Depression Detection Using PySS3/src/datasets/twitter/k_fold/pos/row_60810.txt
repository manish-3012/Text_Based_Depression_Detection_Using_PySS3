why must I be this way Me: accidentally sits one row ahead, in the wrong seat 

The person who actually is supposed to sit there (who also happens to be my crush sorta): hey [beneficial-abroad-820] thatâ€™s my assigned seat

Me: ah

*gets up and magically my bags straps wrap around my legs making my ascent as dumb looking as possible and moves one row back*

My shred of self esteem: imma head out
