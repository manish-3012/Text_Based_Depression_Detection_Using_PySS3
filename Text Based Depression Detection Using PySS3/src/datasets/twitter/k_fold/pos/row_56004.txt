My parents have such a closed mind sometimes Specifically, my parents. I have been asking for more independence in what games I can play on my potato-laptop. I feel like I'm at an age (16) where I know right from wrong, and playing a game like *ravenfield* -or any other game- isn't going to make me murder anyone. 


Whenever I bring it up they say, "I say no: that's final, we disagree with your opinion." and, "Studies have shown "violent games cause irl violence".

 Whenever I ask for these so called "studies" (probably some gossip a family friend showed them on facebook) they tell me to stop being "smart" and that no matter what I'm wrong. I've gone through and done research (looked at official studies) and found no connections to irl violence.

They're just so closed off. They seem to think that pixel-game-gun = Carbine Massacre. It's so ridiculous. With zero evidence to back them up..


Don't even get me started on the shit I get at school for being shielded and not allowed to play. 

I don't even know what to do. Whatever I try, however I try it, I just get shot down (pun intended hehe) and end up worse than before. Not playing games is actualy making me more worse off than if I did. Now I feel bad for typing this out, i mean, they're trying their best and thats all I can really ask? idk


Any advice guys?
