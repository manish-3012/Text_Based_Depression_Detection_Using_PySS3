I know I look bomb, but It doesn't feel like it M 17 here

I have gotten a bid of a glow up, both physicly and socialy. I know I look great when I try to look good. Hand I have been told I am somewhat hot but too short (of couse). And it's not like I fuck every weekend but I can talk to girls. I have lost 2 kg og fat over the Christmas break. Being 82 kg with a 16.8% fat and 42.9% muscel I look a bit above arvege in physice.  I know this, I can see my self and think I look good, but I don't feel like I am looking good. I am depressed over being depressed. I have always felt fat, now that I have lost weigh I feel fatter. Now that I dress better I feel more insecure. 

How the fuck am I still a winterdepressed Virgin who cries every time i feel slight retjection. I have a great life and I get angry at my self for not appreciate what I got.

Yester Day I asked my bedst girl friend if she wantet to be more, I didn't even fucking mean it, I just wantet to be chad wtf is wrong with me, am I greedy?

People say they like me as a friends. And every girls I have ever kissed dunped me and said we should just be friends efter a goddamn week. They like to have me in their life just not romatic? I don't get it.

Am just not wify matrial?

Why am such a crybaby that need validation from other all the goddam time?

I sound self centeret when talk about how I look, but I  am deeply insecure.
