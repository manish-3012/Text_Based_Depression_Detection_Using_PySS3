Gross men staring So yesterday i had to buy undergarments which is already embarasing to do as a teenager, so im trying to find the right size and some creepy old men keep staring at me, in the women clothing section, they thankfully stopped when they knew i had noticed.
Its feels really gross that old men were potentially checking me out. I migh be overreacting but i nearly had a anxiety attack because of it
