Letâ€™s just all admit it: Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed had the best soundtrack for a lot of Modern Sonicâ€™s history. Thereâ€™s just something so heartwarming and groovy about them that brings in the right memories. Sonic colors was my first modern sonic game, and I remember that the soundtrack was just the best thing ever. 

They were so imaginative and creative that each track really felt that truly belonged in that appropriate zone.
