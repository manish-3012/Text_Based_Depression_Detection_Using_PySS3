Gonna force myself to finish a project due tomorrow I want to sleep by midnight cause I have to wake up like at 5 but I need to finish this project thing. its 9:30 here so ill make another post in 2 1/2 hours. I should be done with it by then cause its not that much. I'll turn off my phone do my work and hopefully get a good grade. Also if anyone hasn't done their homework, do it. So much stress once it reaches a month of late work.


Edit:finished at 11:44 so I get 15 min extra for sleep, yay
