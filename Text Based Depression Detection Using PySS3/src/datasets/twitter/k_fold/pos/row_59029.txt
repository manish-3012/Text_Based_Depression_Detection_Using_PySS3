Does anyone know about the "Certificate of Attendance" form the DMV asks you when you apply for a driver's permit? My school attendance person signed the Certificate of Attendance form but the bottom says "Signatures must be originals. Photocopies are not acceptable." They photocopied it and I printed it out and called back to make sure they'd accept it.

They said they work with the DMV and that they'll accept a photocopy. The DMV call line is busy and they won't pick up. Does anyone know if you're required to bring in the original copy or is the photocopy fine? I just wanna make sure in case I get there and they reject it. Thanks!
