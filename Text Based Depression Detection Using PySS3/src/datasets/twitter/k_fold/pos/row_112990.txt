Why do my dreams torment me? Every day, for the last week I've had a dream where I've gone on a date with a boy. Not a boy I know, probably not based on anyone I know. But every night, the date goes really well. Then I literally wake up and feel empty.

It's not fair, I don't want to be reminded of how lonely I am. Plus, it's a boy. I've never even dated a boy! I feel like I'm bi or something because I was actually attracted to him, and loved his personality. 

Maybe one day I'll have a cheesy movie moment where I meet someone just like himðŸ˜…
