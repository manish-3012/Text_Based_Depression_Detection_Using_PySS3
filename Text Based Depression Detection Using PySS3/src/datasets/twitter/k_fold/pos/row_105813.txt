A funny story that I just remembered So it was probably 2016/2017 and me and my family where checking out old abandoned mines in the desert and we saw a skull spray painted onto a wall with danger spray painted below it, I was 10-11 I can't remember and I was touching the cave wall and liking my fingers as a dumb 10-11 yr old does and my grandfather come to the sudden realization that they were warning us about some dangerous chemical that had been used to make the ore and stuff easier to find(I think he said it was cyanide but that could be me misremembering) and he told us to not touch the walls and wash our hands when we got back to the cabin(I was in a group with cousins and such and we had a family cabin in the desert) so after he told us that I realized that I could be in genuine danger because I was being a dumbass and licking my fingers after touching the walls, and I told nobody and nothing bad ever happened because of that
