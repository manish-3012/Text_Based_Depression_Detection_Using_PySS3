Anyone else have that dream where youâ€™re trying to do surgery on your own toe.... But you canâ€™t get it done because there are two other people in your bed and they keep getting in your way and then a doctor zaps one of them with the electric paddles and you get zapped too and you accidentally cut off the wrong toe and then youâ€™re stuck trying to tape it back on? Or is that just me?

Honestly my brain is just one big bag of WTF half the time...
