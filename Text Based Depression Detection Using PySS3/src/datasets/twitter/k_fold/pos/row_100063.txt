I Want to die but I donâ€™t want the pain that comes with it. Hi. I have a hard time showing my emotions for the fear that theyâ€™re invalid. It seems disrespectful to those with severe depression, or those who have committed suicide, to say that Iâ€™m feeling depressed. 

But recently Iâ€™ve been having thoughts of my own death. I have no intentions of killing myself and I donâ€™t see myself ever, but I want to die. Itâ€™s complicated because I donâ€™t want the pain that comes with death, physical, and emotional for those around me; more of a â€˜never existed in the first placeâ€™ situation.

So the main question is: Is this normal? Or should I talk to someone? I usually brush off my emotions and have a â€˜get over itâ€™ attitude when it comes to them, but this has caught my attention.

TL:DR
I want to die but I donâ€™t want to pain of doing so. Is this normal or a sign of depression?
