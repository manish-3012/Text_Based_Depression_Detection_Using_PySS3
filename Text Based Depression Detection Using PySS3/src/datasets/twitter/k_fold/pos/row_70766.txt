My crush picked my best friend over me, and it's doing wonders for my self-esteem So I have been best friends with my bro for about 4 or 5 years. About a year ago I started liking this girl that was his friend, but didn't know at the time that she liked him. Then about a month Into school I had to move. When I moved I told her and she said she didn't feel the same. About a week ago she invited herself to the discord server and we were talking a lot. She made a joke that she had a crush on me, but then straight out said that out of the 5 people I  the discord she liked 2. I knew one that it could be one of three people and I was one of them. I was talking to her when my best friend was questioning if he should kill himself and she was trying to tell him that he shouldn't. Anyways I told her to tell him how much she cares about him and she goes on to confess to me that she likes him. This at first hurt but I was like well there was no way we could date 14 hours apart. So then we were all fine and I knew I was having reoccurring feelings so I told her. I asked my friend why he didn't go for her and he said he will when he is 16, thus confirming he likes her. Before this I was already struggling with the idea that my best friend is better than me at everything so when I found out she liked him and he liked her I pictured them together and it hurt, bad. So then I proceeded to try and talk to someone, but I couldn't talk to my best friend about, not could I talk about it to her. So how do I get over this, while still being friends with them?
