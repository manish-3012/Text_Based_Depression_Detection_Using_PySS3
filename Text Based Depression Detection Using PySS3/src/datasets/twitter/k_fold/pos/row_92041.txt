I need some help with some anxiety I'm having. I have a blood draw the day after tomorrow and I'm having trouble feeling good about going. I've had a fear of needles ever since I was little and I haven't been able to get over it. The problem is that It's hard to convince my subconscious that it's going to be ok. I myself know it is but I'm getting anxious thinking about it. Do you have any advice? Any help is appreciated.
