I'm tired of people calling me a snowflake after I get mildly annoyed after the fifth time someone says I am a bad person for not being cis or het in a single day. Like wtf. Do people not know about this fancy thing called empathy or logic or not using ad hominem attacks 24/7? Like honestly I support your opinion as long as you make well conceived arguments for it. But no. I make a point and bam *unrelated ad hominem attack*. There was this post on r/theaverageredditor just hammering on this girl for coming out as trans to the point where she deleted her account. Do people genuinely think that coming out is attention seeking? It's not. Just because cisnormatitivity and heteronomativity trivialize it doesn't mean it is not important. There is not a single homophobe who will listen to reason, yet I still refuse to stoop to the level of name calling and ad hominem attacks. At this point I am considering giving up on trying to be a beacon of reason. It's tiring trying to reason with people who think not being cis or het is a mental illness. And now I know that there are many homophobes on this sub, so I will ask that if you won't listen to reason, don't comment, and if you do, please refrain from ad hominem attacks, or any other obvious fallacies.
