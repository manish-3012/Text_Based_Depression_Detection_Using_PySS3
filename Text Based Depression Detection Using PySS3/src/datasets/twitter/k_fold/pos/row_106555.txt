You guys are fucking amazing and I love you I'm being for real, lately I've been struggling with so much lately and I didn't know what to do, posting on this subreddit and talking with people actually helped me a lot. I had so many people texting me and trying to get me to think of something different, it's amazing! People wrote me fucking novels about why I should be happy and what's actually good, other just played video games with me and helped me to distract myself. I've never met people this nice before. I appreciate that so much. A lot of the people of course left again after seeing they helped me, but some of them still talk to me and we kinda became friends I guess, so that's fucking amazing.

I appreciate y'all so much it's so nice to know there's a place to go to when I'm feeling down.

So if anyone else is feeling down, feeling tired of everything and just feels like noones give a fuck, just post on here or text me, the people on here are so nice and accepting it's fucking amazing.

I appreciate it, thanks y'all
