Just a reminder, no one cares at all about how much you weight Unless you're seriously unhealthy, no one cares at all! People always get so wrapped up in like oh no I gained a pound or oh no I lost a pound, and ill admit I sometimes do that too, but then I realized I don't care at all about other peoples weight, so why do I think other people care about mine
