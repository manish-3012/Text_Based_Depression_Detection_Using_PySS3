Need your guys opinion on something Thereâ€™s this girl I like (I know how original) and I have a few classes with her but I rarely have time talk to her in class and we walk to the same class twice but I donâ€™t have the courage yet to talk to her (I did a little once but I lost the courage) so do you think dming her on Instagram is a good way to talk to her or should I avoid it?
