Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 59 AH! I missed a day! Apologies, I was *very* busy. As usual for missed days, I'll post yesterday's fact now, then come back later for today's fact. If you have any space-related questions or topics for me to do a fact one, lemme know! See ya later!!  


Fact: Allow me to introduce you to the art of "Texas Tank Watching".

&amp;#x200B;

No, it isn't a group of WWII enthusiasts riding around in a Sherman tank. It's a group of SPACE enthusiasts riding around on horses watching a Mars rocket 24/7. More specifically, we watch SpaceX's Starship prototypes. In the tiny village of Boca Chica, Texas, there sits a test facility full of giant stainless steel rockets under construction. Every now and then, the prototype currently on the launch pad will fire its engines (or as we've seen a few times before, actually fly), and it is *awesome.* I don't know what it is, but something about watching the first proper Mars rocket built for carrying humans unleash its power is just so inspiring to see. However, SpaceX aren't as public with Starship development as they are with other things, so we have to make do. As a result, there are literal *dozens* of camera feeds from groups on YouTube constantly monitoring the test facility 24/7 for our enjoyment. They're collectively nicknamed the Texas Tank Watchers, and they're able to deduce when a Starship will do testing based on road closures in the area, temporary flight restrictions issued by the FAA, and literal *written warnings* sent to the village residents from SpaceX basically saying "we're testing a rocket, you might wanna leave for a bit in case it blows up".

But anyways, us Texas Tank Watchers got a treat today! Starship SN9 (which stands for Serial Number 9) performed three static fires in a single day. That's a new record! In case you don't know, a static fire is when a rocket ignites its engines for a couple seconds, then shuts them off. These tests are done simply to ensure the engines function properly, and it turns out all 3 fires went smoothly! This is a huge milestone, and SN9 is actually scheduled to perform a 12.5 km test flight AND landing sometime later this week, possibly even as soon as ***tomorrow!*** We are in the future, and its home is in a tiny village on the southern border!!
