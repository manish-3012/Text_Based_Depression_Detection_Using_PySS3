My sister came into my room freaked saying she can hear someone humming I was laying in bed at around 10:30 watching youtube and I can hear someone humming I just think it is one of my sister's video in the other room and then she walks into my room a little bit later freaking out saying she can hear a girl humming too. She turned on the light and started freaking out yelling a little bit and than all of a sudden it stops like the person noticed she was talking about them which was weird but she made me call our dad and look around the house with a knife to make sure no one is here and now she won't let me go to bed.  The only people in the house right now are me, my grandpa, my younger brother and sister. my dad works nights and we don't live with our mom so the only female sounding voice is my sister and she is 10 and person sounded a lot older than that. By the way we sleep In the basement and my brother and grandpa sleep upstairs.
