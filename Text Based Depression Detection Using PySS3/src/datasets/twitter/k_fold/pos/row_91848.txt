Yâ€™all I am on a whole new level of pissed off Iâ€™ve been crushing on this girl for the longest time and yesterday I asked if she wanted to go to the river with me, which is my favorite place ever, and she said she wanted to, and then her fuckin parents said she canâ€™t go anywhere today and I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll be able to go tomorrow, since I donâ€™t have school till Thursday (gotta love hurricanes), and Iâ€™m going to my dads house a hundred miles away this weekend so the soonest Iâ€™ll be able to even have a chance at going out with her is next weekend, since Iâ€™m in band and it takes up all my damn time. This week just keeps getting better and fucking better.
