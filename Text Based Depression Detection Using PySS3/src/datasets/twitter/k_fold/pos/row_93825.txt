I hate that Iâ€™m like this I hate that I bottle everything up I hate how Iâ€™ve trusted people in the past and believed they cared when they ended up just using me and leaving bc thatâ€™s what if everyone just decides Iâ€™m good for so hey if u want to use me or fuck me over be my guest bc idk if I can get anymore broken than I am I trust absolutely fucking no one anymore and I think everyone hates me bc why would someone like me thereâ€™s nothing good about me Iâ€™m only good to be used then left and forgotten about and that sums up my whole life pretty much getting left by my real dad getting used by my step dad my mom taking her frustration on life out on me and telling me Iâ€™m not good enough and donâ€™t try hard enough like thank u bc u have a clue what itâ€™s like being me trying to fucking get through everyday knowing the people u ever loved just fucking used u or got rid of u
