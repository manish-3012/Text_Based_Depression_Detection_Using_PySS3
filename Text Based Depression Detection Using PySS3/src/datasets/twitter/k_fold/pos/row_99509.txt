Anyone just kinda... not as horny after losing your virginity? I finally lost my virginity yesterday to my friend. It was great but like, I just haven't been horny since. I'm the type of guy who masturbates two or three times a day, but I haven't done it once since like saturday morning lmao.  Anyone else get that?


Not even a troll post, i swear to god i'm asking a genuine question be easy mods ðŸ™
