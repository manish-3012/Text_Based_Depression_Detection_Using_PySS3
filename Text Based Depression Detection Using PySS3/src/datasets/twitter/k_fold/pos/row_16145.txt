Questions about texting from an overthinker Might delete this post and might not reply to comments but just want to see if any of my general overthinking-isms are valid and want some validation for the logical side of my mind that says I'm overthinking. Here they are as follows:

Does it come off as needy to start too many text conversations? I've been texting with this girl nearly every day during school and the weekends but our convos almost always start with something school-related and spiral into multiple hours long back and forth. Over winter break there is obviously nothing school-related to talk about so I've only come up with an exigence to start a convo once so far in what has been a 4 day-break. Despite that conversation going from Saturday morning into late in the night, do I come off as too needy of a friend if I were to start another convo too soon, should I wait a few more days before trying to come up with something to talk about? For some other info I'm pretty sure she texts with a decent few other people (maybe only a few and not a decent few, am not entirely sure) as well and I don't text with too many others.

Also, is it a good or bad thing that she's said she tends to be kept up at night dwelling on things that she's said that she thought were awkward to other people (probably more figuratively being kept up at night but she still thinks about them) but that I don't seem to judgy so she doesn't really get any sort of anxiety or whatever from saying things she thinks are awkward around me?

Also, I think she texts maybe a few other guys, am not sure how many or how frequently though if that adds anything more to the equation.

That was a lot of words and I think I may have slightly answered some of my questions in the fact that I was able to write so much about all of those questions but would appreciate some validation from internet strangers that I am in fact overthinking. Thanks in advance!
