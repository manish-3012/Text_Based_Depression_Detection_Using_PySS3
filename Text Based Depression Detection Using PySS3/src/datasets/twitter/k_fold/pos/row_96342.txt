Whenever I see a good drawing, I'm happy for that person, but I often get sad. The reason is because it can remind me that my art skills are complete shit and that I usually think that I ruin every one of my drawings from the moment I draw the first line or whatever. Idk I feel like I just needed to get that off my chest.
