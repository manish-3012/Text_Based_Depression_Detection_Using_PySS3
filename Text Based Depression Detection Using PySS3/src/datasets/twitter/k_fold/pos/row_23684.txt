Securly feccing sucks It blocks most of the websites my school says is allowed for research and pretty much steals all of the pupils data and they blocked their own bloody review page. I checked when I got home, it's a one star. They can also feccing "physically locate" Chromebooks with the app installed.

The only thing making this worse is the full-on spying app my school installed during lockdown to see ALL of the pupils data.

Boy I sure do love school
