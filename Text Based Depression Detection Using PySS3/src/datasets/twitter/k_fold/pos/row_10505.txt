1 more year! So today I turned 19!!! While I am happy that I turn 19 along with all my friends and family I canâ€™t help but feel sad that next year I will no longer be a teenager anymore. Iâ€™ve been on this subreddit for 2 years ever since I was 17 and Iâ€™ve seen some good stuff and lots of discussions and itâ€™s always felt nice seeing others my age discuss various subjects and canâ€™t help but feel sad now that I wonâ€™t be a teen anymore. Iâ€™ll have to wait till Iâ€™m 113 to be back! But now I come asking to all of you what your experiences have been on this subreddit and what has made it a nice place for us all. Also just like it sucked looking for colleges knowing that Iâ€™d have to move and live there possibly what are some good subreddits for young adults when they turn 20 where they can all chill much like us teens chill here and discuss? Look forward to talking to some of you.
