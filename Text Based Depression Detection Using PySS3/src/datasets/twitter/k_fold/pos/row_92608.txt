AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH So my mom was recording me playing guitar and singing, and we did it a lot because the video kept messing up or I kept messing up. And then we did it for the last time and it was *BEAUTIFUL*. We then learn later that the phone timer was on and it made the the video into three different videos (it also cut out parts, A LOT OF PARTS). Bro I put my FRICKING SOUL into that piece and now itâ€™s ruined. R. U. I. N. E. D. 

Iâ€™m sorry for ranting, but I have really bad anger issues and needed to vent. Thank you for reading. Rest well my fellow teens!
