Iâ€™m so proud of myself. Never would i have seen myself in this position i have been put in, and handling it this way. Especially the way i did. I cut off a very close friend of mine because it started to feel like a parasitic friendship.


Iâ€™m almost certain this guy is like in love with me or fucking something, and i donâ€™t like it. Constantly being asked when Iâ€™m going to be online, constantly sending me memes, constantly just doing TOO MUCH... it feels suffocating. 


So.. i cut him off. I told him, i canâ€™t anymore. I cut him off for about a month not even a week ago, and he fell into the same habits, the same stuff he did that made me do it in the first place. We never really seemed to see eye-to-eye anyway. And that he liked that he could change my opinions so easily because he was gaslighty. 


Iâ€™m so proud..
