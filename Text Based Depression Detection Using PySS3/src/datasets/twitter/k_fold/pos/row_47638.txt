I am officially done with this Fucking subreddit TLDR: IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE, LEAVE THIS SUBREDDIT.



Iâ€™m done with this subreddit, honestly this place is a cool place. Teens from across the world can connect and be friends. Great. But Iâ€™ve noticed something, everyone here is the same. An introverted loser who just wants to be like the more popular kids at school but does nothing about achieving that goal. Granted not everyone is like that but most of us are. I DONâ€™T WANT TO FUCKING BE HERE. I have goals I want to accomplish in the near future, and I have a plan to achieve them, but every god damn time I open Reddit itâ€™s the same â€œweâ€™re pathetic virgin fucks who want to do more with our lives but we canâ€™t do anything about itâ€ story. It always makes me think â€œwell shit they are right, I should stop doing that good thing and just waist away until Iâ€™m 18 wallowing about it with other likeminded fucksâ€  it gets me every time, and itâ€™s getting in the way, since I have a shred of social skills left Iâ€™m leaving now.
