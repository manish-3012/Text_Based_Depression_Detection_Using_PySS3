I'm so fucking confused about my career options it's annoying I feel like I'm not as passionate as I was in things that I liked doing and studying (which was a very small list), so I don't really have anything to do now. But at the same time, I want my career to be something that I would enjoy doing (I don't really care about the pay as long as it covers my basic expenses). 

I don't know if this is just usual teenage stuff, but I'm stressing out so much AAAAGHHH.
