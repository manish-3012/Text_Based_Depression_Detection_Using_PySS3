A little while back I told my crush I liked her. She wasnâ€™t ready for a relationship just yet and I thought she lost feelings until one day she asked me to be her girlfriend and it caught me completely off guard and she told me sheâ€™s liked me for a while now. Weâ€™re going great and may go on our first date soon :D
