Why are some people so fragile? Now I don't think you are fragile if you are scared of some things or if you cry or anything

You can cry but you have to also move on, you can be scared of things but you should try to overcome those fears

What I mean by fragile are the people who take everything personally, won't accept other opinions etc. for example twitter creatures
