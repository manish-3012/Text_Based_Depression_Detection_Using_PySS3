I am so fucking frustrated and numb at the same time Fucking school, politics, personal life, it all frustrates me, makes me sad, and just unmotivated and numb.
Today, I spent the entire afternoon too tired and uninterested to do anything apart from just watching shit, waiting for the time I could go to bed.
I am so fucking sick of this. And all my friends are dealing with their own shit, so I feel bad ranting to them, so here we fucking are again!!
