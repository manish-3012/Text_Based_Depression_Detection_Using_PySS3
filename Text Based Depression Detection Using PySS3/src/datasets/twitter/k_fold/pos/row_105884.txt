Should I run for student body president My senior year is next year and a classmate asked me to join them in the student body. Should I do it considering that I always feel trapped by responsibilities when itâ€™s there? I kind of want the seat, I like the idea of running and winning but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll like being the president.
