tw: suicide, self harm hey i usually dont post serious things or anything but i needed some opinions on this. i had a friend I met in a video game, through another friend. we had been friends for a long time, and I got his discord. we talked often, but every once in a while he'd be like "im so depressed" and try getting my attention. suddenly, yesterday, he left a group chat with the other friend i had. i was confused so i asked him whats up. he said depression, suicide, other things bothering him. he said it was because school and he had no friends, and his grandfather died right in front of him a few months ago. i tried to help, saying that im here for him. i tried my best, i promise. he just exploded and got so mad at me, saying his life is so much harder than mine and im living a luxury life. damn, he didnt know me. i was and still am a private person, didn't reveal much. so i responded, of course infuriated by what he said. i said, you dont know me, and i told him everything, dont rlly want to share it here but it was some terrible abuse. that got him started. he called me the worst names you could find, calling me a slut and a bitch and everything else. it hurt me pretty bad, especially when he said he regretted meeting me. i realized what a sensitive dumbass i was, he was playing with my emotions. a few months ago i would cry at night because of some of what he said. i dont know if its my fault here, and i dont know what to do. if you got to the end of this, i love you please stay safe.
