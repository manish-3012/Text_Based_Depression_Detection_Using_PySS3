Why the hell don't girls like me? I can say I am an above average guy. I am kinda handsome. I am pretty fit. I'm also funny and also one of the smartest kids in school. Every girl I meet is amazed how I don't have a girlfriend. Whenever I make a move on a girl, she says that she soesn't see me as more than a friend.
What the hell? What am I doing wrongÂ¿Â¿Â¿
