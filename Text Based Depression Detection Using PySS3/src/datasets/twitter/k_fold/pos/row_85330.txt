Yesterday, I fought back Hello Everyone,

I will get straight to the point. My dad is an abusive asshole. He has struck me twice with my mom's stilettos, and even a metal rod. He says things like "I should have killed you at birth", "You are the greatest failure of my life." and other bullshit.

Since childhood, I have heard all these abuses hurled at me, but as I started growing up, my anger grew. Yesterday, as I was sitting in my room, He asked me to shut shut off the door, I was scrolling through my reddit feed and I could not notice him. He came at me and was about to slap me when I took a pen and drove it into his armpit. As he whimpered in pain, I ran away and locked into my room. Later today, he had cooled off, but I feel I have a ticking bomb in my own house. It's to the point I have to keep a pocket knife with me at all times. I fear he would take out my retaliation on my mother or sister.

I asked my mother to divorce him, she says my sister needs dad for her proper development. I tried to call police, but was stopped by mom. I feel conflicted about reporting my own dad to the authorities. He explicitly threatens to kill me and my sister. I live in constant fear about it. 

I called my grandfather (my father's side) and told him all this, he says he will reach a parlay with my dad soon. I hope things cool down soon.
