I'm hoping to get an STi My dad wants me to get an AWD sports car, as he puts it "a rally car of some sort" then he suggested a WRX so I went a' googlin' and got kinda hooked on getting an STi. I found one in my area for a price my dad would probably let me get, although I definitely won't be able to get a car at least until my brother moves out, so like September.

But either way, I'm kinda hyped
