My friend told me he likes me. Hey peoples, so yesterday one of my guy friends told me that he liked me and I was really freaking out about it because I only see him as a friend right now. Earlier this year I did have a crush on him but I donâ€™t anymore. I felt really bad about having to tell him that I donâ€™t like him that way but weâ€™re going to try and continue being friends. Today we had a normal conversation and it was great because it didnâ€™t feel awkward at all! I just thought Iâ€™d share that because why not, lol.
