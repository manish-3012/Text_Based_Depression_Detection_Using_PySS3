A poem on my current life (read it slowly for more depth :P) In playing games I'm top **notch**
And anime I binge **watch**

Studying books is such a **pain**
And in the end there is no **gain**

So all my grades are going **down**
It makes me sad, it makes me **frown**

No matter how much I **try**
In the end I'll have to **cry**

Online classes really **suck**
I don't really give a **f*ck**
