how long is death supposed to hit you? i lost a close friend and my uncle in about the same time frame a few years back and ig I just brushed their deaths off. I never really properly mourned either of their deaths until a few months ago. I couldn't stop thinking about either of them and I find myself randomly breaking into tears often. Once I start crying I always get mad at myself for not grieving their deaths. FUCK I LITERALLY SLEPT AT MY UNCLES FUNERAL. am i ok
