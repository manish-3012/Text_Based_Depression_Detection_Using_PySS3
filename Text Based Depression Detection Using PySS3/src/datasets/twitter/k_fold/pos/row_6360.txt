Anyone else feel like they're just drifting in the wind? I feel like I'm kinda just drifting throughout life right now. Like, last year was my senior year of HS and I think I went through about 5 different friend groups in that time, the friends who were worth it stuck with me but I don't feel like I've actually found where I belong. Same with crushes, I don't really ever get over them, I kinda just fade away from them and stop talking to them. 

I feel kinda lost rn too, like I'm trying to find something worthwhile. Feels like I'm trying to find my self worth but I'm not finding it. Idk, it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just *a* thing.
