I always need to surpass people! So, Lucas asked if he must go bald and showed an earlier picture of him going bald and I want to say: "That's nothing! My uncle is much you are!" And if responds with: "That's not possible" I will say: "My uncle is bald and can see his skull! You can see his skull Lucas!" Because I always need to surpass people.
