I have a class for my dream job! I was going through the courses i can take next year in high school when i say "Video Game Design" and "Video Game Programming" and i was ecstatic. I actually have a class that i will most likely enjoy taking and will actually benefit be in the long run. Maybe high school isnt as bad as people say!
