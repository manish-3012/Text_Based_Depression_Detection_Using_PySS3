I wish my friends would hug me Iâ€™m female and almost all of my friends are male. (Maybe that has something to do with it) 

Iâ€™m sometimes scared that people will leave me, because my last friendgroup did. 
Is it weird that I really want my friends to hug me? 
I just think I would feel less insecure, but they probably think itâ€™s weird or awkward.

Thank you for reading this if you did.
