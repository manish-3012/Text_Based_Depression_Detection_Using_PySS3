Just wanted to let it out So I've wanted to post about my issues for awhile now and honestly if I don't erase this it's a miracle. 

TL;DR: I got bad grades and now I'm stressed as fuck

So due to the virus people quarantined and for the first few months I was struck by depression (your choice if you think a thirteen year old can have depression, I didn't think so too) and being a boy I felt I shouldn't tell anyone and my friends drifted away from me and I found myself staying up all night browsing this app either procrastinating or distracting myself.

 But eventually I fought my way foward and came out of it yayyyy! I also told a girl who I had feels for about well, my feelings and suprise suprise she felt the same and now I am in my first relationship with a friendly, beautiful and just so extraordinary person who makes me feel and who I am in love with (again maybe you think it's young but I am just really happy about that). But of course good times come as fast as they go and here is my problem....

So I've always been above average for school - like a 90/A+ average but in grade 8 (I think the highest middle school grade for Americans) I've gone to 90 to 88 to now (what I've calculated) 86-87. Now I am A) from an minority family B) attending a private school so obviously I am scared as fuck but also I am just so tired and honestly I nearly cut myself and it sucks. I'm not good at anything else and good grades have been always been my thing (I don't do sports) and when I stop getting good grades......what am I? 

This is especially important because the jobs I want need high qualifications and it just makes me very stressed. Anyways I have four more exams to study for and my report comes in a fortnight so I guess I have time so cheers, thanks for listening and see ya!
