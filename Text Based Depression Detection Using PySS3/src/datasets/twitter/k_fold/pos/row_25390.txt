I found a loophole for the lads who have screen time lock on iphones First, go to settings and change apple ID (for app store) and download the chrome app

The chrome app is default exempt from screentime lock. Your parents probably wont know if theres a new app thats exempt. And unlike safari, theres no internal time lock either, so you can be like me and use reddit at 2 am ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸
