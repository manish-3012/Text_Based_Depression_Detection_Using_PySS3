I just got the Fazbear Funtime service and... I donâ€™t know how to explain this but for some reason the animatronics seem to be acting 
â€œStrange.â€ I donâ€™t know when I see them they always seem to hide and not come out like there supposed to or just donâ€™t seem to work. Iâ€™m going to file a complaint to Fazbear Entertainment about this soon.
