My thoughts about Star Wars. Anakin brought balance to the force in the Prequels Ok, so, during order 66, Sidious and Vader bring balance to the force because there is an equal amount of Jedi and Sith (Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and Yoda are the 3 Jedi alive. Vader, Sidious, and the First Brother Inquisitor) (I also mean canon only)
