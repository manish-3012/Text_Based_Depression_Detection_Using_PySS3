I Get to be alone for a Long time.... Hey, welcome back to I tell you guys about my problems then cry about them until I fall asleep. Ready? Ok let's go


So long story short I have two best friends (one male one female) and they obviously like eachother but that dosent matter rn.

So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.

Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

Like don't get me wrong, I want to see them reach their goals and be happy and I am going to support them and I love them both SO much but its just am so scared of losing them and us drifing apart.

I'll finish hs and most of if not all of my college before they get out and that is IF they get out because... you know... it's the military.

So anyway, if my spelling is bad I cant see due to tears in my eyes so yeah.

Thank you guys so much for always giving me a place to vent and speak, you really dont know how much it means to me. Thanks for the kind words and I hope you all have an amazing day
