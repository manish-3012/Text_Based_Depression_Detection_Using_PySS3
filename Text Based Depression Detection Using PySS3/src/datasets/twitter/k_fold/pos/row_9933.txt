Donâ€™t you think itâ€™s weird how we know really random facts, but we donâ€™t know the things we need to know for school? Itâ€™s the truth though. Iâ€™ve been paying close attention in science, and I still donâ€™t know how to write a lab report. But then I know all this random info thatâ€™s not school related.
