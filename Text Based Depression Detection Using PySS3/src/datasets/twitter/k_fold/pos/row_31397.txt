Anybody ever heard of SHP? It's a non profit that makes beds for people who can't afford them. Foster families, families in poverty, people who lost their homes in the fires, etc. They have chapters across the us. It's really fun attending a build day, and they are always looking for volunteers. Plus it's outside and most people seem to respect the mask policy. If you want to help your community or do some free woodworking I recommend looking for your nearest chapter. There was a build today across the us so there won't be another one for at least a week or two, but signing up in advance is always a good idea. Plus you get a tshirt when you sign up online.
