You either die a teen or live long enough to become your dad Idk, when I was younger I told myself that I wouldn't be like my dad when I grew up, but now I'm noticing more and more similarities between our behaviour. I now say things and think: "wow, that's something my dad would say", and even when watching movies in the common room I see myself striking his movie-watching pose. There are other smaller similarities I've noticed too. Just wondering if this is normal or not? (Btw, I love my dad. He used to be scary when I was younger, but as I've grown up I started standing my own ground which he respects.)
