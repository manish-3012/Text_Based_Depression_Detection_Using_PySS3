My crushâ€™s best friend has a crush on me because I spent time with my crush In short:
 I got a crush on this girl so  I spent more time with her and her friend groups and my friends 
Then discovered that she just got a bf so I spent less time with her 
But now I discovered that because I spent time with her friends her best friend now has a crush on me and now even tough i didnâ€™t have a crush on the first girl  (idk how to say it ) I know think I have one again.
And now I donâ€™t have any chances with my crush because she probably sees me as her best friend crush

So in very very short 
My crushâ€™s best friend has a crush on me because I spent time with my crush and now itâ€™s impossible that I am ever gonna be with my crush
