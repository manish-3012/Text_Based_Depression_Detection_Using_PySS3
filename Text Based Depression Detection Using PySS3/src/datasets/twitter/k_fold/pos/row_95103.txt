girls are so nice. i got my hair dyed and i posted to my private story on snap. every girl slid up with shit like â€œomg that looks so goodâ€ or â€œWTF THATS SO CUTEâ€

meanwhile, a guy said: â€œwow not bad for a chinese girlâ€ (keep in mind iâ€™m not even chinese iâ€™m literally hispanic lmao). and another said â€œyou look so uglyðŸ˜â€ which was a joke i guess but still why can none of the guys i know just be seriousðŸ˜ª
