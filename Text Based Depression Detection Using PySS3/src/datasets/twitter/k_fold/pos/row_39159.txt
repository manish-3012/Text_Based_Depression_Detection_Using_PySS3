r/teenagers sexuality poll results (so far) So far out of the 59 participants

 28 are heterosexual

4 are homosexual

9 are bisexual

3 are pansexual

4 are asexual

And 11 are other

Those are the results I about expected, however I also thought that the numbers for gay and bi would be more comparable. The poll is still up tho, if you want to vote for some reason.
