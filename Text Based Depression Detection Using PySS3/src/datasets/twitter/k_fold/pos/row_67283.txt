Just got told to leave social media Just got told by my dad that i will be never allowed again on to social media. This means that i can just say goodbye to wanting to be a freelancer or streamer. The reason of this was because I REPLIED to a comment. He thought I was to young to say my opinion. It wasnt even anything offensive. This will be my goodbye from reddit for probably 4 years.
