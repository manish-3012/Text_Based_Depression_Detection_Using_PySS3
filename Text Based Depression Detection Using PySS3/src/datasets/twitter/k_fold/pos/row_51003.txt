I just cried over simply knowing a cat died My boyfriend works at a gas station and apparently someone ran over a cat (accidentally) and brought it in asking for a bag. He had to put the dead cat in the dumpster, he said it was still warm. I have 3 cats and I have cried over just the thought of losing them even though they're young because there's no way I can handle that. I saw a dead cat in the summer on a walk, definitely fresh and it still fucks with me to think about. I also saw one of my cats die of a seizure and the only thing worse than watching her die is seeing her limp body be put in the box to be cremated. I'm reliving all of this and so upset there are no words for it. I feel so bad for my bf who i cant even hug bc my family has to quarantine (my dad works in a nursing home with active rona cases, we're not sick but are just being safe), and that he had to deal with that, because he absolutely adores cats and owns 3 as well. And he has to keep working like nothing happened and I know hes hurting and I cant help him. God this is fucking horrible I can't handle it
