What do you guys do after a bad exam So I just took my biology exam which is worth 60% of the year's grade and it went pretty bad. I studied more than a month in advance and put focus into certain areas that didn't come up. Instead they tested a lot of the parts that I skimmed through/forgot about. Anyway I do know that these grades are worth close to nothing since I'm a high schooler and hey, if you zoom out a bit they barely make an impact on the world. So that's not the problem--I know that grades aren't everything at this level but how do I stop feeling like shit??
