I am a lame loser and there is nothing wrong with that Don't go and say "no" or "you're beautiful" idc i am a lame loser don't argue against that

I know myself more than you do

While normal dweebs don't like to hangout with people or don't want to go to parties and instead play videogames with their online friends i don't want to play videogames even

I just want to be alone

I think this sums it up

I am a lame loser and there is nothing wrong with that 

I don't enjoy comedy, the office was a pain for me to watch... i felt forced to watch it to just make sure that i don't like it. 6 seasons when i finally had it off

I don't like anything 

Memes suck

I hate everything and everyone 

I am a lame loser

Don't deny it

When u see a gay dude you say "you're gay and there is nothing wrong with that"

Do the same to me

I am a lame loser and there is nothing wrong with that
