I'm struggling I don't really know how to go about this but than say I'm feeling pretty shitty. I'm only a week through a nationwide lockdown and I'm already feeling more sad each day. It's destroying everything. My parents are arguing more and I feel like I'm loosing distance with my girlfriend because I can't even see her right now and I feel like our relationship isn't working and it's just not as good as it used to be. I don't know what to do.
