yes the people who make being lgbt their whole personality are annoying i'm ngl, and the funny thing is a lot of the time they're the same type of people who think patriotism is stupid because you can't chose where you're born, well you can't choose your sexuality either lol and i don't mean that i have a problem with people going to pride parades etc, but can we just admit that people who constantly mention the fact that they're lgbt for no reason are annoying lol
