So, one thing happened today . . . 10 minutes ago in a park in my city a TV reporter came up to me and ofc asked me questions . I'm gonna be on TV Infront of thousand of people .It's kinda common cuz I live in the capital. Wish it didn't happen to me . . . btw I'm an introverted, socially awkward, self-conscious 14 y/o
