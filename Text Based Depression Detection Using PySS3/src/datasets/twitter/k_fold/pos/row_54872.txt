Idk why I keep thinking about dumb shit I canâ€™t stop thinking about how I said hi to somebody months ago or the tone of voice some random person had when they talked to me the other day. If Iâ€™m gonna try this new thing I start worrying because I donâ€™t have the right equipment and then itâ€™s all wrong because I got the wrong shit and Iâ€™m mad at myself in the past. Itâ€™s so pointless help
