Fucking Alarm didn't go off Why is the name of God did my alarm not go off? Now my sleep schedule has been ruined, and my day will be shitty. I suppose I have to spend the day with a ruined sleep schedule feeling tired as fuck and having nothing to do. Of course my little brother who wakes up way earlier couldn't take a few seconds out of his day to wake me up, but that is not his job, so I'm not going to blame him. Of course now the entire schedule is broken, what am I going to do? Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
