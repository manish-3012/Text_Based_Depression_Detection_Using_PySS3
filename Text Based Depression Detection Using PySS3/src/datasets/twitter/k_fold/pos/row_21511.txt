So yeah I was talking with my friend along with some other friends while we were walking back home after ice cream and she mentioned her views on dating So yeah, me and like 3 other kids (all girls but me) were walking back home after getting ice cream cause my one friend, I'll call her Samantha, borrowed my old bike to get there but the tire popped. So basically, me, Samantha, another girl I'll name Kaitlin, and another girl I'll call Carol, are walking along, and they start talking about their views on dating. Well, Kaitlin, who I'd been questioning if I ever liked her for a while, basically said that she thinks they are pointless and would date someone if they asked but not care and probably stop quickly. So yeah, that is never gonna pan out.
