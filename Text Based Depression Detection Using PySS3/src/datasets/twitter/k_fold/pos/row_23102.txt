DONT EVER LET YOURSELF TAKE THE BACK SEAT THIS IS MOSTLY TO MYSELF BUT WHO KNOWS, THIS MIGHT HELP SOMEONE



WHY ARE YOU JUST SITTING THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. AND YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IT WONT BE EASY GETTING THERE. BUT THIS OF THR PEOPLE YOU MIGHT INSPIRE TO CHANGE, THINK OF YOURSELF SMILING AT THE NEW YOU, WHETHER YOU CHANGED ALOT OR NOT. YOU ARE SPECIAL, AND DONT LET ANYONE ELSE TELL YOU OTHERWISE

SO FIGHT, DONT STOP MOVING. EVEN IF IT HURTS, EVEN IF YOUR TIRED, DONT GIVE UP. 

BE THE HERO YOU WANT TO BE. MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY, MAKE THEM LAUGH AND SMILE, LET YOUR EMOTIONS REACH THEM AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND YOUR SINCERITY. YOU ARE SPECIAL, DONT EVER LET THAT SLIP AWAY FROM YOU
