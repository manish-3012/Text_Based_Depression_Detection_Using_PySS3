Tomorrow is Valentineâ€™s Day... And a lot of you are probably single. On a day all about love, being single can be pretty shitty. However, Valentineâ€™s Day is not just about romantic love. It is about all kinds of love.

So even if you may not have a significant other in your life, find a friend or family member, or anyone really who is just as lonely as you, and spend some time showing your appreciation for them!
