I lost all my friends, got my ass kicked, and my girlfriend broke up with me. So my life has gone to shit and I have no one to tell except you guys.

I have had a small group of friends since 2nd grade but ever since we started middle school they started acting like assholes and so did I. There was also one person in our friend group who is a little overweight and we would always bully him (I know I'm an asshole). Anyway, about a week ago we went to the mall, after about 2 hours of hanging out one of my friends decided it would be funny to push J into a puddle. So I helped J up and started to yell at the rest of them for laughing and pushing him. The friend who pushed him started saying shit about how I have no room to talk and it was just a joke, so I punched him in the face and we started to fight next thing I know I had lost. Just to add to this shitty day I had to walk to the bus stop in the rain.

I woke up the next morning to a phone call from my girlfriend long story short my friends lied and told the whole school that I tried fighting them for no reason. And because my girlfriend didn't want to be involved in drama she broke up with me (I don't blame her). Just to add salt to the wound one of my friends told me to come to the school courtyard and fight him and if I don't show up the whole school is gonna think I'm a pussy. So fuck it what do I have to lose I'm gonna kick his ass.

TL,DR: Got in a fight with my friends, my girlfriend broke up with me, and the whole school hates me
