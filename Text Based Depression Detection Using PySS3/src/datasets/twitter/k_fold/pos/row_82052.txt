Reviewing water every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 8 Day 8:
Itâ€™s officially been over a week so I just wanna tell yall to get comfortable coz we are gonna be here for a long time... 
Today I shall be reviewing just tap water. It was good, temperature was quite low which was great, but it had a bit of a weird taste to it (I donâ€™t like tap water) so Iâ€™ll give it 8/10
