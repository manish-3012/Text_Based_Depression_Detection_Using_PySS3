Is DropShipping safe and smart? I am setting up a gaming setup and redecorating and have found multiple videos on drop shipping and dont know if its smart.  I have heard of people doing it and making money off of it and I have also heard of people completely falling on there face after losing 100-200 dollar setting up there company.  I feel like its a great Idea and can make money but I don't know if its smart.   I am starting to also invest in stocks and such but I never heard of it until recently is a safe and smart Idea for me to start a dropshipping business?
