I want you guys to tell me places you used to go or memories you had. I know itâ€™s only been 6 months but so many memories keep flying past my head. I remember I used to go to NYC for Christmas and chill around but now I canâ€™t even go over there because of whatâ€™s happened with COVID.  I want people to tell me memories about themselves and places they used to go. I just want a normal life again, everyone does ;-;
