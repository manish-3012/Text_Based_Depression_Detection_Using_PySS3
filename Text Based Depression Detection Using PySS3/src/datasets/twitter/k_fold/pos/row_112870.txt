My catâ€™s dying Sheâ€™s been losing a lot of weight recently, very quickly too, in the last couple of days sheâ€™s only ate a very little bit when I actively fed her, and when I picked her up today she just kinda, laid limp in my arms, she was awake and breathing but wouldnâ€™t move at all. Iâ€™ve had her since I was a child and sheâ€™s only like 9 years old. 

Iâ€™m not ready to lose her.
