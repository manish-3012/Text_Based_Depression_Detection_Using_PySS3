I'm going back to real school this month. My country decided it would be a good idea to go back to school this month. Like real school, not online. I am just happy I'm not in America or I'd just not go. Honestly don't know if it's a good time yet but idk I have to go anyway. Wish me luck hope I don't catch covid.
