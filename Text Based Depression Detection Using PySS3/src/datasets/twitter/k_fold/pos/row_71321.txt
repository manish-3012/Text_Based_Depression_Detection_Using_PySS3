Tomorrow's my first day of college! ...ngl Iâ€™m super nervous, not only is the campus a 30 minute drive, (today was the first day that I drove alone) but I feel like Iâ€™m unprepared.. and my schedule is wack;   
 
good news is, a college semester is smaller in that 1 of my classes only lasts for a quarter (program and development) and the others end earlier than when I was at highschool (Dec 10 opposed to like the 20th), I only have 1 class tomorrow from 10-11:30, (intro to engineering) so I guess itâ€™s not that bad 
 
I just feel like Iâ€™m not ready, Im lazy and after I get a job in the next month itâ€™s gonna feel like shock... Iâ€™ve never really done anything and lack common sense...  
 
 
anyway,  thanks for reading this far and I hope you have a great day
