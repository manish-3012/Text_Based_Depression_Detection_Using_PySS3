I'm trying to find more "Need/Make friends" subreddits. Do you guys know any I may have missed? I've been making daily help posts on subreddits like these and I want to expand it to as many subreddits as I can. So far I post on:

r/teenagers
r/lonely
r/chat
r/makenewfriendshere
r/meetpeople
r/needafriend
and I just found r/friendship, so I'm adding that to the list

Does anyone have any suggestions?
