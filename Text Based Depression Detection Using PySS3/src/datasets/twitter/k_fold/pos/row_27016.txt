Anybody trynna go on a date with me. I got reservation at a McDonald's Alright, here's how it's gonna go. First, I'm gonna pull up on my Lamborghini Aventedor, aka my 1998 Honda Civic. BTW I named my car 'Lamborghini Aventedor' cuz the engine sounds like one but different kind of sound. Next: you gonna throw up on the way cuz of all the smell of gas from the back of the car. See, now you hungry. Then we go to McDonald's, and I eat so much that I get a heart attack, and then you call 911, cuz you're a nice person. Then I don't remember anything after that, cuz I wake up from coma 5 days later. Now you gotta tell me in details of what happened after my heart attack.
