I went out on my first date Wassup y'all I'm 15 and I just went on my first date. Since there's a pandemic we went on a little walk together and just talked about stuff, laughed and all that good stuff. The thing is I don't know if she likes me, granted she was very nervous while talking to me (that could be a good sign) and I can say the exact same thing for myself but she did end the date early. The convos we had were good and pretty fun but I need to know, if there's any girls on this subreddit. What hints would you drop on a date if you liked the guy, and what would you do if you didn't?
