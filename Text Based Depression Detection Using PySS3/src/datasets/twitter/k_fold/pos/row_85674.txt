My brother just made me cry I (14F) have my older brother (16M) who decided to be really fucking stupid. 

"Girls and women don't know anything" and "You need to ask men, not women" 

So, I started crying. Like a lot. 

When he asked me why, I looked at him dead in the eyes and went "I'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're just so fucking stupid."

Needless to say he was pissed. And I literally cried because he was too stupid.
