Let's get this straight "If you don't want me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best" is not an excuse to be an asshole. There's a big difference between a bad day, and being a piece of shit. And "Sorry, I'm a (Zodiac Sign)" doesn't apply either. The way billion year old stars are placed in the sky doesn't determine what you do. You screwed up because its an accident. Not because a star told you too.
