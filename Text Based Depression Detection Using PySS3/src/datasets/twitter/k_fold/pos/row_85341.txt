Anyone in the GTA want to hang out? I know this is a shot in the dark but is there anyone on here from the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) that would like to hangout?

I really want to make new friends but I'm like really shitty at talking to people online so I was hoping I could meet some people in person.

There's like 6 million people in the GTA figure a few could be on here.

We can just like go to McDonalds or y'all can going shopping while I follow you making sarcastic jokes and bad puns, or whatever. 

Lemme know.
