I guess I should've wanted a PS4 before the pandemic. On Tuesday, I decided I wanted to invest in a PS4. It was like 6 PM, stores were closing, but I gathered my money for the next day.

Wednesday, we check stores online, only 1 Walmart in my city has any in stock. Best Buy had one too, but they were closed. We head over, and they don't. Manager in the technology department says they haven't gotten a truck in 3 weeks. We bought Persona 5 Royal, it was on sale and I wanted it anyway. 

Thursday, we check Best Buy website, and they're out of stock. We check some other stores, and they're out of stock as well. Day ends poorly.

Friday, we check ebay and Amazon. Mom won't let me buy pre owned, but any new cost at least 60 dollars more than usual. Can't afford that, so no options online.

Conclusion: I guess I won't be getting that PS4, least not any time soon. And to make it worse, I now have to look at a game I really want to play, but can't every time I wake up.
