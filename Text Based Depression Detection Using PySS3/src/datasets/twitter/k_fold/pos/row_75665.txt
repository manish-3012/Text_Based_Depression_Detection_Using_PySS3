help please hi everyone ok so this is whatâ€™s going on- i met this girl on discord through my friends right? weâ€™ve been just playing minecraft and whatnot. just hanging out. and then a couple days ago my friend told me that she liked me, which was really obvious, come to think about it. BUT the problem is, she lives in a different state (about 900 miles away). i really like her but weâ€™re only 14 and theres no chance of us actually being together irl. i just dont know what to do. ik that it probably wouldnâ€™t work out if we tried long distance, but i want her so much. any advice will be appreciated.
