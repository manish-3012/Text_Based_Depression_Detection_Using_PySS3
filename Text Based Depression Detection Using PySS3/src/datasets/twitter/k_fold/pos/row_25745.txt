Yo, I'd appreciate if you all could help donate or promote my schools charity event for the Beatson Cancer Charity My school is running an event where students will attempt to to run, walk or cycle a cumulative total  1290 miles. Whilst we've exceeded the goal, I feel like a dick because I can't do it due to the app for it requires a higher ios than my phone has. 

So if you enjoy the thought of hundreds of fellow teens and several teachers running, walking or cycling in surprisingly hot weather then please promote or donate!
