What's up with the "new car" girl? Okay ik im a dumbass. I saw this post about 3 (or 4 maybe??) days back in this subreddit where a blonde girl in a brown hoodie is holding a key and says she got her first car. And today I came back to reddit and my home page is filled with her memes. Can someone pls explain?
