Online or in person school So, our first 9 weeks ends next week. I have done the school year so far online. But, weâ€™re allowed to go in person. Unfortunately Friday is the last day that weâ€™re allowed to make the final decision of wanting to stay online or in person. I have all Aâ€™s in my classes, but I feel like Iâ€™m not learning anything and itâ€™s kinda stressing me out. In person school is even more stressful for me but I would learn more. So the question is, should I stay online or go in person?
