So itâ€™s almost midnight Iâ€™m still doing school work from today, thatâ€™s due at midnight. But the thing is Iâ€™m not really tired and I was wondering if I should stay up and complete the assignments for school for tomorrow and then sleep so that way I have the whole day to do whatever. Iâ€™ve been going to sleep around the same time every night because of school like right now, itâ€™s 11:37. My teachers have really been giving us a lot of work, and Iâ€™m honestly already tired of it so I know I would feel better waking up knowing I already did my work than waking up, procrastinating, and then complaining later on that they give us a lot of work when half the time I get distracted....kinda like rn. Anyway that was it, should I just do all of my work now?
