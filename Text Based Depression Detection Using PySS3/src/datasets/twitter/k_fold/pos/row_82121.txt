Living in this world is kinda tiring and I hope that we change I understand the privilege I have to even be speaking out about this right now, but Iâ€™m just so tired. People are dying left and right fighting for human rights. There are people praising Ruth Bader Ginsburgâ€™s death. Some people are even wishing for Donald Trump to die and Iâ€™m not a Trump supporter, but no one deserves to die. I donâ€™t agree with his personality but heâ€™s still human guys. Iâ€™m tired of people not supporting the right to a womanâ€™s abortion and while I understand the religious aspect behind it, itâ€™s a choice. You arenâ€™t forced to get one. And those are the same people that look at a struggling mom of 6 from a low income neighborhood and telling her sheâ€™s a whore and that sheâ€™s irresponsible because she has too many kids. Which is it? Iâ€™m tired of people dying because theyâ€™re black. Being locked up because their black. In what world would a pedophile and child molester get a lesser sentence than someone who sold drugs because they were trying to make ends meet. I know selling isnâ€™t the only way but if you had the opportunity to make thousands in a weekend to support your starving family, you would do it too. Iâ€™m so tired of the LGBTQ+ community being hurt and told theyâ€™re going to hell because they love someone. If you say that the Bible said so, that was man made in an era that they needed to instill fear in order to keep power. God said love everyone. Iâ€™m tired of people ignoring the fact that Earth is being damaged left and right and we canâ€™t do anything about it because money is more important. Earth is dying. Itâ€™s a sad world we live in today and I pray that it gets better. Iâ€™m tired of being tired.
