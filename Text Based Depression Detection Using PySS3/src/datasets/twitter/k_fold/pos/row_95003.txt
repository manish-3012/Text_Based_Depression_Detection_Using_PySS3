fcuk my school that's all we had a math exam last week Wednesday and like 80students took the exam and now it got canceled because apparently the teacher gave homework to 6 or 7 students which apparently had same kind of questions and that's why now whole 11th grade students are going to have an exam tomorrow, and I forgot all the things I knew sooo that's all, nice right
