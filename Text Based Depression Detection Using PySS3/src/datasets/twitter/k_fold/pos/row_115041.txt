Random thought #58 It annoys me how I get bored of video games. I like games with lots of replayability  or looong difficult games so I don't get bored of them quickly. I got a computer for christmas, and I've tried getting games that have good replayability. Mostly rouge likes/lites 

I got hades, brought mom home and now I feel like I'm finished. That's the thing, if a game actually has a story and I finish it, my brain is just like "okay I'm done now" I'm not a person who wants to 100% games other then, Lego games when I was 8 and one exception which is gungeon, but it doesn't feel like I go out of my way to try and earn things in that. 

I have star bound, finished the story and for now I'm bored. 

I got dead by daylight and all the dlc, I'm currently not playing it often but I feel like I'll come and go from it. 

I have league of legends. I've had it for a while now and I'm still really enjoying it. 

I have skul hero slayer and I'm enjoying it currently, but I got it only two days ago and now I'm done with the story as of today, so I might get bored but I feel like it'll last a bit longer. 

I have lots of others, but my dumb brain is like "nope that's boring now." 

I would replay octopath traveler on switch but the boost button (which you need to beat the game) is broken for my remotes and I can't rebind.
