I hate people in relationships. Let me finish. If you're in a relationship, that's fine, but there has to be a point where every other post in this subreddit is "OMG MY CRUSH SAID YES!!" I understand people are excited, but why don't you tell anyone else who knows who you are and how important this is to you instead of using your relationship as a way to get fake internet points. Can someone please tell me why people do this because I legitimately don't understand and it's starting to piss me off.
