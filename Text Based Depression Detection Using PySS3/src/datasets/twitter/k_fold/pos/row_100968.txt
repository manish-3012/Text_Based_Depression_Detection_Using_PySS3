Unpopular opinion: They/Them pronouns are a bit confusing. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the folks who prefer these pronouns. But considering the fact that the words They and Them are already used for something else, which is groups of people, it gets a bit confusing for someone who has no visual or auditory context for this. Basically when reading something.

The sentence: "They were pretty awesome at that party" without context could refer to both a group of people, or one person. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having the word for one person.

I read an article many years back about how a gender neutral pronoun was going to be coined, called "Ze" or something similar, and I don't understand why you guys would settle for an existing pronoun than having your own.

This is just my opinion, and I would very much like to be corrected if my facts are wrong. I'm all for the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry if my words seem offensive in any way.
