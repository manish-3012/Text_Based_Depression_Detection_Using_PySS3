Sand sculpture revenge Ok so I just remembered this story from 2 years back, when I was at the beach. I love making sculptures out of sand even though they turn out pretty lame. 

So I was at the beach enjoying my day with nothing to worry about, making a sand-man (snowman but with sand) kind of thing. I even put sticks as the arms and some shells as hair. He was a handsome young man. While I was washing my hands, after looking for some shells, I saw these dudes who walked up to my sand-man (sandy from here) and just kicked it. Like KICKED IT as if he had done something wrong to them. Sand and shells flew everywhere-is what it looked like. From my eyes, I watched Sandy's insides come out. All his guts and organs flew around in every direction possible, all while the dudes where laughing. I had the sudden urge to go and mess with them. But as the good boy I am, and didn't. 

 I walked up to Sandy and promised a blood oath of vengeance. Only Sandy's head was buried that day...

So, I put my brain into overdrive. I decide to build another one, Sandy pt. II. But this Sandy was not like the other. It was stronger, faster, more aggressive, and massive. Must have come up to 45cm (approx 1.5 ft). Sandy pt. II was built right behind Sandy, so that the dudes will be able to see it again. And they did. They walked up to it laughing, and they all started kicking it.

There was a sudden cry of pain from the group. Little did they know, I had actually implanted as many stones with sharp edges I could find inside Sandy pt. II. 2 of them started bleeding.

The drops of blood that fell on that spot that day, was Sandy's revenge. It also stands as a mark- a reminder if you will, that pain befalls those who crushes sand sculptures.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
