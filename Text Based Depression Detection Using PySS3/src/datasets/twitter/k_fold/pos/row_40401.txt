I seem to have depressive episodes I am starting to measure their duration and the time they are going to appear.

People, that I consider close in my life think, that I am doing this for attention. I am introvert and I hate it when I get a lot of attention. I don't get enough attention, but like... Why would I want to be sad to get attention...

I was happy for a week or so and I became sad for no apparent reason.

How do you overcome these episodes?
