I'm just here living life Just finished vibing to Mariah Carey's All I want for Christmas in my dorm room. I don't care if it's out of season. I fucking love that song idgaf. Had to get it out of my system. I'll save Nat King Cole and the classics for December. Y'know, the 24 days before Christmas are 200% better than Christmas day no cap.
