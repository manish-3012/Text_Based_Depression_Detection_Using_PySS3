I found out my roommate has a brain tumor My roommate told me yesterday he has a brain tumor. I was shocked because he has been such a good friend of mine. We both go to a programming school in europe and we have had so much fun these past 2 years. He is hospitalised right now and i dont know what should I do to make him feel better? I have tried telling him that the survival rate is pretty high on younger people but he isnt convinced and is feeling down all the time. You guys should go and cheer him up.
