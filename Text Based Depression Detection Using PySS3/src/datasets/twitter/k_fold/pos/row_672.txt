I hate how people's life's suck so wanna hear an embarrassing story to maybe cheer you up? Right so I was listening to my little pony songs and having a yt reccomendations nostalgia trip and I remembered a really embarrassing thing about me.
So when I was like 8 my school was doing a talent show and nobody in my class volunteered so my teacher made my friend do it and she got me and another friend to do it. We chose to sing under our spell from the mlp rainbow rocks movie (btw them girls watching them back have a weird tension about them), I was originally a backup singer but main girl couldn't handle the role so I took it and I sung my little heart out and we got to the finals but we lost to someone singing a Bruno mars song or something idk. I was sad we lost because I was 8 and I really just sung in front of hella people only to loose. ( didn't matter to me because the prize was a tennis racket and a ball from Poundland) oh well, now I've remembered this I have a massive flex on people because I went and did that. What a power move. 8 year old me was a mythic person 10/10 would do again. Tl;dr, Sung mlp song at school talent show, gigachad move, didn't win.
