Welp, single again. Boyfriend of two months broke up with me because he wanted to spend all of his time playing video games with his friends. I feel... idk, useless? Numb? Like he chose video games over me... what was the point of even dating if this was gonna happen. He also tried to blame me for him breaking up with me, and tried victimizing himself as well.
