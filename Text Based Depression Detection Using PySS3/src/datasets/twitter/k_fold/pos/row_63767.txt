Two people in my class have tested positive and five more are out sick, but my school hasn't quarantined the class because three people PER CLASSROOM, not even the whole school, ONE CLASS, must test positive first. This is the most BULLSHIT unsafe thing ever. People are fucking dropping like flies out of class, like half of some of my classes or more are on zoom now. They aren't preventing any fucking spread this is bullshit. They aren't even enforcing the mask thing either it's just like a guideline rather than a rule. And I can't fucking leave school because I'll get in trouble even though I'm LITERALLY TRYING NOT TO GIVE MY MOM AND SISTER PERMANENT ORGAN DAMAGE.

Help
