I want to know, does anybody else do this? I don't really have any in person friends, I never have. I think a large part of the problem is me, I push people away. I get really attached to people really quickly, I don't know if this is just the way I am, or because of my lack of socialization, my guess is its a little of both. The problem with this is my emotional attachment to people, it's very hard to let go.

Whenever I get even the slightest bit close to people, I realize that I don't deserve them. Im not good enough, I don't deserve peoples time. I feel like that for the other person, time spent with me is wasted. Im not funny, im not charismatic, I look like hell, and I don't know when I carry things too far. Because of this, I separate from people and push them away.

Im sorry you guys had to hear this but I needed to get it out somewhere. I hope you understand, thank you for reading.
