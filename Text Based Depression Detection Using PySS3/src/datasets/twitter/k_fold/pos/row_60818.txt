Getting yelled at by idiots on Snap trying to cancel me for a song Iâ€™m listening to. Iâ€™m getting yelled at by 13 and 14 year old girls because Iâ€™m listening to a song that says queer cock is the best cock, and is apparently â€œhomophobicâ€. Iâ€™m not even homophobic I just screw around with that type of humor. What should I do. Btw right now Iâ€™m just laughing at them saying I donâ€™t care which I really donâ€™t care at all.
