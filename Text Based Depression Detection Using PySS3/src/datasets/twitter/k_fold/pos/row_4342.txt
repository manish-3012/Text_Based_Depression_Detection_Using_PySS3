WHAT'S UP FELLOW KIDS! How'd you like to join a totally normal Minecrafter server that just happens to be modded? Please. We're board and need more people on the server. The server itself is already paid for, so you just need to install the mods!

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this seems like a lot, but honestly, setting everything up takes AT MOST 30 minutes. If you're interested, DM me and read the stuff below! We have up to 60 open slots on the server at a time and a discord.

Hey! Our server is a modded Minecrafter server that uses mods designed to run on the latest version of Forge. We have several mods including an advanced electrical mod, Flan's gun mod, Modern Warfare mod, nuclear mod and several more! The server is a psuedo-roleplay where you take on the role of a specific country. You can be any country you want, as long as it isn't taken and you must follow the rules below:

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic or the like. Really, just don't be a dick.
* If you want to have an official war with someone, YOU MUST DECLARE IT IN THE UN MEETINGS. (yes, we have a UN tower that's a work in progress)
* Don't harass other players
* Have fun
* Feel free to use the nukes, but don't nuke the UN. That is safe grounds
* For heaven's sake, and for the sake of all that's holy, DON'T USE THE F!@#ING BALEFIRE BOMB.

&amp;#x200B;

**BASES:**

When you join in, we'll either let you go into creative for 30 minutes to build a base, or we might give you the materials, as some of the materials are a little OP. Feel free to build bases away from the UN, but you should have one near the UN, preferably your main one.

&amp;#x200B;

**PC REQUIREMENTS:**

I can run the server pretty well with a 64 bit system and 8 GB of ram. You don't need a high-end computer, but you really can't have one that's too slow.

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPORTANT:**

I should note that we do use a service called Forge for the mods. The server is already set up. You are not paying for anything, if anything you're just installing the Forge client which allows your Minecraft app to interpret the mods. Forge is not malware, it is a documented and highly reliable service. If you don't believe me, google it! If you don't already have it you WILL HAVE TO INSTALL FORGE. For some reason having to put in 10 minutes worth of work is a turnoff for some people... **IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS OR GET STUCK, ASK ME!**
