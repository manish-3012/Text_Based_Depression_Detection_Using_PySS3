I feel like a fool. Im sorry to put this here, you don't have to read anything, i just need to write this in front of me so i can try and see the truth.
Im a fool. There's so many things to it. I need to get a hang of it.
I want to be better with my frienda, the little that i have, before they fade away. Before i fade away, before i make them fade away.
I don't know who i am ive never told anyone in my life how i feel ive always had trouble with that. I want to feel the true compassionate friendship o hear so many have. I want to feel what that's like. I want to spend enough time with a friend for them to feel like family. I had that once, i think. They were using me because i brought them gifts.
I listion in to conversations at school about people spending so much time at there friends house that it feels like another home to them. Ive always wanted that, although ive always been scared of what they would think of my home or what they'd think of me. If they are just spending time with me because they petty me. Ive been afraid of trying to make friends with someone because how could they be friends with someone that changes the way they act and feel every hour.
I got diagnosed with autism  recently, ive always known something was wrong. People have always made me the center of attention in public because they find how i act funny.
I know its going to happen all my friends are going to fade away, and because i will soon i will lack the circumstance of being in the same class as a preexisting friend, i will lose those friends. 
I don't know anything.
I just feel like a fool.
