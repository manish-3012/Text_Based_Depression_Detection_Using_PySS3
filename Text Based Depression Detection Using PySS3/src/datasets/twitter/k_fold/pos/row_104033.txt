I liked this one girl in my class OK so I met this girl in my class around late 2019, she was 2 years older than me (I think) and she was just the funniest, cutest and prettiest girl I've ever seen. She was into the same things I was into aswell, the only bad thing is I only really got to know more about her a few days before school closed and I think she liked me back. The thing is I knew her for 3 years and the worst part is I only knew her first name and I was too shy to ask for an Instagram so she's now a Jane doe, I unless I get lucky and she pops up on tiktok.,ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
