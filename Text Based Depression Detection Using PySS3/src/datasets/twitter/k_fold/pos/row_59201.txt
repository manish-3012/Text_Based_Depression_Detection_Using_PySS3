Reddit is looking grumpy today. A negative post of mine addressing an unpopular opinion received disagreement, ahm - in *defense* of loving diarrhea. 

A positive post of mine encouraging stoicism and strength against inner and outer adversity was greeted with semi-educated counter analysis.

My positive vibe failed. My negative vibe also hit wrong. Seems my safest best is posting some skeletal figure doing mundane tasks if I want to stay in neutral territory.
