Tried telling my parents about my mental health issues (primarily depression), it failed My parents used the statements:

* It's all in your head
* We provide you with everything, why would you be so ungrateful?
* It's just hormones, stop overreacting
* People have it worse than you, stop being so dramatic
* Depression doesn't exist, you can overcome it easily

This happened a few days ago, but I still feel awful.
