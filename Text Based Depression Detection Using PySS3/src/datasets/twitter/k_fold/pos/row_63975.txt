Lmao I know it isnâ€™t true for most people But my mom looked into astrology a little and what I have actually describes me well

Sun of libra, moon of Scorpio, and rising of Scorpio

I am fair and just, indecisive, self pitying, and diplomatic most of the time

But I have a short and fiery temper and I lose all of that if Iâ€™m angry

Also I can read emotions well

I know this isnâ€™t actually true for the relation but I just found it interesting
