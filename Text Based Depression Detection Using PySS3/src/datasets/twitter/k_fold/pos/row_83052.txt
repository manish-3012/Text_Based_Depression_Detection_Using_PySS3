Do y'all ever get sad when you realize the nice bubbly kids who you went to my elementary and middle school with are now just depressed alcoholics and nicotine addicts Maybe it's just me, but that shift from 5th to 6th grade and the shift from 8th grade to 9th is kinda scary. I feel like in middle school people discovered nic and now have raging nicotine addictions at 16,17, and 18. Why are these things so normalized. I only care because my dad is a nicotine addict and he's been dealing with it for 30+ years and I know he's tried to quit multiple times in my lifetime to no avail. It just makes me sad for my peers. It just can't be that enjoyable anymore. In middle school it went from stealing parents e-cigs and sipping on their vodka to now having a personal device and bottles under beds in highschool.


I'm not trying to shame anyone with an addiction either, let me just make that clear. It's just been on my mind and there is nothing I can do to help my friends/ peers since they just brush off my concerns. And with these rumors of flavored juiced being banned some of my friends are saying they'll just switch to cigs, and I desperately do not want to see that happen.
