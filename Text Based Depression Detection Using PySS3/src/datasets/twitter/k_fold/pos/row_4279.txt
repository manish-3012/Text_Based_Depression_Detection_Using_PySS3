Moving in with another single mom, and coming out to my son  Hi everyone.  I'm a single mom (by choice), living in an Asian country      where same sex marriage is not yet legal.  I met a wonderful woman    who's   in a similar situation as myself (single mom) and we have been    dating   for more than a year now.  We moved in together recently,    however, we   still haven't had a "talk" with our sons yet. They are    both teenagers   and we are not sure how to approach this in the best    way possible.  Any   advice from this community will be much    appreciated.
