Note: Fandom reviews belongs to u/sincyd06 you can share but dont steal my reviews! thx :)  


part 1: under in a tail  
 Undertale has to be in 2nd place for the most toxic fandom I ever reviewed. People can be extremely toxic and hell, Maybe flash death threats at people over a fictional game..  


im not fucking joking when I say "flash death threats."  


IM NOT FUCKING JOKING  
 [How Markiplier should have responded to the death threats he recived for playing Undertale :: Undertale DiscussÃµes Gerais (steamcommunity.com)](https://steamcommunity.com/app/391540/discussions/0/350540780276142149/?l=portuguese) 

So yeah. A bunch of degenerates telling people to die in a fire over them killing a fictional goat. What a fucking joke y'know..  


Multiple youtubers were threatened by fans of undertale encouraging them to &gt;!commit suicide !&lt;  
of course that led to many people disccusing the fandom's toxic core   
rpg monger's video (i think i butchered his name):  [How Undertale Got Its "TOXIC" Fandom - The Fandom Files - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriClv7DLl8)  (also hes my inspiration for making this series :)  


part 2: goat mom fuckwit   
fangirls are fucking crazy  
sans fangirls are worse than that  


&gt;!yes people actually wanna have sex with sans
I did not have to express that in any other way..!&lt;  


the fetish side of undertale...I cant explain it....I fucking cant explain it...  
god almighty what the FUCK IS THAT?  


Undertale's fandom has grown less toxic over the last couple of years. People moved on from undertale (such as me) Undertale has improved and I like that fandoms like undertale redeem themselves by 3%.  


part 3: conclusions  


overall I dont hate the fandom. I only hate what the fandom DOES. people going as far as telling other to&gt;! end themselves!&lt; is fucking cruel and I wont be giving undertale a good view after that.  


but fandoms cant ruin games so i cant talk shit about undertale.  


the end.  


  
what should I review next
