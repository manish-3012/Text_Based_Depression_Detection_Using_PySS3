In September they told us that they were getting a divorce. In September my parents told my brother and I, that they were getting a divorce. 6 months later nothing has happened. No talking to us about the plans for the divorce, no nothing. I'm not sure if I should ask them about it, but idk just really scared to. Why am I scared? I'm not even sure. I'm pretty sure that they decided to not get a divorce any more, but idk because no one has mentioned anything about it since. Ever since COVID started last year things between my mom and dad have just gotten really bad, especially during the summer. Luckily, in the past month or so, things have been better so yay :D. Ack I've just been like confused abou what to do, like how I can help them if that makes sense idkkk. I'm sorry it's 12:46am and I randomly have emotional why-do I-exist-thoughts at 1 am so yay pog hello :)

I've kept this to my self, havent told anyone. Not even to my closest friend (HI PIE55 UR AMAZING WHATS POPPIN U MIGHT SEE THIS IF U SCROLL THRO MY PROFILE LOLLLL) who I literally tell everything to her. I'm not sure why I havent told her yet because she is the most supportive and amazing person I know. I'm not sure why. I'm just afraid to I guess.  (Well now she knows cuz sometimes she stalks my profile lmao hi Pie55 now u know thro a reddit post lol) I've mentioned to her that things have been kinda bad at home but nothing really more than that.

I'm just very confused on what to do, what to say, and just like everything(ha I probably said idk like 1000 times sorry)

Idk why I'm telling the 5 random people (+ my friends who stalk my profile) that'll see this but just needed to get it off of my chest. But thanks for listening (well I guess reading) it means a lot have a nice day &lt;333 :DDD
