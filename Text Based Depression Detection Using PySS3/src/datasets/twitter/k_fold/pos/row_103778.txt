My time has come I'm leaving this sub for good. No, i didnt turn 20 or anything, i just dont think its worth spending my time here anymore. Its mostly just people who are way too young making popularly liked statements and then acting like they are the first to say it.

So bye r/teenagers, thanks for the one friend i got from you
