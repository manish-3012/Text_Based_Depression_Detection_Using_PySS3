update, TL:DR at bottom so a few days ago i made a post about how me and my gf broke up. well thanks to my best friend who iâ€™m forever grateful for, gave me some news that made me happy that i got out of that relationship.

so he told me that she said to her best friend that she was going to make a move on my best friend once we were broken up. thankfully tho, he wonâ€™t let her do that because he knows what that would do to me. 

the other news that made me happy, a few months ago she went to a party, she didnâ€™t tell me whoâ€™s party (but i donâ€™t really mind) 
and that she actually cheated on me while at said party. 

now that i know that iâ€™m so happy i got out of that relationship and not speaking to her anymore. sorry for this being a bit long but just needed to get it off my chest.

TL:DR: got news that my gf i recently broke up with wants to make a move on my best friend (but he wonâ€™t let it happen) and she cheated on me at a party a few months ago. iâ€™m happy i got out of that relationship now...
