are u guys actually awkward when talking to the opposite gender? look Iâ€™m a girl and I donâ€™t find it that hard to talk to guys. Iâ€™m not awkward or anything at all when talking to them. I have a class with all guys except for me and they treat me the same as they do to each other and donâ€™t act weird when talking to me. I donâ€™t know if people just say online itâ€™s hard for them to talk to the opposite gender or what? do you guys actually find it hard to talk to the other gender??
