My semester is about to start and I'm a little disappointed my school is handling the pandemic so well Is it selfish of me? Yes, 100% but I really expected us to all have the exact same scheduling and treatment but they're handling it super well, no more than a few people in the library and other buildings, all classes are online unless it's a class that has to be in person, and even then not many people are in one classroom at a time. I think masks are mandatory too, the guidance counselor even put a big plastic wall in a room that separates the student and her and says it's a "mask free zone" to help people be more comfortable. Why do I wish they didnt handle it so well? Cause I am a very social person, since quarantine I've been out with a friend once, which is already too much. I cant see my friends because we dont have the same classes so I'm back to where I was before, but this is for the best so I'll suck it up
