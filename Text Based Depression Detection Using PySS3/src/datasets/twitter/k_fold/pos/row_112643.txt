Should I ditch my friends on Halloween Iâ€™m in a friend group for no reason other than the fact that my best friend is dating someone in that group.. and Iâ€™m meant to go with that group for Halloween. To add onto that theyâ€™re all dating, like every single person in that group is dating someone else in the group. I would be 7th wheeling all night and my friend is promising not to exclude me but itâ€™s happened before :/ .. I kinda lost touch with all my friends because of covid but Iâ€™m thinking about ditching them and asking on my Instagram story if anyone wants to hangout on Halloween... WOULD THAT BE WEIRD... Iâ€™m also worried that my friends will see it and get mad at me for ditching them. Do you guys think itâ€™s a dumb idea..
