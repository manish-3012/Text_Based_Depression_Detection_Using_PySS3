My smartass faked being sick fearing its gonna get worse...now its on my conscience Yesterday my nose had a flood and bleeding DLC so as this is rare i want to stay home who knows it may get worse...my mother avoids this untill its serious and i faked stomachache with diarrhea

Now i want to kill myself as i have a math test (algebra) which if i go i am bound to get F/1 ...Covid situation in my city(10000 resident) is shit...and for some reason we are not closing shit nor we do anything actually...i really fear this because its reported that 15 from my school (1 in second group of my class) are positive and shitton is in isolation.....Should have posted on AITA but this is a thing we teenagers encountered at least once
