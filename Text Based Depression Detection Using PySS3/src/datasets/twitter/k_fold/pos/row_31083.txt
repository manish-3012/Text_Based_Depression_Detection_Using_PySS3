Iâ€™m too nice and a pushover The two instances that exemplify this best are as follows: 1. Some kid point blank threw a basketball at my face (he said he was trying to make me flinch by throwing it by my face but missed). I just kinda swore under my breath a lot walking away, not telling anyone. 2. Some dumbass I sit behind in class turned around to face me, and we were talking. We were supposed to be doing a journaling activity but all teachers were out of the room. He ended up trying to see what I was writing by grabbing my arm and digging his nails into it making me bleed. I just kinda said â€œBro stopâ€ and then did nothing afterwards. This was today, shit still fucking hurts when my shirt rubs up against it
