I'm actually really stressed about college I have no idea what I'm doing and my lecturer isn't responding to me um I'm kinda panicky and yeah I'm really dumb I had the whole day to get my shit together but every time I'm about to start I just get so panicky like yeah just do it but I can't ugh


To add on I have a lot of depressive, angry, anxious and self-loathing thoughts I've been trying to suppress ... if I don't I let it get to me , equally unproductive. I'm so tired man
