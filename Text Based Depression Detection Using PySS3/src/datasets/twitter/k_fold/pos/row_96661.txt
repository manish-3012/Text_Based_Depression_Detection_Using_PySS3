...I think I'm genderfluid I was standing in Target last night next to a Kenny G board game when I had the realization and I've been panicking ever since pfft

I haven't told my (right wing christian) parents I'm bi yet so this isn't my first identity rodeo but... Damn.

The reason I'm posting is, is it normal to doubt it a lot? The last thing I wanna be is someone who's faking it for attention, but I felt this way when I realized I was bi, too. And that was a looooong time coming. 

fyi, I go by she/her typically, but as of late I've sorta wished people would call me he/him and she/her. I asked my friend about it (he's been in identity politics longer than I have lmao) and he said I'm genderfluid.
