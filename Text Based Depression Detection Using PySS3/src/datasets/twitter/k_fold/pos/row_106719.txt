wanting to know how to raise a child isn't gay so i was just talking to two friends online about the different school subjects and wich ones we liked and wich we didn't. then both of them suddenly agree that educational theory is "gay". i protest as i really enjoyed learning about this at school an i remind them that i and [3rd friend] chose that subject and found it highly interesting. then they say it made sense for me and [3rd friend] to choose ed. theory, because we both want to become teachers but choosing ed. theory in order to learn how to properly raise a child is considered "gay". I was kinda disappointed in them to say something like that because that is exactly the reason why I picked that subject. My aim is to once be a good father and that has nothing to do with sexuality.
