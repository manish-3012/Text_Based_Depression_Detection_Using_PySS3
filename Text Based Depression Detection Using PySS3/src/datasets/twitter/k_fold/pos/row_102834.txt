Do you love it when a teacher makes an error in the subject they teach? I both love it and hate it. I love it because itâ€™s hilarious and I can correct them (my english teacher said â€œwrotenâ€ which isnâ€™t grammatically correct, and my math teacher marked me wrong on a test question that I got right). I hate it because it means the teachers are incompetent. My current English teacher gives off MASSIVE gym coach vibes, like heâ€™d rather be teaching P.E. than English. I tell my sister, whoâ€™s two years older than me, about all of my teachers and as soon as I mentioned his name she said, to nobodyâ€™s surprise, that he was her P.E. teacher. This is sus.
