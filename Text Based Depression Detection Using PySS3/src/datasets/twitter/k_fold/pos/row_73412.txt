The new color of the downvote arrow sucks This is like the 3rd time theyâ€™ve changed it. Originally, it was sky blue, then they changed it to a purple blue, and now itâ€™s at a pale blue. the purple blue was the best blue. it looked like the purple stud from lego star wars. now it looks like ass. the new color of the downvote arrow can suck my balls
