Man, I really donâ€™t want to spend my birthday alone again Last year I spent my 18th birthday all alone. Now here we are, 1 year later. My birthday is coming up, and I really donâ€™t want to spend my 19th birthday all alone.

But letâ€™s be real. Itâ€™s going to happen. Iâ€™m a brand new college student over 500 miles away from home with no friends up here.
