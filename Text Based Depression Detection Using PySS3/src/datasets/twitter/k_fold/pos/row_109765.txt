Put it Out Anyway (151) "**Not Good Enough", "Why would anyone want that?" "That isn't art", is things I push through daily with my art.**

**That is the darkness trying to swarm, we won't let it win.** We all have these thoughts and feelings that we aren't good enough, which is normal but it allows for us to focus on our **intentions.** Our intentions will then allow us to take a step back to breathe, to relax, to realign and then **JUMP FORWARD.**

If someone hasn't told you this lately, then know that **YOU ARE SEEN. YOU ARE HEARD. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU MATTER. KEEP GOING and KEEP PUSHING.**

When we are in the eye of the storm, it can be difficult sometimes to think, why this is all happening, but just know that it is happening for something greater that is beyond our expectations. **Keep working. Keep expanding and keep facing your comfort zones.**

**I love you.**
