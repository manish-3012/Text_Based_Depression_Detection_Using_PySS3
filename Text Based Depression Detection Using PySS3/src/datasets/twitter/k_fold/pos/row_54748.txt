Fuck Political opinions Look mates, I know that the election is important and all, but this is a sub for TEENS

Most of us arenâ€™t even old enough to get a job never mind vote. So I donâ€™t see why J constantly see people saying 

â€œVote for ______ Hes a better choice than _____â€

Or 

â€œVote for ______ because heâ€™s not as racist!â€

They both suck, theyâ€™re both gonna cause an increase in riots, and America is fucked. 

It doesnâ€™t matter who wins because both sides are a bunch of old fuckers in a circle jerk while talking about who correct their choice is.


What we should be focusing on is schooling and family matters not a bunch of old white dudes talking about where they were raised or whoâ€™s the worse liar.

Yâ€™all can downvote me to hell or whatever but just try to read this with an open mind.
