am i just ungrateful? MILD tw for sh

got my mom a ton of gifts, some handmade... and in return she got me a pair of socks and razor blade refills... and nonetheless i thanked her a bunch this morning but tonight she was like â€œarenâ€™t you going to thank me again?â€

so yeah, it was an odd christmas. 

also im coming up one year sh free and i was like oh thatâ€™s... ironic. not that she knows that tho. she only wrapped the replacement blades for me because she had no other gifts im guessing. iâ€™m glad iâ€™m in a good enough mental place that that didnâ€™t make me lose my sh!t 

i hope your christmas was less weird than mine lmao
