I cant get this deep sunk feeling in my heart out of me. Do you ever get that heart sinking feeling when you look at a family heirloom that is irreversibly damaged? Well when my dad was a young teen, he bought a jacket that he loved dearly. It was a discontinued silver and red chicago bulls jacket and he gave it to my brother. He accidentally put it in the washing machine and the majority of the grey/sliver is a sort of irreversibly pink that just kills me internally when i look at it. I don't know why because its not mine, and it doesn't have any large significance or importance to me
