Man Iâ€™m so fucking lonely My only friend barely responds to my texts and when I ask him to get online he never does. I have never been in a relationship Like fuck man I have never even kissed a girl I might as well just give up. I get so board in the day I just sleep. I want to tell my therapist about this but Iâ€™m too big of a pussy to say anything. So Iâ€™m posting here because itâ€™s close enough to talking to someone.
