My accomplishment! At the beginning of August I went through a very rough breakup with my then girlfriend. I decided that to distract myself from the pain and generally better myself to get into a dedicated gym routine. Now almost three months later Iâ€™ve been hitting the gym 6 days a week and feel a lot better. The gym I attend has weekly challenges for different exercises (last weeks was pushups, the week before it was 5k your way). This weeks challenge was plank and I decided to enter. I managed to plank for 3:31 which, along with being a personal record, placed me fifth among those who had competed. 

All accomplishments aside, you can get in shape. It doesnâ€™t have to be 6 days a week. Whatever you do start a routine and start it small, but stick with it! You will make great progress. Donâ€™t get discouraged!
