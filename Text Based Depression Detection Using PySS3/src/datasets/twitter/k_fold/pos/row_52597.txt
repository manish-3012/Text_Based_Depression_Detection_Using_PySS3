I found the best doggo to ever exist So, I was coming from a Christmas party from school, and halfway this dog came with me.He didn't bark or bite or anything,and he followed me all the way home.When I was at the front door, I waved him goodbye.I have not seen him since, but he was the best Doggo ever.
