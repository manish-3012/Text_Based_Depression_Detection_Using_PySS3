These stupid ads &gt;:( Iâ€™m just scrolling through reddit in the dark abyss of my room. Then this bright ass ad slides through and singes my cornea. The ad isnâ€™t even good, theyâ€™re just trying to sell me baby yoda underwear. Like I donâ€™t even want it. 

Well thats the rant. Good night and I bid your eyes good luck.
