Being pressured to uphold impossible standards. Your experience? I found myself in deep thought about the social constructs that inherently affect our behavior on a day to day. Social norms, cultural norms, financial frameworks, accepted behavior. All these preconceived notions about what face you should present to society as opposed to who you truly are. Now I understand there are exceptions to this in the extremes, but on a radar more closer to the mid left and right of a spectrum, this is a very common pressure on us as individuals. Especially in a world where actions are scrutinized to the niche detail. 

I found this train of thought somewhat of an epiphany. While I didn't immediately find myself disconnecting from such expectations, the very fact of self awareness has led me to see things in a different light and helped with mental stability when it comes to just being kind to myself.

I'm not always the best at "speaking" about these things that go on inside my brain. But I do write and compose about it. This is just something you can chose to listen to if you want. This is no marketing gimmick lol. Something I just wrote as "self therapy" and maybe it might resonate with someone out there. :)

Anyway, what are some of the impossible standards forced on you out there? Would you like to share? :)
