My boyfriend just disappeared on me? So I was texting him and I asked "hey, do you want to call soon?" And said yeah he just had to do something then he'd call.

I waited for an hour and I got no call and no text. But he does this a lot, so I just kind of brushed it off and texted him again. Still no response. I thought, "maybe he's just talking to his sister or his mom." So I texted "hey I'm gonna call in a couple minutes, okay?" And still nothing.

After waiting an extra 8 minutes to call I finally do and it rang 2 times then goes to voicemail. Everytime I've called it rings 2 times and goes to voicemail. I thought maybe his phone died, but when it does it doesnt ring, it just goes straight to voicemail.

I dont know what's going on, he wont answer any of my calls or respond to my texts. Maybe I upset him or something. But yeah, I just wanted to rant. I've got a bad stabbing pain in my stomach so I'm just going to go to bed and see what happens in the morning
