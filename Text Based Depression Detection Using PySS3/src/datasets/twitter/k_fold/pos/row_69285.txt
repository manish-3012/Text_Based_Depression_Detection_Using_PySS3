Please tell me that Iâ€˜m not the only one that likes Viking music? Artists/bands like Danheim, Heilung and Wardruna make good viking-vibe music. Like omg that music gets my blood pumping so fast and Itâ€™s the best music to workout with.
I also listen to this in secret because I donâ€™t want my friends to think Iâ€˜m weird lol.
