I'm gonna sneak out tonight. I just kinda want to see what it's like to take a walk at night. I have a good playlist and no one will notice I'm gone. I practiced climbing the backyard fence so I'm good in that area. I'll be going to a nice hill about one and a half miles away that has a lot of people chilling on it in the day, but very little at the later hours. I'll prolly just chill for like half an hour and then go home lol.
