Scarlet Johansen Ok, so a bit about me first before I get into this: I am a 13 year old female, living in the suburbs around a state capital in the US (unfortunately) a lot of the time when I see women on screen I notice there breasts, and hips ect. I donâ€™t really want to have sex with them or kiss them, or even really talk to them or their characters but I just kinda notice them, and certain aspects of there bodies. Because of this I have loosely considered my self bi, And in the community I live in, thereâ€™s not really a whole coming out thing, itâ€™s just oh okay your dating a girl now, cool. I have never dated anyone, and have never wanted to have sex with anyone, like I see the appeal of doing it, I just have never felt horny. A couple days ago my friend introduced me to snl and since then it has taken over my life, and Scarlet Johansen is in some of the skits, she also played Black widow in the mcu. Ever since I saw her in some skits (itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve seen a marvel movie) I have been obsessively searching images of her and watching crap talk shows just to look at her. I donâ€™t want to have sex with her and maybe I just donâ€™t get it because every time I try to puzzle this situation out, I try imagining a sex scene and I get hung up on me, an overweight, acne covered, tweenage girl who has never had her period, getting into bed with freaking black widow, and I just cringe because I donâ€™t get how that could be a fulfilling relationship, and thatâ€™s the confusing thing because Iâ€™ve gathered that being horny is the antithesis of wanting a fulfilling relationship so Idk. Am I horny? please help, Iâ€™m okay if I am but I have no clue,
