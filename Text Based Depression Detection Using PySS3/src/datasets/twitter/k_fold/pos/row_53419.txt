The best (funniest) game of among us I have ever played So I had done a few rounds in a server where there was a smart-ass player. Yall know the type, he named himself detective and didnt let anyone else talk because he said he was so smart. So finally I called a meeting an said itd be funny to vote him out. Everyone agreed, but he went on a whole ass rant about how I ruin the game and was throwing and should be kicked but he got voted out. As it turned out, HE WAS IMPOSTER. so I was dying of laughter but this man, COMMITED. he followed me as a ghost and closed the doors to every room I was in trying to annoy me but only making me laugh harder. After the game he cussed me out and banned me from the lobby. Whoever was the purple detective, thank you. That was the hardest I've laughed in a long time. Also fuck you your playstyle sucks.
