Have you gotten back with Your ex after breaking Up? My ex [17F] and i [18M] broke up out of nowhere. She felt like we ran dry. Shes keeping me sound as a friend for now. I still have feelings for her. Has anyone gone through this before? If So what did you do?

Iâ€™m working through the pain of the breakup, but I want her back in my life. Even if it takes months or years. Although it sucks, I can be patient. 

Just please tell me your stories. I need things to read to pass the time without getting the urge to text her.
