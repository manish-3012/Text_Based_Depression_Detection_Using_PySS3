I am completely clueless when it comes to girls and I need help bad A girl invited me to watch mando last Friday, it was a small group but I don't usually hang out with them. She seemed interested in me and has tried talking to me before in the past but I was to damn nervous and just thought she was being friendly. But I'm pretty sure she actually likes me, she looks at me from across the room a lot but I just find it so hard that someone so attractive could be into me lol. Also the way she invited me was through text, most likely got my number from her dad I think. What do I do? I want to show my interest in her somehow but idk if there is a light friendly way of showing it
