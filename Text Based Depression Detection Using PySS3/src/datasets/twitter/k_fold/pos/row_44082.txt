How do adults like coffee? Like I just had some today to try to keep me awake during distanced learning and it was absolutely horrible. It was so bitter. I put a crap ton of coffee and creamer in it too and it was *still* disgusting. I even put chocolate sauce in but it sank to the bottom. I eventually just friggin downed it and brushed my teeth to get the taste out but god, itâ€™s so horrible.
