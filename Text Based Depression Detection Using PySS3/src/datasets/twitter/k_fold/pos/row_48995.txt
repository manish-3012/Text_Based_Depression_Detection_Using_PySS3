I created a new term for my school: clique wars. It seems as if everyone at my school only hang out with people within their group, and they try to overtake and bring down other groups at school and it is a giant mess. The kids at my school are brutal towards people that are unpopular so my friends and I get a lot of mouth because we donâ€™t participate in the â€œclique warsâ€ (we are supposedly the â€œnerdâ€ clique but we donâ€™t see ourselves as a clique, rather just a group of friends). I remember in 7th grade it was World War II but in school form.
