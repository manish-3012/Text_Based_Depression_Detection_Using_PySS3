What the fuck is wrong with the internet I made a comment about how one of my cousins works in the capital building but wasn't there two days ago because he is paralyzed, from the waist down, and it got downvoted all to hell.  I mean yea, I could've phrased it differently but still. It's a true story he got paralyzed in a car wreak 10 years ago but still works at the capital building.
