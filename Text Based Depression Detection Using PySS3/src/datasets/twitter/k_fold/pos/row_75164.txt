The reason I hate my old school So me and my friends hung out  next to field  during recess and when ever they did the fun run they used spray paint to show ware we needed to go on the field Next to ware all of us were so it got my whole group sick and for me it got so bad it was hard to get up My palms felt sweaty my knees weak, my arms were heavy(no joke but go ahead and post the lyrics to it cuz I know you will)and I had to be out of school for almost a week
