Just a little rant 
I just wanted to take a moment to complain about my younger brother, he just linked our phones (Which means he can text from his phone using my number and receive my text) while I was talking to my girlfriend and almost ended our relationship, thankfully I was able to explain to her what happened over gmail, and itâ€™s just annoying that he can just invade my privacy like that and just ruin everything, Yes our mother was able to fix the problem and he got punished, but itâ€™s just plan out rude and annoying that he thinks he can do that, anyway Thanks for reading and letting me complain my heart out
