The story of an Amber.. This is not a made up story, a friend of mine and his family were abused by the neighbors's lady(let's call her Amber) She even told the government officials that their house was made in an illegal place and made false accusations about his dad that he peeked on her. BTW he and his whole family are really simple and kind ppl from my experience. His father is just a normal shopkeeper.

I or even they don't know why is that lady doing things like that. But justice was served. When that Amber reported to police that man was peeking on her they were all (the whole family) was called in the police station. They somehow managed to get to know the truth that she was lying. She wasted the police's 4 hours! The officers were very angry. It also caused cracks between the friendship between my friend and the neighbors kid. (About our age). 

Many other things happened as well which i would not like to mention.
