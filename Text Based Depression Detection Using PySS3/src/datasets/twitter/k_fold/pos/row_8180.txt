I just crashed my school laptop twice in the past week Shit... well, basically I was illegally downloading and streaming movies on my school laptop... and it crashed last week, and it took 3 days for it to work again and 1 more just to let it get back to normal. I just streamed 2 movies back to back tonight (Spiderman far from Home and Glass, for those interested in what I was watching) and goddamnit my school laptop crashed again... now I'm here reloading it and typing this waiting for it to work again. 

Oh and btw my school starts in 8 days... can the school see everything I did on my laptop over the summer? Cause if so I'm screwed but oh well I was having fun so what's the big deal if I'm not hurting anyone?
