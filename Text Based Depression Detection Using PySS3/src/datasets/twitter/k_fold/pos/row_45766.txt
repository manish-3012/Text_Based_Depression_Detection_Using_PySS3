I feel terrible all the time Im 17.

Hi.
To the 2 people that may read this, hope youâ€™re doing good. I just wanted to vent somewhere and maybe get some advice. 

I have 0 real friends. I talk to some people at school but no matter how much I try noone ever wants to hang out with me outside of school. I feel like Iâ€™ve messed up all my chances to get a social life cause everyone are already really close now and just push me out.

I donâ€™t look good so my attempts at getting a gf have all been pathetic. Iâ€™ve got those weird duck lips that make me look dumb all the time. I just canâ€™t stop thinking about my appearance and itâ€™s stressing me out and making me depressed.

I feel like life would be so fucking exciting right now had I just had more confidence in my looks. 

Everyday is the same and sucks. I donâ€™t have motivation for anything. I feel like I donâ€™t exist. 

Worst thing of all is the tinnitus. I cant even enjoy silence, which is present a lot since im so lonely. 

Fuck everything just sucks.
