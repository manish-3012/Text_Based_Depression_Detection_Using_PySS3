I think my neighbors were robbed Ok, hereâ€™s the story, this white van drove by me house at around 5 PM, the van looked familiar,  I then remembered, I saw that fan before noon today! I was confused, at first I thought they were coming home from work but I realized it was going the same direction, then it parked by my neighbors house, after presumably driving around the block for hours, I told my brother and he pointed out that the truck was the cable/internet company so they are probably just fixing their stuff, but this van had been driving around the neighborhood for hours. My brother kept a close eye on them and he said the two people in the van were screaming and flipping each other off, unprofessional for someone on the job, at one point they split up, one took a latter (cable not satellite, no need for a latter) to house A, and the other goes to house B (across the street) without a latter, he said the guy at house A was messing with its electrical box, then climbed the latter but he couldnâ€™t see what he was doing based on his view, then he got down and went across the street to house B with the latter, he said they didnâ€™t have any technical equipment with them either. He and I think that two of our neighborâ€™s houses were robbed, I told my mother but she didnâ€™t believe me. I just donâ€™t understand what cable company and would do two houses at once with a latter and have their employees flip each other off. Me and my mother made a bet to, thereâ€™s no prize but he still made a bet nonetheless. What do you think?
