Ight bois story time and a good bye So my life is shit, mentally, physically, education wise, and relationship wise and not really relationship wise that's actually going strong (I love you babe if you see this), but family wise. So what I've done/ am doing is I deleted discord, Tik tok, Instagram, might delete reddit (willy we shall figure it out in dm's), and I need to get rid of YouTube too. My plan is to get my grades up, organize my room, finish writing a book finally, get a job, and learn how to drive. So yeah this is possibly Good Bye, but also I suggest doing the same I'm already feeling a lot more free! Also if anyone that knows me sees this I'm keeping snap and then of course text messaging.
