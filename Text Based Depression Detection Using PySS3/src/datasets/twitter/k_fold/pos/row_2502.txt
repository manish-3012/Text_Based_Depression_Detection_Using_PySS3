In the hour of the night The mists settle for the camouflaged stars and blushing horizon, the harsh desert stretching before you as you stare, restless, at the beauty that has become stale in its consistency.

A land collapses with a thud, a wave so mighty it seems unstoppable... but one so solitary it abandons hope, and gets laid to rest upon the twinkling waters.

This land is dying. The beauty you've come to ignore is wrinkling. The sky and land sour in response to the greed and shortsightedness of humanity, and despair grips you as you come to realize there is nothing to be done...

The cancer cannot be removed, it grows with steady powerful strides as it obliterates and corrupts everything it touches

You search for the long since abandoned beauty, and find it has become lost among your distractions

You decide to forget. Why think about the inevitable, when understanding and contemplation do nothing? Ignorance, as it turns out, is indeed bliss.
