Any advice I have a friend that i really like but they identify as transgender and gay(still intrested in men) and i really wana bring it to the next level but i dont know. We will talk and make jokes and have a great time but i really don't think she (or he idk anymore) likes me in that way
And i get it if i date them that would mean technically mean im gay. I really dont care if people call me gay(because im not).
