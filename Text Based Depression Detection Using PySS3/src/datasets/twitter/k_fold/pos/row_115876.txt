Wyoming does not accept the National Voter Registration Form so please do not use our Register to Vote Tool to register to vote in Wyoming.
Wyoming prefers that people register to vote in person at the County Clerk's office.
If this isn't possible, print out the Wyoming Voter Registration form and fill it out in front of a notary. That part is really important! Your Wyoming Voter Registration Form MUST be notarized. Print clearly, using a black or blue ink pen (not felt tip).
Sign the voter registration oath on the form and have the notary or registered agent sign the form.
Make copies of the identification documents you showed to the notary.
Mail the voter registration form, along with the copies of your ID documents, to your County Clerk. Note: Sending your form to any other office will delay your voter registration.
Mail your form as soon as possible. Voter registration closes two weeks prior to Election Day.
Follow up with your County Clerk about any questions you may have about your registration or requests for absentee ballots.
