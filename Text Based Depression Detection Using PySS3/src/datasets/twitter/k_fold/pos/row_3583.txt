Teenage boys of Reddit, what do you want for Christmas? I'm a 20 year old female with 4 cousins in another state that I rarely ever see. They are between the ages of 16-21. What do boys this age want? I know they like video games, but I don't know what kind. I don't even know what their preferred platform is. I can always just send them money, but it just feels so impersonal. I'm not looking to spend heaps of money, I am very poor. Thanks, everyone!
