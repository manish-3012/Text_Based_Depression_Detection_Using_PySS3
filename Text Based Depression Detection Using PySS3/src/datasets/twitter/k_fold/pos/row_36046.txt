Stop wearing band/Artist shirts you don't even listen to it's fucking annoying!!!!! Nirvana is not a BRAND it's a BAND
METALLICA IS A BAND A METAL BAND
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE WEAR T SHIRTS AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY MEAN PLUS IS MORE LOGICAL TO WEAR THEM IF YOU LISTENED TO THEM OR WANT TO SUPPORT? IF YOU ONLY WEAR THEM TO LOOK COOL OR FOR "AESTHETIC" THEN FUCK YOU STIP WEARING BAND SHIRTS YOU DON'T LISTEN TO
I CAN ALREADY HEAR PEOPLE SAYING AM AN ELITIST GATEKEEPER ASSHOLE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T CARE ONLY WEAR BAND SHIRTS YOU LISTEN TO RELIGIOUSLY

P.S TO THE TIKTOK USERS WHO WEAR THEM FIR AESTHETIC YOU GIYS ARE FUCKING CLOUT CHASERS YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL OR QUIRKY YOUR A SAD PIECE OF SHIT
