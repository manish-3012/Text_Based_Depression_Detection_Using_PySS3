Whaddup, a few days I posted about how I've beaten my drug addiction. Now it's time to beat my health. Over the last few years, I've systematically destroyed my body using a combination of drugs, junk food, and a lack of exercise. It's currently 12am and I'm once again filled with the determination to change my life for the better and finally beat depression. In the past, I would wake up and every inch of determination would be lost, but no more. Screw my roommate seeing me, screw being a lazy piece of shit. Tomorrow I'll exercise. And the day after, and the day after. I want to lose at least 60 lbs in 4 months. Wish me luck.
