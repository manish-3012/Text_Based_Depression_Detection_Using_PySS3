Lmfao I probably wouldnt get along with my childhood bestfriendâ˜ ï¸ We just saw each other again after like 8 years, our parents met up with each other after a long time

I see him and he acts so weird, like dude why are you smirking at me like that and stoppp making eye contact with meee, it makes me feel awkward

anyways we talked, and hes super different from what he used to be and he was a tad bit asshole-y, I thought we wouldn't get along with each other but we got each other's contact info because he asked ~ he looks, dresses, talks and acts like one of those e-boy jocks on tiktok while I'm like this nerdy asian guy with glasses that he would probably bully if I were in his school lmfoaosoa
