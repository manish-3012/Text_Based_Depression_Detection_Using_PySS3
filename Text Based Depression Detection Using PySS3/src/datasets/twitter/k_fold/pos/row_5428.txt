Iâ€™m only in my first year of High School how many end of year tests are there. This is such a stupid freaking system just tell me what Iâ€™m doing at the end of each year, why tell me about sat, act, eoc, map, espn, brb and so on but not tell me which I even have to do and which subjects Iâ€™m being tested on. I thought high school testing was gonna be the same as all the others what is this?
