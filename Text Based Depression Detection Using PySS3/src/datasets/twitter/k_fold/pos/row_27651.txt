I have 5 hours and how can I exercise? I have 5 hours until I have to get up for school. But I also have ADHD, and I am not tired at all!


I'm just bored. And sometimes doing something makes me tired.

I wanna burn... ummm... 1,000 calories in 5 hours. I don't know why, but I want to.

Know any exersises that I don't have to jump for (I live in a flat with an old person down stairs), that will burn 1,000 calories in the space of 5hours? 

I don't even mind if it's not 1,000... but I wanna see how much I can do (healthily), thats all. 

Can you even do that much in 5 hours?
That's 200cal an hour?

(I actually have 6and a half hours until I have to get up. Not 5, sorry)
