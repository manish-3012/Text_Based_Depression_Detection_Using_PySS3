A little something I thought about lately. I googled King Kong's height from that King Kong VS Godzilla movie thing and found out he's about 400 feet tall. This got me thinking, gorillas have notoriously small penises in relation to their body size, so how big is Kong's?

I used the height of the Eastern  Lowland Gorilla, the largest gorilla subspecies, of 180 cm as a basis for this. An average gorilla's penis is about 3 to 6 cm long. Let's use both those measurements. 

First we convert them to inches (2.54 cm = 1in). One hundred eighty cm is about 70.87 in. Three cm is 1.18 and six is 2.36 in. Using this, we can say that a gorilla's dick size is about 1.67% to 3.33% of its height. 

Let's then convert King Kong's 400 ft height to inches. That's 4800 in. Now let's multiply.
4800 in Ã— 0.0167 = 80.16 in 
4800 in Ã— 0.0333 = 159.84 in

That puts King Kong's penis around 80.16-159.84 inches (203.61-405.99 cm). In feet, that's 6.68-13.32 ft.  In contrast, a 400 foot Dutchman (using the values I got from the first google search result) would have a 34.64 foot penis. Also, the world's tallest man (Sultan Kosen) is 251 cm or about 8 ft 3 in.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.
