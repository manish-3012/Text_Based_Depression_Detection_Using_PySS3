Parents are not the only people with problems I know this sounds obvious but I just gotta say that it bugs the hell out of me when parents act like theyâ€™re the only ones who can have problems and have the right to complain about their problems. Kids and teens can have problems in their lives as well and parents should hear us out instead of just ignoring us and thinking weâ€™re young and that the problems in our lives are silly and donâ€™t matter. Thanks for listening, I hope Iâ€™m not the only one who feels this way.
