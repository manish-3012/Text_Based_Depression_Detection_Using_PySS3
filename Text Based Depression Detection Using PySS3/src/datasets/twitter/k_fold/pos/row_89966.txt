Situps and confidence in the last sevenish months I've really turned my perception of myself around through working on my abdominal muscles and they've really developed.

I guess the kick in the head I need to start doing situps was when in biology we were learning about respiration the teacher bought out a sheep lung an odd start I know but follow me here it wasn't really the sight of it but something about its smell caused me to turn in the words of the guy sat next to me "ghostly pale" I wasn't far off fainting, my mum put it down to lack of iron and protein so I started taking iron pills and eating more meat.

As I stated getting more into healthy eating I decided on a simple exercise routine twenty minutes of situps everyday and so that's what I did each night before I go to bed I do twenty minutes of situps, I've lost the small amount of excess fat I did have and gained something resembling a sixpack nothing like the ones you see on some guys but it suits the rest of my body and more importantly now whenever I look in the mirror I'm happy and Id encourage anyone reading this who is unhappy with there body to do the same.
