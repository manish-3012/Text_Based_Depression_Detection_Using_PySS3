Are men or women likely to be angrier on average? TL;DR I think that on average women are more frequently angry, but that men are more extreme/reckless/violent when angry. 

I know this kind of varies from person to person, and there are both men and women with anger issues, but this is just an "in general" type of question. 

Based on what I know, women show more frequent anger, but men when angry are more "extreme" I guess. Often shouting and yelling. And sometimes even getting physically violent, or smashing stuff. And this is of course due to the hormone testosterone. 

So basically, from my experience, women tend to complain about things more...and if she's really pissed off at you, she'll gossip behind your back. But men tend to be more reckless and violent when angry...and if he's pissed off at you, he'll go out of his way to physically fight you/beat you up.
