Let me tell you a story So, during the Croatian War of Independence, me and my homies were chilling during breaks between fights. And out of nowhere, some woman appeared on the plains of Slavonia (today we know that was Dara Bubamara). So we ask her what she's doing here and when she answered, we noticed she's Serbian. We didn't want to be overaggressive, since not all people are the same. Boy were we wrong. So, she pulls out a knife and pins me down when my homies went back to the tents. I thought I was dead for sure, but suddenly, a flash of light appeared, and the ghost of Stjepan RadiÄ‡ emerged. He startled her and she ran away, letting me go.
