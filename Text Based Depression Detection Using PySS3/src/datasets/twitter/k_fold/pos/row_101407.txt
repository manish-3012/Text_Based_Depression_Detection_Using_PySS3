I did it, I actually did it I got the courage to tell my friend I liked her and she answered â€œweâ€™re already married silly:)â€I thought I was gonna get rejected hardcore, because I am not the best good looking guy, that is for sure. Sheâ€™s so amazing and doesnâ€™t care that Iâ€™m 5â€™6 lol. Sheâ€™s 4â€™9 so it makes sense but I just thought she wouldnâ€™t like my height. There is a chance boys ðŸ™ƒ
