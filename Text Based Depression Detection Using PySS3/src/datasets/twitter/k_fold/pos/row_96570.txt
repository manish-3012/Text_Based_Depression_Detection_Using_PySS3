Read if you don't believe that covid isn't dangerous. So i thought that too, cus i didn't think it's serious. Now my mom has it and I am reaaaaaally worried. It just doesn't hit you until someone you love gets it. Please be more careful and stay safe, otherwise you will realize that you should have been watching out too late.
