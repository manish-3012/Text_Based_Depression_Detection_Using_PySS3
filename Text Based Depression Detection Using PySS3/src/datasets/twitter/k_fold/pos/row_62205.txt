STOP AWARDING BOTS! It pains me to see people buying so many awards for literal bots! Like, oh look, AutoModerator told me my submission was removed? Better buy a platinum! Like, seriously stop buying awards for bots. They literally CANNOT do anything with the awards you give them! It's a waste of awards and in lots of cases, MONEY!
