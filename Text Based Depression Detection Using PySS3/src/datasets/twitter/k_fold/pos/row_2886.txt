Quick and fun genetic engineering survey! Looking for responses from the generation that matters.  Hey fellas!

I'm doing a quick survey for my class on genetic engineering and would like some opinions on the matter. The survey is primarily geared towards getting the opinions of our generation (2000's kids), as it's not exactly farfetched to say genome manipulation will be a concept our generation, or our direct generational successors will likely be forced to deal with.

The survey takes no more than 10 minutes but most likely will be completed in five - and the first portion is more casual in nature, with the intent of getting those taking the survey to contemplate the idea for a little bit. I'd love you for a brief period of time if you decided it was worth the time of day to fill it out.
