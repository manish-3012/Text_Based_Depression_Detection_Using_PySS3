I need some help with something Iâ€™ve never been very good at picking up on social ques, so I would like the expert opinions of my fellow internet people. There is a girl in my class who is very smart, and she wrote a one page essay specifically for me on how GIF is pronounced with a soft G. I didnâ€™t really think much of it, just thought she was being determined to win an argument, but when I told my mom about, she told me there might be something more happening.
