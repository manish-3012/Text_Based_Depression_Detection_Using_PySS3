What do do after I hear that she likes me back? So thereâ€™s this girl who is really sweet and I have quite strong feelings for her. My best friend heard from her that she has a crush on me and I plan on telling her how I feel. I hang out with her almost daily. But what do I do if she says she likes me too? I know there is a chance she may not say that. Still, how do I aso her to be my girlfriend? Because â€œwill you be my girlfriend?â€ Sounds really weird in estonian(my native language)
