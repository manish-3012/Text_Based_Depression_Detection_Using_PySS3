I'm having a fucking metal breakdown because my overprotective mother can't buy chicken. My mother is really overprotective and it's pushing me over the edge, I can't even have my devices (shit phone and terrible laptop) in my room overnight without her blowing her top. She has to know all my passwords and my fuck wit of a brother won't stop playing fallen kingdom on the piano 24/7. The only people who really know me is my 2 friends. For the past couple weeks she's forced us kids to make a meal every week, so this week I decided to make chicken wrapped in bacon (a family favorite). So it's 1 hour till dinner I'm ready to prepare the chicken and I look everywhere, and my mother forgot to get any. Her one job was to make sure I had what I need and she forgot the main ingredient, and it just set me off. If I ever brought this up to her she'd  say it was because I'm spending too long on my devices. She is an anti-video-game activist and the only thing keeping me together until now is reddit and minecraft. This was just a rant thank you for listening to my Ted talk.
