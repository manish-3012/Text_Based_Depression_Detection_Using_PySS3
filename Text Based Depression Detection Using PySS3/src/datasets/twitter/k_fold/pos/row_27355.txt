iâ€™m sick of not being allowed to drink iâ€™m not really a party person and i donâ€™t have too many friends but my parents are really chill. they didnâ€™t mind my brothers drinking while underage as long as they were careful. hell, one of my brothers is still underaged and they know about his fake id and ask him to pick up drinks for them. with quarantine, my family has been drinking more out of peer boredom. i want to drink to but my mom wonâ€™t let me because of my meds. i feel so left out of everything and like iâ€™m missing out on the normal teenage experience. sure, most teenagers wouldnâ€™t be drinking with parental supervision but whatever. i wonâ€™t even like the taste of alcohol, i just want the same opportunities my brothers have.
