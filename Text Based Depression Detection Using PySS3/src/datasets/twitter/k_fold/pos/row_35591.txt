Help me guys ! My friend is about to turn 20 in a few days , and I want to buy him his first laptop . He desperately needs one due to online college semesters but cannot afford one due to his financial condition . 

I have decided to tutor students in math and statistics so that I can help him with funds . Anyone here who needs math or statistics tutoring at a reasonable rate , please dm me . We can set up a schedule ASAP :)
