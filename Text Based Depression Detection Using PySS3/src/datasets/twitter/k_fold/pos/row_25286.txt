Since tiktoks coming off the app store in the US, im giving the reminder to START ARCHIVING YOUR SHIT If you have a tiktok account and live in the US, other countries too but specifically america, Tiktok is getting off the app store and wont be updating anymore.

Please start archiving your tiktoks and even tiktoks of accounts you really like.

Make a complimation of them and put them on youtube or something, cuz they might not last long on tiktok and your creativity needs to be kept online and shared.
