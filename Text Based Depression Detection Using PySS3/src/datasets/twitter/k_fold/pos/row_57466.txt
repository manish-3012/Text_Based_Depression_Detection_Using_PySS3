This is a good day folks! I've won a war! So yeah, a person, one former extemely close friend, and flirt, just happened to annonce her depature from my school today.
Now I won't have to look at her face the next three years of my life. This is a win.

So yeah, I'm high on happiness currently, she really hurt me, and now she's going to the worst kind of school in my country. I can't say I don't enjoy it a little bit.

Anyway, just wanted to to spill my happiness somewhere,
And people, remember these two things:
1. Don't bother lying, it's so easy to backfire.
2. Never stop your enemy in making a mistake

I know this isnt getting a car, or getting a first time partner, or coming out or something alike, but damn it feels good!
Have a good day folks sorting by new!
