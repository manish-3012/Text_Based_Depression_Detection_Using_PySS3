I made a Reddit RPG if anyone wants to play it Hi! So I made a little RPG on Reddit, and if you guys could play it that'd be great. With 17 different endings, it could end good, neutral, or terrible for you. If you want to play it, you start on [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BologneseboiRPG/comments/kvb8xo/start_here/). Hope you guys like it :)
