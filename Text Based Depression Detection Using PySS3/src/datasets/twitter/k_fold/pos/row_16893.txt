Will I regret posting this? This is a letter I wrote about a girl yesterday. Lets call her Sarah.
I want to start by saying that this year has not been easy. I have been more depressed than ever this year and thinking about this does not exactly help that. But I think in order to recover, I at least need to address it. I like you and have since sophmore year. Big suprise, right? I have a weekness when it comes to these situations because I have pretty bad social anxiety. I hope that explains why I was awkward around you almost constantly. I really wanted to be close to you and I guess I ruined that by being too passive. I also didn't want to ruin our frindship by asking you a question that would make it awkward, so I didn't. You have ruined all other girls for me. Yesterday(Feb 13) I tried to flirt with a girl but all I could think of was how much I missed you. Losing contact with you over quarantine has hurt more than anything. Even if I never see you again, I want you to know that I have changed for the better since knowing you. I used to be a dick and not care how much I affected other people.Â  After knowing you, I now know the impacts of my actions on others. Through your kindness and compassion I finally understand others a little more. You were kind to me even when noone else would. 

I will now point out some of my favorite moments that we shared: 
When we shared earbuds at our school's trip fundraiser, When you would steel my phone to play that stupid game, When you would write little inside jokes on my play script. 
You made my high school experience bareable.
Thank you, Sarah


I did not send this to her, I just felt like I needed to show someone.
