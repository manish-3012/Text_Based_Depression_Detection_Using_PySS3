Been feeling like crap lately Everything suck. I can't concentrate in school. feel like I break everything I touch and I feel like I can't do anything right. I just want to run away. I have a lot of late homework, exams next week. and instead of working on the things I have, I'm on Reddit, ranting about things no one will care nor remember. I feel so alone. What should I do?
