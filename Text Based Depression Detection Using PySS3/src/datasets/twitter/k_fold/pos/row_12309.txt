Fking pissed I tried to get back to my old interests and i find all of them boring. They no longer make me happy. I just read the new chapter of aot and holy fk i dont feel the hype anymore. I alos tried to watch soccer and play games. Nothing makes me feel better im malding. I have no interests and it has been like this for months. I tried to search for new stuff but i find nothing interesting. Wtf is going on with my life.
