Uncertainty and something close to anxious This rant isn't really on par with the actual hell people are going through but I want somewhere to vent without needing to blast my friends with my shit. After seeing all the success of larger youtubers, I started taking YouTube more seriously, I got momentum and am gaining a steady subscriber rate. But now I'm noticing all these larger youtubers in my niche who have been around here for less yet still are getting more views which caused me to realize that if I lit the flame under my ass earlier I would've been somewhere.  I feel like I'm losing time with my friends to videos that may or may not work, yet I don't want to give up and slow down on YouTube because  I don't want to loose momentum and I sure as hell don't want to be dragged into the medical field by my family. I don't know what to feel right now since, yeah I guess you could say I'm doing good, but at a cost.
