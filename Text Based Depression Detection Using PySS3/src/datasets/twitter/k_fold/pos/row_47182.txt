Just found my old skype account I was bored and thought about my old skype account and got in it, when I got there it was full of random groups I was added to. People I used to play with offline for years by now. But the wierdest thing was that 2 people sent me not working google links with my account name (same as here) at the end. And some dude which added me 18 days ago (note: I didn't use skype for 3 years now) and when I added him back his pfp was bulge. My pfp was my 12 self. Came there to see if I can get to chat with some of my old friends and found that it was a good idea to leave skype. And somehow there were people from sexting website that has a part of my name in it.

tl;dr Looked at my old skype account for nostalgia. Found stuff I'm glad my younger self didn't have to see.
