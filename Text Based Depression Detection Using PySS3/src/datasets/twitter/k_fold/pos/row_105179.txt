Someone just shot my dog I have an outdoors dog witch is very protective when it comes to us or our home, otherwise he is very sweet and wouldn't hurt anyone. 
He is wondering around the neighbours often but they all know him and have no problem with him.
Today I found him with blood on his belly and when I looked closer there was bullet/stab wounds on both sides(he is at the vet at the moment) 
I swear to god if I find who did that, boy oh boy will they fish they never done it.
