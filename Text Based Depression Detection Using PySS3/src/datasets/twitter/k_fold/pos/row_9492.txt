My friend asked me to post this about schools. 

(mine at least)

Lemme just start of by saying this... why tf is "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" or "There map these dams all over your country" taught instead of saving resources and teachin how to do taxes or LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO IN THE FUTURE.

Schools are basically prisons where you are forced to learn (mostly) shit you never gonna need. And online School? They be like "More than 30 mins of screen-time is bad for your eyes" but at the same time host 5 with less than 10 mins break between classes. And what tf is the point of online PE class where they just say "Video Games bad" (NO CAP)??

what triggered me rant about schools is they give the fukin datesheet for exams 5 days (or less for some subjects) and be like hahaha whole years syllabus bitches (NO CAP)

When my mom questioned why they doin this and as a result im stayin up most of the night (3:30am) the teacher literally said "Its fine for them to stay up". I CANT STUDY (or sleep) FOR HALF THE DAY cuz They still keep classes (all 5 hrs) (even on exam days like wtf) and now have black circles (RLLY DARK ONES)
