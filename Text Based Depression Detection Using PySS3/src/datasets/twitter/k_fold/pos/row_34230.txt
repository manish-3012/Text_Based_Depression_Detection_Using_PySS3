How to stop being embarrassed over exercises even when literally nobody is watching me?? I want to do exercises but I feel so embarrassed despite being in my room where nobody can see me.

Why???? Stupid anxiety.....

How do I get over this? I just want to lose weight but my anxiety is making it harder than it needs to be.
