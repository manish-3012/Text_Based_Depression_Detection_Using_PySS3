I am so confused on these feelings So I have fallen for this girl for about 3 weeks now (not long) and the feelings arenâ€™t that deep but, I went to see her the other night and she was with another bloke (donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re hooking up) but yea. All night I kept over-thinking it and barely slept tbh. Why the fuck am I over-thinking this shit/cant sleep cause of it? I have never done this with any other girl iv had feelings for accept this one, it does not make sense at all.
