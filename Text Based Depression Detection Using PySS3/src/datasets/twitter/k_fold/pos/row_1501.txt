hi to all of the boys on this subreddit men's mental health is so oftenly dismissed as just being sensitive or not "acting like a man" but any guys on here can use this as a safe place to rant about anything that's on your mind!!

also a reminder to drink some water, eat some food, take your medicine and go outside if you need to &lt;3 you are valid and i am so proud of you :)
