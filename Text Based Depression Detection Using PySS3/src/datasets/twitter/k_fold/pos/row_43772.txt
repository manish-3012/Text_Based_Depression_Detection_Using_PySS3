Politics rant Politics are fucking stupid. Itâ€™s just 2 power hungry apes fighting each other for a title. Why they win? Because people think they are on this side they must vote for this guy. But thatâ€™s bloody shtupid as originally voting for president was for if you agreed with there policyâ€™s not what group they define themselves as. And as society keeps polarizing the prospect of a second civil war is coming closer and closer I just want people to understand what got us into this mess. Oh yeah and the presidential debate was just 2 old guys screaming at each other about politics. If I wanted to see that I would have gone to a pub. Thanks for listening to my ted talk. And good night
