I speak in 2x speed I've been consuming content (Youtube/cinemas/anime) in 2x speed since maybe 9yrs old. So when I talk to people. I usually talk in 2 time speed or 1.75. I guess the reason why i consume content in 2x is to save time; a 10 min video can be consumed in 5. Sometimes I just feel like time slowed down a bit. I'm studying Japanese as a side hobby of sorts and I want to know if I should watch media in 2x or should I just watch it at normal speed. (I also sometime feel irritated when I watch media at default speed for some reason.) My eyes have also gotten somewhat faster due to everything moving so fast.
