I think i know what i want to achieve in life Being rich asf ofcourse

I want to be able to buy like cars that cost 10 million each, mansions over the world worth tens of millions, private plane, iced out chain with massive diamond as pendant, throne of gold bars, tons of expensive other jewellery etc

No i would not donate to charitys like those for africa, i would help most in my family to give then millions so they rich too.

This is more the elon musk type rich, how high is the chance?. Very small, but the chances of billionaires when they started were as small as mine.

If i dont succeed its fine too because ill just try to earn as much as possible
