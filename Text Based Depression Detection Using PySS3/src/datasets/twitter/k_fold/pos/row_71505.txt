So I asked out my crush... So today I was feeling kinda bold. I told my friends that I think that today would be the day that I would give it a shot. So after I got off work, I had a shower, sat down and prepared to ask her out. We were snapping so I figured I would tell her how I felt.

Unfortunately she said she saw us as such good friends and she didnâ€™t see us working that way. So it kind of disappointed me but I actually felt really good, even though I got rejected. 

In hindsight, I wish that I asked her out in person but live and learn I guess. Anyways if any of you have crushes you should ask them out. You only live once and even if you get rejected, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of your shoulders. Anyways time to go listen to the way life goes. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR: I asked out my crush, got rejected, but it felt really good going for the attempt and you should work up the confidence to ask out your crush.
