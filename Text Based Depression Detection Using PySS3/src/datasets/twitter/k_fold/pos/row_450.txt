Couldnâ€™t believe that this would happen to me one day Me (M15) and my brother (20) had a great relations and then he opened up to me that he drank, A LOT, and keep telling me he canâ€™t go drunk easily despite he tried a lot to get drunk. Which shocked me a lot because i thought it would have been much worse than what iâ€™ve thought before.

Until this happened today.

He went home drunk as shit, with his friends having to drive him home. One cunt destroyed one trunk of my favourite plant while they were trying to park his car, and when he came out of the car, he looks messy as fuck, with a puke bag and pukes in his rubber mat. His friends had to get him up and lift him to his room. And when i went to my room after witnessing the whole situation, i cried. Out of shame and disappointment. And telling my Mum about this incident would have ended up him getting banished from the house, which is a horrible sight i wish i would have never seen in my life. 

Canâ€™t believe having to watch your brother went home like this.
