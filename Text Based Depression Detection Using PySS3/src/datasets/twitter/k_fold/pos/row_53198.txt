My girlfriend broke up with me Yesterday i was having some very very bad post nut clarity like i was on the verge of suicide. I texted her and then she started saying some comforting shit and that and i appreciate it but i was too deep in my feels to really accept it. i then said some dumb shit. i said â€˜not everyone can cope with people hating themâ€™ or something along those lines and she took it personally. i didnâ€™t want her to be angry at me so i said talk to me tomorrow. i messaged her earlier and i apologised too much. then she said i dont think this is working. i panicked and started crying and asked what she meant. she said she wanted to break up with me. i begged her to stay to the point where i was pathetic (well i still am but) and then she said bye and stopped replying ðŸ™ƒ

and now iâ€™m sat here trying my best to be happy. 

i donâ€™t blame her itâ€™s a surprise she was able to cope with me this long and i knew this would eventually happen but i didnâ€™t expect it to hurt this much. i was completely in the wrong and i deserve it so i dont know why iâ€™m complaining. what the fuck is wrong with me?
