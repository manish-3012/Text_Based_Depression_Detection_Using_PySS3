"You got something to say?" Every Friday. my homies on the block keep saying, "Yo AG, you got sumthin to say?!"

I be like 'yeah i've got something to say, it go like this'

*I had waited for you


Tried detaining my breath


Begged and Waited for you


I only waited for death


Burst out tears time to time


Seemed I'll never forget


Holding thoughts in my rhyme


Fiction found this regret


I had tried letting go


But something confined me down


Must've fixed to my wrists


There was no fixing me now


Please get out of my head


Since you never had shown


How much you've meant to me


Something you should have known




How did this happen to me


I needed something to blame


Was the right time of day


But my train never came


You'd think that I hadn't tried


To forget and move on


I'm still struck in your eyes


You're still stuck in my song


To really hold you instead


Was a thought in my head


Or when the vision's red


Or the hope when I'm dead


It only shackles me now


The Feeling deeper than love.


The Shattered half that I lost



My one and only Jiya.*
