I had a perfect plan to rickroll my family today. True story. My mom told me to get some new music on USB for our car. 

And, of course, I got a genius idea. Why not rickroll my whole family?

I uploaded the song, everything was fine. You may wonder what went wrong.

Shuffle. Fucking shuffle. It always repeats songs, it *never* plays anything new. 

There is still a chance, for next time tho.  Also, cause our car is so smart, it didn't recognize half of the songs I uploaded. Why? Cause the *name of the fucking file* had space in it. 

As I said, the car is *very* smart.
