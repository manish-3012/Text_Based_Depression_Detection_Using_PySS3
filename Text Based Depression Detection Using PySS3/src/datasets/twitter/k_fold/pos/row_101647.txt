Whatâ€™s up with adults being so against us using the things THEIR generation made to make OUR lives easier? My only guess is that itâ€™s because theyâ€™re jealous. One time, a family friend family came over and mentioned DND. My brother, who loves it (Iâ€™ve played before, and it was alright, but Iâ€™d rather prefer my alone time), mentioned he loves it. They offered for him to come over and play with them, and my brother said yeah. They said I could come over too, and I said Iâ€™d rather stay home and watch after the dogs (nobody else that would be home then would watch them). My step-dad was like â€œhe means heâ€™d rather stay home and play on his phone.â€ Yeah, sorry for not being a people person. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d **love** to play a game youâ€™re not that interested in with people you only know because theyâ€™re friends with your mother. Honestly, I donâ€™t think my stepdad likes us because weâ€™re nothing like him.
