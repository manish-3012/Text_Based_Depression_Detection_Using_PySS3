Writing something positive about my day, day #282 My parents agreed I could get a new phone (well my mum gets a new phone and I get her one) and Iâ€™m really happy Cuase my old one had a really bad battery life and the camera was glitchy. 


Also continue to get submissions for my fan project and just generally had really nice interactions with people who wanted to participate, one person even called it a â€œtrendâ€ so I guess I started a trend lmao
