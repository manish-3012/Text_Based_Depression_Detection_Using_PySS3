Dear lord someone help iâ€™ve dug myself I whole and I donâ€™t know how to get out of it oh god (Sorry for the long text but really what do I do)

So my school does this thing called Remind where basically you sign up for different teachers and you get automatic text messages saying stuff like â€œdonâ€™t forget you have this project due tomorrowâ€ and things like that. Today I was hanging out with my friend and I got one saying â€œitâ€™s -teachers name- birthday tomorrow where animal print to show your loveâ€ Just to specify my science teacher was telling us to wish a social studies teacher a happy birthday so at least it wasnâ€™t my teachers birthday. I thought it was just like a bot sending these messages out and that the teachers couldnt see what you text back because last year I accidentally texted one back and it came up with an automatic message saying that the messaging back was disabled or something like that so I assumed it was like that for all of the teachers so I messaged back â€œnoâ€ because I was with my friend and being stupid then I got a text back saying â€œOkay then...â€ So my science teacher saw the text, then I messaged back saying â€œI donâ€™t own animal print sorryâ€ which I now realize sounds snotty but I didnâ€™t mean for it to be. I have to see this teacher tomorrow and I donâ€™t know whether to kill her or kill my self someone tell me how to get out of this hole Iâ€™ve dug.
