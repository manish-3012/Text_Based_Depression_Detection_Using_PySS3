i do this really weird thing when i hear something sad a couple days ago my dad told me a story about how he was almost kidnapped when he lived in India and was a baby and when he was done i started smiling i was not happy but i just started smiling so i had to explain to him why.

one other times this happened was in school when our teacher had to tell us that our teacher died and i started smiling even though i was super sad and she was one of my favourite teachers and no i'm not psychopath i don't like hearing about other people dying and i have no idea how to stop doing this
