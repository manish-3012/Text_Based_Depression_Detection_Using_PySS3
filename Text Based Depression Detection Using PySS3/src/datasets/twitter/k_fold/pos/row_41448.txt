I just had the best day ever! 1. It's my birthday today. So thats pretty awesome on its own.
2. I got engaged on my minecraft server.
3. I got my first parts ever for my gaming pc that I'm building.

Side note, I accidentally left my discord on during school and my friends could instantly tell that I was in the same group as my crush since they heard more inflexion in my voice than ever. So she probably knows.

Overall a pretty Ballin bday. :)
