God, I am feeling great but tommorow I will have to do hw, ffs. I mean, some girl I am surprisingly interested in asked me if I wanted to video call and I said sure (we had done this before so it's pretty much normal for me). And we started talking an joking and she bought the bandana which I was wearing when we first met which was actually really cute tbh.

Anyways, after that I suggest I draw something (usually I just do graffiti n such shit) I asked her which word she wanted and she said "Gang" because we have that joke of "The gang" and she is the "gang kid" n such shit. Anyways, I don't really know if she is interested in me but it doesn't really matter because she is pretty nice as a friend and I don't not really the type of person to get into relationships. Buona notte, to everyone here.


Arrivederci. (I will reply to any comments when I wake up.)
