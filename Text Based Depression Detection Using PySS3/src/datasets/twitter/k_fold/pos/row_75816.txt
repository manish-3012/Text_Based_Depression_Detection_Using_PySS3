My teacher was just fired for being gay I go to a catholic school, and apparently the school found out that my geometry teacher is openly gay after seeing their posts about it online. The bishop apparently said they had to be fired because being gay was â€œunethicalâ€ or something along those lines. The school has been trying to cover it up ever since, and no teacher has been allowed to reveal anything. We just go into class tuesday normally, and return thursday having no teacher and nobody to take over. Its fucking crazy that this shit is still happening in 2020, and I am tired of people not doing anything about it.
