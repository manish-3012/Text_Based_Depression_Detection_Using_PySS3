Mom Keeps Intentionally Putting me With Friend Who Doesn't Wear Mask Now, let's get something clear. I still love my Mom, and I really enjoy this Friend, but I'm just been frustrated with them both.

So this friend (we'll call him E) hasn't been the best with wearing his mask. He constantly takes it off, keeps pestering me to take off mine, and just is a dick about the whole situation. I really do enjoy him as a person and as a friend, but if he refuses to wear his mask then I don't want to hang out with him in person. I still love having Discord Calls with him, and playing video games with him, but not hanging out with him in person.

There have been 2 occasions of this problem. The first was a dinner party, where we all ate outside and 6 feet apart from one another. Then E and I moved inside to play some video games and still social distance. But he then took off his mask. I didn't say anything to him at the time, later however I told my parents about this. We agreed that I wouldn't see him anymore until after the pandemic, and I thought it was over.

So what's the problem? Well, E and I both play volleyball, and before the pandemic we always did some volleyball lessons together. But in the Pandemic, our Mom's have kept forcing us to keep having lessons. And of course, our friend E keeps taking off his mask. Granted, the coach does as well, but I trust him because he has to get rapid covid tested everyday in order to show up to the gym. I kept on my mask the entire lesson, but then E and I carpooled back to E's house with E's Dad, where my Mom picked me up. I again expressed my discomforted with E and asked her again to not set up anymore lessons with E. Annoyed, she agreed. 

Since I trusted the coach but not E, my Mom and I set up a PRIVATE lesson on Saturday for Monday (today). I was thankful that she was finally listening to me. But then this morning, I found out that she went behind my back and E would be there as well. This will be later in the day. I don't why she keeps doing this, even after several times of me talking to her that I don't feel safe. Again, I still love my Mom and E, but if he is this irresponsible, then I don't want to hang out with him. I just wanted some place to vent about my frustrations. You guys have any advice?
