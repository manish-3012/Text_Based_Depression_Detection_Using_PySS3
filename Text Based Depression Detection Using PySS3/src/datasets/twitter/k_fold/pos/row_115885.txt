Should I move to Austin Texas for three months? It would be more expensive and farther away BUT I would have my own freedom in a place that I know I like and am more familiar with

Maybe would be able to make my own new friends ! Or maybe I would be alone and lonely ?? I have a few friends there but not a ton 

Idk what does everyone think?
