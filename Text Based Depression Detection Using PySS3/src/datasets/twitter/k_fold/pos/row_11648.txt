If you are getting bullied, it's probably for a reason, use it to improve yourself based on what it being criticised if you can help it (if it's on something you can't help then they are just being dicks and ignore them).

I used to get bullied because I was a weird ass guy but now I've changed and am no longer bullied and I'm a better person for it, I know it's hard though, ask for help and talk to those you love if it is happening to you.
