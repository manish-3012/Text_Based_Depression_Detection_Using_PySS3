Leaving to head into my twenties. In six hours I will be officially turning 20. Thank you all for the great memes, posts, and everything else. Itâ€™s truly a bittersweet feeling knowing that Iâ€™m hitting a new age in life. Time to grow up though lol. Keep being you teens who cares what anyone says. Youâ€™re only young once. Enjoy. 


Peace, 

Fellow past-teen
