I have a very weak body structure so my joints in my arms and hips are like horrid. Because of this itâ€™s stopping me from doing a lot of things that I normal would do with my boyfriend and itâ€™s making me feel like shit. Iâ€™m exercising to get the joints stronger, but the exercises, tho they are minimal, make my whole body hurt the next day. Simple things like just sitting down or lifting up my arm to grab something from the cupboard hurt. It sucks and I hate my body.

But hey I use to weigh 160 pounds and Iâ€™ve gotten myself down to 126.5 hoping to loose a little more or gain some muscle. Iâ€™m just hoping that the exercising actually helps with my joint pain.
