how many months till the among us craze dies out? i don't hate among us but i feel like this boom is pretty artificial and will die down pretty soon. 

like some fatal flaws are that two people in the same room can easily join the same public room and tell each other who the impostor is. 

or the fact that people leave the game when they die and the tasks can't even get completed that way. 

or the fact that people hop rooms when they don't get to be impostor.

how long do you think it's gonna take?
