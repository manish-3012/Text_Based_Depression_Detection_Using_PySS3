I come to school to learn, not to be babysit. I am so sick and tired of teachers blaming us quiet students for our shit class. It is not my fault my fucking classmates can't keep their mouths shut, and it is not my responsibility either.

Stop saying I am an 'accomplice' because I don't stop them. How do you expect ME to get an entire class to be quiet, when you teachers, their authority figures, have been trying for YEARS and are still so clearly failing.

I don't know if teachers don't know anything about how teenagers work or if they are just stupid, but if they think I have any more control over what my class does than they do, they're just wrong. And I am getting sick of being blamed.

I'm not fucking Thanos or something, get a grip lol.
