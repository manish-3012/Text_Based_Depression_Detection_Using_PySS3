Fuck, fuck, and I cannot stress this enough- fuck. I just had my first non Zoom, in person college class. Itâ€™s a communications class, and the first thing we did was have everyone give an impromptu speech in front of the class. Guess who gave an amazing and flawless speech? Not me. We were only given 2 minutes to prepare. I went up thinking â€œhow bad could it be?â€ Apparently really bad. I made a complete fool of myself in front of the whole class, and on the first day!
