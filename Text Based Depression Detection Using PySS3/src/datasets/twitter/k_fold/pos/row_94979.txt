I just stabbed someone. (IN SELF DEFENSE) Around a half hour ago I went to the gas station to get some candy and stuff, and then after I payed I went to the preschool near it and sat on a bench and ate some candy. I went over to the trash bin to throw it away. Then this guy started talking to me, so I said â€œHiâ€ and he said hi back. I then went to the playground to go on the swings (hey itâ€™s fun) and the guy grabbed my shoulder and pulled me backwards, flipping onto my back. He grabbed my back and then stared yelling at me to give him my wallet. I donâ€™t have a wallet yet, and I had used all my money on candy at the gas station. He said he didnâ€™t believe me and he picked me up by my collar. I was scared, a LOT! But I knew what I had to do, I reached into my pocket and grabbed my knife, I stabbed him in the thigh with it. (Itâ€™s a 3 inch blade) and he let go of me. Then I grabbed my bag and ran back home. The guy looked around my age (13 or 14)
