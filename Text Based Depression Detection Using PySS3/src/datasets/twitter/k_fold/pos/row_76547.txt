Hey guys I just want to talk. I just want to say that no matter what happens, this sub has always had a special place in my heart. Iâ€™m not committing suicide in case you guys were thinking that but I just want to say that itâ€™s been a pleasure being in the sub for the past 6 months. And that I love you all. Have a merry Christmas Eve, and I hope you all eat plenty of Turkey. Goodbye for now. And thank you for being with me on this journey.
