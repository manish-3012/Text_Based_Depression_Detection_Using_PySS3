Guys, I have to give you a very important advice. Do not ever let your friend who has been doing martial arts for 10 years punch your hand. He may be shorter than you but he will probably kinda make your hand feel numb for the next minute or two the same way you make his 24 year old sister's ass feel numb after 2 claps.

Just be gentle with your arm.
