So I Turned 15 Today I know, big whoop. I've (M) never really taken my birthday seriously, and that probably won't change much. I don't expect gifts, I don't demand attention, nor do I really want it.

But a text from a couple friends wishing me a happy birthday would be nice. Most of my family has remembered, which I'm appreciative of obviously, but they're only half of my life. I have a small social circle to begin with, but none of them seemed to remember. I've talked to a couple people today already, without bringing anything up. Didn't ring anybody's bells.

It doesn't really matter in the grande scheme of things, but my friends remembering my birthday this year would have been nice.
