Doin well! Iâ€™ve just started not caring what people think of me anymore! And usually itâ€™s great! 

Just walk up and be like â€œwassupâ€ and they be like â€œwassupâ€ and then I just walk on by, realizing that no one judges me on what I look like. 

I mean, Iâ€™m not exactly ugly, but sometimes now I just go out without brushing my hair or getting out of my pajamas and itâ€™s AMAZING!!!
