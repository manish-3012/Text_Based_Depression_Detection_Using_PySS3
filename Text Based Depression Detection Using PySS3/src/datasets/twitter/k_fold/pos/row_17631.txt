so my home got flooded about a month ago so yeah my downstairs toilet started flooding bc the drainage pipe for the whole house got blocked by a tree root so the downstairs kinda got flooded and the people to come and put more flooring are finally coming tomorrow, like god damn bro it's been more than a month what took so long there's this big patch of carpet just missing downstairs and it looks hella weird and the whole house is a mess, I'm just glad they are coming to fix it finally, and we're gonna get new carpet downstairs which is nice
