Guys cmon I wanna start a band Guys Iâ€™m posting again cuz not enough people joined, now Iâ€™m kinda sad.


Wanna start a band?

Ok so my names dylan, Iâ€™m a 15m dude, I like music, I canâ€™t read music tho, Iâ€™ve been told I have a really great singing voice, I saw somebody else do this and I was wondering if anyone wanted to start a band, just for fun, guitar players would be great, piano is also great, cuz I was thinking a classic rock/punk rock band, we could do some covers, and then maybe write our own songs sometime, idk. Just hit me up if it sounds like fun. Also, Iâ€™m gonna make a poll for named once we have enough people. 

Update
Ok so far we have drummer, and an extra singer maybe, but thatâ€™s it, some bass or guitar players would be great, please.
