Iâ€™ve been really stressed and unmotivated lately.... I feel like I canâ€™t do anything.whenever I have something on my mind that I wanna do for example study or draw I just drop it after a few minutes...so I want to know how to feel motivated to study or do anything on my mind... 

And also I was stressed because of school and also to the fact that my aunt has COVID..so i if you guys have ways to cope with it I would appreciate it :)
