Idk if anyone can relate but I just feel so overwhelmed and excited and scared all at once Iâ€™ve been looking at University websites and careers and degrees since middle school, but itâ€™s always been just a pipe dream, but now I have less than a week left of school and Iâ€™ve already gotten a guaranteed spot in a Degree. Itâ€™s just so weird to think about Iâ€™ll be leaving an moving to the city either next year or the year after that. I donâ€™t even really know what I want to do I want to try new things and experience real freedom. It always felt like this day would never come that Iâ€™d be a child forever I just canâ€™t process it.
