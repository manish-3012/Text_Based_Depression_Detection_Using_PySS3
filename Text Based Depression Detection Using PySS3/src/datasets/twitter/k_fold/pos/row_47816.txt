You have to stop thinking the pandemic is gonna be over when the vaccine comes out 1) the vaccine will most likely only be about 50-60% effective if approved, that means going out without a mask is still pretty damn risky

2) a very significant percentage of people will refuse the vaccine, due to Facebook and misinformation about â€œmicrochipsâ€

3) We also have NO IDEA how long the antibodies last, we know for sure that they last at least two weeks, but official studies for how long antibodies last can take years.

4) Even if we were to somehow fix the amount of people who donâ€™t want to get the vaccine, and somehow get it to a 70% efficacy by some miracle, we would still be dealing with issues regarding supply of the vaccines for at least another year 


So thatâ€™s it boys, very unlikely best case scenario, itâ€™s over(ish) in a year from now. Most likely, weâ€™re dealing with this for several years, or maybe even longer if it becomes an annual recurring thing like the flu.

So, how does life go on from here?

Donâ€™t let this stop you from having a day to day life, masks + 6 feet social distancing makes things VERY low risk.

Meet friends only very very rarely, and make your friend group very small, just people who you know only meet with you, and they know that you only meet with them, as well as family members from both sides not being the kind who go out and meet people a lot.
