Mental problems? idk what it is Ok so there's this kid whom i've had classes with since 6th grade. i never really talked to him, but you can tell there's something off. he understands what people say and can speak, but he has this psychotic smile all the time and has full convos with people that aren't there. i'm kinda concerned for him, he's been bullied 2-3 times and still had that smile and was taking to himself.
