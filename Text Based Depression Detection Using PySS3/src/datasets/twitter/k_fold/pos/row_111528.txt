Y'all he called me and I'm flushed So, my crush of 4 years called me and wished me luck for an interview I have tomorrow, I have absolutely no idea of how he got to know about it. He called me and wished me and told me how to answer and what to answer to certain questions. I swear I'm so confused right now. And he leaves people on read and never picks up calls, and he frigging called me for something I never thought he'd know about. I-, confidence has shot up!
