Wet dreams suck So NNN is starting and I donâ€™t have any issues in completing it but if I donâ€™t jerk one off for about a week I start to wet dream. Now most people would think that isnâ€™t that big of a deal because wet dreams donâ€™t count for NNN but thatâ€™s not the issue. See if you wet dream you have to deal with the now nutted shorts, underwear, and sometimes a little gets on your shirt, you have to change and clean yourself up. Knowing that falling asleep anywhere can result in there being cum in your boxers is a pain in the ass. Like honestly I may just get myself out of NNN this year so I donâ€™t have to worry about it. If anyone knows how to stop wet dreams ideas would be appreciated.
