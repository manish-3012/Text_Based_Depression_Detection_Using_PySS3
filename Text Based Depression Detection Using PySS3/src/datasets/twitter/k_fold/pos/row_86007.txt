for people who are tired of getting rick rolled. little trick for avoiding rick rolls. although, this works best on a computer

take the url, so, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), which is the link to the actual music vid.

copy paste that into the search bar, but then delete everything except the code, in this case dQw4w9WgXcQ

search for that and you'll find what the actual video is. although this doesn't work if the title and thumbnail show something different.
