Alright this has officially gone too far The first super straights subReddit was banned 

And literal minutes ago the second one was as well 


Iâ€™m not a SS myself, Iâ€™m bi, but I 100% support this, and if they arenâ€™t accepted and get discarded as a Nazi, transphobic, then damnit Iâ€™ll accept them 



Stay strong super straights/gay/lesbian/bi 
You are valid
