UnpopularOpinions and Rant are sh*t subreddits Theyre gone to complete shit because the mods and automoderator just remove posts willy nilly if they disagree with them, even if they're unpopular, and don't even follow their own rules most of the time.

We need a TrueUnpopularOpinion that doesn't take down posts because one single mod thinks that it's not unpopular enough.

For context, I made a post saying that Mellow Yellow is better than any other citrus flavored Soda (Sprite, 7 up, Mountain Dew, etc) and apparently that's a popular opinion??? Like no the hell it isn't, I've never met another person that even drinks mellow yellow, let alone thinks it's the best.

And Rant is shit because the automod flags basically everything as "a witch-hunt"
