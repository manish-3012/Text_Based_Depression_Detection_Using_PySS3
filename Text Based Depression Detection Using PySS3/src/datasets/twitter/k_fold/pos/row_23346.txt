Should I meet with friend or stay the rest of the week at home in my room So im gonna meet Today with a few friends and we want to hang out and later one gonna stay at my place. Okay but all I want to do today is nothing I donâ€™t feel well and just want to be in my bed and watch Netflix or whatever. Should I tell them that I donâ€™t have time today and need to do something important or should I just meet with them?
