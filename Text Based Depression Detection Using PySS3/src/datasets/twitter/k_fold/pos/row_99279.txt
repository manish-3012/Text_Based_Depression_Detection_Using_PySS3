My first post on reddit and itâ€™s already a rant So Iâ€™m in the 10th grade (16M). I have male friends and thatâ€™s all they are, just friends. Iâ€™m in a class with only one friend and he happens to be one of the boys (15M) so of course when we are talking we get comments made by people saying that we must be a couple. Those comments donâ€™t bother me because obviously those people donâ€™t know us and didnâ€™t have any idea but then there are the people that do know us. All the girls in my class are really close and because Iâ€™m a girl I usually join in on their conversations. These girls all like to say that we would be the perfect couple and itâ€™s annoying but I can handle it, up until they started make very sexual jokes and comments about us being together (mind you these girls are scarily uneducated about sex as we go to an Australian private catholic school with abstinence only education) they have just been getting worse and Iâ€™m afraid that some people are going to take it seriously about us. I donâ€™t want to be dragged up to the principals office and questioned about if Iâ€™m sexually active all because these girls want a bit of a laugh. This post didnâ€™t really have much point but I just wanted to get this off my chest so I guess this is my first ever post on reddit
