I kinda hate spooktober but hear me out So last year on October 11th i asked the really cute girl out and we dated for 8 months and in june a few weeks before my birthday she broke up with me and a few days later got with another guy (she moved on fast but whatever) and so i tried to figure out what i did and she ended up just being really toxic about it and it got me into cutting at shit like that, but i never let it ruin my friendship with her i said can we still be friends and shit kike that even though i was depressed (still am) because of her i just wanted to be around her badly, she then kida used me for physical affection but i was fine for it because it ment i was still able to hang out with her but then my mom found out made me give her my knife and take a break from my ex, and now since like August i want to say we have been hanging out more and shit but every 11th fucks me up and i dont know what to do, do you guys have any idea
