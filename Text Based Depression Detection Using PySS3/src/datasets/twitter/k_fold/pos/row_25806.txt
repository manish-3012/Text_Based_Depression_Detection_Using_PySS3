I never thought I'd get this far and now i have no idea what to do I asked a girl out yesterday and she said yes and we can't have a first date because our country is currently in lockdown and i don't know what to do until we can go on a date 

Am i supposed to text her? How many times a day? Do i wait for her to text me? What do i even call this situation since we aren't a couple yet cause we haven't had a first date but she agreed to go out with me so are we dating? 

Oh god I'm too anxious for a relationship
