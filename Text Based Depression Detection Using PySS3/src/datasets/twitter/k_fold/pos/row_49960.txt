Can someone help me with my history homework? I'm studying US history rn and my homework is asking something that's not in the text and I can't find an answer on Google so seeing as I'm lonely and have no friends to ask I've turned to you Reddit. Here's the question "Why were many Americans reluctant to help the British during the French and Indian War". Ik that they didn't want to help but for the life of my I can't remembering specifically why. 
Please someone help I need to turn this in soon and I'm hella confused.
