Bruh my mom just said the weirdest thing Most of my close friends are girls and I usually text them alot at one point or another during the day. I'm scrolling through my snaps and my mom looks over at my contacts and says something like "wow you text so many girls, kinda scary" I say "why?" She says "because only like gay guys hang out with a bunch of girls" 

I'm like lol wat. She's pretty homophobic so I didn't think much of it, but it's just a weird thing to say. Also I'm straight.
