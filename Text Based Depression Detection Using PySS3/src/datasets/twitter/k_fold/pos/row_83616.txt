If you could go to an alternate universe / reality (same time as you read this), where in COVID never happened, but you could only spend 24 hours there before returning, what would you do? First, I would never interfere with my alternate reality self. Though i know he wouldn't react violently (most likely we will ask each other tons of questions), i still wouldn't. Just to be safe.  


Also i would try to never interfere / interact with anyone who knows me. to avoid confusion and shit.   


Here's what i would do:

1. I would go to the Bank and Get All the Money from my Alternate Reality Self's bank account (I know the PIN and i have the Card). I would wear a hoodie and a Face Mask to lessen the chance of being spotted.    

2. Maybe steal some stuff before returning.  

3. It's due to Covid that i went to this subreddit (and reddit in general). I would probably make an account and say hi.  

4. Visit my house and neighborhood. (I will only take a look. Again, I would wear a Hoodie and Face Mask)   

5. Try and Check my Alternate Reality Self's Email, Facebook, and all other accounts for any information.
