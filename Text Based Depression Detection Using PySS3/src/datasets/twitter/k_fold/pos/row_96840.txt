I have 2 best friends who started dating now they are banking me and Idk if its because I'm annoying or they're just wrapped up in their own world. They both used to talk to me every day and then they started going out Christmas time and spoke to me a few times a week outside of school. They had huge arguments and broke up about 10 times in 3 months and I always mediated and got them talking.

Then lockdown started, I'll speak to one of them twice a month for about a half hour convo then they'll just not respond, idk whether it's because I'm annoying or they've just got stuff going on. Plus they'll only ever respond if it's about them or their SO.Which is annoying

The other will take 3 or 4 days to reply and then take another day to respond. I've got these people through so much, listened and supported them and then they just ignore me for sometimes weeks on end. They both have problems in their lives so I don't want to push it and ask just to find out they're nursing injuries from parents and seem evil.

I'm a bit of a loner anyway but I'll see them post videos with each other or their other friends (I'm still shielding) and then I'll feel really inadequate, idk I just feel really bad. One every so often says they miss me and takes a week to reply with a "lol".
I'm really not emotional the only reason I made this post is because I'm so tired I just feel like I'm a massive burden even though I've never shared any of my problems with them and I've always supported them

Thanks for coming to my depressing ted talk
