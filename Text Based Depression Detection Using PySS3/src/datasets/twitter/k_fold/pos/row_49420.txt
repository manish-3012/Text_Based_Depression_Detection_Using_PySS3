Help for the future I overthink far too much but I just thought about something.

I've planned on buying a house with my girlfriend after she graduates (shes a year younger than me) and I've started saving up already just because the area we want to move is quite expensive. But my mom wants me to get into some too teir college. I get straight A's so I dont think it would be hard for me to get into an ok college. The problem is that I dont want to leave my girlfriend. Any ideas on how to fix the problem are welcome.

Also I'm only 14 so none of this is coming to matter until a few years from now, I just over think about everything
