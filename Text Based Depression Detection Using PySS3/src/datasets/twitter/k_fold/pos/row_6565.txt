I hate female dating strategy # fuck you r/FemaleDatingStrategy saw a post saying some shit to justify hating all men so I wanted to share my story of what WOMEN did to me.

The people that abused me my entire life weren't men, they were women.

the people who verbally assaulted me for no reason and homophobic reasons weren't men, they were women.

the people that called themselves my friends yet acted like I was subhuman and that I didn't matter weren't men, they were women

the person that stalked my social media accounts weren't men, they were women.

the students that bullied me relentlessly weren't men, they were women.

the people that shamed me for everything I did weren't men, they were women.

the teachers that punished me for no reason weren't men, they were women.

do you know who were men? 

the people who I felt safe with were men

the people that made me feel accepted were men

the people who taught me to like myself were men

the first people I truly liked were men

my TRUE friends were men

some brain dead idiot came up with some stupid dog fight analogy saying "You've seen dog attacks and been the victim of dog attacks before so even though all dogs arent mean you have reason to hate them.'

by that logic I, a female, can think that women are monsters and men are friends.
