i think im going insane so i have health anxiety big time

I think i may have rabies. To begin with, i first got this thought in september 2020 and i got a vaccine (actually 5 shots of antirabies) and it was all nice and cool until 31th of december when i THOUGHT i was bitten by a dog. I got extremely anxious and went to the doctor again. She said i was fine and protected from rabies for a year because i did those 5 shots in sept. The thing is last weekend i walked pass a dog and it started running towards me. I got scared and ran off. The dog didnt seem like it had an owner and i have no idea if it bit me or not. I was with a friend and he said that he saw the whole thing and i didnt get bit. i also didnt feel any pain at the time but i cany help but be anxious. What if it bit me? What if i have rabies? What if the vaccine is inneffective or what if the doctor lied to me to make me feel better what if im gonna die

it really debilitating and i am stuck in an endless loop of anxiety thanks for coming to my ted talk
