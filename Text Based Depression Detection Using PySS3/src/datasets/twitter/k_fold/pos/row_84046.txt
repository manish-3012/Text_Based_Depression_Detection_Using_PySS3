What even is my life at this point I donâ€™t even know what reality is anymore. Everything Iâ€™ve done just further enslaves me to this fantasy that Iâ€™ve locked myself in where my longings are quenched but the consequence in that is that a new quenching is needed and that has now made itself apparent as the longing for a knowing of what reality is, what twitch is fantasy and which are real. Oh, Christ, I need out. I want to know if constant work would help, but then what more would my life be then constant labor? What purpose then does it serve? Should I have to wait? I want to pursue it now, but I havenâ€™t a clue how. I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s real in me. And nobody else can tell me. Iâ€™ve fucked this all up.
