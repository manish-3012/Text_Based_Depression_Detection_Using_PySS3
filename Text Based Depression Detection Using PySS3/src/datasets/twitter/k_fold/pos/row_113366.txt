I think I'm just incapable of being in a relationship. 
I just got into a romantic relationship with a girl who has been my best friend for on and off two years. She's absolutely incredible, she's loving, she's kind, she's everything I'd ever want in a girlfriend. Yet for some reason, I sit thinking 'What if I don't love her and never will?', 'Maybe we have to break up because of this', it seems she absolutely adores me yet I'm having thoughts like these. I'm at a loss. It's not the first time this has happened either, I started getting the same thing toward the end of my last relationship. I just don't understand it. Why can't everything just be perfect?
