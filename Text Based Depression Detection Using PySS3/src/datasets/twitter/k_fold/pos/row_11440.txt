Loophole Request: I go to a prominent boarding school in England, and as of last year, there's been a change in management. The new Headmaster is an annoying, arrogant tyrant, but that's not important. The school doesn't have a uniform, but it does have a dress code, where boys wear shirts, but before him, we never had to tuck them in. I know it doesn't sound like a big change, but it really struck a nerve with us, so could anyone find any loophole in the phrasing: "NO visible shirt tails, underwear or midriffs."? I don't expect many responses, but anything helpful would be awesome, as a sort of mini-rebellion for us students. Thanks!
