Does herobrine exist? I started playing minecraft in the winter of 2012 &amp; after i started to become more &amp; more experienced in minecraft, my uncle told me that there is a legend in minecraft if Herobrine. I actually started minecraft on IOS but after an entire year, My older brother, uncle &amp; i started playing Minecraft Xbox 360 edition. they had always told me that herobrine never existed. i did believe them the he never existed. during the summer of 2014 i would play minecraft ps3 edition at my grandparents house in my room. this was an updated version &amp; all it had was city texture &amp; the new stuff but i couldn't remember what update it was, i remember one day where i was building a house in a new world when i saw something on a hill. It wasn't a creepy, zombie, skeleton or a villager. i stopped with everything then i started to run towards the hill then that thing walked into a cave, the cave was filled with redstone torchs. i couldn't find that nps but i found redstone torches &amp; strange signs in it. After all these days i can't remember what those signs had written on them. so does herobrine really exist?
