Ecological footprint Ok this is kinda cool so listen up

It compares humans demands for resources to Earth's capacity to generate resource as well as absorb human waste

So u can Google up ecological footprint calculator and you'll find yours with a short survey

It'll show how many Earths will be needed if everyone in the world lived like you.
