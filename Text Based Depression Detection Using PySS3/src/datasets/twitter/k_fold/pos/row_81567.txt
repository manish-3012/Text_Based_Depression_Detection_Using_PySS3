Want To Bee In A Minecraft Movie? Some friends are making a movie in Minecraft and we need the help of the community. We need actors, builders, and camera people. We have a discord server and a Minecraft realm. We have a script and the movie will bee about an hour long. The main plot of the movie is set in medieval times, there was a group of magical creatures that are bee/human mutants, they were in war with the humans, now a group of 4 kids and 1 young adult are trying to find the home of these creatures. Dm me for discord server and put any questions in the comments. This is done in Minecraft bedrock edition.
