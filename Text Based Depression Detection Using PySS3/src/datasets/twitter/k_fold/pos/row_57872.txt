man i remember laying in bed in the hospital and i may not always recognize it but iâ€™ve come so far from then that was like early january n i been in &amp; out a couple times but iâ€™m not gonna live in and out of the hospital iâ€™m gonna live and feel and Love

i hate feeling sometimes most of the time cause it hurts. it hurts so so so much but to feel is to live and to live is to love. and i love and that means everything to me
