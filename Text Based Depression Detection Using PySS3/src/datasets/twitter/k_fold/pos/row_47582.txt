Do you think my friend would forgive me? So i had a friend i made in discord a while ago and i became pretty good friends with her, we would talk everyday and we would ocassionally have phone calls  this happened during 2017-2019 but in early 2019 she started acting very cold towards me and at one point she insulted me for no reason, we later got into an argument which ended in an insult match and we ended up blocking each other.

Its been almost a year since our fight and im starting to miss her a lot and i dont know what i can do.

Should i try and contact her and apologise or something? Or should i just forget about her?

What do you guys recommend i should do?
