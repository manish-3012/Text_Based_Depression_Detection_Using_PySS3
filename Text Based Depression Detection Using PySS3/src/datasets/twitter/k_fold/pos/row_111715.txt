Looking for computer help So I may be getting a new laptop soon, and since I know jack shit about computers I was looking for help. The only things I would be doing is schoolwork, watching youtube, maybe playing Watchdogs 2, Among Us, and Minecraft, so would anyone be able to help? These are the specs, and it is a Lenovo ThinkPad E15:
