My crush / best friend gets to have a date on Valentineâ€™s Day This is some major bullshit . I am happy for her beacuase she tried to commit suicide and now this is better for her but now I feel like dog shit , and the worst part is that itâ€™s a furry .  Iâ€™m not trying to hate furry culture and all that but Iâ€™m just pisssed and sad
