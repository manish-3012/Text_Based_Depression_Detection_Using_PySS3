Today I found out something really strange So last night I had gastroenteritis which for those of you who donâ€™t know it is where you get an upset stomach and you vomit. 

Anyway so last night I got out of bed felling really sick I asked mum if I could use the toilet in her room cause the one near my room was broken. She said yeah of course but as I was walking I couldnâ€™t hold  it in and vomited all over the carpet. She then said â€œgod fucking dammit! Whatâ€™s wrong with you? I stared at her from the toilet you know how expensive this carpet was. 

Ok I didnâ€™t think she was serious but it sounds like she cared more about a carpet than me basing sick.

Also sorry if I made any spelling mistakes
