Thereâ€™s no incentive to get 100s when all I hear when I do get a 100 is good job. I donâ€™t want a halfass good job when I had to ask for it in the first place. Iâ€™m a smart kid and if my grades where gauging my intelligence they would be all be 100s but since there gauging my ability to put forth unrewarded (in the short term) effort then I canâ€™t work my ass off for nothing.
