My group home buys me loads of vegan crap and it's annoying I've been a strict vegan for years and I'm recovering from an eating disorder. I live in a group home where most people are overweight and being overweight is perfectly accepted as normal. It really really bugs me how they obsess over the fact that I'm the only vegan and buy me loads of unwanted vegan junk food that I don't want. The freezer is full of random almost out-of-date vegan burgers, pizzas, pasties, pies, etc. Just let me eat my kale in peace.
