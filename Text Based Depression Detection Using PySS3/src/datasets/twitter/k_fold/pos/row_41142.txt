In a weird position with one of my friends right now, not looking for advice as I know what Iâ€™m doing just kind of stating the situation So yeah she just sucks at dealing with my emotions lol. The way she handles them always makes me feel worse rather than better. Itâ€™s not a toxicity thing though, sheâ€™s just very blunt and that doesnâ€™t work well with me. Sheâ€™s in a healthy relationship with someone and has a lot of close friends so itâ€™s not like sheâ€™s unlikable or anything like that just the way she handles emotions doesnâ€™t gel well with me.  
  
I donâ€™t really want to talk to her about this because itâ€™s not a big deal, I have other friends and I think it would do more harm for her than good for me. I just have to quit talking about my emotions with her which is just weird. Iâ€™ve never had to like purposefully weaken a friendship unless I just wanted to get rid of it outright. Just a weird situation really
