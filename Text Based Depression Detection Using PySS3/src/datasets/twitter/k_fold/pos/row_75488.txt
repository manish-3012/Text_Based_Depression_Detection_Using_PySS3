The Dark Lorax (WIP) I am the Lorax, and I speak for the trees.

Litter again, and I'll break your fucking knees.


The Lorax knew one thing better than all.

He knew this thing better than dinosaurs can roar.


The trees can't be harmed.

If the Lorax is armed.


He pulled out his sniper.

Which could kill like a viper.


He shot the Once-ler,

That littering wanker.


He fired 3 shots, Shot 1, 2, 3.

One to the chest, head, and knee.


There was the Once-ler, one second in Bed

The very next second, he was dead.


I know this warning was blunt.

It was directed at you littering cunts.


I am the Lorax, and I speak for the trees.

One more man is dead, and that's because of me.
