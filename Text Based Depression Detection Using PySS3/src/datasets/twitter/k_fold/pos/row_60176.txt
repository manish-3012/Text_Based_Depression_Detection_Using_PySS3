Iâ€™m kinda getting irritated by this girl Alright hello everyone, Iâ€™m in AFJROTC and on Saturday 10/17 we had a community service project at one of the high schools, I ended up meeting lots of new people and one of them are a guy (ofc I canâ€™t use his real name) so letâ€™s just call him Cadet R. Now Cadet R is really nice and sweet,we get along very well. Now he calls me pretty, cute, and beautiful, I have told him that I am in a relationship and tried to make it clear that Iâ€™m not interested (Iâ€™m not assuming that he likes me itâ€™s just something I want out there) now this girl and me are Friends we are going to call her Cadet E, now Cadet E has a huge crush on Cadet R. (Cadet R is a senior, me and Cadet E are freshys) Cadet E keeps thinking that I want to steal Cadet R from her and I really donâ€™t, I have my own boyfriend who I love dearly. All Cadet E has done is assume that I want to be with Cadet R even Tho I have made it very clear that all I want is to just have a friendship with him. Itâ€™s starting to really irritate me, does anyone have some advice?
