Do you remember some bedtime stories which still inspire you today? I still remember this bedtime story from my mother, it was about a hungry spider who asked God to make everyone die who laughs mockingly at someone else.

The spider brought cassava plants to a rocky place where almost nothing grows, then he encountered deer who asked him what he was going to do and the spider replied: "I'm going to plant the cassava here," and Deer starting laughing "nothing grows here!" and died. Now has the smart spider food for one week. 

The next week was the spider going to do the same thing and waited for someone to encounter and the first one he encountered was Vulture and he told Vulture the whole story and Vulture said: "I have to go now, I have an appointment with the barber!" The spider started laughing, "But you are bald!" and then he died.
