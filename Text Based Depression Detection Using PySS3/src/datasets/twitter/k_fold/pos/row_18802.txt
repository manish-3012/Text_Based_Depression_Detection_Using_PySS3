What do you all believe? Title basically. What are your thoughts on religion, what's your faith, that sort of thing. Just curious to see what people here believe.

I believe that there is a god, but it doesn't give a shit about earth or humans. It probably doesn't give a shit about the universe either, it simply started it and went off to do something else. I believe that to believe anything else would be egotistical, space is big and we're just one species on one tiny planet in one tiny corner of the universe. Why would a god pay any more attention to us than some other species on another planet?

How about you guys?
