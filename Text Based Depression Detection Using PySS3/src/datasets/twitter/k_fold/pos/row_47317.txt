Everyone from my middle school friend group glowed up. EXCEPT FOR ME! I still look like a beached whale. 

Everyoneâ€™s teeth got straightened, they loss weight, grew into their features, has a nice style. Yet here I am, still wearing the same hairstyle and clothes while being 50 lbs heavier with a messed up smile.
