This sh*tty year (and the last one) I have dark circles under my eyes becasue I'm always too stressed to fall asleep. Even though we've had three semesters too, I still haven't adjusted to virtual school. On top of that, I've neglecting my physical and mental heath for the entire lockdown. I barely get outside, I'm generally sitting in front of a computer for 9 hours a day. I feel completely useless and uncared for, even if I know this isn't true. I've just fallen into a depressive slump. Looking into my future, I can't see anything for me. I've considered self harm or even just ending it all multiple times. I just don't know what to do.
