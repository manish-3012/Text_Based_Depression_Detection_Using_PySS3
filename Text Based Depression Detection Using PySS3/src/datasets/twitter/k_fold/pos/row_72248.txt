I'm constantly stressed out, and recently its been getting worse Hi, im 18 and from the UK, and i feel as though I'm always stressed about pretty much everything, finding a university corse that will put me in a career I actually want to go into, problems with my car, college, or even talking to friends or playing games  stresses me out because I feel as though I should be doing something more productive. I haven't sat down and had fun playing a game for months now because of this.
 
The deadline to apply to a university is in 139 days and only this week I've been trying to figure out wtf to do with my life, because i have no idea. Is it normal to be stressed out all the time? Because it feels obsessive and I feel as though I don't have control over it  

Is anyone else like this, does any one have advice? Thank you in advance
