What are your thoughts on how coming of age movies and tv are impacting teen culture and boredom/expectations? So, I think I found my research topic for school and I'd like to kind of... figure out if other teens feel that there is a genuine influence there or not.

So, Do you think coming of age in movies and tv *have* had an impacted on teen culture? Our expectations of being a teen or what high school would be like vs. what it is?

Would help a lot to know what you all think about this and the whole idea of "am I the main character?"
