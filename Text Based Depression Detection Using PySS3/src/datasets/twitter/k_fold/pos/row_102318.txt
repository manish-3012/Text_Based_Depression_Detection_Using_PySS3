My fellow redditors, I have failed No Nut November, but I think I can redeem myself. Ok ok hear me out, I failed No Nut November, which is a challenge where I have to not ejaculate for an entire month, so, if I don't masturbate until the 2nd of December, will that mean that I successfully completed No Nut November?
