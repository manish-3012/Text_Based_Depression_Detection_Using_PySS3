The one album that everyone on the internet knows. Classic vaporwave.

2. [Catsystemcorp- Palm Mall Mars](https://youtu.be/Cc5Yz1TnOVY)

Sequel album to catsystemcorp's "Palm Mall" album. It's one of the examples why I love vaporwave so much. It's a concept album about the first Martian shopping mall in 2149.

3. [Paradise of Yesterday- Nightlife](https://youtu.be/VhhWSZc6Lkw)

More ambient

4. [FM Skyline-Liteware](https://youtu.be/blGGMUTb7YI)

Good ol vaporwave 

5. [Desert sand feels warm at night](https://youtu.be/FF-l9SoB73Y) 

Very ambient. Almost crosses into the territory of ambient music. It's good to listen at 3am thinking about stuff
