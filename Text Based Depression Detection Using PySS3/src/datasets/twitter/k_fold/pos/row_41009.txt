Why is it so hard to find a girl? I just want an online relationship with a girl who has a good personality. Guys out here having sex. You doin too much. I like white and black girls. Neither want me. I never lie to people I care about. Girls lie to me. I show interest in you and your interests. They don't show interest in me. Why you girls playing so much? Wtf is wrong me? If you gave me a chance you'd love me. Don't sleep on me. I don't ever leave you on read.
