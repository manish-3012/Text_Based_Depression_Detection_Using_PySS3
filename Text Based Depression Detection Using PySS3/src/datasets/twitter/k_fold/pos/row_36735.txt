F*ck my School district  

So y'all know that whole coronavirus thing right? Well F\*CK IT we don't care were going to go to school with nothing to stop the spread of Covid-19. No mask, no temperature checking, no social distancing. You know how we tried to do summer school a month ago and had 5 positive cases within a week and got forced to shut down that definitely won't happen again. - my School district, 2020

Any ways can't wait until 2 weeks from now when they get shut down and I can stop putting my family's life at risk cause are school board wants to be r\*tarded.
