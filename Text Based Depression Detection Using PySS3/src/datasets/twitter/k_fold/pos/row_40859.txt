Stop scaring people by not wearing masks Firsteval I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, but I'm still posting this.

My point is that even if you think that Covid-19 isn't real or you don't care about wearing a mask, you should still wear a mask. Because many people believe in the Corona Virus and are afraid of persons like people that don't wear masks. And if you don't wear a mask you'll make his life harder and it isn't as hard to wear a mask. Sometimes I forget that I'm wearing a mask and just walk with it even if I don't have to.

An example would be, if there were a serial killer that escaped the prison and the media warns everyone to stay in house and make the lights off, so the serial killer doesn't know if there is someone. And you believe it, but your friend or roommate doesn't believe what they are saying and wants to show you the truth, so he decides to switchs all lights on, plays loud music and stuff like this. and you are scared as hell that the serial killer is coming to your house. And it turns out your roommate was right and the serial killer doesn't exist, but it still was a fucking horror for him.

I don't know if this was an good example or if someone will ever read it, but I just wanted to say that. 

And it's just much easier if you wear a mask, because you don't have all the stress. 

That was all I hope you have a good day and stay safe. (Sorry, if there are any spelling mistakes, my native language is not english)
