Its â€œshouldâ€™veâ€ and NOT â€œshould ofâ€ Holy fucking shit. I canâ€™t stand it anymore. A few months ago, I saw someone type â€œshouldâ€™veâ€ as â€œshould ofâ€ on their Instagram story and couldnâ€™t stop laughing at that. It was hilariously stupid. Fast forward to current time, SO MANY PEOPLE ARE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE. Like how the fuck did that shit spread faster than corona? Today I saw a trending post on this sub Reddit which also made the same mistake. After reading that, I knew I had to do something to save the world from this abomination and what better way than to start from us- the teenagers. We are gonna be the ones to lead the future, so we cannot be making such silly mistakes. 

So let me make it clear-
â€œShould haveâ€ is shortened to â€œShouldâ€™veâ€. 

Thatâ€™s it. 

Thereâ€™s nothing like â€œShould ofâ€. This no makes sense. 

So I request you all to stop making the same mistake and if you see anyone else do the same, please correct them as well. 

I hope that at least on this sub Reddit, I wonâ€™t see anymore â€œshould ofâ€s in peopleâ€™s posts. I know there might be grammatical errors in this post as well but I hope my message is clear. Godspeed.
