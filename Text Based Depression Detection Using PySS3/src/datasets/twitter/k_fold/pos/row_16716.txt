Females who are in the late teen mark (15-19), I need your help For context 

I (17m) am autistic, so social understanding and recognising someoneâ€™s emotions based of facial expression or voice alone is hard for me. I want to ask if you like someone, what do you do? Either to get their attention or just something you do to try and hide your feelings but fail miserably? I donâ€™t suspect any girl I know likes me in that way, but itâ€™s more like a â€œjust in case thingâ€, yâ€™know
