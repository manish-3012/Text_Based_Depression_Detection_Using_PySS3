Friendly reminder that saying â€˜youâ€™re the only funny girl iâ€™ve metâ€™ or â€˜usually girls arenâ€™t funny but you areâ€™ is not a fucking compliment i swear to god if one more guy says this to me i will throw my phone into a river and live in the woods where i never have to talk to a fucking neck beard again
