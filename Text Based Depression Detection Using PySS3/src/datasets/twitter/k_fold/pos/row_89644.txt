My drunk uncle gave me over 400 $ at new year's eve few years ago and told not to tell anyone. What the heck do I do? Pretty much what the title says but let me give you some backstory.

First of all I'm not a native english speaker and the currency in my country is not dollars but google says the money is worth 406 $ now. 

My uncle is an alcohol addict for as long as I can remember and he stopped fighting it years ago. His wife left him. His family members either don't give a shit or "help" the way that it's getting worse. I mean his sisters came to his house yelling at him that he needs to go stop and he was only more uptight ever since. 

The thing is that whenever we had a family meeting like someone's birthday no one cares about him and he comes to me to talk because I am the only one that listens to him probably. And it is like this for like four years now maybe. (For some context I've recently I've turned 18) 

Probably when I was 15 or maybe 14 on new year's eve he gave me money worth about 400$ and told not to tell anyone. He said he doesn't need this money and that he is a loser or something I don't even remember. I was kind of scared and refused to take it but he was stubborn. 

It is not my money. I mean technically I have it but I don't think about it as my money. I don't want to spend it. Also he was drunk so I don't even know if he remembers he gave it to me. And I just....shit

What do I do, internet strangers?
