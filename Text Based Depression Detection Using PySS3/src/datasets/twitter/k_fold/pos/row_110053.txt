so my school of 11 people switched locations recently, and we are RIGHT FUCKING NEXT TO A GIANT FOOD COURT. the place is a lot bigger than our last one, I really like the vibe of it, we can actually hang out and we have a really comfy space and stuff. but the best part is that there is a Starbucks close by as well as a huge mall with 2$ pizza and tons of different restaurants. 

Today friends and I went to a burger joint near the mall, it was really fucking good. it's just fun. we gon be getting lunch out  EVERY DAY! 

and there is a HUUUGGGEEE shopping store with a ton of different snacks and stuff.
