Millenials are old people now Millenials are old people now. Watching the same, boring shows on loop, claiming the world was better when they were young, being oh-so out of touch with the youth. You thought minion memes were bad, wait till you see the same impact font jpg about some 20-30 year old show or movie that the world has forgotten. They desperately clutch for the youth that passed them so long ago. Example, Stranger Things and the new IT movies. Good on their own, but so much of the success is Millenials going "Oh it's like the '80s! When the world was so much better!" And when the youth don't know about the shows, movies, music, or any pop culture of their time, they get angry. Granted, age doesn't render media worthless, but no one should expect something to never age. Something chalk full of dated pop culture references may make the average Millenial bust their balls, but someone from gen z will not find it funny. Or worse, it can age poorly. Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic jokes cracked like nothing, before people realized that they have feelings. Even worse, they may never grow up from it. "All these snowflake bastards can't take a joke! Everyone is an idiot except for me!" That's why comedians like Bill Burr just aren't funny anymore. Their rose tinted glasses are so stained that they can't see the worth in the modern world.
