So it's the first time I'm going to have to try to fall asleep naturally instead of exhausting myself into sleep by browsing reddit all night, as mom decided to take my phone. First time I did it un a few months already, imma report what stupid thoughts cross my depressed mind in the morning G'night lads

Hoping to not lie down for 2 or 3 hours straight thinking about stuff

See y'all
