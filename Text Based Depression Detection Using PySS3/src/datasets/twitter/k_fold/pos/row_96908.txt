I kind of walked (success kind of) It took like 20 minutes in order to even have enough strength to stand up. My balances was non-existent and I almost fell down immediately. I held onto the book shelf which kind of didn't help. I got like two or three steps before collapsing again. But heck, this is a big achievement! ðŸ˜ƒ
