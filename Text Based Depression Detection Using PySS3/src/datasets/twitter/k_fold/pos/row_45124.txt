Crush has the same name as me-what would you do? Weâ€™re girls and we have the same nickname but not the same first name. If youâ€™re wondering what kind of nickname, itâ€™s the kind of nickname that literally EVERYBODY calls you (like your birthname is William but everybody calls you Will).

I guess my question is would you date someone with the same name as you? Yes or no and why?
