I think my sister is gay? I saw a couple posts on social media where she was tagged by her friend who is a girl. The posts are usually memes about relationships and stuff and the captions are like "this is just like me and [sister] when...". Back when she was in high school there was also this other girl who was gay that was super friendly with her. My cousin's friend who knew the girl also told me that there was something between the two back then.

I hope I'm not overreacting but I'm getting suspicious. If this turns out to be true I will support my sister 100% and I want her to be happy. 
I'm just not too sure how my family will react to this. They're pretty traditional and my sister is the prettiest among us siblings plus she's very talented and she always gets teased about being "chased" by boys all the time.
