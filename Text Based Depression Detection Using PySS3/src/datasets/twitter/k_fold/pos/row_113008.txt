I just discovered PewDiePieâ€™s doki doki playthrough and boy, is it hilarious! His comedic sprinkling on storytelling is what makes them amazing to watch. Maybe thatâ€™s why he came at the top playing video games after all. 

I wish I found his newer content more interesting than older ones. Most of his 2020 vids have been sorta boring (except among us and KSIâ€™s meme review). His minecraft hardcore is linda boring as well. The only that series made me chuckle was in the past episode where he killed water cat 7 seconds into the video.
