To all of you that talk about SCP to the bus driver STOP IT 
Just had road at the front of the bus and this freshman would not shut up about scp once he left I asked the driver if she was ok and she jokingly asked for antidepressant, so pls for the love of humanity stop, your internet passion dosent interest everyone as much as you.
