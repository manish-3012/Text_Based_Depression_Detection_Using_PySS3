My Mother My mom does absolutely nothing around the house, when she's done cooking she leaves everything out and expects (her kids, me and my brother) us to clean it up. She's the messiest person ever i've ever met, on new years i was with her at her friends house, he was apologizing about his house being a mess. I told him it was fine, he responded with "oh that's right, i've seen your guys's house"

my cousin lives with us, he's 26, he invited his friend to rent out a room here, he's been here for a year now. When my mom went on a little vacation, we were at our dads house. My mom had her son (age 1) he's from a different father then my and my older bro. 

when she returned we came back to her house to spend time with her (custody reasons). My cousin and his friend had a family meeting which was rare because he just stays in his room and doesn't bother anyone, but they told me my brother and my mom how they were more comfortable with my mom gone because the house was clean. 

By mentioning that above, i'm just saying they also know my mom does nothing around the house, except, my brother (17) has a minor mental disability which barely affects him, but he's reallly lazy. So my mom puts all the chores on me.

i'm not one to not do chores, i understand i'm a great help, and kids need to help around the house. But when i'm literally the only person doing chores, of course the house is going to look horrible. 

my mom told me today, she has to settle a (driving on a suspended lise car charge) if the judge doesn't decide to clear it or whatever, she'll be arrested, i asked what would happen with my 1 y/o bro, she said me and my 17 year old brother would take care of him. My mom doesn't even trust my brother cause she thinks he's neglecting him, when he babysits

I'm considering moving in with my father, but when i mentioned that to my mom, she sort of threatened suicide.

all this, and i'm 15

i know my life isn't the worst I just don't know what to do
