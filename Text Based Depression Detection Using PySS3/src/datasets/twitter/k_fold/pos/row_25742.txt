Mid-Week Crisis I literally have no idea what to do with my life. iâ€™m scared of failure and i already feel like iâ€™m going to be nothing... i genuinely think about life and how terrified i am nearly every time i try to do my school work or even when i go to my job. i donâ€™t wanna be stuck at a grocery store for the rest of my life, and i wanna not fail in school, but iâ€™ve got absolutely no clue wtf to do with my life. i wanted to be a psychologist or a forensic psychologist but i honestly donâ€™t think i could handle all the school work for it:/
