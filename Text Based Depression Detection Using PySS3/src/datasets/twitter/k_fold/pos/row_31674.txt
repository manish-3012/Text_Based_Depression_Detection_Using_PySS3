Omg I found out from my dad I might finally be getting my uterus removed! Huge news. I've never been more excited before. It's probably just going to be a few until my belly is finally empty!

For context I'm an eighteen year old agender person. I really don't like the fact that I have genitals, so I'm working to get them removed. Once my womb is no more I can look twords removing the rest!

 Any advice on how do deal with this? What should I expect?
