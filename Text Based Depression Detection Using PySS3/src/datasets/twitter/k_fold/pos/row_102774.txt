I really hate my brother rn i was in his room for internet like always, and i was charging my gopro bc the time lapse killed it. Hes room is screened in, go the outside temp is the same inside. I am cold bc its windy and what not so I ask to use a blanket that he never even touches and is hanging up. He said no bc im not worthy like wtf, and i just asked if i could use it bc im cold and he doesnt use it. he said no over and over bc im not worthy and make a mess. like wtf am i not worthy of, and how tf do you make a mess with a blanket. I staarted asking wtf i wasnt worthy of and he wont fucking tell me, and tells me to get out. i got my stuff together and he says dont forget your gopro. I ask if he can put it in my bag bc my hands were full so he grabs it and says i can get it myself. its in his fucking hand and he wont put it in the damn bag im holding out to him. He wont give it to me, but will take the extra 10 steps to put it outside. I stand on his steps and he puts it outside, i ask if he can put it in the bag, and he wont. i stood there for like 20min just watching him and occasionally asking y he couldnt put it in the bag. he said bc i cant follow orders, like wtf ur 11 and i dont 'take orders' from anyone. this little bitch starts crying throwing a fit so i leavr the bag outside by his steps so he can put it in. i walk over to my aunts, and he followed me bitching about it. he went and moved the gopro and told me to fing it if i wanted it. I took his new watch and told him to get it for me if he wanted it. eventually he went and got it and said i could keep the watch. i set the watch on the table and he throws it a everything. now his watch is broke, i have my gopro back and hes crying and bitching abt hating this island and how the world sucks and our family fell apart.
