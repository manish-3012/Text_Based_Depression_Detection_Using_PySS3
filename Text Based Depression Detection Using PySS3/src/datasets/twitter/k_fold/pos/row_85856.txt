Normal conversation Me: reading in my room
Dad: Comes in
Dad: so.  What did ya get on ur biology test yesterday?
Me: I got a 22/25 on that test 
Dad: what the fuck. Thatâ€™s so fucking low.  What the fuck is ur problem?
Me: I donâ€™t know what my problem is and so I emailed the teacher-
Dad: like what the fuck is ur problem.  You said to me a couple of days ago you understand everything about that topic and you get low of a fucking score?
Me: no I thought I knew everything but it looks like I didnâ€™t and so I emailed the teacher-
Dad: no fucking excuses.  And thatâ€™s ur fucking problem. You donâ€™t know your problem. What the fuck is with you?
Me: yeah I donâ€™t know my problem so I asked the teacher if-
Dad- I donâ€™t give a shit.  You told me u knew everything and that you were confident you were going to do good at the test. And what do you do?  You fail the fucking test! Below average even
Me: the class average is-
Dad: I donâ€™t give a fuck what it is itâ€™s low still. I donâ€™t know why you think you know everything
Me: I never said I knew everything
Dad: then why did you say you knew everything a couple of days ago huh?
Me: I said I knew everything about that test and what to do to prepare for it and I did it.
Dad: but you failed the test right?
Me: no I didnâ€™t fail the test, I just-
Dad: donâ€™t you try to be smart with me.  You got questions wrong right?
Me: yes
Dad: so you didnâ€™t know everything did you?
Me: I THOUGHT I did but I guess I didnâ€™t know all there is to the test
Dad: so you lied to me then huh
Me: no
Dad: you said to me you knew everything and now u just admitted you didnâ€™t and so you lied. RIGHT!?!?!!?
Me: I guess...
Dad: now thatâ€™s ur fucking problem. You lie and you donâ€™t know your problem. Ur fucking grounded until I see improvement 

A day later

Me: so apparently the questions I got wrong were actually right, the google form test just didnâ€™t accept the answer. So my real grade for the test is 25/25 and not 22/25
Dad: good. So ur grade for that test is now perfect right?
Me: yes. And it wasnâ€™t my fault when it said it was a 22/25 
Dad: what
Me; yeah. It wasnâ€™t my fault that it said it was a 22/25 when we talked yesterday 
Dad: what do you mean itâ€™s not your fault.  
Me: itâ€™s not my fault because the google form test just didnâ€™t accept the answer
Dad: didnâ€™t accept the answer? So you got it wrong?
Me: no, I got it correct bu-
Dad: then why doesnâ€™t it accept the answer?  It doesnâ€™t make any sense youâ€™re not making any sense right now.  
Me: Iâ€™m saying the technology fault not my fault. 
Dad: and there you go blaming everything else for your problems
Me: no I was jus-
Dad: thatâ€™s another one of your fucking problems. Blaming everybody else. Just once just fucking admit your mistake
Me: it wasnâ€™t my mistake it was the technology that made the mistake
Dad: can you just say I admit I made a mistake
Me: fine. I made a mistake and itâ€™s my fault 
Dad: now that wasnâ€™t so hard was it. Next time, donâ€™t go fucking blaming everything else for your mistakes you fucking understand me?
Me: yes
Dad: good. 


Iâ€™m so fucking tired of dealing with this shit like what the fuck are you listening to me


Tldr: I get a 22/25 on a biology test and dads not happy. He says my problems are lying and and not knowing what my problems are even though I emailed the teacher to ask what I got wrong and keeps interrupting me. Turns out it was a google form error and then my dad says I blame everything on something else and never admit to something and makes me say I admit my mistake
