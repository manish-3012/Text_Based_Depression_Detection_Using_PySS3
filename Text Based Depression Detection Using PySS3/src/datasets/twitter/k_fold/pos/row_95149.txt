No classes with this girl but still want to try to ask her out I'm interested in this girl that I've known for like 2 years but we don't have any classes together and we are on virtual school until November. We talked a lot last year before the virus hit but we didn't talk as much after. We follow each other's finstas and we comment on each other's posts every once in a while but we don't really dm. How should I start talking to her again and eventually ask her out on a date?
