Editor and Voice Applications (and maybe drawing applications) for Animated Explanation/History Video I am thinking of making an animated video (not moving animation but like PowerPoint animation), and I need help. If anyone reading this has editing talent, or experience in making videos, PM me and we will talk. If anyone has drawing talent, PM me so I can see If you are skilled enough to get a part in the video. Digital Art Only!

All of this is unpaid and the final video won't make a profit. All the people who worked on it it will have their usernames in the credits.

Any Questions?
