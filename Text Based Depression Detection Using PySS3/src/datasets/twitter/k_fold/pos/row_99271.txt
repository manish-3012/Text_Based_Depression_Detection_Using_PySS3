Im really lonely, i just want talk about it. Yea. My best friend suddenly stops answering my texts, even though we'd play minecraft like every day. I send him a meme and just nothing, just put on read. He still shows up to the online classes cause we have a class together. Im pretty sure he still has his phone. I dont have a girlfriend, i remember in elementary school, i had a crush on this girl, and i knew she liked me back. I had that feeling of happiness whenever i would talk to her. But a year later after going to different schools for a year in middle school, she doesnt talk to me anymore. I tried to say hi to her in the hallway once. I know she heard me, but nothing. I think im depressed, i just play video games all day now. No friends really to talk to. I have my dog (which i love) but she doesnt really like coming upstairs to chill. She only comes upstairs to sleep on my bed with me when i go to bed. I dont have anyone to talk. No fucking way im gonna talk to my mom or dad. Im just really sad sometimes when i think about it.

Im going to high score next year, and the way things are going, thats going to suck. At least im getting a gaming pc for christmas tho :)
