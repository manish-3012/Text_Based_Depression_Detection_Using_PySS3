What is the most stupidest thing that traumatized you as a little kid? I'll start. When I was around 5 years old, I thought bricks were one of the strongest things in the world and told my parents as such. They said no, it wasn't but I felt they were wrong because if I couldn't break any bricks, then they MUST be unbreakable! (Well that and because I was like 5 I didn't know any better lol) 

But my parents decided to show me proof that bricks weren't all that strong by having me watch a video of a tsunami tearing apart buildings, most of which were probably constructed with bricks. I was so shocked and dumbfounded when I saw that, that I became VERY afraid of water to the point where I thought that the littlest bit could make a tsunami and it made me scared to bathe because I thought that I would drown due to a tsunami forming in the tub. 

This fear of water/bathing stuck with me for a looonngg time afterwards, but eventually after I grew older I stopped fearing water and baths and now interact with both with no fear at all whatsoever.
