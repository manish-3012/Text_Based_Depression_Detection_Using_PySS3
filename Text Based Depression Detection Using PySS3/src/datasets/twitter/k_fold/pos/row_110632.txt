I hate that even though I like girls more, Iâ€™m likely only gonna date boys as a teenager Because thereâ€™s like no lesbians or bi girls in my town. I mean boys are cool too! Totally! Just wish I could experience having a gf as a teenager. I mean there probably are bi/lesbian girls where I live, but Idk where they are lol
