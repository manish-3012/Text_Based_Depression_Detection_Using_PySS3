My Sibling's backpacks just got stolen I am so f -ing pissed. 

My two elementary school siblings just got their backpacks stollen. Most of their important school supplies was at home, but their cromebooks and books were in there.

This might not seem like a huge deal, but my sister keeps trinkets on her backpack and she is a huge things person, she does not know yet but it hurts me to think about how she will feel.

This might sound selfish but I made me think about it my backpack was stolen, it has a journal I would kill for before someone read, a sketchbook that I have spent hours on, all of my notes from school that I'm graded on, a crombook, and lot more. I would die if it was stolen.

I'm really angry but if someone wants to share a story feel free to do so.

I hope you are having a good day!
