The worst geography teacher that I ever had I had a really bad geography teacher, this happen this year, before I have online classes I had a really good teacher but then start the online classes he resigned because he couldn't make online classes witch is a shame, so a new teacher came becasicily when the class started he played a music (with bad sound quality) like michael jackson and "sand junior" in the wolf of the time he was complaining about the internet and the other half he has showing a video

I am really good at geography but I only take 6 on the fist test made by him so a study really hard to next one to only take 7, I get so angry that when my parents saw me they think that I get 2 or 3, but when they saw it was 7 they said that it wasn't bad but I responded that I studied hard.

I realized that test that he made was a piece of Shit, why? He claims that the question on that test has made by him but my sister discovered that from the most part it was text , articles or news from G1(one of the most relevant Brazil newspaper) but note only that most of the text don't any relation with the content that my class where studying.

I remember in one of the test have a question with a long text about the basque country a region on Spain and France that what to be a country) but all the answer where about Ireland.

My school only fired him because in one of his test everyone get a bad great, after that the school create a bonus test for the people who need a better great.

The new geography teacher ins't bad and I take 9,70 on the first test of him but I don't watch his class.
