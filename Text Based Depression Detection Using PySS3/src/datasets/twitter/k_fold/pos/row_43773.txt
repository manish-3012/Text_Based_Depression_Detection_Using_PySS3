I love my parents! I've been saving for a Nintendo Switch since May, and I finally had enough. I was holding off, however, because I wanted to get a game at the same time. But my dad thought it might be hard to get, as there are rumors of a second lockdown here, so my mum bought it, a game, a case and a screen protector on her lunch break! Waiting for her to arrive with it right now.

Of course, I'm gonna pay for all the stuff when I have enough.

Except the screen protector. That was a present.
