Youâ€™re not cool or funny if you imitate other languages Ok so first of all, Iâ€™m not SUPER offended or triggered if you try to imitate or mock indian people. I get it. It sounds funny, the accent is silly, whatever. 

But in school last year, it was so goddamned annoying to hear people say beta (e pronounced like in emma) after every fucking sentence with an indian accent. 

All the â€œpopularâ€ kids thought it was the funniest thing in the entire world, but you donâ€™t hear indian people saying beta after every sentence. 

I think part of it was the fact that Drip Report released that light up sketchers song you might have heard about.

Now it *was* hilarious to watch people blasting that and Mundian To Bach Ke full volume in the hallways thinking they were the coolest people in the entire world.

idk maybe this is just a problem in my school in general. Youâ€™d think that people wouldâ€™ve matured enough by 10th grade to do something else, but hell no. 

Anyways I had to say that somewhere. I cringe a little internally when I hear someone bragging that theyâ€™ve memorized the lyrics to an indian song but theyâ€™re just sputtering gibberish. 

Goodnight

Edit: Iâ€™m indian born in the United States i shouldâ€™ve put that at the start
