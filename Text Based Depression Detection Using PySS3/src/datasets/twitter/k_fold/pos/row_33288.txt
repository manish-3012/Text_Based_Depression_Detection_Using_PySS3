Is it weird that my dad has full access to my school email? He accesses it from his computer and looks through my school emails (he gets all the updates I do, so I don't see the point but okay). Recently, he has asked me to stop deleting my emails (they can still be viewed in trash but okay). I don't plan to stop because I like to keep it clean in my inbox. But it feels weird to know that he can be looking through all my school emails including personal emails from other students. Is that weird, or am I overreacting?
