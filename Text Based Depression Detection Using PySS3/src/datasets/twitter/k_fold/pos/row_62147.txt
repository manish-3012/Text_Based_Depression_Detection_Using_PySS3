I guess she likes me now This girl that was relatively new to my school (only been there since September I believe) was talking to me about how she was thinking about bleaching her hair. But when she paused to let me speak I said â€œyour hair looks nice the way it isâ€ and she blushed and then we talked for a few more minutes during lunch. I think she liked me before this but I have a feeling that this amplified that.
