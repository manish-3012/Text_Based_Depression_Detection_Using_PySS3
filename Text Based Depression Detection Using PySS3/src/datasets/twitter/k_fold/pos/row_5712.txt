respect girls but don't let them shit on you..... This one of those things that you learn with time but someone can help you ,so the basic points are--
1. Don't spread rumours about any girl.seriously,they remember it for a long time and will destroy you when they get the chance.
2. Don't abuse them verbally,simply don't call them bitch or hoe, if your classmates tease you about it remember that you are more mature than to fall under peer pressure.
3. Don't let any girl treat you like crap...this will be difficult....see,you have to have a quick wit and a ready answer to shut down any girl....if you don't have it then give them a cold look and just outright ignore them,as if they are not worth your time.
4.simping is not equal to respecting girls,you should have complete confidence in yourself and not appear as a needy little bitch.
5.NEVER  hit a female..... even if they try to beat you,trust me if the female is cunning she can get you in a lot of trouble legal or otherwise.
6.don't underestimate them,they are equal to males in matters of mental ability,but most prefer subtle manipulation,just keep a clear mind all the time
7.don't back down , respecting girls doesn't mean that you should give up your rights or anything you deserve.
