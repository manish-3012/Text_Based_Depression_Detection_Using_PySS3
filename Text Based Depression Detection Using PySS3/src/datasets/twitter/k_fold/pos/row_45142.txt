Venting about her I've been friends with her since 4th grade, and started liking her at the end of 6th grade. I'm now in 8th, but the last time we saw each other was in 7th. Corona cut off all contact with her, and is terrible. I miss her so much. I miss her voice. I miss the stuff she'd say to me. I miss Being around her. I wish I could see her again, and just hold her tight and never let go. I dont want to lose her for another 7 months. I dont want to spend a single day awry from her. Sheer makes me so happy. Whenever I think of her my whole body feels like jello and I start blushing a lot, and it feels like my chest is on fire, but in a good way. I really hope I can see her again and tell her how I feel. It would make me the happiest person In  the whole if she loved me back or have me a chance. She's also one of the main reasons I want to live, I wanna make her happy. I remember all the times she's complemented me, all those times we just hung out and chilled. Those where such fun times, just lying around with someone with someone you love, even if you dont know if they feel the same way. She's so nice looking, she's a solid 10 in every way. She's so perfect, and she makes me so happy. I miss her so much, it's one of the first times I've ever cried over missing someone. I love her. I love her, I really really hope she feels the same way about me. I dont even know how to put into words what I feel for her
