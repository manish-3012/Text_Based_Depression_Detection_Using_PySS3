Is it sad to turn up to formal alone? My year group is finishing up year 10 at the end of this year. Y10 (15/16-year-olds) in Australia is the last year of high school. My friend and I had a discussion regarding if going to Formal (Australian prom for the lack of a better description) alone is considered sad? 

Just wondering what you guys think.
