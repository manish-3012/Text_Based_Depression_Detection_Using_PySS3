Not necessary but if you are interested in sending data to the moon. Here is an idea. Hope youâ€™ll be able to do it! Okay I guess some of you might have seen that post on r/space tell you that they will send 10 mb of what ever you want. So I decided to send a song of mine which took 4 Mb. **I got this idea to take pictures(panoramas) of the area I live and my parentâ€™s house. I took 3 panos and put them in one big photo and added the latitudinal and longitudinal points(kind of like coordinates in minecraft but for earth)**. My dumbass exported the final picture as jpeg and it had lost its quality, [here is the picture (quite a shitty place lol) ](https://imgur.com/a/vvyrooW)Iâ€™m not sure if this is useful but Iâ€™m hoping that somehow those who figure out this will find the places we send. Kind of dumb but I guess some of you might be interested (:
