I'm a 16-year-old looking for the best way around my technology situation for a new school year...would love a fellow teenager's advice. Hi there!

I'm a 16-year-old high school student looking for a decent set of tech for my new school year starting September. I currently use an iPhone 8, and it working really well, so the phone situation is clear.

However, the issue is with laptops and tablets. I'm having a rather tight budget of about $820 which is AED 3000. I'm debating whether or not to do an iPad with a keyboard or a laptop or a laptop and a cheap tablet.

I will be using it for the following purposes: Zoom/MS teams meetings, viewing online textbooks, word processing, making spreadsheets, playing light games (Minecraft mainly) and general media consumption.  With a laptop iI ll e able to do my online classes really well. on the other hand with a tablet, I can take digital notes and maybe pick up the new skill of digital art.

I have the following options:

1. Blow the whole budget on a laptop
2. Blow the whole budget on an iPad with a keyboard and pencil
3. buy a cheap laptop and a cheap tablet
4. buy a cheap laptop only

It's really confusing as every side has its pros and cons. looking forward to a very informative response from Reddit.
