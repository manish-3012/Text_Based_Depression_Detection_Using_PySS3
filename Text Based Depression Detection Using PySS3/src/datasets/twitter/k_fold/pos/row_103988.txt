I HAVE RETURNED! If you don't remember, I'm that 16 year old who made a psychedelic rock album out of his room. I'm very proud to announce that I just released a music video for one of the songs!! We worked pretty hard on this bad boy, and also had a lot of fun. Please go check it out, it's so worth your time. And while your there, consider listening to the rest of the album, which is, of course, on every platform.

Here's the video:
