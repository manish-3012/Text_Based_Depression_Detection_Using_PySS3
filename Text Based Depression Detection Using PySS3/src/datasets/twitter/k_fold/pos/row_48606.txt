I feel super guilty over this This post will get lots of hate and sorry for bad grammar Iâ€™m on a phone typing fast ...I got back from a hunting trip today last night the person driving the truck I was in was very drunk we stopped in a small town and the tailgate of the truck was off and we were talking to a tweaker a dog jumped in the bed of the truck and we didnâ€™t notice and it layer down I donâ€™t know if it was his or someone else the ton was less then four miles from another town that just burned down and the dog was covered in bit marks all up itâ€™s face well forty miles later we got out to see if the trailer hitch was in the back still and we seen the dog at this point we were already in the mountains and it was one am and we had been in the car for twelve hours so we let the dog stay in the trailer with us this morning it ran away then came back as we were leaving the driver (my dad )said just leave it letâ€™s go i looked at him to see if he was being serious because we were a mile from town and it was thirty degrees and he just said get in so I did he left the dog there I feel guilty because i believe it will die of hunger or freeze to death but there was nothing I could do it wasnâ€™t my choice and it wasnâ€™t my car and we were forty miles away from the town we found it in i believe it could survive because itâ€™s about five and looks perfect and itâ€™s in a hunting camp with about twenty people I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they just left it too but I hope they donâ€™t I feel guilty I donâ€™t know if I should the dog was running up and down a dark road into traffic on a road people go fast on and was running in front of cars it also looked like it hadnâ€™t eaten in a while and we fed it so I think itâ€™s a street dog from the fire but I donâ€™t know I hunt a lot and have killed animals before even though I wasnâ€™t the person who made the call and I couldnâ€™t have changed it I feel guilty still
