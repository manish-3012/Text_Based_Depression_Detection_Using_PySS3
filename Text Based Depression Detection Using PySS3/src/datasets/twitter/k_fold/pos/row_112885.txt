Does anyone have experience with lash lifts, how different are your results i have long eyelashes but theyâ€™re kinda flat and never stay up with mascara or anything, and iâ€™d definitely want to have some more curl. i feel like it would def be something for me unless it doesnâ€™t seem worth it. what do you think about it?
