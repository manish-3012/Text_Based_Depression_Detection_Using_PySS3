My mother thinks I'm a unemotional psychopath. My mother recently had a conversation with me and she said that I am dry, emotionless, don't believe in love and have my own world. She also says that if I don't want to be with her on a daily basis, it means that when I turn 18 I will leave and lead a lonely life.

I, on the other hand, think that my mother is too emotional because she cries for any reason and is overly concerned about everything. We differ on many things, but she doesn't know why I don't show emotion. It is simple, No emotion, indifference to my surroundings in the judge of justice, dry analysis of most of the major actions I perform. If I express any emotion I do it only alone in the woods, in my room or only in front of my dog. I think dogs are better individuals for expression and play than humans. A dog will listen to you, smell you, lick you, wag its tail and still won't understand anything because it doesn't understand human speech in an abstract way. The expression of any emotion in public hinders me from pursuing my goal and creating an image that I have been creating since about 4th grade of elementary school. People perceive me as an emotionless young specialist in creating film special effects.

 I don't know how to repair the relationship with my mother in this matter. Finally, I'm not from the U.S. but from Central Europe.
