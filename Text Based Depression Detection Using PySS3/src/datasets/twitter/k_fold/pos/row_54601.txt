Itâ€™s officially been a year since the last time I hurt myself. Iâ€™m glad to say today is a very big day for me... the last time I self harmed was 1 year ago. I was going through a lot emotionally but I worked on getting better. Now I get to celebrate today feeling better. :) just thought I would share with you guys !!! Talk to me if you guys need support to get through stuff :)
