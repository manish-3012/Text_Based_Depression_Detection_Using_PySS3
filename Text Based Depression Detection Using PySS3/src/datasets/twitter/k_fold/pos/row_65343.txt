School stress Hey guys, Iâ€™m sure I can relate to at least some of you when I say that life is pretty stressful right now, at my school, I go in 2 days a week, Monday and Thursday, which is probably better than a lot of you because Iâ€™m at a small school, but the other 3 days Iâ€™m not there are very difficult for me, Iâ€™m taking AP US history, advanced English, college level French and physics (1 grade ahead) and itâ€™s extremely difficult. History is by far the hardest, i will spend probably 4-5 hours on it daily, only to receive 85s, and it makes me incredibly frustrated. Iâ€™ve tried reaching out to my teacher, he hasnâ€™t even responded yet, he leaves notes on assignments, but theyâ€™re incredibly vague â€œelaborateâ€ â€œconnectâ€ people say heâ€™s a good teacher but Iâ€™m not sure, I canâ€™t drop the class anymore because itâ€™s too late into the year, even though Iâ€™ve only had 3 IRL days where I could really judge how the class goes. On top of this, I really struggle to learn through a zoom call, I need to be in the room with the teacher (especially for French and english) to fully absorb the material and I just canâ€™t get that, and Iâ€™m in 11th grade and the word â€œcollegeâ€ is just floating on top of me and I feel completely surrounded
