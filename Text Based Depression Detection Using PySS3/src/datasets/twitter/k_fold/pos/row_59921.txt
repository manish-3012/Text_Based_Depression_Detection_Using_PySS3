Just thought Iâ€™d go ahead and ask what yâ€™all think 15 years of age and I see something worth asking

I suffer from multiple mental afflictions, including GAD and MDD

It seems to me that people our age have a lot more in terms of these illnesses than those that preceded us

Do you reckon thereâ€™s some sort of cause behind this, or are we just more open and educated about it now than other generations afore time?
