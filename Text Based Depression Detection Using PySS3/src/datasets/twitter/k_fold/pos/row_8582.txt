I wish I knew when to stop. I spent the last month is physical therapy, just to have to do it for another week or two. I finished my first one yesterday, and then I tore fibers in my shoulder. I canâ€™t do anything for a week with my arm. I was supposed to be really high in ranks in tennis but know my friend is (which Iâ€™m happy itâ€™s him) because he beat me. I was up 2-0 and then I went to serve and I hear a ripping noise. The idiot I am, I continued to play the match. I ended up losing 4-2. I kept doing my power shots which only made it worse. I kept serving which kept tearing stuff. I just wish I knew when to stop. My parents taught me to play through the pain, so that what I did. Then when I told my mother, she yelled at me for continuing to play. She makes fun of me because Iâ€™m always hurting. The reason Iâ€™m always hurting is because she never calls for appointments like she says she will. She just gives me some Advil and calls it good. Then she hits me in the ribs (thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m most messed up) and she knows that where I canâ€™t stand it. Then she tugged on my shoulder last night before I went the chiropractor.
