Communicating is underrated and not appreciated enough Like imagine we couldn't talk or communicate in any way, we would be such a shit species. 

Nothing here now that we have made would be here if we couldn't talk. 

Thank our ancestors for learning how to survive and do this, or we probably wouldn't be here. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
