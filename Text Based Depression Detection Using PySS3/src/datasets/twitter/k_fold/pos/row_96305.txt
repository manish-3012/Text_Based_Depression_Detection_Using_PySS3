I CAN"T BELIEVE I GOT HEAD!!! NEED TO SHARE So last Friday my parents forced me to go to a party that their friends were hosting. And every year I tread going to it. So we arrive there and one of the daughters brought the most beautiful friend to the party. I literally could not believe it. Perfect curly hair, pretty face and seemed to be having a good time. 

So there were 5 other kids around my age at the party, 1 other guys and 3 girls. And we were just chilling in the basement talking about the the first day of school and other shit. So I thought I'd spice up the conversation a bit and suggested we all play truth or dare.

And one thing leads to another and it turn to spin the bottle after the girl dares everyone. It was the perfect girls turn and it lands on me. So I give her the look and she looks at me back. Next thing I know she runs up stairs and goes away.

I got really sad but then one of the moms at the party gave me a real deer head because she knew I was into hunting. And too return the favor I ate her out.
