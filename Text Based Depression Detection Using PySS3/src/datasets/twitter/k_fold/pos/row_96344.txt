Iâ€™m so depressed and suicidal because Iâ€™m so tired of girls never showing interest in me. No girls ever wanted to date me and no one ever liked me back. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore. Iâ€™m ugly, boring, and have social anxiety. My life isnâ€™t really interesting. Girls always show interest in my friends but never me. Should I honestly just kill myself at this point? I know you guys donâ€™t care about me and I literally have no one to talk to about my problems. Iâ€™m so tired of living.
