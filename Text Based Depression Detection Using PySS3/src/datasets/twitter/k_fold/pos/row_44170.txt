I think I love my best friend. We lay in bed and cuddle, I sit at his work while he's doing his job and we chat and he introduces me to people. We phone every night we can.

We cuddle and watch dumb shit together, we can be completely open with each other, we both sing along to songs and we are having a movie night tomorrow (moana and lion king).

But when we cuddle he's so careful. When he speaks about me its always nice words. When he's there I feel safe and he's swore to always protect me

He gave me a back massage (I get quite severe pains) and he asked before touching my lower back, and if he was okay to lift the top a bit. No ones ever been so understanding

He sings so well, his impressions are the best, he's done so much to make me feel safe.

Theres so much more I could write im just so overwhelmed, I just got off a call with him.
