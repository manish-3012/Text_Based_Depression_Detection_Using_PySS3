Are horny teenage boys wrong for noticing a womanâ€™s breast and ass very often? Iâ€™m saying this because there are certain people who think that just because we tend to, as hormone filled men, notice womenâ€™s breast and ass first we donâ€™t think of them as equal and we just see them as sex objects. In a biological level, no women are not equal to men, itâ€™s just facts, but outside of that, absolutely, everyone is equal.
