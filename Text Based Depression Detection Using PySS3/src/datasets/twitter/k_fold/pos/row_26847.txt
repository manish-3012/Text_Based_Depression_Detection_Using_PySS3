having lost their lives on this land, they have become our sons as well... (Probably you know this but) "Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives... you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours... You the mothers who sent their sons from far away countries wipe away your tears. Your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well." 

This is a letter which is written by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk -The Greatest Revolutionarist In The World- for anzac mothers who lost their sons in the "Battle Of Gallipoli"
