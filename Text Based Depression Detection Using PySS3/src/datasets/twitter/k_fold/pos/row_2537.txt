How do I know I like a female? There is a girl that I have known for about 2-3 years, were in the same class in highschool and we went to the same university and same department as well (physics dep). I suspected that she may be into me back in the day but I was never sure, she even invited me to go to a holiday with her a few common friends but covid-19 came. I did not want to go and she got quite upset, she would always ask me why I would not go and all of that. In october when we entered college, we met and she told that we should go hang out to grab a coffee or some shit like that. we end up spending an entire afternoon, walking in the city, talking, we grab a coffee and I payed and walked her home and right in the end she told that we shoul repeat this another time, it was pretty cool. She is 7/10 qt but I never really had a gf, how do I know I like her and what to do, Im new to this stuff, I am really confused and this is embarassing because Im 18 lol.
