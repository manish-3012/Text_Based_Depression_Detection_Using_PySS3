I hope everyone is having a safe and gentle new years This has some serious undertones so tw for that!

I always never really liked the new years, maybe cause I was just a hella depressed teen who just always felt sorta disconnected from all that celebration. A few years ago when I was 14 I got the cops called on me on new years, 2 years ago my exgirlfriend and I had a huge fight on new years and ended up breaking up a few days after that. This year I'm actually working on new years eve (whilst during a pandemic)

However this post is not all doom and gloom. I wanted to say despite how shitty this day might feel for some, its an amazing accomplishment to have survived another year. To have completed things you've done. So many of you reached important milestones, accomplished shit that others could not have deemed possible during our entire situation. You deserve to feel proud of yourself. Throughout this year, and every year, you have gone through so much. Highs, lows, and felt things you've never felt, learned new things. You've grown so much. 

So if this day has got you a bit down or in your blues, its okay, I understand. But please know you are loved, worthy of this life, and deserving of so much. Be kind and gentle to yourself, it's gonna be okay.
