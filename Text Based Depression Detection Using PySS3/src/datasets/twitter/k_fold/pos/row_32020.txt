Why went teacher's birthdays always like this? So our teacher was celebrating her birthday. So we had to come dressed up to school and of course almost every girl dressed up as some basic Disney Princess and the boys dressed up as some super hero and there was always that kid that had some cultural appropriating 'costume' and then there was me dressed up as Pikachu, but this birthday was differntly. Me and a couple of friends planned to dress up as bats for this year and it was almost a success until our friend Hilaal came to school dressed up as Zorro, so our leader Coen who dressed up as a vampire (he knew we were bats so he dressed up as a vampire to boss us around) planned during recess that we all should go after Hilaal to hunt him down for ruining our idea. The end of the day was kinda crazy after we finally took down Hilaal, so Coen was chasing Zoe a girl dressed up as a butterfly to kiss her after he caught her... I also went after a girl named Eva but my intention was to eat her, because bats eat insects and she was a butterfly either and Hilaal? He kept it silent until the day was over.
