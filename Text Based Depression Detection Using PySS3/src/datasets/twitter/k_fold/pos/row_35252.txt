life feels like one big chore and iâ€™ve about had enough of it i canâ€™t even take one day for myself to have fun without me falling behind in all my responsibilities and spiraling into fits of anxiety. every day being alive feels less and less like a privilege and more like a cruel punishment to which there is no end until you get lucky and die. i hate being in the paradox of longing for death yet being absolutely afraid of it, and i hate knowing how awful it is grieving over a suicide. iâ€™m supposed to be the poster child of perfection and intelligence and iâ€™m so sick of it. i work myself to death over shit my peers do with no problem and when iâ€™m not working myself to death, iâ€™m worrying about the next time i have to work myself to death. i thought i had gotten over this point of view but then school started again and it came right back.
