Why am I feeling an excess amount of â€œgive up life and cryâ€? Last weekend I was yelled at for getting an A in LA, that my only job is to get good grades yada yada happens all the time, I get sad, then itâ€™s better. But today is different, Iâ€™m feeling hopeless, scared, and sad, why is that? Is it a normal part of being a teenager?
