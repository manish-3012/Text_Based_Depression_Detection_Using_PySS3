I finally did it. I know no one probably cares but I have no friends so Iâ€™ll just leave this here. 

I finally told my mom I was having suicidal thoughts and have been hurting myself. It was one of the hardest conversations I had to go through but I did it, I can wear t-shirts now, yay! Were gonna be visiting a psychologist tomorrow so wish me luck 4 people who are reading this. 

If youâ€™re struggling with suicidal thoughts or anything of the matter, pls tell someone.
