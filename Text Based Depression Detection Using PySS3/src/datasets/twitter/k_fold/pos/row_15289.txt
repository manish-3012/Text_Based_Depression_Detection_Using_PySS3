Do you guys..just pretend to get along with your friends? Idk but I do that.They talk about things I can't relate with and I just dk what to do like do i smile throughout the whole conversation and who do i look??where??the ground?their faces?

Then I find myself staring at them a little way too intense they kinda get freaked out a little and I stop doing it.When they laugh,I force myself to laugh.I also cant seem to talk about certain topics I want to talk about like how I really feel...to them bcs our relationship is all about being carefree and joking around.So I cant talk about serious things with them.Our senses of humour dont match too :\ kinda miss my old friends cuz I got along way better with them than my current friends.

Maybe I'm just tired.They arent bad people but sometimes I feel like they're not really my real friends.
