I just want to someday have a wife and children and be a happy family I just want a girl to take me in her arms and cuddle me. I want to lay in bed with her and cuddle and kiss her all night. I donâ€™t even care about sex anymore I just want intimacy and romance. We will be married and I will call her wifey, and she will call me hubby. We will have children and we will raise them to be the best they can be. They will have good grades through school, and eventually grow up and move out, much to our sadness but also happiness for them. Sorry guys Iâ€™m just fantasizing about something that Iâ€™ll probably never have
