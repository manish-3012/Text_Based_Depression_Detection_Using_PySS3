To the girls on this sub regarding the feet pictures I requested in your DMs. PLEASE READ. I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the girls on this subreddit. The accusations regarding my so called "behavior" are untrue and extremely hurtful. To the accuser/s (you know who you are kitten), a few points for your consideration: ðŸ¤”

1.) Yes I was asking for feet pics in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.

2.) The feet pics I was attempting to accumulate from this group were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Every head of a non-sexual foot fetishist? Well sorry to break it to you but we really do exist.

3.) I have almost NEVER taken screenshots of the feet that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people.

4.) No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages &amp; friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a "threat". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here awaiting an apology.

5.) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this post, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called "opinion" no matter how misguided it may be. As you can tell my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (feet pics or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the sub.
