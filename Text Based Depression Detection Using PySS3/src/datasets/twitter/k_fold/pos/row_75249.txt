ok so i gotta ask if this makes me a bad person im really scaared that it does so i have my crush and i really love him but i despise the way he dresses. and not because I'm being judgmental, i wish i wouldn't care, but it really just makes me cringe so hard and im being grossed out and sometimes it even gives me second hand embarrassment or im even embarresed to be seen next to him. 

he just dresses so badly, and it's not because he's poor or something, he isn't, he's just mot aware? i really dont know it just looks so bad every single shirt i want to burn them all

it makes me feel like such a shallow and judgmental person, but is it really the case?, i know that im always super harsh on myself so i decided to ask here and see what others have to say, please be honest, thanks.
