Ah Shit here we go again I think I may have screwed myself. This girl has been talking to me for a few days and apparently has liked me for months. Now my friend tells me I should ask her out but I've only know her for a few days. So after deciding im not gonna ask her out cuz this anit one of those love stories where you hook up after liking  each other for years, fuck I hardly know her. Now the reason I say "ah shit here we go again" is because I've made the mistake of dating someone I don't know for shit. Doesn't go well. Hardly even what a normal person would call a relationship.

So I've decided I'm not gonna ask her outyet, crisis averted right? Not so, she asks ME out. Fuck. My friend is now hell bent on making sure I date this girl so I freak the fuck out and say yes. So the logical thing to do is end it, but I can't bring myself to do it because she's liked me for awhile and she thinks this is the best thing to ever happen to her. 

Ah Shit here we go again.
