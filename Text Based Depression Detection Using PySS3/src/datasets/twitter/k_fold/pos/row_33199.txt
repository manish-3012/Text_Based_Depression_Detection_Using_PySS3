My friend caught me watching porn?  This is a throwaway account, but here is what happened. I was on incognito, watching you know what, when I instantly got an instagram message from my friend mentioning it. Is there any way he was watching my device from his? Also, what should I do now? (he did not see me irl btw, it must have been digitally?)
