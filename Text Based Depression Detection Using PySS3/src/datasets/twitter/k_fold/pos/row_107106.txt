I came out to my sister :D The place I live is a not so friendly place for people like me(I'm gay lol), but I find comfort that I have a family member that really does love me for who I am. I personally struggle with a lot of internalized homophobia because of the way I was raised(Christian and homophobic), but knowing that someone I love accepts me helps me try to accept myself. There is a long way to go to self love, but I'm trying to make that journey. Y'all just seeing the start of it :)
