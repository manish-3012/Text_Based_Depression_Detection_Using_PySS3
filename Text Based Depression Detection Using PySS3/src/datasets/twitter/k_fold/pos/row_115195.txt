Jeez how biased are these drug prevention programs We're doing one called Project Alert and they're showing videos about marijuana and alchohol, and they're pretending that most people who start drinking or take even one hit from marijuana are going to become addicted. "Marijuana is a gateway drug" they say. Marijuana has an 8% addiction rate, less than smoking and alchohol, and they're saying that you get addicted even if you do it like once at a party, same with alchohol. It's just so biased
