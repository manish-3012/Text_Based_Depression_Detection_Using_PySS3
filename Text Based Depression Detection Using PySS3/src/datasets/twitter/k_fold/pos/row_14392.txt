I am new to anime.. So i just finished Jjba completely and almost cried at the end .. I need more awesome anime like these which have good battle style or plot twists like death note.. Any good anime recommendations plz.. I don't like childish anime like pokemon or Dbz so any kind of mature anime like Death note and jjba.. And is dxd good or not.
