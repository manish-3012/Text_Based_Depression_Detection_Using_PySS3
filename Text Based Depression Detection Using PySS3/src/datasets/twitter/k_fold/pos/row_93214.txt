I failed my attempt at gaining weight as usual. I feel disgusted by myself. I'm 6'2 and I have always been that tall and skinny skeleton looking dude my whole life. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that I look like a skeleton.

I really tried to finally get myself to a healthy weight during this quarantine. I've been forcing down at least three meals a day and snacking in-between during this whole quarantine as well as working out so I can get some muscle. Just a week ago I was finally starting to feel happy with myself. I reached 165lbs and also had quite a decent amount of muscle, nothing to brag about but it was nice to finally be able to look at myself in the mirror shirtless and not feel horrible.

But I slipped up as usual...

Stopped following my eating schedule.. three meals turned into two meals, then one meal and now.... i'm as skinny as I was when I started. All in the span of a week I managed to destroy 3 months worth of progress....

Why can't my body just be normal. Why can't I just have a huge appetite every day and be able to eat full meals without needing to force myself, almost to the point of puking, just to eat my required calories for the day...

I'm still working out but the muscles I built do not even look that good since theres no fat on my arms anymore.

Every single time I have tried it always results in failure.

I hate myself... I'm done.
