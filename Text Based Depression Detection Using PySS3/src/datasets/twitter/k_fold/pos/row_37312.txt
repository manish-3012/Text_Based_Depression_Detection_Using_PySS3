Iâ€™m curious as to what your opinions on fanfiction and those who read it are? I personally read a lot of fanfiction, and I wanted to know the general publicâ€™s opinion on it. 

Also, if you read fanfic, why? 

I personally have 2 main reasons. 

-I am content starved for my favorite series and fanfiction helps scratch the itch.

-I have very few close relationships in real life and instead of putting the effort in to gain more I replace the hole in my chest with fictional characters falling in love.
