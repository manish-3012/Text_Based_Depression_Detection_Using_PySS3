Currently, I am too tired to sleep. I'm always tired. But can never sleep. It's like, one day, I'm physically tired. But my brain just decided it isn't and gives me a rewind about my failures; and when I'm mentally tired, my body just decided it's not.

Like, can you please just let be tired and let me live my life?

"I'm tired"
"Oh really? Cool, I'll go to bed the-"
*Reached bed* "I'm awake now."
"What."
"Yeah, I'm awake now."

This literally sucks, my hair has been falling out, I have been more grumpy and my skin has been really bad lately... I just want to curl up and be a duck or something.
