I think Iâ€™m getting over my acrophobia! I used to have a pretty bad fear of heights, to the point where I would have increased heart rate and felt lightweight and didnâ€™t trust my own body even while just looking at an image of heights. I still have a fear of heights, but Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™m not having as strong of a reaction as I used to have. Kinda happy lol
