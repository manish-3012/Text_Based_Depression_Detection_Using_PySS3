Lowkey it bums me out how some adults be like Honestly In my day to day life, I tend to act very over the top. I am a very optimistic person and I like to try to be as positive as possible, and that bleeds into like how I talk and everything I do. 

I've met so many adults who say "oh when you're older you won't be like that anymore" or "I remember when I was young and naive and happy" 

like thats such a fucking bummer, like it sucks to hear that. Cause I never like to talk to people heart to heart and shit, but I lost my childhood to depression and my teen years and I straight up refuse to let it take anymore of my life away from me. 

and this is just how I feel about it, but the world needs more happiness and light, and sometimes we need to look through rose colored glasses so we don't constantly feel like shit. Like it feels like these adults and my coworkers, or just these people who say this stuff to me are under the assumption that I'm a neurotypical when I'm not. I get how some people make jokes out of their trauma or mental health as a coping mechanism, I used to do the same thing. But it feels like sometimes they say this shit not in a joking manner but like they're mad at me for acting bubbly. 

I get it can be a lot, and I'm aware for some its annoying. But I never try to make them feel shitty for the way they look at the world. so really just let me be? if you think im to happy, idk what's wrong with that. why yall gotta bring me down for
