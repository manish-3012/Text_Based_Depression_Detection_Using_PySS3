My poem collection before i gave up Little Thing About Me

Roses are red
Im always super random
Im a talentless piece of shit
But at least im more handsome



Dear School

I fucking hate school
Its literally a child prison
Parents think school is cool
But in order to go to the BATHROOM, you have to ASK FOR PERMISSION???!



Are You Sure You Wanna Fight? (emo)

You've never been faced with a man bigger than yourself before

But today ill fight you so much ill make your bones sore

Ill save everyone as you wont be able to fight anyone anymore

Its your last chance to run away before i destroy your goddamn core




2 Random Things

Twinkle twinkle little star
I wanna kill your beloved once with a guitar
Have you heard of this movie called "Avatar"?
Im watching it tonight, its gonna be bizarre!



Im Not Good Enough

I was told I'd never be good enough
I tried to prove them wrong
At first it was really tough
Then I realized I couldnt, so i accepted it and came out strong
