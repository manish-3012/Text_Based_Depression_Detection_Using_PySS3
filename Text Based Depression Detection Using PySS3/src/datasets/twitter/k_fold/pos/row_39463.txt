"Oh you're tired? Well that's not allowed" Long story short I've been doing schoolwork all day, its 10pm and I pass out doing my Chemistry worksheet. Next thing I know my dad is quietly yelling at me that if I dont get it done I cant go to work tomorrow. They do the same shit over 1 point formative items. I already have an A. in the class.
