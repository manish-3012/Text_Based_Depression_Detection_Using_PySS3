Why do I feel like I don't fit in? Why do I feel like I don't fit in?

Ugh. I feel so down right now.
I'm at a boarding school and I do actually have friends.. or sorta. But I always feel line they're gonna leave me anyway sometime in the future. I have no one I can really talk to. Everyone I have, I feel like is gonna leave me anyway. There's this one girl, who's very nice and to whom I can talk about my problems. But I feel like I'm just putting weight on her shoulders she doesn't need. I just feel like I'm bothering everyone.

When I was younger, like in primary school, 2 of my closest friends just left me telling me that they actually hated me and just acted like my friends. After that a lot of other people left me too and I couldn't form any real friendships with anyone which would go deeper than a "hello, how are you? Do you wanna play some video games?" I feel like everyone I like doesn't like me. And all my friends are just some people to whom I'm just a annoying kid trying to be friends with. I feel so awful.

Why do I feel like a burden to anyone.

I feel like anyone is gonna leave me anyway. It's always been that way and it always will be. I just feel like a unnecessary weight on everyone's shoulders everyone is gonna take off anyway. And I'm gonna be alone at the end. I've always been alone at the end.

Maybe if I wouldn't be there.. this world would be less miserable.
