I deleted my previous reddit account.  

I have been on reddit since 26th August 2019 and it would have been my first year tomorrow but i deleted my account.

I  don't know why i did it, many people on discord said that its not that  great and etc, i was so overpowered by what they said that i deleted my  account. All my my memes, my coins (which reddit gifted  me because i had no real life and was online most of the time), all my  friends all gone. Anyways. I made a new account and feels great to post here again.
