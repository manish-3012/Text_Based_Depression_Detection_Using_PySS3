Coming from a straight guy, stop with the Super Straight ya dinguses Basically Super Straight started as a joke (a poor one) and eventually grew into something people where people  calling themselves saying they are part of the LGBT+ community, either seriously, or to rhile up LGBT people. 

Just stop

Straight people are literally the least oppressed sexual group, and trying to say your part of LGBT or trying to make the community angry for laughs is, as I say, cringe. They struggle to secure their own right, and have been victims of numerous hate crimes. 


Tldr, stop using super straight seriously or as a joke.
