This weekendâ€™s gonna be a long one My parents got in a fight over the most insignificant bullshit this morning and now they arenâ€™t speaking to each other. My dad was trying to get a glass of water and my mom told him to just wait a minute because she was standing there, but he didnâ€™t wait and tried jokingly asserting his dominance but my mom gave him a slight shove because he was literally invading her space. But then the water spilled a bit and my dad got mad and just spilled the whole thing.

And they just started yelling at each other over that. Iâ€™ve been upstairs in my room all day  because I didnâ€™t want to deal with their nonsense, itâ€™s been like 9 hours now. Iâ€™ve eaten breakfast and lunch and dinner up here lmao, Iâ€™m glad I have a computer and a phone and books and things to do up here because if not I wouldâ€™ve died of exhaustion and heat stroke (itâ€™s hot AF where I live today).

So yeah itâ€™s nice being up in my room but Iâ€™d also love to just go down occasionally throughout it the day and see that my parents are enjoying themselves. But now my house is just gonna be silent for the next couple days as it has today. 

What sucks is that I have no school Monday and Tuesday because if I did then I wouldnâ€™t even have time to worry about whatever theyâ€™re doing but now Iâ€™m forced to be trapped in a silent ass house with a lot of negative energy between my parents. Theyâ€™ll sort it out Iâ€™m sure but man they just had to ruin the one four day weekend I get this year. Ima be confined to whatever I have in my room these next few days...
