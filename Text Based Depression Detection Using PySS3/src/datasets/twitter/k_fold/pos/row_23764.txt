I'm facing a dilemma Between dreams and school ... Well, I always did very well on my grades at school, I never felt a problem with the content, I never questioned what all that information was for, but now I discovered my vocation, I always knew how to draw  Very well, but I never thought it would be possible to work with it, today, I have some dreams of drawing superhero comics, a difficult market ... But the knowledge of the school is not necessary today, I'm closer to achieving my dream, but, I'm having bad grades, and my father, who is a teacher, was not happy with it, so I don't know if I take school seriously to go to college, or I follow my dream and focus 100% on drawing, anyway, the atmosphere here at home is heavy, because my parents think I'm going to be unemployed, and I'm just as afraid, I don't know what I do, in the end, just I wanted to vent, thank you, if you've read this far ...
