The Minecraft Villagers may have been to the Nether or may know people who have been there Someone else has probably said something similar to this, but I just realized it. So, Brewing stands can only be crafted with Blaze Rods and there isnâ€™t any possible way to find Blaze rods without going to the Nether. How does this relate to villagers? Well it just so happens that Cleric Villagers utilize Brewing Stands. Not only that, but Blacksmith villagers sometimes have Obsidian in their chests, alluding to the usage of a Nether portal since Obsidian can only be used to craft Enchanting Tables, Beacons, and Ender Chests, none of which appear in natural villages. Thanks you for your time
