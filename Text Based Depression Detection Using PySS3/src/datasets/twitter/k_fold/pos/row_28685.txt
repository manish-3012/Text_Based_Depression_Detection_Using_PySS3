One more bit of advice from a girl about girls These seem really popular rn (and a great idea) so I've got one more thing that I didn't see mentioned 
 
If a girl is sad or frustrated or feeling overwhelmed, you really don't need to try and solve the problem. Just being reassuring and giving her a good hug is one of the best things you can do in that situation. Also, if she says she's on her period, hugs are great too (that might just be me tho, check with your specific girl bc it can vary) you don't need to understand everything, we just like support :)
