Since the mods won't do it this team will. The mods have not been doing their job clearly.

So u/WeNeedHunters will.

On behalf of them I will be sharing their message.

Hello teenagers.

We are Team Striker. 

Obviously this is a spot for teenagers to gather round and talk about their life experiences and blah blah blah.

But this is a popular Hotspot for pedophiles. Yeah the hobos who sit on their computer all day and message people under the age of 18.
So the mods seem to not really care about actually finding these people but we do.

Over the weekend we will be releasing a bunch of accounts hunting down pedos. This will continue until we have barely any on the map. So I'd like to tell all of you.

I dont care how long it takes but we will scratch all of them off this subreddit. If you are above the age of 16 and would like to join Team Striker you may.

Have a nice night everyone.
