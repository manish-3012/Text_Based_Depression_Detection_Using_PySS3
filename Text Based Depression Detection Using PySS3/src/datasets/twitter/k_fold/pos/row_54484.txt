The drinking age should be 16 If you start drinking earlier with parental supervision you learn your limits earlier and are probably less likely to binge drink right when you turn 21 cuz 21 year olds are stupid and independent and 16 year olds are stupid and under there parents control so there parent (hopefully) will stop them from drinking 10 beers the first day, then by the time they turn 21 they will have learned there limits and hopefully be less stupid 

Letâ€™s be honest who actually waits until there 18, most probably have there first drink at 15-17, most people donâ€™t wait until 21, who does that, itâ€™s not enforced at a small scale 

Fuck MADD why did they do that, it didnâ€™t decrease drunk driving at all, even if it did itâ€™s not worth it 

Also British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, PEI, Saskatchewan, and Yukon, why is your legal drinking age 19, thatâ€™s fucking arbitrary, good job Quebec, your legal drinking age isnâ€™t arbitrary, itâ€™s still too high 

The closest place I could legally consume alcohol is France, itâ€™s on the same continent but you canâ€™t drive to South America from North America, honestly it would probably be cheaper to go to Continental France then French Guiana
