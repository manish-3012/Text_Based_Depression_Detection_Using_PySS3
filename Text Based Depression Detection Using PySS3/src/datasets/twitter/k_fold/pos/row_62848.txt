Damn, I'm happy I'm so fucking happy! My father hugged me and told me that he loved me! Aaaah! It was very surprising considering the fact that he told me he hated me and was sick of me a year ago. My father isn't very affectionate. I think he changed after his kidney surgery when he saw how much we loved and cared for him. He's been chirpy and shows interest in the house and his family. Earlier, he was rarely home (he's a social activist) but now that he has to be at home, I think he's starting to love it here.  
Anyway, I just wanted to say, I'm so fucking happy!!!!!!
