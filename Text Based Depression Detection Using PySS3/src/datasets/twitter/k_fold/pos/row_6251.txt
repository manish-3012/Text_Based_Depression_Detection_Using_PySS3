Read reviews of middle and high schools if you're bored I saw this in a comment under a Gus Johnson video. If you get bored it's really entertaining to read reviews of middle and high schools. There's a lot of reviews from angry students complaining about how terrible the school is. I looked at the reviews for the high school I go to and there were a lot of reviews complaining about the stairs. I found one review that said, "If this school were a pokemon, I would smash the ball" and another one from this guy talking about how much he loved the beekeeping class he took there.
