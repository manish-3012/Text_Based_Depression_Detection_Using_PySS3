So does anyone else feel like they have to choose between being happy mentally and socially and doing good in school? So I'm 99.9% sure I have ADHD and Depression and I told my mom recently and still haven't been to therapy or got diagnosed, so I'm in a slump of trying to do good in school and only focusing on that or just relaxing, talking to friends, playing games and being social, it's what's keeping me happy and, honestly keeping me from being more suicidal than I am, but I choose to be happy instead because I don't think I can mentally handle working like hell in school but ending up more depressed than I already was, so I guess I just wanted to ask if anyone else has this problem and if there's any good advice for it.

TLDR: Does anyone else feel like they need to choose between doing well in school and being happy and emotionally healthy?
