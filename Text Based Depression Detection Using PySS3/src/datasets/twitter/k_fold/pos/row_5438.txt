You know what I hate? The guilt tripping that is the "About time to support your favorite artists" message on Bandcamp Like, I don't hate Bandcamp. I'm not against supporting your favorite artists, in fact I encourage it. 

But can you not randomly have a message pop up **with a fucking heart-breaking animation when you press no?** I'll buy the album when I want, Bandcamp.

Most of the time, I just stream the album (And by most of the time I mean I've never bought an album/song off Bandcamp). There are benefits to buying other than supporting artists, like having a backup of the album if it gets deleted or the page does the Beer On The Rugâ„¢, but I've never had interest in, well, asking my mom to buy an album/song.

It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to listen to albums on Bandcamp cuz of this.

Call me a cheap whore, whatever. Just saying.
