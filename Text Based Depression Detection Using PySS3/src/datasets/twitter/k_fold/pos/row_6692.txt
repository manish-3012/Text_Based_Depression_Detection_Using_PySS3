I need to stop procrastinating Ok, so I have a project that is due by next week and I know I wonâ€™t be able to finish it solely during school hours. So I need to work on it at home but whenever I think about it Iâ€™m just like â€œI donâ€™t feel like doing it right now. Iâ€™ll just do it tomorrow.â€. So I need advice on how to make myself work.
