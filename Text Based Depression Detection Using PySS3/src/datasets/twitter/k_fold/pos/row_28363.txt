Girls, how big of a deal is it for a guy to have acne? So basically, I have acne on my cheeks and I'm going to meet a (pretty)girl tomorrow who I haven't met before. My acne isn't severe but noticeable. I don't look bad (without acne), considering some girls have had crushes on me. I have pretty nice friends, so I'd say my personality isn't bad either.
