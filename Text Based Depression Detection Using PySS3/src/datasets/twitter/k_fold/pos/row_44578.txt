So tired of others being perceived as 'less', just because of their gender It really makes me mad. Its 2021. Yesterday, I was playing basketball with a few guys in my grade. Blocked one of them, and the other boys started yelling 'YOU JUST GOT BLOCKED BY A *GIRL'.* Really? Does it matter if I'm a girl or not? I can be just as capable of blocking someone as any other gender. I'm really tired of this, and just felt like ranting. Thank you, and have a nice day.
