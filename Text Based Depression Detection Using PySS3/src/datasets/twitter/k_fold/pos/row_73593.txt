hear me out Real talk, why do parents always assume that when iâ€™m smiling while looking at my phone it must be the cause of a bf or gf? Parents really make teenagers subconsciously shut themselves in their room because whenever you express any sort of positive emotions they feel obliged to comment on it. And then they get mad at you for staying in your room all day.
