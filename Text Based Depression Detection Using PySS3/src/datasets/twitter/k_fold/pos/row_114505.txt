Give Me Your Top 10 Favorite Albums So I Can Roast Them Like Beef. So a few days ago, Burnthony Roastano made a video called [Roasting Your Top Albums](https://youtu.be/jBOHnWQdFkE) where he basically looks at peopleâ€™s top albums and roasts their taste in music. Since then I wanted to roast some peopleâ€™s opinions to the ground. So tell me, what are your Favorite Albums?



Here are some of mine if youâ€™re curious:

Septicflesh - Sumerian Daemons 

Incantation - Onward To Golgotha

Kamelot - The Black Halo

Dream Theater - Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory

Emperor - In The Nightside Eclipse

Agalloch - The Mantle

Napalm Death - From Enslavement To Obliteration

Ne Obliviscaris - Citadel

Dragged Into Sunlight - Hatred For Mankind

Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly 



Keep in mind that Iâ€™ll spice some of my roasts up with some snobbery, keep in mind that Iâ€™m not an asshole rather some guy who loves music and enjoys it as much as the next man.
