For everyone in relationship post that tell me â€œyouâ€™ll find someone some dayâ€ Believe it or not, certain people are just meant to be alone. No matter how many people they talk to, or how hard they try. 
And it doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™ve never even had any friends in my entire life and have been bullied since elementary. 
Also that Iâ€™m not even that attractive or have good social skills. 
Donâ€™t even have any special talents or anything good going for me body wise like a 9 incher or any funny jokes other than my existence.
And in the case of â€œnobody is meant to be alone,â€ Iâ€™m nobody. 

What Iâ€™m saying is, not everyone is meant to meet someone and be happy. Itâ€™s sad but true.
