Ahhh omg Iâ€™m literally so happy rn So I had like this thing kinda with this guy before the second lockdown. We would hangout a couple times a week with some of our other friends and cuddle on the couch when we watched movies. But after the lock down we stopped talking bc we couldnâ€™t hangout and that was like the only times we would talk. But like an hour ago he texted me and we started talking and just having a conversation then he asked if I would maybe want to go skating or something with him next week after the lockdown for our area is over. Anyway yeah hehe
