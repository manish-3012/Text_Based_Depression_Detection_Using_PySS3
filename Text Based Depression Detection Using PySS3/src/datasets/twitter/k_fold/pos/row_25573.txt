I just cut my hair by my self Itâ€™s alright. It used to be emo/ scene now itâ€™s pixie. I donâ€™t trust barbers since when I was younger theyâ€™d always cut it too short and revert one knows you canâ€™t say you donâ€™t like it. Iâ€™m a 13 year old boy so you can imagine being â€œyoungerâ€ and having terrible hair lol. Just wanted to share this lol
