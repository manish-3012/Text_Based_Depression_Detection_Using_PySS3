Was anyone else afraid of fat people as children? I remember when I was a child, I was a bit scared of fat people. Especially fat women. It was so rare to be fat where I grew up, that whenever Iâ€™d see a tourist, their lumbering ness kind of freaked me out. Like not that theyâ€™d kill me, more of an oddity that you tried not to stare at. 

Anyone else relate?
