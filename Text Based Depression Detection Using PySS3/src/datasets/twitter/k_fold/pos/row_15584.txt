Why do we need a government? If we just adopt a good NAP and then have anyone who violates it be hunted down in brutal vigilante justice we wonâ€™t need a government. And if the government got its grubby hands out of the market and stopped artificially raising prices we wouldnâ€™t need anything like socialized medical care.

In other words yes, I have become a staunch ancap.
