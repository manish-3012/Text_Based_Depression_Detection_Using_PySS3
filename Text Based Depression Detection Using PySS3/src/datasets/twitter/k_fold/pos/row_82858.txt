I miss having darker hair Random post but idc. I miss having dark brown/black hair! I love my natural hair color (medium brownish red thing going on) but when I had darker hair it made my eyes look much warmer and it made them stand out more, which I loved. But the regrowth was awful and plus it was super damaging. 

I need to find a good dark brown wig to pop on when I'm missing it fr. I felt like it made me look so pretty.
