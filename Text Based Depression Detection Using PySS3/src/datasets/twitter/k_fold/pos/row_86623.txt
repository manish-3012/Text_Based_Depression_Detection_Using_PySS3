What are the bloody odds? every day or two I go to another district to play football with my friends, and I go by bus. Where I live the government supports who's under 18 so, I don't have to pay for the bus. Yesterday I jumped in a bus, but the guy that collects the tickets told me "don't get used to that, its not free" I replied why? he told me this bus belongs to a private company not the government. I usually ride on those buses and nobody cares. I was going home now, I took another bus and guess what? the same bloody guy comes again and says "didn't I meet you today?" I say nope I dint remember.He says "but I do, and please don't bother me. If my supervisor sees you it wouldn't be good for me". So, after I went home I discovered that he's right and it is actually a private company. But what are the odds of meeting the same guy twice in day and night?
