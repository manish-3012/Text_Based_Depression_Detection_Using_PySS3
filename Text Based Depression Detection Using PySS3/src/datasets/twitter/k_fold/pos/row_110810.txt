An old couple was scared I was going to attack them So I was walking home after hockey practice around 6pm. I was holding my stick in my hand as there was no where else to put it.  After a while there were 2 old people walking ahead of me, they heard me and looked back. They started walking faster. Im a fast walker so I wasnâ€™t that far behind when the guy pulled his wife behind him and shouted at me to stay back. I just crossed the road lamo.
