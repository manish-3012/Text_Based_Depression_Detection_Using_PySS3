Unsent letter for my online friend I've gotten use to the burning feeling that settles in your throat while holding back tears. Our time together has warped in my thoughts. Maybe it's because I'm hopeless. Maybe it's because I can't let go. I mistaken our last conversation happening much later than it actually had. It only hit me when I looked back and thought. You were talking to me out of pity, it's clear now. And it's quite understandable. I just wish you would have given me a goodbye so it would hurt less. I don't know what you considered our relationship, but thanks for sticking around as long as you did. You're a champ, and I'll always consider you a dear friend.
