How do I explain to my parents why â€œAll Lives Matterâ€ is a harmful phrase? My entire family thinks â€œAll Lives Matterâ€ is the right movement to support, and I want to find a respectful but assertive way to inform them about why itâ€™s invalidating to the BLM movement.

How can I help communicate this to my family?
