I have very bad social skills. yeah I'm not very good with people I got a few close friends but that's it. I'm usually fine with it but lately I've been feeling lonely. There's that one girl l'd like to talk to but I don't know how to. I'm not very good with social cues so I figured I should ask here if I should just start a convo through dms? I figured that would be easier for me because she's usually always surrounded with ppl irl. So any suggestions?
