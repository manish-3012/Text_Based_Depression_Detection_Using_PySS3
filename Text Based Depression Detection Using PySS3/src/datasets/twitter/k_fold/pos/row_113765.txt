Going bald at 16 I am going bald at 16 and I feel like my life is over before it's begun. The other day i'm walking through the mall and I could see this group of girls were looking at me and laughing and said nice hair as I passed them. This destroyed what little confidence I have left. I read things like bald people are less likely to get jobs or find love and I think what's the point on going on. I'll probably be the virgin guy at college while everyone else is having a great time.

Is anyone else in this position?
