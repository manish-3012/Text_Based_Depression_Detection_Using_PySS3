Why do people like dying hair? Idk if its just me, and pls dont get me wrong i dont hate you guys youre great, i just find people with dyed hair less attractive, especially non-natural colors, isnt natural the hair the best, and shouldn't you make the best of yourself without changing yourself (not sure if that makes sense)?

Again im just saying my opinion please dont get offended, you may disagree but its just my opinion.
