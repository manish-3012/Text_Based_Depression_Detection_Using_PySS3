I'm leaving reddit for a while I live in America, and I'm addicted to reddit. But as time progresses, more and more subreddits are being filled with politics. "wholesome" subreddits have anti-Trump stuff. People hating on religion. People having ZERO tolerance for people who disagree with them. It's awful. I'm not even allowed to love my country, and I'm tired of people telling me there is no hope or the only way there is hope is if you do what they say. I came to reddit feeling happy, laughing at stuff, and now everything is just stupid politics. I can't make online friends or laugh at funny stuff because people are always telling me I'm wrong and there's no hope. It's really depressing y'all.

Well done reddit.
