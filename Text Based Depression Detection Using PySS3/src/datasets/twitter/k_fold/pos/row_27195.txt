COVID has been hard... anyways the lyrics to guardians inferno Getting down and dirty with a procyon lotor
Got no people skills but he's good with motors
That weird thing by his side's an infantilized sequoia
The two of them walk by, people say "oh boy-a"
They ask me why I'm bringin'
A baby into battle
That's really irresponsible
And getting them rattled
I say "give me a break
Get off of my back damn, it"
I didn't learn parenting
My daddy was a planet
Zardu Hasselfrau, Zardu Hasselfrau, hey
Zardu Hasselfrau, Zardu Hasselfrau, hey
In these times of hardship
Just remember
We
Are
Groot
