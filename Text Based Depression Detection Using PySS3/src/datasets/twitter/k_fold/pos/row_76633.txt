Alright boys its time for a rename for MCC(My Crush Chronicles) its old and outdated. Also a development. First, today like right after school and heading too her place and too some land her family bought and plan on building a house there(itâ€™s literally adjacent too where i live so sheâ€™ll be really close now, shes like 30 miles away so overall a 60 miles of driving. Its our first time seeing each other since labor day. And now for a rename, i have something in mind but mayhaps you cultured folks have something for me. Sheâ€™s gonna be my girl on Halloween so the crush tag has gotta go yo yknow.
