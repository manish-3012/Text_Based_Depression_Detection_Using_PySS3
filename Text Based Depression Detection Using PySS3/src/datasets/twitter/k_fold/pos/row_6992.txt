I feel like Iâ€™m in a toxic relationship with this subreddit I know this probably sounds dumb but, I canâ€™t stop coming onto this sub everyday. Itâ€™s ingrained in my head and it has to stop! I only come here to find people to talk to but my curiosity gets the better of me. Almost all of the bad moods Iâ€™ve gotten in recent memory have been caused by posts on this subreddit. Yet I keep coming back. Itâ€™s like I have an addiction! What do I do?! I need help! How do I keep myself off of this sub other than looking for people to talk to? And please donâ€™t give me the bullshit condescending answer of â€œJust donâ€™tâ€, I need actual advice.
