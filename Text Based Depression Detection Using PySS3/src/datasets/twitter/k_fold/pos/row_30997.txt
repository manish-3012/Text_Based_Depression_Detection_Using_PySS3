Uh, guys I figured out how to kick my school off of WiFi. So basically you just get the IP address of the schools WiFi and copy and paste it into some WiFi booster website. Doing this without permission is illegal tho. And you can be tracked easily through your IP address so in order to not get tracked use a VPN. I also would not recommend doing this because the site could steal their IP address and use it maliciously, or could find where your school is and do bad things.

 Police if youâ€™re reading this, no Iâ€™m not going to turn off the WiFi i just figured out how to do it, I havenâ€™t violated the law in any way, and I am in no way recommending doing this.
