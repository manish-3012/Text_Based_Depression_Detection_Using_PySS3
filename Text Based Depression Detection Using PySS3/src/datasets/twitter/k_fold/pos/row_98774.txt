How are people getting so many awards suddenly So, today I woke up in the morning and the first meme was with 76 awards... Okay no problem it was a great one anyway. But even after scrolling across 50-60 consecutiveposts there were memes which had got 2-3 awards. I have never seen this before. Can anyone explain why or how?
