ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ Random Antarctica Factoid #26 ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¶ The Antarctica Treaty was signed in 1959 and forbid countries from using Antarctica for military purposes and as a dumping ground for radioactive wastes. Later in 1991 it also became illegal to extract minerals or oil from the continent for 50 years. I hope that the ban on disrupting the environment becomes permanent honestly, otherwise I'm not looking forward to 2041 and beyond.
