I accidentally bombed a zoom class So my friend usually is muted in zoom classes so I'll usually talk to her while she's in class and not feel weird about it. Anyways today I was trying on a super fuzzy shirt that was really comfortable, so naturally I went into her room and screamed: 
#FEEL MY TITTIES 
right as she was answering the teachers question. As soon as she turned around with an angry look on her face laughter erupted from her computer and I screamed and ran awayðŸ’€
