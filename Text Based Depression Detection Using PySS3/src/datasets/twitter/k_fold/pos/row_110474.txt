Hereâ€™s why Iâ€™m worried about star wars im worried that since disney ruined the franchise, and i am a newer fan, i wont have the same pleasure watching it as that of a longtime fan

and im also worried that i wont be aboe to host authentic conversation about star wars with other people since they left the franchise

what are your thoughts?
