I forget to type spaces between words This is an unedited post made by me so right now I am thinking about typing spaces and it makes me type spaces which doesn't really show what I mean but in a little while I will stop thinking about it and accidentally type two words without a space inbetween them and rn I can't really get it to work but yeah sometimes it happens because my iq is below room temperature
