astrology and personality stuff okay so firstly I don't believe in all that crap but apart from your star sign, there's also something related to planets and stuff. I don't know how to explain it because I genuinely don't know anything about it but let me tell you what happened

So there's this astrologer who tells you stuff that can happen in the near future and how you should be careful and stuff. After telling him my name, star sign and the date I was born, he started telling EVERYTHING that happened to me. Last month I was really sick, recently not been able to concentrate etc. and all of it was true.

 I'm just really shocked and he also said that there's gonna be issues with guys i.e, I'll get cheated on lmao. so he told me to stay away from guys and not fall for anyone (which I don't think I can control) and I'll update you guys if this ends up being true in a few months lol
