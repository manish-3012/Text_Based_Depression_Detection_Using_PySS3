I miss someone, I wrote a poem about it You are the stump of a fallen tree,

A memory cast aside to die with time,

The last light of a disused lighthouse,

You are the last sound of the Titanic,

A fragmented whisper of horror,

The sound of the last violinist sinking,
****
****
It's been five fucking months,

I'm too scared to say hello,

But I miss the hellish glow,

You set my mind on fire,

Now it's burning out.
