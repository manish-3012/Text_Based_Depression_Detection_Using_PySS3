What is wrong with me Me: â€œHey your hair looks really good!â€

Girl: â€œhaha really? Thatâ€™s nice. Itâ€™s actually my biggest insecurityâ€

So Iâ€™m thinking sheâ€™s crazy right? Her hair is good. So I said....

Me: â€œreally? THATS your biggest insecurity?â€

I donâ€™t want to exist anymore â˜ ï¸
