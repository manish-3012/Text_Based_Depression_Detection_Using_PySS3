Its summerbreak and i have less time to do stuff :( I really wanna make music because I had a goal of finishing one song i actually like before school starts but i dont have time. If i want to im still busy until 10 pm all the time and its pissing me off and making me lose interest.


I dont want to have summer breaks that are this long. It isnt enjoyable at all and defenetly more stressfull than going to school. And im studying an extra year worth of courses in the same time.
