Advice for meeting ball/prom date for first time I've asked a girl from a nearby school to my school's ball/prom, but the problem is I've never met her. 

My school's fairly small so I didn't have many options. I asked her over text and I wanna hangout and get to know her before the ball/prom so it isnt awkward.

What can I do to meetup with her for the first time and it not be awkward? (like activities or in a group setting?)
