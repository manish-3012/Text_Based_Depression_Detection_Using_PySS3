Do any of you girls get like freaking death symptoms before your period? So sometimes I get a migraine that feels like a tumor but nope it subsides when my period comes. Sometimes I lose my appetite for literally a week but nope goes away when I bleed. Sometimes I have literal ACHING pains in my stomach or chest and it completely goes away before my period. And now my lymph nodes swelled up, you guessed it, right before my period (apparently it happens due to a hormonal imbalance). Like WTF?!
