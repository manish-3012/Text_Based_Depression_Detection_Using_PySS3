i guess i just have to accept it. weâ€™re broken up. i mean, we have been for a while now. you ended it two weeks ago as of tomorrow. but weâ€™ve been doing decently on the surface... itâ€™s been bearable since you came back home. and i get that we have to spend more time apart now. but it really hurts. i mean, we live together. and yet weâ€™re worlds apart. iâ€™ve been trying so hard to make sure we stay good friends, but you really are... gone. i know, if you read this youâ€™d be confused, weâ€™ve been speaking every day since i got out of hospital, weâ€™ve laughed together... but i meant it when i said it felt like you were far away. itâ€™s like youâ€™re sombody else now. i dont know why everything had to change. everything and everyone around me keeps changing. i wish it would slow down. my heart is getting heavier by the minute. i just want to sleep.
