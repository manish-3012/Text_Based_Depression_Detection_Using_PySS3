Reasons why school is hell because I need to vent \-Other people are assholes

\-A crap ton of dumb rules

\-The coding for the in-school social society is:

   { 

If (subject = majority) {

run acceptsubject.exe;

}

Else {

run tormentsubject.exe;

}

}

\-Many teachers are just idiots

\-Homework is the physical manifestation of all evil

\-â€StReSs Is BaDâ€ they say as they give us a three week project due in three days

\-â€iF yOu HaVe BaD gRaDeS yOuRe A fAiLuReâ€

\-Seven out of twelve of my waking hours are spent at school, not including the time it takes to get there, go home, and do my homework.

\-school starts at 8:00am, despite the fact that adults, the people who require less sleep, get to start at 9:00am.

\-â€tHiS iS a BuLlY fReE sChOoLâ€ they say as they punish the victim of said bullying

\-â€WhY tEaCh KiDs HoW tO bAlAnCe A cHeCkBoOk WhEn YoU cAn TeAcH tHeM hOw To FiNd ThE pErImEtEr Of A tRiAnGlE fOr ThE tHiRtEeNtH fUcKiNg TiMe?â€

\-HAHAHA PUBLIC SPEAKING GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

\-Phys Ed. The entirety of it, in fact.

\-Why do I have moderate-severe depression again? Oh yeah, thatâ€™s right! S c h o o l.

\-â€What, you fell asleep because you overworked yourself to near death doing the absolutely in-fucking-human levels of homework I gave you, causing you to stay awake all the way until goddamn 5:00 am? Hmm, sounds like you want a fucking D E T E N T I O N.â€

\-Teachers are allowed to punish the whole class for something one or two kids did, despite the fact that itâ€™s a violation of the fucking G E N E V A C O N V E N T I O N, but itâ€™s fine because itâ€™s â€œnot a prison environmentâ€ (which is dumb because A: itâ€™s still unnecessary suffering, and B: school is literally just a reskinned prison).

\-Weâ€™re not actually learning anything because of the way that school works

\-Despite the fact that word problems should be the most interesting thing, they actually become the least interesting because everything involved in them is generic AND could be solved by the characters involved.

\-HEY ya know this thing that I said was optional before yea NOW ITS MANDATORY AND ILL GIVE YOU A FUCKING DETENTION AND TAKE YOUR FREAKING MONEY IF YA DONâ€™T DO IT

\-A man made of physical pain sits within a school. Is he made of school, or is the school made of flesh? He screams, for he does not know.
