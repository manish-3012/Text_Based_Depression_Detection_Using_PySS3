Being smart isnâ€™t a blessing Itâ€™s a fucking curse. One second youâ€™re taking an IQ test and the next youâ€™re in mostly AP classes for your sophomore year of high school. This shit sucks! I miss my free time where Iâ€™d yâ€™all to people and help them. Now I canâ€™t do that. I have so much homework, that when Iâ€™m done with it, ITâ€™S TIME FOR ME TO GO TO SCHOOL *AND GET MORE HOMEWORK*. I fucking hate this. I want to quit school. This isnâ€™t beneficial. It just makes me depressed. Wtf is wrong with the education system?
