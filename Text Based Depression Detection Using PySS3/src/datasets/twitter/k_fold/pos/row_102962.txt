I need help with my girlfriend's dad. My girlfriend has been asking her dad for a new phone for 3 years already (she is 15 btw) and every time she asked, he would answer with simply "no" or "its a stupid  idea", "We could need this money someday". She has been using two different phones for those 3 years. Whenever one of them fails, she pull out the other one and so on and so on... One of the phones has stability and system issues and the other has battery and charging problems. Her dad doesnt really cares about that and if she has a phone or not, but still he denies her from getting a new one . She is also an acrobat and won literally almost 100 times a gold medal. Not only that but she often goes with her dad to a near village where they have a house and a garden. She works hard there. Like...VERY hard... Every time she had a birthday for those 3 years she asked and begged her dad. Hell, she will even pay for it, she has the money thay she earned herself! Isnt this enough for her dad to let her buy herself the phone. Apparently no. She literally cried last night and this one she is also crying. She got back home from training and her phone charger was missing. She asked her dad, if he had seen it, but said No and said she is careless. I am genuinely disgust by his attitude to her. Its like he doesnt care about her. From the time i saw him and can a conversation with him , I immediately noticed that he doesnt spend alot of money on stuff...Like even the phone she want isnt that expensive. Its like 100 euro and its second hand. But he bought himself a 190 euro machine that chews tree branches into bits... I have no words for it... Can you guys help, please... Im desperate. Is there any way for her to convince her dad to let her buy the phone. She will literally not have a phone otherwise and her dad probably wouldn't care. Also keep in mind that he is also my teacher in school, so i cant exactly confront him or in general i dont want to directly confront him or make her go against him. So ye...any help will be deeply appreciated.
