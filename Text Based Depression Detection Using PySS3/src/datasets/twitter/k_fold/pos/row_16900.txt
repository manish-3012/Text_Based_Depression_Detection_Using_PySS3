Today is a difficult day Sorry if this takes up any of your time, but today isn't a good day for me. My kitten, which we adopted about, I think, 6 months ago, has become very hurt recently as of writing. She has a bad leg, and she has refused to eat for a few days now. I'm really trying to make sure she feels better, but things aren't looking up.y grandmother (who really owns the kitten, but she's mine in my heart) has made the ultimate decision of putting her down Friday if her health doesn't look up. Usually I'd be looking on the upside and hoping for the best, but I can't this time. I have this feeling that no matter what we're doing, things won't look up. I'm hoping she'll be better, I love her with all my heart.
