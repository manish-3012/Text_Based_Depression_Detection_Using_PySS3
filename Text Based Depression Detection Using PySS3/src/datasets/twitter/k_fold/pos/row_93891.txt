Okay so like dreaming clears junk memory, they could also be alternate universes within our head.. I had a dream the other night where I had vividly passed out and whatever the case I was in my head like I couldn't feel my body or nothing I guess that's what a lucid dream is? I felt really rested afterwards idk what that was.
