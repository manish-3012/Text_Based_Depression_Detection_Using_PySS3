Gc Paranoia So Ill get straight to the point. Im in a gc with 4 people that we use for a class we all have together. No one really talks except for when we talk about the class and when I try to initiate a convo they dont really respond? Just wondering if they are in a second gc or im overreacting. Thanks in advance
