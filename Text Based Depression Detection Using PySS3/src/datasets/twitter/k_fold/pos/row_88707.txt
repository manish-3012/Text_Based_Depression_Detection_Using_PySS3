My crush got a boyfriend So Iâ€™m in 7th so donâ€™t take me too seriously but let me get into my story. So thereâ€™s this girl I like right? Iâ€™ve liked her for about a month now, up until today I thought she liked me back, I told my fiends they thought she liked me back. Even my family thought she did. But she just dmâ€™Ed me saying she has a boyfriend now. I know Iâ€™m only in 7th grade but it still stings.
