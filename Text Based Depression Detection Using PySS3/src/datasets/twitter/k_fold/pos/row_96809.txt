I need help before i lie down on the floor and scream in existential terror over the multiple years of wtf Welcome back to

Am i a girl or a femboy!!

Do i wish to be a femboy because they are given positive attention and representation online while trans representation is often terrible ?

Do i wish to be a girl because im aware that im unable to stay as a femboy forever before testosterone eventually has its way with me?

Do i wish to be a femboy because i want to escape masculinity while also remaining a boy?

Do i wish to be a girl because i have a crappy life and am seeking a grand way to start over?

Do i wish to be a femboy because I love being a boy and just want to be perceived as cute?

Do i want to be a girl because of a fetish

Am i making this stuff up to make myself deny my identity?

Do i even want to be a girl at all?

Does being a femboy mean what I think it means or is it a twisted mirror of reality

I used to be dysphoric so what happened? Why did it get better? Why do i feel it again sometimes ?
