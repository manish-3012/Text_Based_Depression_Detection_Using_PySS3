I didn't rly think I'd like Fall Guys but I kinda do like it just bc it's so simple to play. Like I don't have to listen to the sound I can just listen to music on my phone. Where I could be playing a different game which requires sound and full attention and it's not as relaxing always. filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
