Some days you might be in the middle of the desert after the conclusion of a music festival smoking with your friends while a coked up guy in a badge suits Tries to Convince to invest in his startup. Take that as a sign its time to go  And pay the random stranger who was just hanging out with the people who were camping next to you trying to hitchhike a ride to Nebraska to drive you all to Omaha because none of you were in the proper state to be operating a motor vehicle.

You may or may not have to tell Badger suit guy that you saw Elon Musk hanging out by the drink stand to get him to wander away just enough for you to finish packing your tent in get the fuck out of there while your friends  Do their best to make sure the guy you just hired to drive you Omaha Nebraska isn't a serial killer.

Your friend Maddox is assigned riding shotgun because hes the least compromised at the moment.

You don't even think about and take a not for about 6 hours waking up when Your friend is demanding to know whether or not you want Doritos or Mike and ikes from the gas station
