Reposting this when more people are awake so I get more feedback Humanity settled on a planet in the near future, but this planet has a longer distance from the sun, so they can't rely on solar power, so they slowly mine the planet for resources, flooding the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, to keep people from leaving the planet, corporations sign contracts with employees, promising them big land and wealth for their family a couple generations down, people invent biomekanical beings to help do work, lighter than air squid like creatures called carbon scrubbers are sent into the sky to eat carbon and produce oxygen, soon enough everyone starts using biomekanical machines. The more machines need to keep the atmosphere breathable, the more people are needed to stay for longer, perpetuating a cycle of endless slavery, class separation is being to be encouraged, as to not hint to the plan of slavery, and the people become content, not knowing that the very machines keeping them alive, are keeping them imprisoned.
