That's sucks but apparently everyone go though it rn, it is called âœ¨schoolâœ¨ So I have a very big pile of hw to do and very tough teachers that won't agree to change the submission date even if their lives depends on it. I have at least one big work for each day of the week, and I'm only in 10th grade, oh and I think that there is a name for how am I dealing with it- gifted kid burnout maybe?. Anyways I'll go continue my lovely breakdown, good luck for me, and have a nice day for youðŸ¦‹
