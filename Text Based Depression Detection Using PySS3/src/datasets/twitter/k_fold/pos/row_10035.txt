Watch out for dangerous people out on the road Today I went on a drive with my buddy and as usual we were having fun switching lanes and cruising. Out of nowhere this hillbilly starts trying to run my boy off the road in his pickup truck so I flip him off and he starts literally trying to ram us. Thankfully we were able to easily outrun his rust bucket Chevy (as we both have fast German cars) and escaped unscathed. There are lots of assholes out there who are just looking for a problem so beware.
