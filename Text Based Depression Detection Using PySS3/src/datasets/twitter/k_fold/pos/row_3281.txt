10 things parents dont understand/should do for teenagers 1: comparing us to our friends or siblings hurts

2: forced family fun, is never actually fun

3: defining everything we do based on our grades also hurts and makes us feel like nothing

4: do not dismiss our feelings as us being "moody"

5: we are stressed!! the past year has been very hard for most of us and you need to understand that! please!!

6: just because we want alone time or privacy, doesnt mean we have something to hide

7: giving us positive affirmations every once in a while helps with self esteem

8: let us hang out with our friends now and then. Personally, i havent seen some of my best friends in over a year due to covid and it takes a toll on my mental health

9: we dont always have some wild story about how our day at school went. If we walk in the house and u ask how it went and we simply say, good, leave the conversation at that

10: check up on us every once in a while :) a lot of us need that in our life. I dont mean barge into our room and search every nook and cranny, i mean, maybe sit down and have a genuine conversation about everything, and try not to get angry. we might say some stuff you wish you knew

thank you for attending my tedtalk.
