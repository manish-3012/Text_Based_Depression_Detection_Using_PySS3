Are there any Paypal alternatives for teens? Hi, so I recently just got my first Debit Card (Greenlight) and I wanna start making some passive income on the side with my meme page on Instagram by having people buy shoutouts and things like that, but since I'm still under 18 I can't use paypal. Is there any way people can send their payments and is there a Paypal alternative that allows teens under the age of 18?
