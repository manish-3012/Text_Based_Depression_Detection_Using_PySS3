Just a bit of rambling I feel I like Iâ€™m possessed by both a being of infinite knowledge and a being with infinite questions. The one who questions asked the all knowing questions throughout any given day and the all knowing answers but during the night the all knowing stops answering and the one who questions asks more and more and the later I stay up at night the more frantic it gets with itâ€™s questions and when I sleep everything resets.
