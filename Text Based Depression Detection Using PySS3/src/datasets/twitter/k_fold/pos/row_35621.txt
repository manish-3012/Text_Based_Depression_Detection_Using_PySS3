Hard times In the COVID-19 quarantine lots of people are probably struggling with depression and I'm just here to tell you to go outside and hang out with people, go out and do hobbies or play sports (make sure you are being safe from the virus tho) because depression has killed many more people than COVID-19 ever will, find something to do rather than just feeling sad
