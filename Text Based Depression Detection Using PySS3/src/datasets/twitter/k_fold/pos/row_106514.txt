I'm lucky as f**k I was searching for a girlfriend for almost 5 years. And now I'm in University and... YES , I found the girl who liked me. She is like me , we have same interests , same problems etc. And yes , it seems that we are created for each other!!! But... It's one liiiitle problem... She have a boyfriend :/
Jeez , when I found an ideal girl , the next day she said that she have a damn bf...
I'm really lucky person. 
P.S. Fuck!
