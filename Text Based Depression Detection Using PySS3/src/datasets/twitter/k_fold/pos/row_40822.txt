I had one of the happiest days of my life until the night came along I was happy all day. I was laughing so much. I was so full of energy. I smiled the most I have in awhile. It was a great day. But as soon as night came, my mood drastically changed. I felt depressed, lonely, exhausted, I wasnâ€™t enough. I want to cry now, all alone in my room. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone because I know whatâ€™s going to happen if I tell them how I feel. I hope I feel better tomorrow.
