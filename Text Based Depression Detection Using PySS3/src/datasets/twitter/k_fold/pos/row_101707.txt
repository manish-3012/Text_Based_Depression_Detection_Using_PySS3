lil rant or whatever ðŸ˜€ &gt; be me


&gt; absolutely suck at talking to people


&gt; only have like 2 friends


 &gt; only one of them is actually a "close" friend


&gt; been friends for like 1 year and a half now


&gt; he gets a gf


&gt; barely even talks to me now


&gt; scared of us slowly talking less and less until we just stop talking


&gt; could possibly lose my only real friend
