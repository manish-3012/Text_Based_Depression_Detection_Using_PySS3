Should I really care about dating? I'm (M15) and I've only ever been in 1 serious relationship which wasn't very enjoyable as she was manipulative. I was always fine with being by myself as I always had friends to hang out with.

But now a lot of my friends have girlfriends and are spending time with them. And it started to make me feel like a tad bit sad as I miss the feeling of having someone to share moments with and that I'm missing out. 

At the same time I know that I don't need anyone. I can't determine whether or not I should be actively trying to find someone to spend time with or just have fun by myself and ignore the urge.
