I just had the worst dream ever. I actually cried about it when I woke up and I haven't cried due to a nightmare in years. It was just that bad. I had a dream where my mom was diagnosed with covid and...

Didn't make it.

And I cried so much, and then I was stuck with my dad as my dad said "I hate your mother. She's making you cry like this" and I just wanted to hit him so hard and I was so upset about it that I actually wished covid on one of my "classmates" siblings saying "why couldn't they have gotten covid? Or me? Why did it have to be mom?"

I just...

I'm so fucking upset rn.
