I found out what my Christmas gift is by accident and now I'm sad that it's not a surprise. I mean, it's exactly what I wanted to I'm really exited about that, but now I know brand and color and stuff so it's not a surprise anymore :(

Here's what happened: yesterday, a delivery truck came and parked in front of my house and brought a box to the door, well usually they have it double packaged into a box that doesn't say/show what it is, but this one did. So I just looked out the window and say the box. Luckily my sister in law was here and wanted to open the door so she got it and brought it to my mom.

Now I'm just sad I saw what it was, including color and brand, and it's no longer a surprise.
