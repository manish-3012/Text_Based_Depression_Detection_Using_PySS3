Telling you facts about every country untill I run out of them in alphabetical order (hopefully) every day : Day 28 : Burundi Burundi won a gold medal in 1996 for the first time in Olympic history. In doing so, it became the poorest country ever to win an Olympic gold medal.

Burundi, prior to 1996, had been unable to field athletes in the Olympics. It never even bothered to join the Olympics movement until then. However, through great personal effort and success of their athlete - VÃ©nuste Niyongabo, Burundi sent a team to the Olympics. VÃ©nuste Niyongabo got a personal reward by winning an Olympic gold medal in the 5,000m race. This also became Burundiâ€™s first and so far, the only Olympic gold ever won.
