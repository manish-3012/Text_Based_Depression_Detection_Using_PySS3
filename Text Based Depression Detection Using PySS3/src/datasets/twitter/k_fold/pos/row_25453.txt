"Go for girls with common interests" One of the most low IQ advices ever given. Women dont give a shit about having common thigs. Pussy wont get wet with that. They want someone who is good looking. Anything else is an extra.

Take me for example. I had everything in common with my oneitis. Both gamers yet she didnt even wanna talk about those things. She didnt even want to talk in general or be with me in the first place.

This cope has been debunked. Looks are the only factors in dating. Anything else is secondary.
