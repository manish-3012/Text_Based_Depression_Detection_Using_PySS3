Something about going outside is nice Nature, warm weather, bicc, shitty unmaintained roads, and da smell of fresh asphalt. That nice smell is better than drugs. Smell of the local tributary as u ride ur bicc down the hill. The smell of the warm air as u ride through downtown. Sounds of nature at 8 pm in the summer. No cars on the road, very quiet road, and jeans with some shitty t shirt. Idk walking through some random sewer. And doing all that while listening to juice wrld and some other artists i forgot.

It feels better than sitting on a chair playing a videogame.
