Hey so like ummmm life's stressful. I need help finding perspective (rant) I'm 17. I'm about to graduate high school. I'm applying to college. I'm about to be an adult, and like what the FUUUUUCK is happening.

Assuming I get into college, there's 100 things that I need to stress about. How do I share a bathroom? I'm an only child, never have done that. How do I eat in a cafeteria? I don't eat at school, I study in the library during lunch and eat at home lol. How do I live on my own? I know how to do laundry and cook and stuff, but I don't like being alone.

Also!!! I love my house. It's the perfect size, and I have a yard and stuff. I don't wanna leave. 

I just need to find perspective, right? I kind of like the idea of having my own apartment. Yes, it's smaller than a house (duh), but it's all mine. 

The more I grow older, the more I realize that I do NOT wanna move far away from my parents. I'm a coddled only child who's had life handed easy to me.

I'm going to be honest and say that I'm privileged. My family is healthily middle class. My parents are (going to try) to pay for as much as my tertiary education as they can. They said I could live at home as long as I want until I'm able to start a stable life.

It's just I'm so stressed. What if I never get a good paying job? What if I can't live on my own. What if I never buy a house or get a good apartment. What if I become homeless or something. How do I share a bathroom if I get into college :(
