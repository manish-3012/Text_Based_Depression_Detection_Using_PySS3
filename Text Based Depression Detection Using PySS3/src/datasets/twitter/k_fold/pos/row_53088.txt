So my little sister asked me how babies are made, what should i tell her? So today my little sister (4yrs) came to me and asked "\*Name\*, do you know how babies are made?" and i was like "Why do you want to know that?" and she responded to "I'm just curious."

Should i tell her how they're actually made, or should i tell her about the stork? Or should i tell her to ask mom?

I'm a boy btw.
