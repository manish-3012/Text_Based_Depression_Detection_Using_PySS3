My school was weird So I went to a elementary school and it was be fine 1 teacher per class pe with a different teacher 30min break 1hour lunch and we could have literally anything the parents of the kids could bring in a lunch for the kid if they wanted to (or forgot to) . And you would be considered the â€œcoolâ€ kid if you got your mom to bring you McDonaldâ€™s and a Coca Cola and it was only that combo nothing else was â€œcoolâ€ then the school lunch was the best. I donâ€™t know what everyone thinks about school lunches but mine were the best when it was elementary school but other schools I went to was really bad. The best part of the school I went to was that there was 1 male teacher and he was able the let everyone on a phone 3ds ds and that was great but he would say things like donâ€™t bring in an iPad donâ€™t take pictures of each other and the girls in the class would do that they would bring in an iPad and take pictures of everyone
