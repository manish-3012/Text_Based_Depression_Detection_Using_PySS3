Being a werewolf would be easy Full moons are about once a month. Girls have periods about once a month. They deal with it so can I.

How worth it would it be is a good question. Do I get any benefits in human form? Do I lose my mind and hunt for humans when I go all were?

Is it like skyrim where I shift at will and I'll be battling an inner wolf to avoid eating children or something?

Can I grow a tail and wolf ears at will?

Can I turn into a normal wolf if I want to?
