Bruh. My arts teacher just got mad at me So earlier today, I sent 2 works I had due this Thursday. 1 of the went through and the other didn't and I don't know why. My teacher saw the first job and said it was interesting.

The problem begins when I say I had another one and it didn't show on the email. So I showed him the other work, it was a painting I did, and my teacher said he thought the painting was amazing but he was mad at me because I didn't send it. I tried to tell hi that I did send it but it didn't show, but he just ignored me 

Later I checked my mail and didn't saw the 2nd email, even though I and my parents saw me press the Send button.

A very strong bruh.
