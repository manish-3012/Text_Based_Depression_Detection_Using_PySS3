A poem a day until I get my SAT scores back - day 10 Humanities. The study of humans.

Yet, its disciples are treated anything but.

Worked to exhaustion like sub-humans.

Casted to the side like an orphaned mutt.

They blame phones as a distraction.

Piles upon piles, my tasks amass.

They no do not understand my reactions.

My eternal dread for the next class.
