My Experiences as the Youngest I hear many people say "Being the youngest is the best. They're always treated like a God." though I agree that this is true in some families, it's the exact opposite for me. In my house I'm always having to do every little thing around the house. I do nearly every chore, have to do the annoying stuff for my parents. My brother is is considered an "adult" just because he recently turned 18. He's treated like he's the best when he's learning decimals in community college. My experience as the youngest isn't the best.
