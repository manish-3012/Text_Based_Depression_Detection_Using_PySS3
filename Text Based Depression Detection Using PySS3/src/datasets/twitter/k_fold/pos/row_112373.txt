This girl DM'd me today on insta She responded to one of my stories and we started talking and it ended with her wishing me luck in today's race (which i ended up bombing) weve gone to school together since 7th grade but never talked cuz were both quiet. Idk if shes interested or not but ive always been kinda into her so I'm kinda nervous and dont know what to do. What do you guys think?
