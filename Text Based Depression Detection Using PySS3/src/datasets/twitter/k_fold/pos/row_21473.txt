Petition to ban reaction memes r/memes just did it. r/dankmemes did it a while ago. Can we please have memes that donâ€™t just have a random meme template on the bottom that adds nothing?

Ex: â€œman does good thing with money that a lot of people used as a kidâ€

EVERYONE LIKED THAT

Thatâ€™s not a meme. Itâ€™s karmawhoring.

Mods, if you wish to take this post down, go ahead. I donâ€™t think it violates the rules, but thatâ€™s up to you to decide.

TL;DR: no more reaction memes please
