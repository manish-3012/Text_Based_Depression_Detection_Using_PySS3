Teens with anti-vaccine parents - diverging opinions and self-consent Does anyone in the subreddit have anti-vaccine parents? Do you agree with them? What shaped your own opinion? Would you consider getting vaccinated without parental consent (or have you already)? 

Personally, I donâ€™t have anti-vaccine parents, but I work to support teens that do, and I recently published an [op-ed](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-16/teen-vaccinations-self-consent-covid) in the LA Times on this issue. Iâ€™m the founder of [VaxTeen](https://vaxteen.org/), which was inspired by stories of teenagers with anti-vaccine parents turning to Reddit. Its website allows teens to determine what vaccines they need and when they can receive them without parental consent in their state. VaxTeen communicates directly with teenagers and young adults to educate them on the importance of vaccines and empower them to make well-informed decisions about their health.
