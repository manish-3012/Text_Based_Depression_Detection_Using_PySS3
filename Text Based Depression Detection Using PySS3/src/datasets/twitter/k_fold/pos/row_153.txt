when you want to date people because women are kinda hot ngl but you also are worried about leaving your friend behind because you love your friends and know that hes insecure about being replaced by people and obviously you dont want to replace her and youre worried youd end up spending less and less time with her and eventually drift apart, which in itself is one of your biggest fears, so instead of doing anything you just cry because you dont know what else to do !!!

edit: also you dont even know if you feel romantic attraction at all and you just need an excuse to spend time with people because you have a crippling fear of being alone!!!!!
