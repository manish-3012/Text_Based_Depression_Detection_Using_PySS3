Iâ€™m pretty sure I have a bunch of undiagnosed (possibly fatal) disorders Iâ€™m not gonna get into what they are because kinda personal. But, my self-neglect just does not give two fucks, like I am content if I die from this shit. Some people have tried getting me to go to the doctor and I basically just told them to fuck off.
