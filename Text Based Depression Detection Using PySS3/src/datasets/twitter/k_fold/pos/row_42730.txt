Well, I asked her! I have known her for like over a dozen years and I have low-key had a crush on her since then. I decided to ask her to be my girlfriend today and I am waiting for her to reply. Any advice? (Btw yes, I am 18 and haven't had a girlfriend before. No, I am not ashamed. This is something I take seriously.)
