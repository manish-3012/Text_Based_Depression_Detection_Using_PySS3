Anyone who is interested in tech wanna start a discord group? You don't have to know anything about tech, so long as there is a general interest. These interests can be anything from computers to networking! 

I created this server because I don't have anyone in my real life that shares the love for computers as much as I do and I'm hoping that I might meet some new people and maybe one-day, we could do something great.

Just add my discord at Human Hand#0150 and I'll invite you to the server
