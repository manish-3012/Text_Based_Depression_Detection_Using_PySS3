I need your help Iâ€™m so sad. I had two online friends named Sam and Puffly that I met in animal crossing. I donâ€™t remember how long i knew them for but i remember we were going to text each other and stuff and then i stupidly reset my ds so they got unfriended. I remember trying to find them again for days on end. I remember asking if anyone knew on countless forums and YouTube videos related to animal crossing. I remember all the fun we would have together. They were my best friends. I mis them so much. I donâ€™t remember a lot about them besides puffly having a sister named Samantha (not the same one) and Sam liked melanie martinez. I think we would still get along today. Sams town was named rose and pufflys was named puff town. I havenâ€™t talked to them in 3-4 years and want to find them again. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been looking for them to no avail. Please help.
