Online school is good Ok so I know that this is going to be semi-controversial and honestly this is more of a rant than me stating an opinion. But I wish my school went fully online, we currently are in-person but you can choose to do online learning (which I and some of my friends have). I checked today and ~40 people got covid in the past 10 days at my school alone! Which is insane and the fact we havenâ€™t switched boggles my mind. I have had multiple friends that got covid, granted I doubt they got it at school but itâ€™s still a possibility. As much as I hate not seeing my friends and the lost productivity online school brings, I couldnâ€™t stand to see a friend lose a loved one because of covid. The students literally started a petition with hundreds of signatures urging our school to switch but for some reason unbeknownst to me we havenâ€™t. I know this is gonna see by 2 people but I just had to rant somewhere about it. And I know that if I get covid I hopefully will be fine as I am a healthy teenager but I obviously would prefer not to get it, and there is the risk of me transmitting it to someone who might be more vulnerable.

Idk might delete...
