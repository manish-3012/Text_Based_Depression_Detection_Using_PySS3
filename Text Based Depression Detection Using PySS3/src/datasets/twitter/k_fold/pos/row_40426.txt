Last day as teen Well everyone, this is it. Kind of a spontaneous post but time surely flies and I just realized that it's my last day as a teenager. Lots of great memories and a great childhood, lots of time wasted browsing this subreddit too. 

While I've great things that I look forward to (applying to med school in 6 months ugh), I still feel like a kid and so I suppose it's really with an ambivalent feeling that I step into the next stage of my life. (1/3 through manufacturer's warranty, 1/4 through manufacturer's expected life span yay but probably worse cuz all the all-nighters).

Anyway, enjoy your time - a cliche but you really only live once. Remember that wherever you go, there you are. 

Keep fighting and I'll see y'all on the other side haha!
