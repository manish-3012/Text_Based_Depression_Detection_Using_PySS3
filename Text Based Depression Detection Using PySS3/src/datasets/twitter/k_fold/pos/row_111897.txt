Did I just get asked out? So my best friend and I were talking about how much we missed each other and how much we wanted to hang out, and she says we should "Go out to an arcade once covid ends" if I was up for it. I said hell yeah and that I haven't been to an arcade since I was in like 6th grade. Her response was "then I'd love to take you."







Seeing as I'm socially inept, did I just get asked out? She said a couple months ago on her snap that she wasn't interested in dating, but I'm not sure if she changed her mind. Was she just being friendly? I'm looking for more of a yes or a no, I'm probably not gonna just out of the blue ask her if it was a date, I just wanted to get the opinions of people with A) an objective view and B) more experience.
