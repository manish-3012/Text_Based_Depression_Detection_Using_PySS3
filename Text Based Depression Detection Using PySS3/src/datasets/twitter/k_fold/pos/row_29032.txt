We got a dog... And what can I say...He's so cute, he knows so many tricks, he's so obedient.

Except, that is the opposite of what's true.

I (16M) am very much a cat person, we have two cats, one of which is scared of everything - if you put down a plate too loudly he will run away. And way before we got this dog my two cats fought a lot, my mum even considered that they fought so much because the house was so busy (especially with self isolation etc).  
So what does she do? Get a god damn dog.

It is a very old white Jack Russel with lung illnesses because his owner smoked a lot indoors. It's fat, unfit and follows you arround grunting until you give it what it wants. 

Admittedly, it was not the plan to get it, but when our old neighbour fell ill and had to go to hospital, for some reason my mum offered to take it, even when there were many more suitable people to take him - such as the woman who took care of him and owns his house and money.

My cats will no longer come downstairs and are eating much less food, but all of my protesting seems to do nothing. I'm worried for my pets and I honestly don't care about the dog.

Just a rant really, but if you have any advice it will be welcomed.
