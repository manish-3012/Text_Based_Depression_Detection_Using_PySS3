I can't think of what to get for Christmas PLEASE HELP(i will reply to anything really fast) Okay so as you guys know in 45 days Christmas will come but I can't think of what to get for Christmas and I also really need to think fast. Most of the stuff I would usually want was just to get a phone, upgrade my gaming gear but this year i cant think of what to get which isn't very expensive as i can no longer upgrade my gaming gear. Most of the things i want never get bought because my dad always just goes like: "Yeah, but you don't need that." or most recent when i asked for a phone: "Your phone already works really good i don't know why you want a new one." BUT MY PHONE BARELY WORKS. It's battery barely lasts, it's really slow, and my sister used to have it until she broke it AND INSTEAD OF REPAIRING IT, THEY BOUGHT HER A NEW ONE, also now my phone(her old phone) has the button which closes the phone like barely sticking to it and i had to use glue many times just to make it stay. But now i don't know what to get so any Christmas presents i could ask for that aren't like too expensive or too cheap or straight up a god damn book. PLEASE TELL ME!!
