My fish played among us We started out with 12 fish and then one fish mysteriously disappeared

We ignored it bc it was just one fish

Then another one disappeared

We figured out that one of the fish was eating the other ones, hence why we couldn't find the corpses of the dead fish

Then another one disappeared

We were starting to get worried bc we didn't wanna lose all our fish, but we didn't separate the fish up to find the impostor

Then more disappeared until there were 2 left

They were around the same size so we didn't know who was the culprit. One was a black fish and one was a red fish. The red one was always faster than the black one

Then finally one day we only had one fish left

It was the black one

It died a week later
