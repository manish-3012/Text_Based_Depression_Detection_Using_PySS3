I don't know where to talk about this , so... I hate this world, I am a little lonely piece of shit, I have got NO friends, the only friends I have we haven't talked in like a year. I have no one left to call a â€œbest friendâ€, No one really understands me, every time I try to go out with my school friends, I always feel left out, There was this one girl who really understood me, but I started having a crush on her, and I fucking messed up, in my previous school I had a lot of so-called friends but I found out that they only used me, for homeworks especially maths, I used to share with everyone, but I found out and I stopped sharing my homework when quarantine started and no one has ever messaged me or even said â€œhiâ€.  The only way I kept myself sane from a year was by learning programming, I expertised in Arduino and python. My mum always says me to go out, but I have fucking no one to go out. As I am a foreigner in Poland, whenever I went out with my classmates they would all talk in Polish and I wouldn't understand much. I fucking hate this world.
I also want friends that don't want me ONLY for homeworks, I want to go out with them, maybe play sports, play videogames together, go for movies.
