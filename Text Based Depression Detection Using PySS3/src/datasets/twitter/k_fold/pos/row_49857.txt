I just unclogged the toilet on my own and I feel like a legit god, no joke So I hadn't taken a shit in about 2 weeks, and I took one around 20 minutes ago. Problem was, the shit clogged the damn toilet bowl. 

This was an absolute nightmare, mainly because I started having flashbacks of a similar incident in a hotel, which was a traumatic experience for me and my dad.

The time was 11:30 pm and my parents were asleep. First step - don't make noise. This would attract them. Second- try to solve this. First, I flushed again.. didn't work, obviously. Now we don't have a plunger or whatever, so I thought what I could do.

Then I googled some solutions. All of them required baking soda or shit, which I didn't have (and I didn't have the time for it either)

Then I thought if water hit the shit at a high velocity it would force the shit down the pipe

Filled a bucket (it did make some noise though) and dumped it in the sink

Nothing happened, the bowl flooded and eventually the water receded

I filled another bucket and while I was waiting looked into the mirror and gave myself a 'pep talk' of sorts

Once the bucket filled I lifted the bucket HIGH up, and dumped in the bowl

The shit dissapeared, and I felt RELEIF. Fuck, I am so happy! I UNIRONICALLY feel like a fucking god for having done this on my own.

Also, my dad used the bathroom JUST NOW for taking a piss, and he didn't notice anything. Mission accomplished
