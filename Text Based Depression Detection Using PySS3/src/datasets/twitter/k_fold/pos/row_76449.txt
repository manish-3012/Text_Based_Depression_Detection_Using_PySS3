I just did something that will anger a few people So I was unloading the dishwasher. I get through the silverware and theres these little pile handle things you use to hold corn. They are colored, so my mind instantly went "ok, these are colored, so they are probably supposed to go together based on color." So like a normal home sapien creature, I randomize which one goes with which. That's right. I consciously told myself that they go together by color, and I mixed them up. Thing is, I didnt do that on accident. I did that on purpose. Why? It was an opportunity. An opportunity not taken is one wasted. You're welcome, perfectionists.
