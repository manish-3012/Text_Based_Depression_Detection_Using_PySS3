Should I Do The Essay Or No? So I have this business with my brother where he pays me to do his English work and assignments because I get him better grades and he's too lazy to do them himself. I don't really want to get into an argument about the ethics of doing this, because that's not why I made this post.

So basically, my brother KNOWS that he needs to give me a heads up for bigger assignments like essays, because they take longer to do. So yesterday, he comes into my room at 11pm when I'm half asleep and asks me to do his essay and I say "sure", thinking it's due in like a week. But he comes into my room today and asks if I finished the essay yet, because IT'S DUE TOMORROW MORNING.

I worked really hard on my own English project all day today and poured all of my energy into it. I didn't have much energy to begin with because my stupid sleeping problems woke me up at 4am today and I couldn't go back to sleep, so by the time I got home I was completely drained.

So that is why I am confiding in you guys about this situation. Should I do his essay for him, even though it will stress me out even more and I'm already drained? Is it worth the $25? Should I just tell him to do it himself?
