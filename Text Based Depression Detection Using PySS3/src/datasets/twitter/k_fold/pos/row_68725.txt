Nobody tells me anything and I hate that This is just a rant about something that happened a little bit ago today, so my dad has a gf and it's her birthday today. Her daughter, her daughter's bf, and someone else are supposed to be coming up. This was supposed to be a surprise. Nobody ever told me it was supposed to be a surprise. So I asked her about it and she was like "what?" so I asked my brother if I wasn't supposed to tell her and he told me "it was supposed to be a surprise but ok whatever" in a ride tone as if I was told it was supposed to be a surprise. So basically I just ruined my dad's  gf's birthday surprise because nobody told me it was supposed to be a secret and now I hate myself for it.
