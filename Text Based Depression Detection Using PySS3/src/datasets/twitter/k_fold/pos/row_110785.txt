My dad wants to monitor me (13, boy) and my sister (16) with a security camera. The room is two flights of stairs up. I'm getting a new room and as we are painting today my dad starts bringing up security cameras. Most of the core details are in the title. My defense is that "if my sister changes in her room (when i'm not there of course) then looking at her on the camera is another way of getting very close to underage nudity." His defense? "change in the closet."

I got a temperature light gun (you point it at walls and floors to check temperatures and we had one). The closet was 106 DEGREES (41 IN CELSIUS). He also wants at least two to get all angles of our room, so creaking the door open so we don't have a heat stroke is going to be impossible. 

The best part is...the room is two flights of stairs up to climb. This isn't anything with regular cameras where "Oh, it's dark out, I don't wanna go outside." This is two flights of stairs up to check in on us. But no. It's too hard for him.

So...should he get one? (and is what he's doing even legal?)
