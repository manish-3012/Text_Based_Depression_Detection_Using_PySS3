my dad ditched me in a mall on my birthday went out for dinner tonight only to be met with my dad leaving without saying anything, he also ignored my calls which I know for a fact because he only answered once switched to private.   
No better gift then being abandoned in the middle of shopping centre for 45 minutes.  
Happy fucking birthday to me I guess :)
