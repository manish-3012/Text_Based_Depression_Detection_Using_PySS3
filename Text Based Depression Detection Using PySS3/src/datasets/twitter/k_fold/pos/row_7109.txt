I feel bad for my teachers Like I have an independent work time where I and other students can ask for help on math or science or whatever else is available that day but all that ends up happening is the teacher sitting in silence sorrowfully looking at their computer to a room of muted mics. Like I would ask something but I never really need help at these times.
