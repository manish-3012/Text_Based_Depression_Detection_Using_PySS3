This fricking bs Why do adults think they own the fricking world? Like bro, I'm not allowed to speak to them in any way once they tell me to do something, be it wrong or right. I'm told that I'm too immature for the real world, but mature enough to handle little kids pissing me off. I'm legit on the verge of tears. I cant ask for anything without being bombarded with thousands of lectures about why I cant have it. And most of it is bs. "DID YOU JUST USE FACTS AND LOGIC IN AN ARGUMENT?!?!?YOU ARE A DISRESPECTFUL PIECE OF GARBAGE, YOU ARE GROUNDED". This isnt ok. Teenagers are probably the most neglected age group ever. Children get taken care of and dont have responsibility, that's fair. Adults, on the other hand, think that the word "responsibility" means that they have the choice to treat me like a trash can. I'm told I have no right to do anything except obey. I AM NOT A SLAVE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DONT HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, IN THE HOUSE, YNTIL I FINISH LAUNDRY, THIS IS BS. I'm really sad because I've no way to defend myself without being destroyed by the words, "I'm the adult". 

Sorry I just needed somewhere to vent my anger, thanks
