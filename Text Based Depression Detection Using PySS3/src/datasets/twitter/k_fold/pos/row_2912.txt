I'd like some feedback To make a long story short, I've liked a girl for a while now but she will absolutely say no if I ask her out. I don't want to say anything but keeping my feelings down for the past couple years has been torture and it's getting to a point where I just have to tell her. So for one, should I say anything? And 2 if I do, would what's below be acceptable?

"I wish it weren't the case. I can see how desperately you don't want it. I see it in your eyes when I smile around you, but not saying it for the past 3 years has been killing me from the inside out. I've had feelings for you for a while now. I just need to get that out. I love you and I don't think those feelings will fade anytime soon. God knows I've tried to stop it or ignore it but it's just been eating away at me. And it's not even that I don't want to love you, it's just I know that it's not what you want. So I'm sorry. I hope we can continue to be friends. I hope it doesn't burn any bridges. I truly hope we can still have a bond without a lingering awkwardness. I don't think I could stand a life without you. If you need some space from me for a while then I'd totally understand, but please just know that I will always be there for you. I'll always be rooting for you, even if it has to be from afar. You are genuinely one of the best people I've ever met and I'm so lucky to be able to call myself your friend. I'm really sorry. I've tried to keep it down and not let it get in the way but everytime I talk to you it's like a pressure builds up in my stomach to force out all my feelings for you and it's torture to hold it back, so here's me not holding it back anymore. I really hope you understand and I really hope we can still be friends."

I know that was a lot to read but any and all feedback would be great.
