I have toxic parents(sorry for bad english) Every time i get home i want to escaoe from them. I have this feeling from years. They usually jell at me , but i don't know i. They don't like it when i'm playing... What happen if i'm drinking alkohol? 
They always "tell" me what to do, always delete my plans, and i need to change that plans. Etc. I think you know what the toxic parents do.
I think i had/have depression. I find the "cure" in metal/rock and love(finally ). 
 (I'm in collage 120km from my "home", learning mechanical engineering.) 
I'm happy for this community because i can share my problems.
