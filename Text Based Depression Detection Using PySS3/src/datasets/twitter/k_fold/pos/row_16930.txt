Why do knives always have a key ring Who puts there keys on there knife and why would you, if you use your keys people will know you have a knife on you and you canâ€™t take your keys to place where knives arenâ€™t allowed 

I donâ€™t want people to know I have a knife on me, it might make them anxious or scared or something which I donâ€™t want to do and is understandable but Iâ€™m not going to just stop carrying a knife
