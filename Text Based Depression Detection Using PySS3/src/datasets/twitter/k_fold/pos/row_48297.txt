Had a Zoom bomber in our online classes today - slightly traumatized We had a Zoom bomber come into one of our online classes today yelling racist, sexist, and homophobic slurs. Our P.E. class has a hundred people attending, so the teacher has no waiting room and anyone who knows the link can be admitted into the classroom. The Zoom bomber came in, and what was the scariest thing, was that they had the exact same name as one of my classmates, and their voices sounded very similar. The classmate was proven innocent by some backend means. Likely a coincidence, but nonetheless quite shocking. Many of us were slightly traumatized by this experience.

Just wanted to share for anyone who's experienced something similar. Online classes are tough.
