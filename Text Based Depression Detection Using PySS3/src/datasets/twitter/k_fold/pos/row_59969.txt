I'm having a panic attack So backstory my mom has loud ass alarms and they're usually music which I'm fine with but tonight it was a tapping sound with a ladies voice saying the time I kicked into fight or flight until I heard my mother turn the alarm off now I'm sitting here unable to calm myself. So hows everyone else's nights going?
