Just venting because I have nowhere else to do so Im trying real hard do get work done in school but the way our school system works i cant make it through the day without crying, feeling nauseous, or being really uncomfortable 

It gets really difficult to do work after school because I just can't handle work and my own emotions at the same time. Im discouraged from doing anything because im in a constant state of self hatred and sadness

Im trying to turn in all that i can and it hurts sk bad when my dad demands to see my missing work for the 15th time this fucking week and he tells me im not trying at all
