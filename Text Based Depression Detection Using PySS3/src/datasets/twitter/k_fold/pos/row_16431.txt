Tiktok wasn't Terrible. Okay hear me our, yes the pedophiles were bad, yes the data mining was bad, i hated how girls were encouraged to post soft core porn. but there was a good side, now before the reddit hive mind gets my ass. Every damn social media is chuckloaded with pedos, the data mining isn't really excusable but most people either didn't know or didn't care. And in the end if girls want to post that of content there isn't a issue. Tiktok had a side that wasn't awful. This will probably get downvoted to hell but im so tired to the "tiktok bad Reddit good" garbage
