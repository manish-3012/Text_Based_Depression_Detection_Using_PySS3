I just found out my cousin (f16) got raped. I really need some advice on how to handle this situation, I told her I wasn't gonna tell anyone and I don't wanna commit a murder. 


Heres the story.
So we weren't actually that close because she's busy a lot but started talking since the whole corona thing started and she talked about her new boyfriend. 
She mentioned stuff that was supposed to be normal, as if it were something really special. How he doesn't tell her she's worthless, how he hugs her and is so nice to her. 
Okay so this made me wonder. She said she was so sad all the time, couldn't look herself in the mirror and really fucking hated herself. 
Anyway long story short her ex came up. I thought he was just another asshole, that wouldn't keep texting her after things were over. 
Turns out. That he fucking raped her. Four times. He was blackmailing her, too, and said if she told anyone he'd rape her friends too, and hurt her even more. She was together with him for 1.5 years and he abused and manipulated her in every fucking way. She got scars. From when he stabbed her with keys for wearing a crop top. 
The whole situation is so fucking messed up and I don't know what to do. She says shes FINE, ffs. 
Should I tell someone? Her parents? Mine? 
I just feel so fucking horrible, it's been 8 hours and I can't stop shaking. She's the sweetest and most talented person I know, and her self worth is gone because of that bastard. 
I tried talking her into therapy but she won't even block him on social media even though he still has the AUDACITY to text her he loves her and all that crap. 

Any advice would be appreciated, and sorry for shitty wording and formatting, I don't feel so well rn.
