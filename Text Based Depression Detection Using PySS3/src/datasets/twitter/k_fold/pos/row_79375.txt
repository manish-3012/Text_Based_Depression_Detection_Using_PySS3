I hugged and kissed my crush on the cheek kinda. (makes me happy every timeðŸ˜Š) So it was a dance camp
I was with the girls talking about going home and leaving the dance camp one week early.
My crush started crying because she wanted to go home.
So I hugged her to try and make her feel a little better.
And when I kessed her on the cheek it was like a day or two before.
We were playing truth or dare and someone dared me to kiss one girl on the cheek(face;) ). So I kissed her.
It's my happiest memory everðŸ˜Š
