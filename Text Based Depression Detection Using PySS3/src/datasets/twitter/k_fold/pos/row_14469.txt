actual rant about the LGBT *community*, read before you instantly downvote So, first off i wanna make it clear that i have nothing against being lgbt. As a matter of fact, i think im bisexual.

My problem is with the attention maniacs and the "if you're not gay, you're homophobic" people. 

My first point i wanna discuss:

If you're lgbt, just tell it and move on. Dont talk about it all the time. You just become annoying and look like you crave attention after you repeat it every other sentence. 

My second point:

Dont accuse someone of being homophobic just because you dont like them or other unrelated reasons. This is compareble with black people that call everyone racists because they're not black.

Yeah, thats it. Thats the rant.
