I excited! I released my first product today! I've been working on this bad boy for months and I'm really proud of it. It's a product I'd be willing to buy for the price it is vs. the content you get, and I thought it was ready so I released it!

The product is basically a creepy texture pack for all you 3D artists out there, taking a TON of inspiration from the anime/manga Berserk. It's actually really just all Berserk, but can be used for other things.

I won't go into much detail here but if you're at all interested in this you can preview the contents [here](https://gumroad.com/l/mUyQL): [https://gumroad.com/l/mUyQL](https://gumroad.com/l/mUyQL)
