Anyone who wants to start a band and need a vocalist in Stockholm. I have no training in singing, I just want to see what my capabilities are and probably blow off some steam. I haven't sung in a long fucking time but I've been wanting to sing out loud for quite a while, I just haven't gotten any opportunities. I wanna see if I can growl and/or scream, just see what my vocal range is like. Wanna take my mind off of being played by a girl I had a crush on. Any potential metal bands or people who do some jam sessions, feel free to DM. For bands, no need to pay me if my vocals are crap. I don't care at this point. I just want to try to sing again and forget that my emotions were played with.
