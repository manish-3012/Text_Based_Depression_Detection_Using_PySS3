Is there something wrong with me? So, at the beginning of the month, my girlfriend broke up with me. And then on Christmas day I end up going on Facebook and I found a girl who used to have a crush on me in middle school that I haven't been in contact with for 6 years and I just started talking to her again, and now I think I'm falling for her.
