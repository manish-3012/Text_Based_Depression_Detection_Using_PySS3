I don't know how to feel so basically, there's a girl, and I never had any feeling for her and just thought she was a very beautiful, good friend. now a few days ago we were at my best friend's house party and we kissed and did some other naughty boy and girl things that night, and I thought that was the end of our short but nice fling, but the next morning when I went home, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and still now I just feel an almost empty, sad feeling like I want to rewind time to just go back to that night, I never felt this way before about her but now Im like deeply attracted to her. Is this normal?
