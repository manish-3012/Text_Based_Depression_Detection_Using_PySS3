Answering the age old question of why dudes get praised for having high body counts while women get slut shamed Itâ€™s a simple answer, for decently attractive women it takes absolutely no effort to get a man, there are so many dudes throwing themselves a lot of the time, especially really pretty girls. it would take no effort to sleep with one of the guys she knows if you are a somewhat attractive girl. 

Men get praised because getting a girl as a man is pretty damn hard, going up to girls and having the confidence to talk to a stranger is pretty impressive when you consider the fact the most girls would be too shy or nervous to go up to a guy, it takes genuine effort and confidence for guys because they are usually the one chasing, it takes actual skill since they usually carry the conversation, etc

Think about it like this, I used to work as a waiter for my first job and we relied on tips, imagine the number of tips representing a body count, there was girl, extremely shy she wouldnâ€™t say anything to the people to make the service better, but she was attractive, people tipped her ALOT of money solely because of her looks and her nice body, me, on the other hand, I was trying me best to never mix up the orders, had engaging conversations, and recommended them foods and drinks they ended up enjoying, I barely got any tips compared to her, even when I did it took way more effort since I had to understand the customers and the type of food they liked a recommended them things.No matter how attractive I am a girl isnâ€™t gonna tip me that much money compared to what the guys are tipping her 

Now imagine I was bragging to my friends about the extra money, they would congratulate me right, of course .since It took the effort to earn those tips, but why would the girls brag about her tips, she isnâ€™t gonna get praised for all those tips because they came easy
