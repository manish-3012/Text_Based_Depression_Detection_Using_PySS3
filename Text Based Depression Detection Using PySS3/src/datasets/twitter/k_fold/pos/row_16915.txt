Get ready for a cringey post but Idc So I have a crush on this girl (my first crush) and itâ€™s driving me up the fucking wall as, to be totally honest, I donâ€™t know her at all, sheâ€™s in a couple lessons so Iâ€™ve started to know here a little better but I was just gonna ask if Iâ€™m beyond hope and should just start moving on ASAP or if there could be a chance...
