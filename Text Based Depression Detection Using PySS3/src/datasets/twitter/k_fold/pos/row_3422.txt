Ask a trans girl about literally anything #42. Also, I'm sorry. If you saw my last two posts, I would just like to say that I'm really sorry for how I acted. It was immature of me and now that I've had a moment to step back and look at my actions, I realized that I was just being stupid. If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me explain.

I had made a post asking ppl if how they would feel if their girlfriend had come out as a trans mtf. A lot of responses said stuff along the lines of them breaking up of how they would break up with her since they aren't gay and that would be dating a man. This made me more than a little upset.

So then I made a  very passive aggressive post saying that trans women are women and that it isn't gay to date them. But then I got a lot of comments that comments that disagreed. At this point I got really pissed so I started responding with WAY too much hostility.

So I'm sorry for the way I acted. I should have just deleted the posts and let it go. But I've backed away from the situation and I'm ready to move past it. 

Anyways, ask a trans girl about literally anything! Idc if it's serious, personal or just random. Ask away!
