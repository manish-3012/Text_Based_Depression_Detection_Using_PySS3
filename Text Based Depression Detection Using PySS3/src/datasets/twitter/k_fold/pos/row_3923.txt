I donâ€™t know where to put this I just wanted to share So there is a girl I like and she is in my first period class. Itâ€™s in a computer lab and because of covid we have to sit every other chair. This morning there was one chair that was not next to someone and it was next to me but instead of sitting in it she just sat next to me. The teacher made other kids move because they were to close but not us. It made my day.
