Blocked on Snapchat? Iâ€™m not sure if this is the place for this, but Iâ€™m not sure where else to post.

Anyways, when youâ€™re blocked by somebody on Snapchat, and you see them mentioned in a story, what does that look like? Does the â€œadd friendâ€ option for them still pop up from the mention or no?
