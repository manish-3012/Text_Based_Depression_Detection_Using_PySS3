This girls being so dramatic So thereâ€™s this new girl who has a huge group of friends. But basically the point is I had a group project with her, but I didnâ€™t know her name. I thought I heard someone say her name so I just called her that. Every time I would say her name she would laugh which made me confused. In gym class we were playing capture the flag, and she started to run towards our flag. I yelled what I thought was her name to warn my team. She then walked up to me and said I was being annoying and to just stop. I was so confused until my friend told me her real name. I said sorry and that I didnâ€™t realize that was her name but she just rolled her eyes and ignored me.
Iâ€™d also like to add that she has made fun of me a lot before this(mostly about my shoes and my height).
