Fortnite isn't bad, it's the fanbase  Now I've played my fair share of Fortnite. It's not great, but it's not bad either. Honestly, I like Fortnite. Its the fanbase that ruins it. It's always annoying little kids on my team when I wanna just play some games in quarantine that yell like Caillou when you can't clutch a 4 v 1. Fortnite's deathruns are fun too, not far from Minecraft's few deathruns. Again, its the annoying little kids that ruin it. They yell about everything. Their mic sounds like they paid someone from Wendys to give them the Drive-Thru mic. Someone ALWAYS intrudes on their gameplay, making them afk. Like literally, I had to play duo alone because some kid had to go eat lunch or dinner, or whatever. It's them that ruin it. Overall, I like Fortnite. I just think it's the fanbase that ruins it for most people.
