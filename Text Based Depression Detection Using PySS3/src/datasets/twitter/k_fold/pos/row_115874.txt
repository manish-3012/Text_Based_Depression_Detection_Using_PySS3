Fuck life Man I hate life and Iâ€™m thinking about offing myself. My parents treat me like shit and when Iâ€™m feeling down tell me Iâ€™m weird for not wanting to socialize with them and that thatâ€™s the cause of why I feel like this. My brother is the youngest and has sense of regret and just makes fun of me all day and Iâ€™m really tired of it. None of my friends respond when I text, hence why Iâ€™m posting to reddit. So that only leaves me with you guys to talk to. I canâ€™t smoke anymore cuz my sister fucking ratted me out and now Iâ€™m really just spiraling downwards. I just donâ€™t wanna live anymore and I canâ€™t tell my parents cuz my sister went through the same shit and my mom threatened to put her in a mental hospital with round the clock surveillance. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I want it to end.
