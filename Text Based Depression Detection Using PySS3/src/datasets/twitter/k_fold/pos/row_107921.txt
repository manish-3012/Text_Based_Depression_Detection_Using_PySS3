I really, really want to go back to school in the fall I hate online learning, it is just a bunch of stupid busy work and you cant spend time with your friends, and there is no motivation for learning. Literally just make  us wear a mask, put hand sanitizer in every room, idk exactly what but there r ways to make it work. I missed my graduation, and that sucked but I just want it all to move on so things can go back to normal.
