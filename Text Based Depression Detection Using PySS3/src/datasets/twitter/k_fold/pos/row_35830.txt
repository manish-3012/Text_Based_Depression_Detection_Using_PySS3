Not proud of my reaction for my weight. I just found out my weight, and let's just say my reaction was *not* the best. 

I started crying and started to panic. 

I'm so fucking scared. I knew I was overweight, but not like 13kg overweight. How on earth did I not start taking precautions?
How did I let myself get to 48.2kg?!


I did start stretching in the mornings, but now I feel like I need more drastic measures. 

I need help. 

Oh my god Reddit, what should I do?
