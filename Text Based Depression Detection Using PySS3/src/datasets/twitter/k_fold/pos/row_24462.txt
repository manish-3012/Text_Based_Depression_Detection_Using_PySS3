So, this will sound weird, but sense a young age, your parents have been comparing you to other kids. Now, it might sound ridiculous, but hear me out. When you were young, and you did something (or started) to do something wrong, your parents would say â€œbig boys donâ€™t *blank*â€. So, even if you think they only just started, theyâ€™ve been doing it for years now, and itâ€™s ridiculous that parents do that. Anyways, thatâ€™s all.
