I'm tired of this year One of my dogs is dying, another died earlier in the year, I've lost a lot of friends, my now ex broke up with me because she thought I cheated on her for some reason and now my cousin was found dead in her apartment. Can one good thing happen to me this year? I want to go back to funny shit not all of this
