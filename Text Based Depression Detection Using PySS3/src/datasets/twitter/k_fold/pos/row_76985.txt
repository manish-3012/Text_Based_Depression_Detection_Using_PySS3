I don't have a crush and I don't know why I'm 14(m) and all my friends have crushes and or girlfriends, yet I don't. I can feel sexual attraction to fit people but I just don't really love somebody. What do I do? I'm happy in life and I told a close friend that I think i should get a girlfriend. I don't really spend much time with girls as friends, I kinda just hang out with the bois so should I hang out with more girls and get to know them?

TL;DR I don't anyone romantically and I don't know why.
