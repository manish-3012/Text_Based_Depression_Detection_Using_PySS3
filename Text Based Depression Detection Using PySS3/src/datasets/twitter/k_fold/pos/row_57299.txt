Iâ€™m in trouble for being homeless So, my dad and I recently lost our house. We are staying with my aunt, but we canâ€™t stay here for long. As you can imagine, Iâ€™m under a lot of stress as I progressively get further behind in school work and donâ€™t have my own room. I feel unwelcome. I vented on Twitter about my situation because I donâ€™t have a therapist or anyone to talk to, and a â€œfamily friendâ€ saw it. We arenâ€™t vocal about the loss of our house, so This family friend thought I was lying because he doesnâ€™t like my political beliefs. So, to â€œteach me a lessonâ€, he called CPS on my dad and I am in trouble.
