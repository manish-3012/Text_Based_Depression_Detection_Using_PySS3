You guys I got a reason to hate Tik-Toc that isn't a r/redditmoment. I actually liked it when it first came out but my school found out about it and all the teachers were making god awful video's amd ASSIGNING us to watch them.

So no, I'm not like other gir- i mean redditors.

I am an omega virgin.
