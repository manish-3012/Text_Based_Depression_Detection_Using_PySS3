The Earth is not a sphere ! Neither is it flat. 

Actually the earth is a computer simulation run by some superior being (or as we call it aliens) which is capable of being run in 6d which means they can interact with it. Turns out they are using our planet as a cricket ball. The reason why the earth spins is cause it's being bowled frequently. And when their bat hits the earth we experience a force we like to call an earthquake ! Thankfully their simulation managed to get a strong magnetic field which resulted in the formation of our atmosphere and we are able to survive all hits !
