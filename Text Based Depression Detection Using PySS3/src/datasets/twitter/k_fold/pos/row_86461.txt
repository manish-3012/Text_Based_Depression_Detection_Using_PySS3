Does anyone else have the stupidest shit disabled on their school chromebooks for no fucking reason? Like when the lid closes, it signs out so you gotta keep the lid open if you're in the middle of something.

Or how the android apps are disabled so you cant install office and open and edit documents that only work with office on your chromebook.

And then I gotta reconnect to wifi everytime it goes to sleep because the auto reconnect to wifi option is off and greyed out.
