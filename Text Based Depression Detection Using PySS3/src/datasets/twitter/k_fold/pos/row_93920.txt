My hamster died They werenâ€™t really my hamsters they were like the familyâ€™s hamsters but this morning we woke up and and one of the hamsters had brutally killed and eaten the other two I have no idea why he had plenty of food it was pointless. I canâ€™t even look at that hamster and I am sad now :(
