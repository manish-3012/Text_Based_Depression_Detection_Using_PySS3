So uh I got colitis recently The surprising thing is, I'm 13. While my mom got it when she was 30.  
My doctor speculates it might've been increased stress and an unhealthy diet, as well as lack of exercise. My grandparents got cured though, so I hope I can recover completely.   
It's not a huge deal, especially since I'm just slightly more affected by things I'm vulnerable to.
