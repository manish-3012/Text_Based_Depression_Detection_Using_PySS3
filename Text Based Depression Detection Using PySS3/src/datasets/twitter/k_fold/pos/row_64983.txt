ITS HAPPENING So 2 weeks from now, Iâ€™m going to go and hangout with a girl who Iâ€™ve been talking too for a while. We send memes to each other a lot and I think sheâ€™s cute, so Iâ€™m very very very nervous. My stomach is turning just thinking about it. How do I ease this anxiety and not completely destroy my chance with her???
