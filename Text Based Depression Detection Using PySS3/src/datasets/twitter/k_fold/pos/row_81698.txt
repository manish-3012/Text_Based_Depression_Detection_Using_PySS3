Iâ€™m so friggin tired of this B.S. Iâ€™ve been in quarantine since March and hardly go out (only like 4-5 times for actual reasons). Why the fuck are people still going out here in the US?! 

Not to sound a bit selfish or anything but Iâ€™ve been sacrificing my mental health a lot and seriously, Iâ€™m literally going hysterical here to the point today I feel like vomiting. Why do people have to go out without masks and post shit like â€œwe at the beachâ€ or â€œhangin outâ€ on their stories on Instagram and snap or anywhere else?! 

Everything I do while stuck at home that entertained me is now plain boring. Just please. Stay inside and donâ€™t be selfish! Wear a mask! Two things some people canâ€™t do 

I apologize in advance if I have made some people upset or angry but honestly, my life has become very depressing with the toxic environment thatâ€™s in my home.
