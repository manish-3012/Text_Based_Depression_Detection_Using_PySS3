I keep getting some texts from a doctor's office So I keep on getting texts from this doctor's office not even in my state and they say that "my daughter has an appointment". I don't have a daughter or any kids. It said say stop to opt out and I said stop and they didn't text me for about a month but I just started getting more yesterday and today. What can I say besides I don't have a kid or live in Mexico to get them to leave me alone. Also I have said they have the incorrec  information but they still text and call me.
