god, i just. FUCK. im really not fucking ok. just seeing a message about someone asking me if im ok makes me start bawling. my mental health is absolute shit.

im constantly thinking about how to kms. what ways to do it. and im always on the edge of doing it. im c-tting myself almost everyday. and it just doesnt hurt anymore. i really want to do it right now but i cant. there are multiple reasons why. 

my fucking parents. itll hurt them but ill know theyll think im trying to escape my punishment and thats just not fucking true. i plan on taking my punishment just fucking fine. i dont care about it.

my friends. my two best friends specifically. i havent talked to them in so damn long. it hurts. it hurts not seeing the two people you care about the most for a long ass time. i dont want luther to get a text from my mom saying i committed s-icide. and then hed have to relay it to parker. that destroy the both of them. luther would end up being fine but parker would probably follow me. and then it would just be a string of s-icides caused by me. and i really dont fucking want that.

i want a future. i want to see what the world has to offer but i also dont. because i know itll be shit. and i dont want to deal with that. 

im honestly just so fucking scared. i want to die but i dont want to hurt anybody. i hate hurting people. i have so many great friends and i love my family. but i dont want to live. its too fucking much for me.
