Crazy Story Iâ€™ll admit one thing before I start: Iâ€™m sort of a player.

Iâ€™m a lesbian in a catholic high school, so it has been a little difficult to find any gays in person, so I have plenty of friends online. 

I was flirting with these two girls, both of which had fallen for me. I had feelings for both of them, but not very strong feelings for one, weâ€™ll call her A. The other girl, though? In love with her. Weâ€™ll call her R.

A (the girl who I didnâ€™t have such strong feelings for) asked me to be her girlfriend, and she was mentally unstable, suicidal, and developing an eating disorder. I felt that if I said no she might feel inclined to hurt herself, so I said yes.

The day after, R, (the girl who I had super strong feelings for) found out that I was in a relationship, and she was really hurt, because she had strong feelings for me, and thought that I had strong feelings for her, which I did. I wouldnâ€™t have said yes to the A if I knew that R had feelings for me. R said that we could still be friends but she needed a few days to distance herself. 

I broke up with A yesterday, and she was okay, so I really need to explain to R that she was the one who I had feelings for the entire time, and that getting with A was purely out of fear that she might hurt herself if I hadnâ€™t.

I really care about R, and it has been a few days. I miss her like crazy. Any advice?
