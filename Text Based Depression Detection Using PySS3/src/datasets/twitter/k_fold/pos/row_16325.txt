There is no box for us to think outside of 
Before you comment anything, hear me out 

Walt once said, 'No! Don't think outside the box! Once you say that, you've established that there is a box.' There is no so called box in our reality, there is only one thing limiting what a human can accomplish, and that thing is time. If given enough time, anything is possible, but since we don't have unlimited time,  generations like ours are very crucial contributers in history. We are already too late to explore the world, but also too early to explore the universe, which is why we need to set the foundation for the future, we probably won't get to see the future unless there is a huge leap in the medicine industry which our life span can be expanded, but my point remains valid. 

Civilization is based on thousand of years of development, and not all the generations can see the outcome, there is always a couple of generations in between, and we are, fortunately or unfortunately one of those,  but it's the awkward generations that contributes the most to the development of human kind, the advance of humanity is only possible because of the accumulated knowledge throughout the thousand of years of generations.

We shouldn't be disappointed in the awkward timing of our existence, we should be proud as we are one of the key contributers to humanity's advancement.

Don't think outside the box, because there is no box to what's possible, the thing we should do, is to spend our time to do what's possible now

This has been on my mind for some days, and it's probably flawed in some ways as I'm like 14, but I'd still love to hear what fellow redditors think. Please don't tell at my English, not a native speaker
