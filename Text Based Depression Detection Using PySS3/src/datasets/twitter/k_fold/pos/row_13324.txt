It has come to my attention I know that this isnt as serious as some of the more recent occurances in this sub, but i want to clarify some things about the topic of FEMINISM!

FEMINISM IS NOT ANTI-MEN
Just like being christian doesnt make you hate jews


The people who say crap like "ALL MEN ARE PIGS" and "TO MAKE UP FOR THE OPRRSSION WE FACED IN THE PAST, MEN SHOULD TAKE A PAYCUT AND WOMEN SHOULD BE PAID MORE" and other typical anti-man sentiments, are called RADICAL-FEMINISTS.



THESE FEMINISTS ARE VASTLEY DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPICAL FEMINIST!!!!

to be a feminist, all you have to do is agree and support the idea that ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL!!! 

I think that the reason why people associate the word "feminism" with the more negative side of it is because of all the media coverage of the more outrageous claims and statements made by radical feminists



Tldr: feminism means you think all people are equal, RADICAL-FEMINISM is where the "Men= Bad" statements come from.



Thanks for reading and have a great day!
