Wholesome rant About 6 moths ago, I started working out to get rid of some stupid love handles and man tits. Today I looked in the mirror and out loud said â€˜oh fuckâ€™ in surprise to how much Iâ€™ve changed. I just want to let anyone know, I believe in your personal journey to becoming healthy. It doesnâ€™t matter if you do 10 mins a day, or 2 hours. You are putting in the fucking work and you deserve everything coming your way
