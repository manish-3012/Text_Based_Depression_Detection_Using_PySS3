Help pls So my a couple of day ago my crush invited me to a "sweet sixteen" (there are only going to be 10 people) I had no idea what this meant so I just assumed it's a normal birthday party and said I would come, turns out it's not a normal birthday party, cuz she just asked me if I am going to sleepover, see the problem is that I want to but idk about my parents cuz she's a girl and you know how parents are, so then I realized that something like this is probably a pretty big deal, now I was just going to give money as a gift but now I'm scared that that going to be a bad gift
