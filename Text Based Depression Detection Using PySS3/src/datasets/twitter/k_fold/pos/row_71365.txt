Uhhh bloody cat at my house A stray cat with blood coming from its ears, a respiratory infection, and eyes filled with puss was sleeping in our shed. My parents arenâ€™t home so a warmed up some leftover meat, got it some cat food, warm water, and warm milk (I know cats are lactose intolerant but this thing looks like it wonâ€™t live much longer so I might as well make it happy) its like 10 degrees outside so I put a blanket on the hay where it was sleeping. Itâ€™s very friendly but I donâ€™t want to pet it because it looks really injured. I already know my parents will either tell me to stop feeding it so it goes away or put it out of itâ€™s misery because the vet is too expensive. Idk I just feel bad for it what should I do
