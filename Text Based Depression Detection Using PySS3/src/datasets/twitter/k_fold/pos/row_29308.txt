Snapchat problems So I'm trying to make a snapchat account, and it's saying that my phone number is already being used for an account, but I don't have one. I changed the password, so hopefully that locked the person out, but I can't "login" because I don't know the email or username associated with it, and I can't login through phone number, so I'm locked out of my account, anybody got some advice?
