I've had enough of this shit why can't I just fucking die I'm not suicidal. I just don't care if I die, I'd someone held a gun to my head is just let them shoot me. I don't care about life anymore. What's even the purpose? My whole life my dad has been a narcissist and my mom a self depricaticating narcissist. All I can fucking remember is them arguing. Especially my mother, I can't stand her. Her whole life is taking small things and making people feel bad for her and when they don't she flips the fuck out and goes nuclear. This shit is unbearable. I can't wait to get my ass out of this fucking house and leave. I've even picked up their bullshit, I snap easily and argue with them all the time. I try to fix it but constantly being around them it's impossible. I don't think I've ever gotten validation for anything and because of that I feel like I can't go to them for anything I can't show them shit I'm proud of. I hope someone breaks into my fucking house, I wouldn't fight back.
