I busted a girl giving me a fake number This happened in freshmen year, back when I was still stupid enough to think i even had a chance. There was this girl i sat next to and i asked for her number, and surprisingly she gave me a number. Once I got it down I noticed that the central office code (the 3 digits after the area code) was invalid. See, your boi knows that the central office code cannot begin with 1 (ex: 555 1xx xxxx).

I asked "ok whats your real number". She doubled down, and I came back saying that the central office code cannot begin with 1. She called me a "fucking nerd" and walked away. Ah well, sucks you dont know how the NANP assigns phone numbers.
