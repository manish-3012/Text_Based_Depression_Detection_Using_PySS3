I am so happy i could cry right now. Thing is, I just got to dress completely like a male, like male cargo pants and a tshirt i had gotten from the men's section. This might seem somewhat insignificant, but as a closeted transboy who's going through really bad dysphoria, THIS HELPED ME SO SO MUCH. I AM SO EUPHORIC. I am getting more confident and will probably ask my parents for a short haircut once its my birthday...i need to gain that confidence slowly, but I'm getting there bit by bit:")

Just a positive vent post coz idk just because.
