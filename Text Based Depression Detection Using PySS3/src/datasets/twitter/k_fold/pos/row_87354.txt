its never going to happen no one is ever going to like me,ive tried a lot,but now i just given up at any hope of being a part of the people here who even got someone to like them,now i just sit in the dark and browse reddit  and play games all day,listening to doomer music from my phone,legit the only light im getting is from my light up mouse and key board,this is not a "sad post",im not karma whoring either,just wanted it to get out there.i might just be 13,but im not going to face the fact when im old and dieing alone
