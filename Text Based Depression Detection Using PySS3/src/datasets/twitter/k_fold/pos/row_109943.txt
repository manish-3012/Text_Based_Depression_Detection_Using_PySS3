Iâ€™m freaking out So my brother is going to get a covid test since he has symptoms 

My dad said that I might not be able to come into school and Iâ€™m freaking out. 

1. I donâ€™t want to get corona. Itâ€™s always been pretty far away from me and Iâ€™ve never considered myself to get it. I know itâ€™s not my brotherâ€™s fault but I really donâ€™t want it.

2. I hated online schooling. I hated it. It tore me apart and made me so badly agoraphobic. Iâ€™m recovering now especially with normal school and I donâ€™t want to go through that process again. 

Iâ€™m panicking I donâ€™t want this to happen, I want it to go away. Please help me Iâ€™m just sitting on my bed crying pathetically about something that might not even happen. I canâ€™t tell any of my friends as no one should know anything unless it comes back positive.
