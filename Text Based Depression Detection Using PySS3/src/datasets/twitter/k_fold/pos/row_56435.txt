Tomorrow Iâ€™m gonna start new. Lately the way my life (and many others) has been going sour. Iâ€™m sleep deprived, I have no motivation, Iâ€™m too lazy to want to do anything, but tomorrow Iâ€™m gonna do my school, go on a walk, look for a new hobby or start a project. Iâ€™m done with all this. 

Iâ€™m slowly deteriorating and it is fucking me up mentally. I canâ€™t keep doing this. Small things, even the small things I do Will help me I feel, I think the main problem is I have to do all this by myself, on my own.
