How tf do boys get to cheat and not be shamed Like Iâ€™m a girl and never cheated but been cheated on and before anyone says â€œoh you deserved itâ€ no I seriously didnâ€™t I gave this boy everything he ever wanted. But if the roles were switched I would of been the slut right? Boys are so lazy to do school work most of the time but got all the time in the world to cheat like does it not take much work how do you have the energy and why are some of you so needy of love? Iâ€™m not angry at men and Iâ€™m definitely not a feminist Iâ€™m just trying to understand.
