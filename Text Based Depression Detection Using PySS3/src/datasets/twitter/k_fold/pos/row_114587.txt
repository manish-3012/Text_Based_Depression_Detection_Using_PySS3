Is it okay for an 18 year old to talk about relationships with a 14 year old? I didn't know this person was 18 until today (they didn't try to hid it, I just didn't know), and they talk to me about their crushes, usually call me by a nickname (i'm not one of their crushes). I got confused and asked if the "liked me", which they told me no and that it would be illegal. Still, i'm just a little confused. Im probably over-reacting, but any feedback is very much appreciated. Thank you.
