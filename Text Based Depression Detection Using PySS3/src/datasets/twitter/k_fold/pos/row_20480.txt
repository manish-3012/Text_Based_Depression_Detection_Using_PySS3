Does anyone else have trouble remember songs they just listened to?  Ok so the strangest thing happened to me while I was thinking of the song Levitating. I couldn't remember it. I was sitting on my couch doing some paper work and thinking "Dang I really liked that one Dua Lipa song I played a million times earlier today" when I realized that I just could not remember the song. I knew the lyrics. But when trying to remember the melody or instrumentals I couldn't think of it.  I was listening to some other songs for the first time too at the same time, but I could remember those just fine. And every time I came close my mind either went blank or twisted it into a different song. Is there a word for this?
