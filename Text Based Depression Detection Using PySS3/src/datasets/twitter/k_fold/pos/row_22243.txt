K need help bois So I've got a problem about my crush, which is that I don't necessarily need to start a relationship with her, as being good friends with her is already good enough (I'm also not looking for a relationship), but I want to take her out to the valentine's dance, but the problem is that one of my good friends used to date, her and it was pretty recent, like a month ago they broke up, it wasn't a long relationship either, it was only about 1-2 months. Should I ask her out? Or will I fuck up my friendship with my friend? (MY crush broke up with my friend, but my friend wanted to keep on going.)
