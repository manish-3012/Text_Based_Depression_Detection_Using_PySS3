I cannot believe this!!!! Ok so I started smoking weed at 12 (Iâ€™m 15) and Iâ€™ve only been caught one time. And my mom never knew I smoked after she caught me. And when she caught me I lied to her about how I got the weed and how long I was smoking. But today I had the motivation to talk to her, I donâ€™t like sharing my feelings to people but today I just had the courage. So when I got off the bus, I cleaned the house, did the dishes and a bunch of stuff I usually do not do because I wanted to kinda make her have some gratitude. So she came home and I told her that we had to talk, we sat down and I explained to her that my grades have always been good, Iâ€™ve never gotten into big trouble, Iâ€™m responsible and respectful, so I asked her why she dosnt want me smoking weed. After talking back and fourth, we came to the conclusion that I can smoke but only outside and that she wants me to stop buying from my dealer and she will take my money and go to a dispensary. This did not go the way I expected it too but Iâ€™m excited
