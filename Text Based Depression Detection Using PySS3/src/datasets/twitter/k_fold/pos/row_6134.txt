Putting my sister over my crush So... I have a crush on one of my twin sisterâ€™s close friends, I havenâ€™t told her yet, but I donâ€™t even need to tell her for me to know that she wonâ€™t like it. She has repeatedly told me that it would be the most awkward thing in the world for her if I were to date one of her friends. Not only that, but I donâ€™t want to be the reason a friendship was torn apart over me. And so, Iâ€™m going to put my sisters feelings over mine. Family relationships are the most important relationship. Maybe one day I will ask my crush out... but it will take a long time
