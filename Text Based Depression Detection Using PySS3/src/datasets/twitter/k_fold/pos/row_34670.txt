I need some help fellow redditors Hi, I'm the guy from [my good boy died](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/iaa72c/my_good_boy_died/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)" post, as you may know I don't really know the real reason his dead but something really weird happen last day
Spike my dog that passed away was one of 5 puppies, we only keep Spike I gift the other ones to my friends, here comes the weird thing, 3 of his brothers died the same way, nobody know why this happen, one died a month ago, another one died recently like mine, this is something genetic? Something from his parents? A genetic disease?
Idk, I hope that his 2 remaining brothers survive
