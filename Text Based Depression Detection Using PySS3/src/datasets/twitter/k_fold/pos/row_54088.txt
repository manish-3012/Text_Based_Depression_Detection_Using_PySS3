I'm really confused So basically, my girl best friend has been extremely strange with me recently, when we've had plans, she has made excuses and canceled and when I've been having like full blown serious conversations with her over text, she like, leaves me on read at a random point and then never talks about it again, like as if the conversation never happened, but she frequently approaches me at school and stuff and is very friendly with me as usual, she also goes out of her way to talk to me, I'm not interested in her as a crush or anything, but, like it's really fucking with my head, does anyone know what this could possibly mean, if anything
