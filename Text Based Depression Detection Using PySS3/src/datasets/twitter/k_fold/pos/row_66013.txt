Weird stuff that happened to me as a kid. 1. I remember growing up with a single mother who looks completely different to the one I have now
2. I saw reality was made of multicolored blood cell like beings who traveled around like schools of fish, I could talk to them and control them
3. I saw 2 dimensional shadow beings that I played with 
4. I saw massive hands on the walls and on my bed that scared me
5. when i tried to sleep I could see weird arms with more than 3 joints in them that tried to grab me.
6. I got presents that my parents didn't remember getting me
7. there was this time I hit my head really hard and I remember being driven through an infinite carpark with yellow streetlights as far as the eye could see

I don't see any of that stuff anymore but i'm pretty perplexed as to what was going on, i know you guys are all teenagers and you probably won't know either but I just thought it was interesting.
