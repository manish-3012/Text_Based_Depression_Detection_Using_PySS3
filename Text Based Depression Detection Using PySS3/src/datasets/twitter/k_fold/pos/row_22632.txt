Ask your crush out One of my biggest regret is that i never tell my crush that i loved her. Please, if you really love someone, tell her (or him). 

I know it sounds dumb, but you never know if you will be friends in 1 mouth, 1 years or in 5 years.

Don't stop yourself just because you want to maintain your relationship, because you don't even know if it will last. 

It has been 5 years now since i lost contact with her, and i just wish she knew that i loved her.
