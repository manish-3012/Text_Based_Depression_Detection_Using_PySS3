UGHHHHH I WANTED TO READ A SPECIFIC MANGA BUT I FORGOT WHAT IT IS AND NOW I JUST REALLY WANNA READ IT BUT IDK WHAT IT IS maybe I should just read hanako kun again 

Iâ€™ve read it before and really liked it but itâ€™s really annoying how much time it takes them to post a new chapter 


^also ^if ^i ^see ^one ^more ^among ^us ^or ^a ^crush ^post ^I ^will ^try ^drawing ^a ^realistic ^frog ^out ^of ^pure ^fucking ^rage
