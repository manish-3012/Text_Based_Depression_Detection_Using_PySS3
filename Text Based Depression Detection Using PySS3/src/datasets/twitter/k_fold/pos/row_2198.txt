I find life to be harder since I havenâ€™t been in love with someone. Has anyone felt this way before? This is new to me. Even though Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, throughout my life Iâ€™ve always had a different crush in mind, that I also eventually phase out of and then I find a new crush to imagine myself with. Not sure if itâ€™s healthy, but thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve always lived. Now I havenâ€™t had anyone to crush on and I feel really unmotivated to do anything. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore when listening to music, watching movies, or playing video games. I feel empty in a way. I donâ€™t feel motivated to better myself in any way anymore. I havenâ€™t been exercising at all, just sitting all day and being very unproductive, eating just enough to get by. I donâ€™t know why I feel this way. If itâ€™s because I donâ€™t have a crush or what. Fuck it all.
