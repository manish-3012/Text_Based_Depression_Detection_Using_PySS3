I got to stay home from school today I convinced my mom to let me stay stay home from school today because my shin really hurt and I couldn't do PE or volleyball which are the only things I enjoy at school. She asked me if I was gonna take any pills (I have attempted with them before), I'm not even allowed to have ibeprofen in the same room as me. I stayed home because of my shin. With no otc painkillers. How am I supposed to take pills. Lmao
