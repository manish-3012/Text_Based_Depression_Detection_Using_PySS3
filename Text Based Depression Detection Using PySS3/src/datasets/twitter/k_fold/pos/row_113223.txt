I accidentally let 4 Girls fall in love to me I'm not really attractive just a bit I guess, It was 9th grade I was a transferree. My mother told me to be nice always and be good, I actually did that. Im an introvert and a good listener something like that.

Its a pretty long story but I'll make it short.

I listened to their problems, being friends with them, I was good company to them, I made good advice, I went to their birthdays blah blah blah now 4 girls are after me.... Which is uncomfortable, I started seeing love letters on my locker, my bag, my chair or anything.

I actually ignored to them its pretty annoying. And now they are chasing me like never before.
