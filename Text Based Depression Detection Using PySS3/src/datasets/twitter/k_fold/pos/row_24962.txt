Am I the only teen who has nice parents and no anxiety or depression      It seems everyone on this sub is looking for help because theyâ€™re depressed which I think is nice because itâ€™s like this sub is a family of strangers to some. I feel so bad for everyone who has to go through this and literally canâ€™t relate or help in any way. I also notice most teenagers I know are having problems with parents or just a nervous train reck. Iâ€™m sorry a lot of you have to go through this. Good luck. Fight through it, youâ€™ll make it.
