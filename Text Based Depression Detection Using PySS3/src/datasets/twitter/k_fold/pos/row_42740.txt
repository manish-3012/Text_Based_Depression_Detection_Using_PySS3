Do people ever stand disrespectfully close to you or get in your space before/during class? As iâ€™m typing this there are 3 girls standing really close to me having a loud conversation about a fight or something 

now theyâ€™re talking by about wanting to get high after midterms 

now theyâ€™re talking about a fight happening at someoneâ€™s house

Wtf theyâ€™re on all sides of me now

Why tf you gotta be so close to me? Go to your fucking desk to talk not literally swarming mine. Not my fault for eavesdropping in your conversation when I literally canâ€™t not listen.
