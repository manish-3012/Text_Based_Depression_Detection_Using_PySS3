how far do you guys push your toothbrush down your throat/mouth when brushing your teeth? like unfortunately, i get a bad smell in my mouth really fucking fast (even after brushing my teeth), which im infinitely insecure of, so in order to extend the "good smell in my mouth" a bit further in time i kind of push my toothbrush dowm to that tingly thing back in my throat, kind of brushing the sides of the start of my throat and the back of my tongue (like where your tongue starts)

and actually its kinda working lol cuz back when i only brushed my teeth and the tip of my mouth, it was still smelly, so i suspected that the smell must be coming from back there, which turns out it actually is! 

i also started using listerine (you know the mouthwash) which also seems to have helped a bit

(but despite these, i still get bad breath pretty fast, but at least theres been some improvement)

so yeah wby guys
