December sucks the big one I'm just gonna narrow it down because I know people don't like reading long posts but the entire month of December sucks for me. No other month affects me the way December does at all. December reminds me of my Grandpa who was born on Christmas Eve and died in 2014, a year ago I lost a friend who I've known since I was 2, it also reminds me that I lost an almost 1 year old baby cousin so yeah December and 2020 can go fuck itself.
