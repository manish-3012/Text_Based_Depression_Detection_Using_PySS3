If a see a post and find out midway it's about their grandpa or grandma being nice, I immediately stop reading it. It's because I never had a grandparent and it makes me jealous. Sorry for being jealous, but I never had a grandparent and I would really love to have one. Also, I used to read a lot of grandparent posts but then it made me feel sad that I never had one. So, I quit. 

Sorry y'all.
