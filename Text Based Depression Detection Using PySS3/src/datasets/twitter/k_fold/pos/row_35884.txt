i hate when teachers dont call on you when you actually want to answer something 50% of my spanish grade is from participating in class, but my teacher never calls on me when i actually DO wanna answer. Then she says "oH yOU nEVER uNmuTE". I am currently failing spanish because of this. 

Teachers if you are reading this, PLEASE dont do this.
