I THOUGHT SOMEONE BROKE INTO MY HOUSE Dude my heart rate is so fucking high rn. So hereâ€™s what happened: so I woke up at 2 am randomly . I go back to my room and start playing some Among Us cuz i was having trouble sleeping. So two hours later I hear this LOUD ASS SLAMMING NOISE, and my heart rate went up in an instant. I hear my mom yell what was that. So I run into my parents room, and I say  â€œ I think someone is breaking inâ€. And we all just stand there for a minute listening for more noise, and nothing happens. So we start looking around to see what happened. So I look in the bathroom and THE FUCKING MIRROR ON THE WALL HAD FALLEN. Like bro I was trying to vibe and play some Among Us and the mirror has to make me almost go into cardiac arrest. 
So how has your morning been
