Imagine this: imagine being in the middle of the sucluded woods high up, in a cabin, overlooking the beautiful scenery with a lake in the distance, but also its either raining or snowing, and you are staring out the window form your cabin, adorable furnished traditionally, but modern. The lovely smell of the cabin and you're sitting on an extremely comfortable couch, staring out the window at the scenery, while listening to old records from your player, and theres a lovely fireplace a bit off to the side keeping you warm. And finally, snuggled on the couch, if the softest blankets, you and your significant other are just peaceful and happy and content.
