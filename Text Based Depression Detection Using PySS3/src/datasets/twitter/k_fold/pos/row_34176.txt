I just got tested positive for Covid and Iâ€™m terrified The title says it all. I got tested for Covid and it came back positive. The thing Iâ€™m terrified about is it I spread it to my friends at school. My school has been hybrid since the start of the year, with only a few cases popping up here and there but they were virtual. I was in school the day before I got tested, which means I could have easily spread it to my classmates. Anyways, remember to stay safe.
