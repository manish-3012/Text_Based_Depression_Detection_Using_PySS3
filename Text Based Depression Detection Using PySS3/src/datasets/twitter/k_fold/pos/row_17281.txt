Day 1 of trying to slow down on video games What made me start this is my tv overheated and the screen went all weird, i'm taking this as a sign i should slow down, i'll be trying making these posts to help pass some time maybe, nothing much is happening yet, i'll be slowing to 1 hour a day (usually played all day) wish me luck!
