Hey lads! Can I get some help from y'all? So.. I have a girl friend (important, not girlfriend). We talk to each other since around this year's March. We talk to each other every day, or if one of us is let's just say.. too busy, we still text at least a goodnight or a goodmorning. Every single day. But after the school started, oc the calls were pushed into the background, and these texts are getting drier and drier. Ngl I'm into her and I'm really worried. I wanna impress her somehow, I'd do literally anything. The only barrier is 230 km between us. I thought this is a place where I can get some help with this. I tried simply giving compliments while ofcourse not getting carried away, only little/pretty ones but they were just simply ignored like... They were always related to some topic we discussed before or so on, but she just continued the discussion itself, or changed the topic ( which's I think can be related to the fact she got it and slipped over it wittingly ). Soo hope I can reach out for some assistance here about what should I do.  


Have a good day y'all!
