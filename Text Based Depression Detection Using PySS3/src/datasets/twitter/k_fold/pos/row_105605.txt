Random thought I had today, so do guys actually like girls with small boobs more? Or is that just something you say? Iâ€™ll delete this in a bit so just leave your thoughts below for research purposes 

Just out of curiosity, Ive seen this talked about a lot by some guy friends I have, or just dudes in general. Ive always just thought it made me look like a 12 year old boy who hasnt hit puberty, and have never liked the way I looked but apparently you guys like that?

My brain tells me itâ€™s because men are attracted to girls that are more, how do you say it I forgot the word uhhhh â€˜less matureâ€™ (if anyone can remind me of the word that would be very cool because I genuinely cannot remember it right now) but I dont know, just wondering

Please dont be weird and DM to see my boobs this is a genuine question lmao
