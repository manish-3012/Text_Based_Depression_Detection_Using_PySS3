Iâ€™m seriously so tired of this god forsaken sub    Earlier I read something about a girls dad going through 2 heart attacks and 3 cardiac arrests and cancer. This sounds like something he would probably experience, in a life time. Op said they beat cancer, during that summer. Not only is this completely impossible, but itâ€™s super immoral to do that for fake internet points. 
    This sub is built on fake stories, just scroll down, sure enough, you will find one eventually. I hate to sound like the shadow man, but why do you do the things that you do?
