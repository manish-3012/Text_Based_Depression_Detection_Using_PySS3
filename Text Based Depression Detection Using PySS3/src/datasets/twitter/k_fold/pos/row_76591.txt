Damn, I'm not surprised... This girl I'm friends with and I were talking about how Tinder's going for both of us last night since we're both using it. Well, it's not going great for me, I've gotten one match (a bot) and one like. Them she says, "TBH I have like 300 likes." Jesus Christ, that's a lot. It's not surprising at all though honestly.
