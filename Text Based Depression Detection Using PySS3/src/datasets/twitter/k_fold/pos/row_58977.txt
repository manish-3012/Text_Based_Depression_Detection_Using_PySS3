My crush is sleeping while weâ€™re video calling Guys Iâ€™m so happy! I was video calling my best friend in the entire world and the girl I love with all my heart, and we was tired decided to go to sleep while in the call. The fact that she trusts me this much that she feels that she can do that means so much! 
Iâ€™ve stayed in the call and am still in it, sheâ€™s been asleep for over an hour and Iâ€™ve singing her favorite songs and a lullaby my mom used to sing to me to her. 
It sounds like sheâ€™s sleeping very soundly, there isnâ€™t any light, so her side is blank, but I can hear her. I can hear when she turns and shifts in her sleep, and at points I can hear when she breaths.
Iâ€™m gonna marry her. I love her so much. Guys, sheâ€™s the greatest. I would die for her. 
She has feelings for me as well, but sheâ€™s not in a place to be in a relationship right now, and I respect that. 

Thanks for reading, Iâ€™m just so happy, I donâ€™t even care that itâ€™s literally 4:40 right now.
You guys are awesome!

Also sorry if my formatting is pretty crap, Iâ€™m on mobile.
