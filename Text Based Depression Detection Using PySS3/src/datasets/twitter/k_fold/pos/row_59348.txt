Umm hypothetical question So letâ€™s say you cave in and download tiktok, you donâ€™t make an account because you are just there to browse. (Hypothetically of course) and then all of a sudden the is STRAIGHT UP (hypothetical) CP. Despite being disturbed you decided to still scroll the app every now and then because there is some funny stuff. but the TWO MORE RANDOM CHILD PORN POSTS IN ONE DAY.

Could I get (hypothetically) in trouble for that?
