Is anyone else getting this?? I'm on a laptop and I tried opening chat but it just closed itself and when I tried turning the whole tab into chat it loaded and then the tab went white. I don't know if this is happening to anyone else or just me but can someone pleease help!?!

I even tried opening it on my other laptop and it still didn't work.
