Thinking abt my cringy 10th grade relationship lmao I would say â€œI love youâ€ to him and felt so repulsed afterward and I was just hella uncomfortable the entire time but I thought everyone felt like that and soldiered thru it but turns out I am aromantic. In this essay I will 

Ok but seriously I did have a soft spot for him like I loved being close friends and having all those inside jokes and such but romance and all that jazz is just not my scene it grosses me out I get so uncomfy tee hee

We r still kindaaaa friends now (eh that statement itself is a bit of a stretch bc a LOT happened) but Iâ€™m tired of his childish games so he got *clap* *clap* cut off like I literally donâ€™t speak to him but he somehow found me on social media a while back and we r mutuals on there except I have all his stuff muted cuz I donâ€™t rly care abt him that much anymore but yeah quick history lesson nobody asked for :)
