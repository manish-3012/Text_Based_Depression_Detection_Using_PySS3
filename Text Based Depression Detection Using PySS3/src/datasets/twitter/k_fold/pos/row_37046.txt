My P.E/gymnastics teacher wants us to do a TikTok dance and send it to him. So weâ€™ve had school from home for a few weeks now and my p.e teacher wants us to dance, record it and then send it to him. And mind you, he is gonna set a grade on it. Like wasnâ€™t it bad enough we had to work out in front of a camera? Now we also have to do a TikTok dance and record ourselves. What kind of horrible human being would force someone else to do that?

What the hell should I do? I donâ€™t want to get bad grades but I sure as hell donâ€™t want to dance in front of a camera either.
