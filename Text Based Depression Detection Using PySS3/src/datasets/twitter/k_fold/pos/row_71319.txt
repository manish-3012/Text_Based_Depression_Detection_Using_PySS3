I'm going to stop drinking milk It's not that I'm lactose intolerant or don't like it, it's just that the milk industries are quite cruel, and it contributes to 3% of greenhouse emissions (for reference, it's more than all airplanes combined)

Also, I don't need to drink milk to be healthy, so why not stop drinking it if it's good for the animal welfare and the planet?

[PS: by milk I also mean dairy products]
