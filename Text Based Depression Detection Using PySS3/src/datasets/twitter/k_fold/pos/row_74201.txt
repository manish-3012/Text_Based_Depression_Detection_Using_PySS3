I just wasted 3 whole days on editing 3 minutes and I got bad grades I'm disappointed and my day is ruined. I've always wanted to edit and make memes, but I've never had a good pc and free time. Also, I did a mini-comic and the whole class said my work was the best. And I got bad grades for that. She said my work is the worst and it isn't the best representation of a Hamlet. I just can't believe I've spent so much time on that and didn't waste it on free time. Also, I'm going to get a bad grade tomorrow since I have an physics exam and I didn't have the time to study it SINCE I HAD TO WORK ON THIS FUCKING ASSIGNMENT.
