people really believe heterophobia exists huh i saw a meme that was that scene in love, simon where a kid comes out as straight (idk i havn't seen the movie) and people were saying it was heterophobic

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone seriously experienced heterophobia? Have you been hated for centuries for no reason? Can you die because of being straight?
