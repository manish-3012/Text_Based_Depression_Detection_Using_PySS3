are guys really just that simple? hi guys, woman here, trying to figure out what goes on inside of the male head. 

how do you guys express how you like someone? is it just a waiting game? is being called a friend by a guy the same way a girl calls someone a friend?

i have many questions, but please throw some facts at me before i start psychoanalyzing everything ðŸ˜©
