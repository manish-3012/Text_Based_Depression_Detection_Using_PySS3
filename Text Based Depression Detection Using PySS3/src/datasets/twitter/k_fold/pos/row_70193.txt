I admit it, iâ€™m gay I need help because as the title says im now revealing im gay, im really scared because my grandma basically wants to kill all gay people and my dad doesnâ€™t like them in general. Only person that would barely accept me would be my mom. I hope at least this sub accepts me and they can help me with this situation cause i really never thought i would be facing this.
