Does anyone else do this? Sometimes when you get a scrape it gets all sticky and then you go to sleep or put a long shirt on and then you get cotton stuck on it and then it scabs over and then cotton because embedded in your skin and then I peel off the cotton from my shirt or sheets and then i eat it..
