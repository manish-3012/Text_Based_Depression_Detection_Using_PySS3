My best friend might be leaving me My best friend and I had a fight on WhatsApp this afternoon, she was really mad and I was too. But I just left my phone for some while, so we could think about it. She messaged me that I was a mean bitch, that she didnâ€™t even do anything, that I was childish, that I had to wake up and she was never going to forgive me and such things. After reading, it actually didnâ€™t piss me off, it more broke my heart. I actually thought this would be the end of our friendship, so I texted her kind of things like please donâ€™t let our friendship end like this, I love you, donâ€™t leave me, that sort of things. She said she was going to think about it. I send her some more things but sheâ€™s not responding. I dunno what to do. I asked her why she wasnâ€™t responding and if I should just leave her to be for some time, but she didnâ€™t respond to that too. I really donâ€™t know what to do, guys. If she leaves me my life would crack, I would seriously rip my heart out, I love her so much. The fight was about nothing, practically. I just I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even saying this here but I have no idea what else to do.
