I'm not even joking or exaggerating I seriously want to move out of America It literally is not safe or enjoyable at all to be here. There's way too many details about why, but especially being trans I feel like I don't belong here. 

Right now I'm thinking about Australia it seems so much better. Cause Canada is too fucking cold, I would rather live in extreme heat than anywhere that snows. And yeah idk where else, has to be mostly English speaking, and not the fucking UK im not tryna have less rights.
