Maybe I take it way too personally But you all throw shit on this Carson dude sexting 17-yr old girl like he is some kind of pedo. It's only 2 years difference and it were only Discord messages and from what I saw he didn't pressure her or anything, he was just really horny and who isn't from time to time. It makes me sick they you call him pedo or groomer because it devalues these words and if he is pedo then I'm too because I'm in relationship with 16yr. You can now throw shit at me
