Teen needing some relationship advice Hey fellow teens Iâ€™ve liked this girl for almost 4 years and after all this time Iâ€™m finally at the stage of being completely ignored and blocked which is really sucky. I donâ€™t wanna move on but I know itâ€™s for the best, do you guys have any tips on how to move on in a way where Iâ€™m not still gonna have feelings for her later down the track 
Thanks ðŸ‘
