Making a Diary like thing on Reddit 237 So, i had PE for most of my school day. First 2 hours, and one hour of math and then back to 2 hours of PE. I could have had 2 more, but i was done quickly. I had some Strange presentations of PE for the first two, and played some football golf in the last 2. I hated it, it was so annoying. It doesn't help that i hate golf already. It is such an annoying thing to Play, my parents ruined it. I dont want to go into further depth there.

Anyways, when i got home, i did not do much. But i did manage to get my parents to buy Disney+. So that means i can finally watch the clone wars. Yay.

See ya tomorrow.
