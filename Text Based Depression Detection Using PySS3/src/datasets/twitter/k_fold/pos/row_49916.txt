Agsshdasgdw my mental health is so fucking pisspoor that I'm fucking losing it over dropping a mug in a sink and breaking it Hgguqwrf how fucking weak and pathetic do I have to be to be throwing a fucking tantrum over a mug and fucking complaining on reddit of all places. Thank you, distant parents, for raising me so fucking well. Parents are just the greatest and are always perfect aren't they??!!!!! Ny
