iâ€™m playing for both teams so i like this girl, buy i also like this boy. iâ€™m a girl and iâ€™m bi and i like two people, iâ€™ve already told the boy i like him and he said he feels the same but we having talked about it since and we didnâ€™t do anything about it, itâ€™s been about 2 weeks. and the girl and i really get on and now iâ€™m thinking sheâ€™s the way to go forward ( sheâ€™s bi too) but i feel so bad because iâ€™ve already told the boy i like him and i still do, that the fuck am i supposed to do i feel like such a prick.
