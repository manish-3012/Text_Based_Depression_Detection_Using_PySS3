I donâ€™t know where else to post about this. my family situation has been shit lately my parents have gotten divorced.
my parents have different sides of stories of everything thatâ€™s happening and
my brother is a fucking piece of shit in ways you canâ€™t even imagine, I fucking hate him.
itâ€™s hard to trust my parents at this rate and I love my parents both very much but itâ€™s just hard. 
and honestly itâ€™s probably taken a toll on my mental health.
Itâ€™s just hard for me to be happy it seems the only people are my few friends, cousin and sister and I donâ€™t like talking to my friends because either they donâ€™t take it seriously or I just feel weird like I feel stupid.
