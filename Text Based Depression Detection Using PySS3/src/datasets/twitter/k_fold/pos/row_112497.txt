Help me decide, please. idk what to do about it some background info here

So yesterday me and my stupid classmates got into a violent dispute over a meme (they literally don't care about others sharing memes, but I got yeeted out of the class chat for sharing an oof meme. how nice of them). Needless to say, now I am alone in this hellhole of a class.

Also we have that secret santa event going on, in which I decided to take part a week ago. Grave mistake. 

I GOT PAIRED WITH THE SAME GUY WHO YEETED ME OUT. OH GOD.

Neither was I lucky, nor ambitious, and never will be. But I see this as a chance to clear all the misunderstandings.

So, do I behave like an asshole here and say "You ain't getting anything from me" or just give him a fucking present and let it pass? You decide.
