I fucking hate my life My friends who never go out especially now decided to go out today. So I asked my parents if I can go my dad said yes no problem. But he had to tell my mom and she freaked out about how she â€œtrustsâ€ me but wonâ€™t let me do jack shit. This is so dumb. The one time I go out to see my friends I barely see.
