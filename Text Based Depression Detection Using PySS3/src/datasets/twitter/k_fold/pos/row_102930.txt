I react with my dick to pretty much anything? So recently pretty much out of nowhere my dick has become very sensitive it's almost like it's in a mode of "ready" all the time, any sound or sudden movement makes it sort of react and vibrate its hard to explain really but i think you get it. Kind of frightening it could become erect almost anywhere, what should i do?
