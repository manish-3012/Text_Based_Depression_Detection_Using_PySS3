I need help My mother is constantly shaming me and yelling at me for not wanting to do certain things she tries to force on me.

Earlier today she screamed at me calling me a lazy piece of shit attached to my phone because I felt like I wasn't up to the two mile run she forces me to do every day. I tried to explain that it was Friday, and the day after my first soccer practice in a year. Needless to say I was pretty sore and tired from school.

My mom also yelled at me for not wanting to ski this weekend, as I had skied the past three weekends and it is 70 degrees out, so the conditions would be terrible.

I do not feel like I am in the wrong in this situation for wanting free time and rest. If I am please let me know. If anyone has some advice for this type of situation please send it my way.
