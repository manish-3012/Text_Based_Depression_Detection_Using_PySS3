I need advice So, I want to take my girlfriend on a date (yes i know Iâ€™m lucky) and sheâ€™s such a wonderful person, that I need to ask you (girls mostly). I donâ€™t know where I should take her to, the movies is the classic go to and I can afford, the park is fun and relaxing, but other than that Iâ€™m not sure what else. So Iâ€™m asking you guys out there if you guys could give me some ideas as to where I should take her. Can be anywhere really, Iâ€™m not sure,
