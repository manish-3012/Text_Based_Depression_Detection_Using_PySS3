I need your lots advice ðŸ§ on something. I started my own YouTube channel. It over a week old. I have about two-hundred and fifty views (between four videos), and sixteen subscribers. Do not get me wrong. That is a fuck ton. I did not think I get that far.

All of my videos thus far have been guide videos about Fallout. Because of that, I post links to them in the Fallout subreddits. About fifty percent of my views (it tells me) have came from Reddit. Thatâ€™s a lot.

I want to make game-play commentaries. I have a few recorded - of me and my friends. However, I am scared ðŸ˜¦ that people wonâ€™t watch them. I canâ€™t post them anywhere as they arenâ€™t like guides - they are just gameplay videos. 

Dont get me wrong, itâ€™s not about the views. I fucking love creating videos. Itâ€™s so much fun. Iâ€™m not even joking. At first I didnâ€™t care, buts itâ€™s like cocaine. Not that I know what cocaine is, but you get the point.

What do you think I should do? How should I get them out and about?

Sorry about any punctual mistakes. Itâ€™s two in the morning. I usually donâ€™t stay up this late.
