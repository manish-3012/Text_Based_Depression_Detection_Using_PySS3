Idrk what this post is about, just need to vent about all my weird thoughts today. Idk, like It felt like yesterday I was with my best friend and we were in elementary school just goofing off and doin stupid stuff, but it felt like all that just went by so fast. Like we're in highschool now and it's just weird. This thought hit me when he came up to me and showed me his car that he just got. And I was just thinking like, holy cow, were getting older, like I said I don't know what this post is about really so it may seem jumbled. 


And not only that but I've got see all my peers grow up around me and change into different people. It feels like I'm having a midlife crisis and I'm only in highschool. People are making plans about what there gonna do after highschool and I still have no idea what I'm gonna do. Like life is just kinda going and it's just... Idk. 

I'm not sure about college or even if I'm going to college, I guess I'll just have to go with the flow kinda deal. And it's not like I'm depressed or anything, I have a great life and amazing friends, it's just when I think about life in a bigger frame of view I just get lost. Anyways I'm gonna stop ranting now, thanks for reading if you made it threw this weird post, haha.
