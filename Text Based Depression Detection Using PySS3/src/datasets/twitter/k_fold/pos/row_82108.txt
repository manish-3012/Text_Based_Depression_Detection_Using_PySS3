Bruh how do you deal with loneliness Bruh how do you deal with loneliness

Iâ€™ve got some friends, but weâ€™ve been friends for so long and we like only interact online through video games.... the only female friend I had stopped talking to me like a year ago too.



And now Iâ€™ve got a crush on this girl who I barely know, and sheâ€™s nice but I just canâ€™t start convos and because of online learning I canâ€™t see her or talk to anyone in person and I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point.. any advice would really be appreciated
