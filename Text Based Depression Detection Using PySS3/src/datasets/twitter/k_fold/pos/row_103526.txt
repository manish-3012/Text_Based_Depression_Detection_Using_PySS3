I made a poem about dogs! I hope you guys like it. &gt;!Hello friend!!&lt;
&gt;!You smell so good,!&lt;
&gt;!The family I have!&lt;
&gt;!Protect I should!&lt;

&gt;!Pat my back!!&lt;
&gt;!My golden features!&lt;
&gt;!I love you so!&lt;
&gt;!I am your creature!&lt;

&gt;!I am your pal!!&lt;
&gt;!My coat is graying!&lt;
&gt;!But it doesnâ€™t matter!&lt;
&gt;!My tail is swaying!&lt;

&gt;!You love me too,!&lt;
&gt;!But you wear sorrow!&lt;
&gt;!Donâ€™t worry, pal!&lt;
&gt;!Iâ€™ll always follow!&lt;

&gt;!Im getting older,!&lt;
&gt;!My friend forever, !&lt;
&gt;!But this bond will never sever!&lt;

&gt;!My life was filled with joy!&lt;
&gt;!From you and others,!&lt;
&gt;!In our time together, we were brothers!&lt;

&gt;!I may not be here!&lt;
&gt;!In flesh and blood!&lt;
&gt;!But never forget, I am your bud!&lt;

&gt;!Now let me rest,!&lt;
&gt;!My time is over!&lt;

&gt;!I love you so,!&lt;
&gt;!Eternal brother!&lt;
