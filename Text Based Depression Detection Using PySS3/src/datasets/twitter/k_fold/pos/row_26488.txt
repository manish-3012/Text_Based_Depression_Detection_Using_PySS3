My Dad wants me to go to my Aunt's even though I'm sick My Dad goes to my Aunt's every Saturday and has started taking me. I'm fine with going sometimes but  I've been ill since yesterday and couldn't go to school- I have a sore throat, I feel like I'm going to throw up and have been coughing, blowing my nose and coughing mucus up endlessly. My Dad knows this but still expects me to go to see my aunt and grandma today?? He didn't even mention the fact I'm sick when he told me. How do I stop him from making me go out today?
