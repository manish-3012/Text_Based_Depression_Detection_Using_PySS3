Lethargic and sad. I loath waking up everyday. I loath that stupid building and everyone inside of it. The students are annoying and rude. I loath hearing that stupid dog barke everyday. I loath seeing my sister. I miss my friends from my old school. I've been at this new school for a motng and a half and i still cant stand it. I miss my old friends. And my online friends have slowly stopped messaging me. I miss my friends.
