Anyone here have advice for preventing missing assignments and procrastination? Over the last few years Iâ€™ve been having trouble with missing assignments. Last year I had 20 of them in my first trimester of school and This year Iâ€™ve had around 13 total. Most of them have been caused by either me deciding not to do something because I found it difficult or confusing, or me procrastinating until I forget about it. My parents have tried to help by providing an  incentive (a $200 lego set if I didnâ€™t get any missing assignments all year) and it didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™ve gotten better at asking for help when I need it but Iâ€™ve found it a lot more difficult to stop procrastinating. If thereâ€™s anyone here whoâ€™s been able to stop procrastinating, do you have any advice for me, and anyone else who might be in a similar situation?
