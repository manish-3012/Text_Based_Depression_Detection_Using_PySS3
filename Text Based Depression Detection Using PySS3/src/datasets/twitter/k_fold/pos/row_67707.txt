I wish I could go back to highschool I was class of 2020, I left normal school for homeschooling halfway through sophomore year cuz I always missed class and didnâ€™t have many friends. I wish I was the person I am now back then, and realized that all these â€œpopularâ€ kids are just confident dumbasses. I didnâ€™t do shit throughout highschool so Iâ€™m kinda bumming on that. Never got to go to prom or got a gf, went to a few actual parties but I was too awk to talk to people. 

Now life is just hitting harder and harder, Iâ€™m trying to get my shit together, dealing with all these family and personal issues, worried about how Iâ€™m gonna eventually support myself, etc. shit was so easy back then, wish I couldâ€™ve used that to have a good time.
