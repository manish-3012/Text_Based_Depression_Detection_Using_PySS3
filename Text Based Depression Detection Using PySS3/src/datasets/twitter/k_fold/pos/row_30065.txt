watching snake feeding videos recently. hognoses r v funny. all the other snakes r powerful and scary and they jump at the mice. hognoses just slowly slither up to the food nd slowly open their mouth nd eat it. like a cute baby death kiss ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º they r so careful w it. their face also goes flat while they eat so they look even more cute. how

god did a good one w them tbh
