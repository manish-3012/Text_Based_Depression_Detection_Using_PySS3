Iâ€™m bisexual but Iâ€™m afraid I wonâ€™t be accepted because of it I think this year Iâ€™ve finally admitted to myself that I am bisexual. My sexual identity has been something Iâ€™ve struggled with for years. When I dated my first girlfriend, I had a crush on my best (guy) friend, and I felt guilty. I tried to get her to admit she was bi so I would feel less guilty telling her I was bi. My grandma has told me multiple times she thinks gay people are abnormal and unnatural, and after my grandad died 2 years ago and I felt unfulfilled with my relationship to him before he died, Iâ€™m scared of disappointing her. I recently became vegetarian and she got mad at me for that. I love my grandma but also want to  be accepted for who I am. My mother has asked me if Iâ€™m gay or bi before and Iâ€™ve denied it, and sheâ€™s made it clear sheâ€™ll accept me for who I am. But Iâ€™m afraid my dad wonâ€™t, that heâ€™ll think itâ€™s just a phase or that Iâ€™m actually gay or Iâ€™m just straight. Iâ€™m worried my friend who Iâ€™m still friends with will find out I had romantic feelings for him, and that Iâ€™ll lose him as a friend. Iâ€™m afraid of being alone, not being able to find a partner because bi people are seen stereotypically as untrustworthy and greedy. Iâ€™m afraid of being alone.
