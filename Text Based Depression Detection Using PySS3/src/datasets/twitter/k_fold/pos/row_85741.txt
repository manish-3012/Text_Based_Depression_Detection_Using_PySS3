I miss her So my ex broke up with me about a month ago and at first I was pissed but now I miss her. I wanna talk to her again but sheâ€™s not responding to anything. Idk Iâ€™m just really confused right now and I feel like Iâ€™m not myself lately. Iâ€™m always tired and every now and then I just get hit with an extreme amount of sadness. Iâ€™m not seeking Attention I just needed to get this out there because I have no one to talk to.
