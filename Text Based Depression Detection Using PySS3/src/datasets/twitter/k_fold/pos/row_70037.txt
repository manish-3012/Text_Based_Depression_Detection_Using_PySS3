I have been in the works of making something really cool and i want yall to check it out Hey guys,

I have been working on making a podcast about a hobby I have, Tech. My podcast talks about tech but through a teenâ€™s perspective. Me and my friend are doing it because we find difficulty finding information about tech and stuff through a middle or high schooler's perspective so we started our own podcast to make sure others don't have the same difficulty as us. Please listen to the podcast at https://anchor.fm/talk-tech-teen-tech/episodes/Triple-Budgets-ektiks

You can even find my podcast on Spotify and starting next week my podcast will also be available on Apple Podcasts and the list will keep on growing. 

By the way if anyone is really into technology like I am them DM me and maybe I can host you on your show as I like to know the opinions of many different people. 

We upload every week on the weekend and the episodes are usually around 45 min each so you can listen to the podcast while getting work done or something.

It would mean a lot to me if you could try my podcast out and see how you like it. If you do like it please follow since you will be updated the second my podcast goes live.

Thank you guys so much in advance

Hope you like the podcast
