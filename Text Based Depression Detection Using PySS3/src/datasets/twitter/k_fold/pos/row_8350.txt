How obsessed are you guys with your physical appearance I feel like your appearance defines how much ur worth so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been grinding the gym and barely eating the past 6 months to have abs plus my genetics are good so Iâ€™m attractive face wise and like for example whenever I go out I have to be dressed my best even if itâ€™s going to the store for food. I also make sure to check myself in the mirror several times throughout the day and keep my posture straight cuz Iâ€™ve read you get treated better and more seriously and tbh it works cuz Iâ€™ve been getting girks a lot more than before but at the same time Itâ€™s so exhausting
