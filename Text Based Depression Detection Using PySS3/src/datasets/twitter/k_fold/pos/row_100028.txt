Iâ€™ve got something important to tell you all... Itâ€™s my birthday! Iâ€™m 15 now, POGGERS! None of my friends or family has said happy birthday to me, not even my mom which sucks. Looks like Iâ€™m celebrating alone again this year... Just wanted to tell yâ€™all cause I love this community and feel like I have an actual family here! Have a great day yâ€™all!
