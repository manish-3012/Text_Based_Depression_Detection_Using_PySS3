I swear, my dad and sister are having a competition to see who can be the most illogical For context: my sister has this condition where any little sound sets her off, crunchy lollipops, pretzels, and gum just to name a few. Because we have so many animals in the house and because everyone hated re-filling the big silver bowl, we got a filtered fountain thing. Just recently I learned that she can hear the little humming said fountain thing and my dad somehow threw out the filter so that had to buy a new one, did they buy one at the exact same size and move it somewhere else? No, he bought an even bigger fountain, with a more noticeable hum, and put it right above where my sister sleeps. I knew damn well my dad wasn't going to listen to my sarcasm so my mother and I suggested moving it to unplug the sad excuse of a roomba knock-off called 'Gerald' and they still refused to listen to us. I swear if my sister complains about this, someone owes me $5.
