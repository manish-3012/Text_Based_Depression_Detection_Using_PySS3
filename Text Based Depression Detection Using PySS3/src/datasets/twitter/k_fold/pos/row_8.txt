Guys I want friends Thatâ€™s it , Iâ€™m alone and donâ€™t talk to anyone dm me or anything, Iâ€™m just tired of only talking to my dad and sister, literally only my dad and sister , I like animated series but Iâ€™m flexible to anything the last series I watch was Santa Claritaâ€™s diet and the last animated series I watch was the hollow and shera ( I was watching them at the same time ), and I have a very extended music repertoire I can draw you anything you ask ( or at least Iâ€™ll try ) you can text me at any hour of the day , I pretty much only do that , I have weird family anecdotes and stories I can tell you  , but if you are not interested in anything I mentioned it doesnâ€™t matter Iâ€™m just here to be a friend
