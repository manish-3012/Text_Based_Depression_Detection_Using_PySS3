u guys ever just wish there was a manual for every social interaction sometimes Iâ€™m thinking about one very specific time that I was totally anxious bc I finally had the opportunity to talk to someone that I thought was cool and was avoiding for so long. So there was some sort of presentation day thing going on in my school(this was a year ago btw I just have no life and I ruminate a lot.) During this presentation there was no one in the room I was friends with so I saw this person I barely knew but kinda watched from afar wishing I had the courage to talk to them. Throughout all these presentations  I sat next to this person because I just DIDNT WANNA BE ALONE. Also I saw this as a cool opportunity to finally be around someone Iâ€™ve been meaning to talk to. I SUCKED SO BAD. I kept trying to think about what to say and there was NOTHING. I was worried the whole time that this person was thinking â€œwhy is coolstarfish55 following me around everywhere?â€ This is basically my worst fear. I donâ€™t wanna be that weirdo so anyways I kept thinking about what to say and I asked questions like â€œWhat college are you planning on going to?â€ I felt so dumb and I kept thinking that they donâ€™t wanna talk about stupid shit like that. I couldnâ€™t think of anything interesting to say and I just felt lame for trying to make small talk?? Then again the other person didnâ€™t do the best job with holding the conversation but I felt like I should have been able to do this?? Idk Iâ€™ve just realized Iâ€™ve screwed up a lot
