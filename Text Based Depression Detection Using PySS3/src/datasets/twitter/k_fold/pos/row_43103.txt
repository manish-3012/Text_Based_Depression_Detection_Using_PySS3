reminder to check on your friends ya never know when someone can be feeling down. I just learnt that someone I thought was a chirpy person is actually not OK. talk to the people you know, not talking about your feelings doesn't mean you're superior to others. everyone has emotions, so instead of being a sad lump, be kind to people, communicate, and even just a little smile could make someone's day :)
