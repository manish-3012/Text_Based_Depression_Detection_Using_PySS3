So tired of dumbass Americans fantasizing about communism. You guys are so ignorant. Communism, as long as humanity exists, will never work. Yes itâ€™d be nice if we all had equal assets and were happy with it, but we wonâ€™t be. Communist government often quickly go corrupt because of greed, and then the ruler turns it into a dictatorship and rules through fear. This is pretty much how EVERY SINGLE communist govt ends up.

I was born in Ukraine and then my parents moved to America. You guys donâ€™t know what communism does. It really brings out the worst. Stop idolizing it. Many came to America to escape the ruins and corruption communism has left all over Europe, especially eastern Europe. Kindly fuck off if youâ€™re a communist.
