Message from fellow teenagers over at Myanmar.  If you do not hear anything from us in the next few hours or few days, please know that the military has cut off the internet connectivity and taken our freedom of speech away as well. We as a citizen of Myanmar do not agree with the current move and would like to request the world leaders, UN and the global media to give a hand to our country- our leaders- our people - from this bitter acts. We want democracy and want our country being track on the democracy route! #saynotomyanmarmilitarycoup #justiceformyanmar #saveMyanmar ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡²
