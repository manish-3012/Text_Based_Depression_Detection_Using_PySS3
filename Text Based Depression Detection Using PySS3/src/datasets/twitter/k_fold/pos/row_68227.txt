Anyone wanna be friends I'm just kinda lonely a lot so this is my attempt at getting to know people

Some things that I like are music, basketball and videogames

My music taste is really mainstream and by that I mean I like hip hop. I love it when people recommend music for me and I will probably recommend music

The games that I usually play are nba 2k, cod, fortnite or rec room. I only have a playstation

That's really all, I'm not that interesting
