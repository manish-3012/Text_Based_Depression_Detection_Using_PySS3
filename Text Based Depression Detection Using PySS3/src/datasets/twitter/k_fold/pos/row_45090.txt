Something shady is going on in my country (Spain) So some of you may have heard that there where neo fascist terrorist attacks in Spain (I think my friend with the inappropriate username posted about that) and the thing is all the right leaning parties said something about and claimed they didnâ€™t do it. Except for one extremely far right party who said nothing.

Am I just going a bit crazy because of the shock of something like this happening or does this make sense?
