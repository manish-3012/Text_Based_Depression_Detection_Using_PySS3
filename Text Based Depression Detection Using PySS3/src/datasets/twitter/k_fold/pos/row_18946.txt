School makes reading boring Just read The Hobbit for the first rime and have earned a love of reading, the thing is school makes great books boring as shit, here's why

For me at least, you go at a snail's pace because every student has to read out loud, tbh i don't really see a way to fix this while making sure the students are keeping up

The second is assignments, no one wants to do a 400 word analysis on a character because it's boring, it makes you like the book less and once you complete it, you forget the analysis and all that shit.
