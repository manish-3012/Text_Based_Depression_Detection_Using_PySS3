I just hate when bullies are smart. Now I know that title sounds bad, but hear me out.

A bit of background information first, I'm a transgirl (I think) and am in a conservative all boys boarding school. My english teacher is a TERF and I am generally unpopular because I'm bi and was a prick when I was younger. Me and the bully are in the Higher class and are both straight A students.

Yesterday in English class we did the Second Coming, which is a poem by W.B. Yeats about the end of the world. And someone made a joke about transgenders being the antichrist. Anyway this fucking lad who thinks he's the shit and has a bit of a harem of lads too scared to object what he says went off on how trans people are a scourge and should live with the hand that they were dealt and the then the teacher started supporting him. I would have argued with him but I didn't (look I'm a bit of a coward ok?). Later I spoke to my friend about it and he said that basically that would have been the equivalent of outing myself and would have essentially ruined my life. This lad could fucking argue black was white and anyone who disagreed would get abused by him and his clique. Like getting the shit kicked out of each other. I was homophobically bullied for two years and really I didn't want it to start again. Now I feel like dirt for not standing up for what I believe in.

For the like 4 people still reading, bullies who can argue a point are the worst. hope i didn't sound like a quirky edgy nerd kid. Just should I go for it and speak up next time or hide my opinions?
