I HATE wires (After reding this paragraph, it may come off as bragging to some, so I'm sorry if it does I'm really not meaning it like that, and if it doesn't come off that way to you then I'm happy because that's how I want to to be) I have a wireless charger on the way, my galaxy buds plus get will charged wirelessly from then on, I'm buying the galaxy note 20 ultra in a few weeks (maybe months) and it supports wireless charging too, I don't like gaming but I bought an MSI gaming laptop that I only use for like YouTube and minecraft, and it's extremely well performing, and since it's a laptop it only has one wire relating to it which is the charger, I bought a wireless mouse amd headset. My vision of my life is for it to be as wireless as possible, and those small wires that are left (the wire of the wireless charger and laptop charger can be hidden well. Please let me know I'm not the only one who is trying to be as wireless as possible
