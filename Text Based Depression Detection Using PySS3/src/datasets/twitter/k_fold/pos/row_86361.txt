Would appreciate some advice regarding my crush and rainbow 6 siege I know amazing title

There is an event happening in a game we play together (rainbow six siege) and I know he really wants one of these limited time cosmetics, due to the fact that I didnâ€™t get him anything for his birthday should I purchase him this gift? I want to but I donâ€™t want to come off as â€œI bought you something now like meâ€.

Thanks for any advice anyone may give me.
