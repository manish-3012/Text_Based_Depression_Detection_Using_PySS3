My parents seem to have no respect for my wishes. I told my mom that I want to lose weight, and she shut me down saying I am not fat at all. Well I think that I should be the one to decide if I am fat or not. Right?

When I told my parents I want to try to earn some money by learning how to flip items on eBay and Facebook marketplace, they said that it is too dangerous to be trading items with strangers. They told me to get a job instead.

When I told them what subjects I want to pick for year 10, they said that they would be too hard for me and they donâ€™t think I could do it. I know they meant well, but it really hurt having my parents limit my abilities by their own minds. 

Ok, rant over. I might delete it later.
