Bruh i just realized something I know it's obvious but it just feels so strange how i haven't thought about it at all and how powerful it really makes us, but, we literally control who makes money on Youtube. We could simply destroy or create someone's career if we wanted to. I mean, i guess parteon and merch counts in on all of it but we have power over those things too; decision on wheter to pledge and/or buy the merch or not.
