How to get my on 2-4 hours of sleep So Iâ€™ve invented the perfect sleeping schedule for school. This may not work for you if you have a more physically involved routine or it just might not be right for your body. 

So I go to sleep around 6 or 7 pm then sleep until 8 to 10. If you have trouble falling asleep on command like I do, and your day doesnâ€™t make you tired enough then I recommend weed. Indica works better for sleeping but sativa works too.
