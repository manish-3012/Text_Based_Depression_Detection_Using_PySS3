Iâ€™m really confused right now and I kinda need to rant to get this off my chest. I get my grades for the exams that determine wether or not I go to college on Thursday and so many people are stressed and shit but I have literally no emotion towards them. 

I donâ€™t want to get the results because that means my parents are going to send me off to a college 3 hours away.

The thing is Iâ€™m really shy and reserved and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to cope with living in a dorm where the minute I leave Iâ€™ll be bombarded by teenagers. 

Nobody I know Is going there and tbf I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m interested in the course anymore the worse thing is I havenâ€™t applied for anything else.

I was considering doing an online course but my parents are very against that. So much so they get irritated if it is mentioned. I do worry if I did decide to do this Iâ€™m wasting away the slight chance of having a social life but right now just the thought of moving away is stressful. 

The worst part is Iâ€™m not feeling mentally able to cope with this right now  I feel completely lost and nothing I do makes me truly happy. Iâ€™ve been aiming toward this course for so many years but right now I donâ€™t think I have a lot of interest in doing it. 

Iâ€™m just so confused and I fucking hate the education system my country has. I donâ€™t even know what to do and I have nobody to talk about it to because they donâ€™t understand and if I try to explain it end in an argument.
