I think I like someone, but they are a bit older than me. I'm 15 and he's 17. 

We talk a lot, (we have a seven hour difference, so we can only take during certain parts of the day, but its a lot of fun) 

I don't have a huge crush on him, but we're kinda flirty towards each other.

Do you guys think 15-17 is weird? Me and my sister broke the 'half your age +7 rule' down to months and it was good, but I want to know yalls opinion.
