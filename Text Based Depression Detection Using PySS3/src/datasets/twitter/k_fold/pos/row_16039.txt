I feel bad for Parents of Trans Peeps Not because of any prejudice but just think of the amount of time and hours they all spent on suggestions and how they should name their baby. And then like 10 or 15 years later they do a 180 and go by a different name. Like Sam or Alex. And not to diss the child anything you know you do you. But still what if they just donâ€™t like that name because that name came up before. Like this:
 
Mom: How about Sam?
 
Dad: Sam? What is he some sort of generic piece of bread?
 
Mom: okay then what.
 
Dad: John.
 
Mom: like your dad?
 
Dad: yea itâ€™s a nice name. 
 
Mom: alright fine. John it is.
 
10Years Later
 
Mom: I FUCKING TOLD YOU! No problem, SAM.
