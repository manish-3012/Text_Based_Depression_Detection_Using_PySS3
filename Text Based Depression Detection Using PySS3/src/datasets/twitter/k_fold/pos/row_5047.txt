Insomnia gang Anyone else suffering from the inability to sleep? Kinda losing hope I just wanna hear stories of people who've experienced it and got better, or just people who are experiencing the same thing atm 


( I only realised that reddit is louder at this time bc most of the users are from the other side of the globe lol.)
