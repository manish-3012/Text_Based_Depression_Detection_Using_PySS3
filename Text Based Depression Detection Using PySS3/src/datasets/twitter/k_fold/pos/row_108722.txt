Ok, but like, can we talk about Rodrick? The OG Rodrick, of course. The new one looks like lil tay. The old Rodrick was a dreamy pink boi and the new one, I just wanna punch him in the face. They did my guy Rodrick so dirty in the last one. Devon Bostick is the only person I will ever accept as Rodrick. Also, if you want to, send me your best Rodrick edits
