I need to fill my teachers classroom with memes about crockpots So a few weeks ago a sort of meme as popped up in my favorite teachers classroom...I'm not entirely sure how it happened but now everyone makes crockpot jokes every time they're in there now

But instead of simply joining, imma fill his classroom with memes about crockpots

I'm gonna do 20 probably then print them all, then during lunch fill the whole classroom with the memes and then wait for his reaction

Except I gotta pick some good ones, any good ideas?
