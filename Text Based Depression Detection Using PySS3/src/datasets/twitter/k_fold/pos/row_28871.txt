Wanna get people to stop hassling you about not doing drugs? Lie on surveys. Ever been given one of those surveys where your school asks you if youâ€™ve done a whole bunch of drugs? Those things are the reason shit like the truth campaign keeps clogging my YouTube feed with ads and why thereâ€™s this constant â€œare you doing drugs?â€ bullshit from every third helicopter parent. In an effort to reduce this, I would argue that from now on every high schooler should claim that they donâ€™t use any form of drug, regardless of whether of not they actually do, and try to get there friends to do the same. This would skew data towards teens being largely drug free and make it the world a little bit less annoying, not just for us, but for everyone who doesnâ€™t like to see cringe anti-tobacco adds every twenty minutes.
