My grandma is now educated about Reddit and the stock market... Hello everyone. I would like to apologise in advance for any spelling mistakes or other errors. English is not my native language.

After it snowed heavily during the night, I had to shovel snow at our house. In the meantime, I decided to take groceries to my grandmother's. Now I was sitting there with grandma and talking to her about all sorts of things when she suddenly asked me about the stock market and "the site where people talk about it". I had to think for a moment before I realised that she meant Reddit. To quench her thirst for knowledge, I explained what was going on with the stock market last week. Then it was on to the hard part. How do you explain to a 70-year-old how Reddit works and what it is? With the help of my mobile phone and some visual aids, I was able to explain r/wallstreetbets and r/mauerstrassenwetten to her. Somehow she found all the action with Gamestop and so on funny and is fully behind the investors. I then updated the TV's programme list and ate breakfast at her place.

In my opinion, it's great that even old people like my grandma are interested in things like Reddit and ask me about it. I hope you have a nice day and we'll see each other sometime.
