Is there anyone I can talk to about my girl problems thatâ€™s not a dude who thinks he knows everything about women? Seriously every time I try talking about some problems Iâ€™ve had with this girl itâ€™s always with another dude who tells me what sheâ€™s thinking or how girls are just â€œlike thatâ€ I just need someone who will tell me straightforward â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€ without this â€œgirls are just that way sometimes, king, keep trying!â€
