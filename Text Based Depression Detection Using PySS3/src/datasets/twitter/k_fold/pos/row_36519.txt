What is your opinion on a straight pride flag or pride flags in general? I disagree with the idea of a straight pride flag but I'm not sure exactly why. What does a pride flag represent, and why should straight people not get one, or should straight people get a pride flag what about a straight pride parade, I think that would be way too far. Do we need flags for every gender and sexuality? does it help bring awareness and identity or does it only bring division? Can straight people just have a straight flag for the sake of having one so they aren't left out? Is it homophobic to fly a straight pride flag? LGBT pride is a lot about how LGBT people are persecuted for their sexuality and gender, some straight people are persecuted for their sexuality too but not nearly as much, is that a good enough reason? I'm not sure where I stand in this debate since I can't really see the argument either way.
