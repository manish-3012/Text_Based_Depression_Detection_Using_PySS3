chasing someone else's life this is some advice. please take it to heart.

I see a lot of teenagers chase the life of others. They "stan" people, and I find it childish. If you stan someone, please stop. It's cringy, its weird, it's awkward, it's childish. Stanning is commonly found upon:

pewdiepie, callmecarson, BTS, KPOP, etc.... like please do not do this. it kinda makes me mad.

thanks,
