I am such an idiot Only now, almost 4 years later i realized that the few girls in my class (who i genuinely thought were pretty) were giving me green signals.

I feel like a total dumbass for ignoring so many hints, i feel like i've missed a secret area in a game with only one playthrough that could've give me a secret ending, someone please take my life i can't stand such a failure
