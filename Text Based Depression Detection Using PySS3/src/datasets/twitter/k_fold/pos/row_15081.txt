My dog is going to have to be put down and itâ€™s tearing me apart She is a 12 year old English Mastiff named Brandy and Iâ€™ve known her since I was 4. Sheâ€™s been with me through everything ranging from when my dad died to just bawling over studying. Sheâ€™s always been here to cheer me up at my lowest points. And now sheâ€™s not gonna be here anymore and thereâ€™s nothing else I can do to help her. Iâ€™m dreading the day we are going to have to take her to the vet.
