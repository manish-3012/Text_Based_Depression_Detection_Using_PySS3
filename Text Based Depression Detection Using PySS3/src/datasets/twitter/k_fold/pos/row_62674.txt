Please read I feel like I need to say this but at the end of the day
1. Not every one thinks badly of you I know it's hard to overcome but most of that stuff is just in your head
2. Don't let people's judgment of you stop you from doing what you like as long as you are happy that's good enough for me. While you should take some judgment in incase something is wrong or what you are doing is hurting you or someone else
