Because this breaks the rules of r/amitheasshole, Am I The Asshole? So I was on this Discord server (thousands of members, only a few in chat at the moment) during school, being sneaky not to get caught during class. I couldn't see very well what was happening on my small phone screen.

We started talking about sex, but I had some pretty disgusting / weird / gross fantasies, so I explained a relevant one to the conversation. I couldn't see what chat was doing then other than some people also describing theirs, so I continued. Instant ban from the server.

On the reason, it said that I was apparently asked to stop. I didn't see any messages asking me to stop, and I saw other people doing it too and not getting banned. This wasn't against the rules of the server, as things that are NSFW are, according to the moderators, only extremely explicit things. I thought this was allowed. I didn't see any messages asking me to stop.

Am I the asshole?
