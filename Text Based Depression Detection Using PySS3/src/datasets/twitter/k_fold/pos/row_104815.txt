I'm in a dilemma and I need your help guys This is about a girl which I wrote another post on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j9dryr/i_think_a_girl_has_a_crush_on_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
If you don't want to read it, here's the basics:
She's my best friend and I thought she was dropping hints that she liked me. I didn't want to tell her unless I was absolutely sure, because if she didn't like me back I might lose her as a friend.
It later transpired that she was with someone, so good thing I didn't tell her. 
About two weeks ago she told me she broke up with her boyfriend. Obviously, I supported her and in general was extra nice to her. She told me her boyfriend said that it was just a break which I didn't believe because I know him and he's the type who will have multiple girlfriends at once. A few days later, he asked me if I knew any single girls he could ask out. I asked him if he was through with his previous girlfriend (I supposedly didn't know) and he said yes, and that she was just his friend and he wasn't going to get back together with her. I told her this, because I didn't want her to wait for him and have her heart broken. While it made her sad to know what, she said she was better off knowing, and thanked me for my help, and that I was a true friend and I was the only one who knows about this. I asked her about her other friends and she told me she only had one other girl friend.
So here's the dilemma. I want to tell her, but I don't know if I should and when. This is my final year of highschool and if she rejects my advances, I'm afraid I'll lose concentration and not get good marks in highschool. I'm also scared she'll say no because she wants to focus on just school right now.
On the other hand, I'm afraid of I don't tell her, she'll meet someone and my chance will be lost. Or that if I tell her, she'll say no and I'll lose the friendship. 
Any help is appreciated. Because to me, all options don't seem too good
TLDR: I'm in love with my best friend and I don't know how to tell her, that is, if I should tell her at all
