Why is always like this? Why I'm moving out early Black mom: *Acts rude*

Me: *Acts rude back*

She: *Cries*

"You're a mean unthankful ambition!"

"Lower your voice!"

"Don't give me a reason to make you cry!"

"Don't touch me!"

"Don't think for other people!"


And as a nice addition do I have a white dad who always simps for her, even if she is wrong.
