Haha poem I wrote. What do you think? Lately Iâ€™ve been popping any pill that I find around,
Ope thereâ€™s goes a laxative, 30 Advil, 
thatâ€™s my system shutting down, Iâ€™ve tried being nice, but my demons keeping attacking, 6 suicide attempts, Iâ€™ve been to the ER twice, but for whatever reason I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a bad thing, maybe it is, only in the sense that I didnâ€™t commit, Iâ€™ve tried 6 times and I still fucking missed, no surprise though, I could ruin my life with my eyes closed, Iâ€™m a born failure, defective, side note, Iâ€™ve never tried rope, A noose, better learn how to tie one then kick the tote. I only have to die once. Life is a joke. So letâ€™s get to the punchline, somebody please slit my throat, I wanna be dead by lunchtime. Maybe people will feel sorry after they read all the songs I wrote. Okay goodbye. Im tying cinder blocks around my thighs and getting ready to jump off the boat. And remember, if you have a shit life, make sure you tie them tight enough so you donâ€™t start to float. Donâ€™t put up a fight. You want to let go, you donâ€™t want to feel the load. Ending itâ€™s right.
