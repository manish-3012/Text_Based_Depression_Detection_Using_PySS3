yesterday was E P I C yesterday was a bit boring until i played terraria after a while i got so many good stuff anyway the best part of yesterday comes in the afternoon our english class has an exclusive channel for itself and then i noticed that one of my friends is sending meme images so decided to start a war with him (btw we two are best friends and we both like memes so goddamn much) 

so he sent memes and i sent memes this war continued until the rest of students stopped us and due to this unfortunately we didn't had a winner but after that so much fun meme war 

i watched a youtube channel known as memekun who usually sends terraria memes since i am making memes in r/Terrariamemes  memekun noticed me and put my memes in his videos and then when i saw my own meme i freaked out because i always wanted my meme to be shown in a youtube video especially in lwaiy or jacksepticeyes meme time but since none of my memes made it there i was a bit sad until i saw that my memes are shown in a youtube channel with 12k subs (it's not much but damn that channel's videos usually get a lot of views and still it's a youtube channel)
