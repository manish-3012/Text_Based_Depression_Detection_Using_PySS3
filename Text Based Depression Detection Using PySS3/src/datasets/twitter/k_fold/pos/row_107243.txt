I think I may have sensory issues or my adhd is just making me delusional Why? Well well well

I hate wearing socks and tights because the sewing at the end of the foot touches my toe(s) wrong and  feels weird, like, I need to peel off my skin or sumn shit

Whenever the fabric of my shirt or bra is well fittes on my back I constantly pull on it because it just feels wrong. 

Wearing tight fitted pants innuncomfy, especially jeans, and even if they fit my right i constantly pick and pull at the fabric to "fix it" the only fitted pants I can wear regularly are leggings

I'm very ticklish, like to the point that sometimes gentle or comforting touches aren't very comforting, especially on my arms and torso :')

I HATE the feeling of my hair on the sides of my neck, but when I pull it away it still feels like its there.

And my face randomly feels...uncomfortable, like, I want to peel off the skin because it "doesn't fit"


I sound insane and paranoid but like bruh wtf is wrong with me lmao
