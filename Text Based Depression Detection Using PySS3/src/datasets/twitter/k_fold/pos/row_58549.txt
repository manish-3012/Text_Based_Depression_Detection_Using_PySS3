Just remembered this from last year felt like I should mention So for some context I go to an all boys school and we had a female substitute teacher, we were in science class and humans we brought up and we were referred to as homo Sapiens so as a class full of boys would do they made homo jokes because HaHAaHa no homo = comedy obviously. The class was making jokes for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden of sub just went crazy at 1st we were confused why but then we noticed what she was saying, so it turned out she was lesbian and we were just insulting her for must of felt like hours to her. Now Iâ€™ve learned my lesson and homo does not equal funny and to respect other peopleâ€™s choices on their sexuality. 
To the 5 of you that read that, I hope you respect other peopleâ€™s sexuality.
