To Achievers, People who have Excellent Grades / Performance, Geniuses, etc. , How do you find Studying? Is it easy for you? or what? Just askin. I'm just an Average student. When i was elementary i always find time to study in the library. It could be anything. History, Science, bit of Maths, etc.   


I was so interested in reading and studying that i find it like walking on a pillow. (but i only graduated 5th Honor)  


But now in high school i lost that interest. Currently i find studying some subjects kinda hard. But that doesn't mean i lost my interest completely. It's just in a different place. Right now it's Aviation. It's really easy for me to study Things related to Aviation (I play Flight Sims so yeah). I could almost just read once stuff and keep it in my mind for a long time.   


Meanwhile school stuff? Such as Chem or Bio? It would take me 3-5 reads and still not get it completely. Not to mention it's easy for me to forget them.   


How bout you guys? Do you find studying like walking on a pillow or eating a cake? or what? I'm kinda jealous that your Appetite for Studying is in School Stuff. Wish i could kill myself to be born again that is like you guys haha.  


Yes i Admit. I have just Ok Grades and if "Grades" means Intelligence / Character / Hard work for you then i'm just an Average guy. I'm not excellent in anything.
