So basically i wrote something, i don't lnow what this is, I'll give an explanation if someone asks, but basically i was in my "depressed" state while in a certain situation and these words were just stuck in my head so i wrote them down and i present them to you Sorry for English because i don't know how certain things would translate :


The sun burns, i deserve this
I will remain here until the end of time
And until my flesh will be no more
And once what's left of me will be bones
I will rise up, knowing that the destiny has been fulfilled

I low-key think it's kinda cringe after reading it and knowing I'll post this, but I'll do it anyways lol

Suggestions are always welcomes since I don't know what to change for fulfilled since to me it seems a bit wrong
