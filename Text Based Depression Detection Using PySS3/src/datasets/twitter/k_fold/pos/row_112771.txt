Do you guys know if dyslexia can return? So when I was little I had some issues with dyslexia. Itâ€™s made me switch my hand writing from cursive to print mid word all my life. I used to have trouble reading and I had a stutter and lisp so I was really bad at social interaction because of it. Although Iâ€™ve been placed in advance classes since kindergarten. When I was younger my grandma would â€œbeatâ€ it out of me. Sheâ€™d wake me up at midnight and slap my hands if I got it wrong and make me read, write, and do math problems until I got it right. Then once I got enough problems right sheâ€™d send me off to bed. Well she did it to the point where it went away I guess. The writing stayed the same but my stutter, lisp, and social interactions got better. However since quarantine started Iâ€™ve been mixing up numbers in math and reading and writing things wrong. Itâ€™s really affecting my school work. Is there any way this can come back?
