Why are we here, just to suffer? My life has been an absolute trainwreck, I feel empty inside I was diagnosed with diabetes before puberty and have been bottling up my feelings ever since. My ability to socialize has been destroyed I'm lonely and blew a chance at happiness twice. I'm numb and I dont know how to not feel this way I just feel empty. The brief moments of happiness I have are when I'm with my 11 month old niece and when I'm really just with my family. I've lost the will to put effort into life. I've even lost the will to shower regularly. My permit expires in a month and I've put in 0 effort into learning how to drive. Were in a pandemic so everyone I care about could be dead soon. The man who was like a 2nd father to me committed suicide.  Soon I'll be kicked off my moms insurance and my medical bills will begin stacking up into the thousands. What did I do to deserve this, Was I the zodiac killer in the past life? All my friends are moving on, and im being left behind.
