I feel awful because I may have made my friend angry. So, a few days ago I texted my friend who is a girl. She was with her friends and sending me voice messages, and in one of them her friend said that she likes girls and that I shouldn't try anything. I am absolutely okay with this because I wasn't trying anything. But today I texted her again and she said that I should stop because I heard that she's not interested in me. Now I feel like I've made her mad at me.
