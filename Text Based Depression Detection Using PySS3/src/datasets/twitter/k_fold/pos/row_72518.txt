Feeling left out of my friend group Due to corona and all that stuff my friend group hasnâ€™t been meeting irl at all and just play video games. During summer vacation there were pretty much only 4 active people in the server, and I was one of the only ones who still hung out with the group. Once school started I canâ€™t play as much, since Iâ€™m taking ap courses and all that stuff, and as the school year started a lot of people who werenâ€™t really active in the summer started playing with us. Iâ€™m not as good at some video games and donâ€™t have as much time to play but when I do get on they just ditch me cause they have a full squad. Even if we have say 7 people, Iâ€™m never included in the main group and Iâ€™m just left with whoever joined last. Iâ€™m honestly feeling pretty betrayed cause I always stuck out for the people who were low ranks in valorant and other games but now that we r playing r6 the guys I stuck out for and solo queued with cause no one else wanted to play with them just turned there back on me. Advice?
