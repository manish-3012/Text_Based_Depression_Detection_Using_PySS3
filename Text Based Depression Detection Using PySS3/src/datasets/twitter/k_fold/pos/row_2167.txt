My grandpa just un-boomered himself! The thing is that I had a discussion with my 65yo grandpa, who never used Internet or smartphone in his entire life.

We are not from English speaking country and suddenly he said to me â€œNo commentâ€ with a perfect accent.

I donâ€™t know where he heard that, but Iâ€™m so f*cking proud of him.
