Bro... time flies so fast I was playing skribbl(dot)io i was IT and chose the word pinball and holy shit nostalgia just kicks right in. I drew the whole space pinball game and drew it by memory. I'm sorry that I can't get to show my drawing here like a child showing his drawing to his mother. I'm literally gonna be proud if I were to show it here, oh well. I just miss going back from school and turning that bad boy and opening that game. I actually bring my friends just to play that and damn I still remember when we were playing playing. That's it, thanks for coming to my ted talk.
