What's wrong with people I don't know if this belongs here. It's just something that bothers me a lot. I'm a 12th grade student at a school in eastern germany and people talk trash about me because i don't participate in the current mainstream in my area. When it comes to fashion i definetely stand out from the croud because all the other boys just all look more or less the same (Everyone is wearing just black sweaters, a pair of tight adidas trackpants or black skinny jeans and white or black air force 1's). I could keep on going about how i dont really like this mainstream but thats a bit too much for now i think. I basically want to stand out from the croud and i think there is nothing wrong about that. But all the other people (except my friends of course) keep calling me gay or girly or weird because of the way i dress, because of my hobbies and the way i behave (Btw i have nothing against gays or the lgbtq+ community, in fact i support the community a lot because almost all of my friends are bisexual or gay. I just dont count myself as a member of the community because i identify as a heterosexual male). People just in general say things about me that are not true and that makes people who dont know me think that i am weird. That makes it hard to get to know new people and that sucks because i like meeting new people. I just sometimes wonder whats wrong with the teens at my school. I hope you can understand my situation. (Sorry for the long text and i apologise if my english is a bit bad). Have a nice day
