3 yr old watching Game of Thrones Okay, so I (16) teach a youth fitness class and my friend's little brother is one of the students.  This kid (3) walks into class and when I ask him what he has been up to he tells me that he started watching Game of Thrones.  My parents won't let me anywhere near that show!  I kinda died inside right then and there that a 3 year old is actively watching something that my pare ts wont even consider letting me watch.
