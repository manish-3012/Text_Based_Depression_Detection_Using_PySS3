Can't believe there are people that unironically defends "pay to play online" Like,bro,you're literally being scammed.They're just pretending to make the "service" with your money eventhough it's just a waste 

Like,Steam has a ton of players as well but do you need to pay to play online?No,it's completely free of charge unlike console

This really sucks.I just bought a game and now I have to pay just so I can play online?Talk about being money hungry
