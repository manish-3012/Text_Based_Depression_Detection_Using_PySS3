developing new problems theyâ€™re always phases but in the moment they seem like theyâ€™ll never end

today i took the time to think about my actions because my mom yelled at me 

looking back on the last 24 hours:

i slept at for 4 hours and woke up to watch 4 streams in a row. 

the first stream being a 10 hour one. 

i declined 2 breakfast/lunch invitations to watch a man stare at a brick wall on minecraft for 10 hours

yeah the only times i left my room were to drive to the gas station for red bullâ€™s and gummies. 


maybe iâ€™m just over simplifying my day but i can literally only remember sitting in a chair and looking a monitor. i really just switched over to my phone and airpods when i drove to the store
