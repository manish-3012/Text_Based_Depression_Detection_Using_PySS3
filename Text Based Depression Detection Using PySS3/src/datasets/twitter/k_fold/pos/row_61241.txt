If ur a teen that hasnâ€™t brushed their teeth in a while hereâ€™s a recommendation for you. So I havenâ€™t brushed my teeth in like days and I knew that was dirty but I just didnâ€™t want to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and brush my teeth. If you have a window in your room that you can open then this is for you. 

My dad told me we had company today and I didnâ€™t want to go in front of them with bad breath so I went into the bathroom, took the toothpaste and my tooth brush got 2-3 water bottles, then went into my room opened my window and started brushing my teeth with a water bottle outside my window.

Yea I know it sounds crazy but just try it... itâ€™s fun. 

Idk if itâ€™s bc Iâ€™m weird or something but I find it fun.
