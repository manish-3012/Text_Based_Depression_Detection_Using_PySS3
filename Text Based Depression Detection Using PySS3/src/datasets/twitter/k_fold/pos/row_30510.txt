Iâ€™ve never been actually stressed until now Yeah Iâ€™ve been stressed out before but bother like what it is right now. With having less than a week to decide next years classes, having no idea whatâ€™s going on in math, having a essay I really donâ€™t know how to finish, and having to keep my grades above a C so my parents donâ€™t get mad itâ€™s just a lot more stress than I have had before. Almost every night finally being able to go to sleep around 1am just laying there over thinking whatâ€™s gonna happen to me if I donâ€™t get stuff done just sucks a ton. Also having to wake up to go to school where Iâ€™m only able to see my friends for 20 minutes at lunch doesnâ€™t help either. I probably donâ€™t even have it bad compared to other kids but it just sucks being stressed out like this.
