#1 Tip for College: Don't Fucking Go **College might not be like high school, but it's just as stupid.** Especially with online classes now, they fucking suck. 

I had to email my geology professor last night because this week I started having trouble finding all my assignments. This morning she emails me back saying that the reason I don't have my stuff is cuz I didn't do an exam that was due *last Sunday the 13th.*

"***Excuse me? What the hell did you just say?"*** 

An exam. I missed an exam. How the fuck am I just gonna not take an exam that I have a whole week to take. I'm pretty dumb, but I'm not that dumb. You can't make up exams. Something that is like 50% of my grade. And I'm not gonna take it? Yeah right. I email her back saying that I never got the exam. All she says to me is, "The test was available. Sorry that you missed it." **Bitch. I'm fucking mad.** 

Every single day I click through my classes, every single tab, to make sure that I'm not missing anything. I'm all caught up on my stuff, I check my grades, everything is fine, except I feel like I'm not doing enough work this week for geology. After she gave me my other assignment when I emailed her, the stupid exam popped up in my grades with a 0. ***MY GRADE WENT FROM A 102 TO A DAMN 80.*** I was pretty proud of my grade, happy that I'm not failing, trying to maintain my A's. But what the actual fuck. *How the fuck is she just gonna say "sorry, it was there" and give me a 0 when I know damn well it was never fucking there. At all. Ever. And it still isn't there. Anywhere. Nowhere in sight.*

I was so sad earlier that I laid on the floor for 3 hours, and didn't go to the rest of my classes except for my last period. Now I'm just frustrated that she hasn't emailed me back when I asked about trying to make it up or something.
