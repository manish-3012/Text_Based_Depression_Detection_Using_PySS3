I was intrigued on what everyone was talking about when they said edtwt and shtwt is nuts... catch me being âœ¨triggeredâœ¨ iâ€™m genuinely a pretty fucked up person but I couldâœ¨ never âœ¨ post shit like that if it could in any way hurt another person. Iâ€™m just so freaking concerned and wondering why the fuck that shit hasnâ€™t been taken down yet. Thanks reddit for being lessâœ¨toxicâœ¨
