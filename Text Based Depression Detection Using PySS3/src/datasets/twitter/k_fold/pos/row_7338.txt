Alright so I just took my PSATs and I want to be happy with myself but... My friends immediately started talking about how their scores in the 95th percentile were shit and I got like 90th. I know realistically I can do better- I didnâ€™t really sleep last night and my mental health has recently been an absolute dumpfuck- and I know that 90th is great but still it hurts. I kinda just wanted to be happy with myself for once and thatâ€™s hard to do when the people around you are kind of shitting on you.
