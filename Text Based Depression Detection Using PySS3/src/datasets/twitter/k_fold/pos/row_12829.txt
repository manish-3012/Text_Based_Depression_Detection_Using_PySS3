Please help I feel like confessing to the girl that I like before I leave (I'm gonna go to my home country for a year). But I don't know if the feelings are mutual. If they aren't, it's ok. I just want to get this off of my chest. But if it is, then it will be really painful not being able to see them for a year. what do I do?
