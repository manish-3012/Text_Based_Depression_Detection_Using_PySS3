I need new friends So someone on here told my 2 only irl friends that I'm suicidal and now they always say they wanna hang out with me but they never actually do. 

I think they would just feel guilty if i actually go with it. 

Long story short I really need new friends i can talk too, so umm if anyone is looking for new friendships I'll be up for it.

Im female, 18 and bisexual if that helps.
