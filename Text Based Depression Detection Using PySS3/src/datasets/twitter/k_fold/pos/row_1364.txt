Having a bad education system is not your fault https://youtu.be/-MTRxRO5SRA

Hey! I was just hanging out at youtube and i came across this Sal Khan TED talk. Well, Sal is the founder of Khan academy, and he pretty much said some stuff i believe is the biggest problem on education. Year after year we accumulate gaps in our learning, and at some point it all collapses. No one is born a math genius, or a great historian, but we all can learn these stuff and master it. 

I thought i could never be good at physics because it was such an messy subject, turns out i was missing some of the fundamentals, and once i learnt these basic stuff i could learn and master physics at a high school level. And now i'm at college studying a sciences course (Physics, Chem, Math, Biology, Computing)

What i want to show is that you can learn whatever you want, you just have to be patient and calmly fix these little gaps.
