why does my family not care and brush it off as me being an edgy teen? ok fine!!! i act reckless i drink, self harm, smoke, walk on busy roads, steal, do graffiti but i do it because it helps as i can't fucking express myself without these fucking angry breeders criticizing me and blocking me off my speech with their one dimensional thinking why am i silenced and not allowed to express myself or talk to anyone it makes me so fuckin' empty and hurts its like knots in my heart why do i have to justify living and why am i forced to live in an authoritarian capitalist world where i have to be a wage slave with people who have power over me and justify their violence against me with their "law and order" i can't fucking take this why can't i just fuckin' enjoy live and talk about my feelings instead of filling that emptiness with bad coping mechanisms and getting attached to fictional character, youtubers and such as a way to cope with the hollowing pain and atheist existential dread i have.
