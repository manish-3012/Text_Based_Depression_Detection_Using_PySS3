The boys handled storm front perfectly So if you are planning on watching season 2 and havent seen the episodes yet or whatever, then spoilers.

Honestly, I love the way they handled Stormfront. First they gender swap her, which gets everyone thinking that the show will be woke. You have the comic fans who automatically hate the show now, the group that I'm in that wanted to see why they would change it and curious on why the change, and then the people who know nothing about the comics but immeidalty like stormfront cause she is another strong female in the show. Then the first 2 episodes, she automatically has most people's attention. Everyone on twitter is praising her and everything. Episode 3 comes in and boom, the part I was waiting for the entire time, shes a fucken racist nazi like the comics, and they played it perfectly. In the show she has everyone praising her cause shes standing up to a corrupt government, but shes just as bad as homelander, maybe worse. And then episode 4 comes in and then you find out she was a superhero in the 70s with a lot of the company covering up her racist attacks. They fucken duped everyone who supported her, like the show got a lot of hate on twitter for making her a racist. Which was hilarious, like imagine supporting any of the heroes on the boys, except starlight, but imagine supporting anyone else. But yeah, I just finished watching episode 4 and felt like talking about it. What do you guys, if you've seen it, think of the boys so far?
