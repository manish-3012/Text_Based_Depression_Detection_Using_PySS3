I miss her a lot. I have a crush on one of my best friends, and we haven't seen each other in 7 months thanks to corona. I'm hoping thanks to school starting up again i'll be able to contact her. If/when i see her again i just want to hug her and not let her go. I don't want to lose her for another 7 months, i refuse to. I want to tell her how i feel about her, and how much she means to me. I hope that she gives me a chance with her, that'd make me happy.
