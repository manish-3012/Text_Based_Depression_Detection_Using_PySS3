My privacy is gone My mom has downloaded an app on my phone used to monitor 5 year olds who don't know how to navigate the internet. So now I can't do anything without my mom seeing it, I can't delete tha app without her getting a warning and my phone being locked, I can bypass the app without her getting an alert and said bypass being deleted. So now the concept of privacy doesn't exist to me
