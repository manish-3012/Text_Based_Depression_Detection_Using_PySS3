Is it just my school or is everything moving slower? Iâ€™ve been doing online for nearly two months and we only have 50 minute classes instead of our usual hour and 10 minutes. We also follow seven day a block schedule. I feel like my core classes are moving slower online then we would ever move in person. I canâ€™t think Iâ€™m of many great examples, but my math lessons take two days now and i have only done one coated In History. 

I really want to petition to college board especially because Iâ€™m taking 3 AP Classes and if this year is anything like the debacle last year, and they are also requiring us to finish the whole course for this years AP test, any AP student could be in deep shit. This could really go for any student at their point with how little some of us have learned already.
