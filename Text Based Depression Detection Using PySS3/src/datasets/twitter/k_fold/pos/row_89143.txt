Cat names My parents allowed me to have cats, weâ€˜ve been searching a bit and finally found a boy and a girl.
Theyâ€˜ll probably be here in about a month or so, but we donâ€˜t have names yet, could you suggest some?


My friend has already decided that Iâ€˜ll have to name the girl catwoman and I donâ€˜t think that you could possibly come up with a better name than that.
