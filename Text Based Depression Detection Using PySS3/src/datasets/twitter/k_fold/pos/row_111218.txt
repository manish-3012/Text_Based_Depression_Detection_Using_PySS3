Its been dificult Hey, do you ever just feel so down becouse of the demanding schoolwork. And you realise that your dream is unacheavable and you just want to cry yourself to sleep.

And than you talk to your friends on discord of course becouse you cant see them irl an just start thinking how pathetic you are becouse you are fucking 16 years old and bave never kissed a girl even though you are not that weird.

Sorry for the bad grammar and that you read this. I just wanted to complain.
