bad thoughts for context I (F16) currently live in lebanon and will soon travel to europe by myself for college. 

i have been getting countless horrifying thoughts about another explosion happening in lebanon, killing my family and destroying my home while im away in europe. the beirut blast happened about two months ago, and although it didnt affect me or anyone very close to me, it still haunts me. sometimes i get flashbacks to that afternoon, that deafening thud, how everything was shaking and everyone was screaming, how i ran home to find my sister crying and my mom calling my dad and other relatives to make sure theyâ€™re alive, and the news on the tv blasting on full volume the whole time. it was a huge punch in the face, and it really reminded me of how unpredictable and ruthless life can be, how in the blink of an eye you can lose absolutely everything. and i know itâ€™s unlikely that anything like this will happen again anytime soon, but im still fucking terrified of losing my family especially while im away. 

ive been waking up in the middle of the night sobbing, even had a couple panic attacks. its really bad, i dont know how to get over it.
