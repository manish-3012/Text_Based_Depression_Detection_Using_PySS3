I've recently realized I'm super insecure. Like mostly like weather or not people like talking to me, I've been like this for a while, but am just realizing. In school I can't talk to popular kids or upperclassmen especially I feel like they will be annoyed by me. I never call people my friends out of fear they'll disagree, with my best friends I can't say we're best friends. With my closest friend group I even lost touch with them over the summer because I was convinced they didn't like me. Whenever I log onto xbox I can't join their party unless they invite me. I know they like me, but just can't get it out of my head that they might not.

Whenever I text someone new on snapchat if I can get myself to text them I always make sure they want to talk to me, I can't not do that. I started talking to this girl back in November, and I've done this a few times to her. Well now she hasn't texted in 4 plus days, I think her phone got taken, but idk. Then this other girl, I did this to her too when we started texting a couple of weeks ago, and now she barely texts back like once every few hours. I swear I didn't mean to, but I was looking at my snap map and she was active, so I checked several times, she's just choosing to not text me. That's fine if she doesn't want to talk then she just doesn't.

But since November I've gotten used to having someone to talk to and tell everything to, I can't explain it, but like with the first girl especially I felt like I could tell her anything. I just can't open up like that to boys, I'm not fully sure why. Right now I have no one to talk to. There's things I want to talk about, but am afraid of being judged or something else. 

There was more, but I doubt you even want to read this much. Please don't be to hard on me idk.
