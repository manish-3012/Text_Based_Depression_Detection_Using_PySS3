This year fucking sucks and it won't get better. Here's how my hair started out it was January 1st I'm excited for a new decade. And I told myself I'm going to lose weight. But then there was a pandemic white cops murder black man and other people that are rioting in August a building exploded in November a pedophile became president. And put the cherry on top they're still a pandemic and thousands of hundreds of people are died. Some people are saying 2021 will be better no no it won't to coronavirus is still going to go on. And if we're lucky world war 3 is going to happen next year so let's all pray to God that it won't happen. And my two cats died this year so yeah that the only bad thing that have happened. And also there ain't going to be a covid-19 vaccine. Why because science is going to mess it up. So if you think 2021 is going to be better you may as well stop hoping cuz it's just going to get worse.
