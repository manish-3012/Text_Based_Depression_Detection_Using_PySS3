Did I just go to the pool with a swim shirt and a pair of goggles so I can take a picture and submit it as â€œevidenceâ€ for PE? Yes, yes I did 


Did the one kid in the pool look at me like a crazy person as he saw me walk up to the pool, put on goggles, take a photo and then leave

Yes, yes he did
