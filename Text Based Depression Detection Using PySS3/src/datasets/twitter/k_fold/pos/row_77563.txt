Am I the asshole here? The other day, I (23M) was driving my car on my way to my mothers house (25F) on the way, I (23M) saw a Kindergarten class consisting of 17 children (5F) (6M) (6M) (6F) (5F) (5M) (6F) (5M) (5F) (6M) (5M) (6F) (5M) (6M) (6F) (5M) (6F) crossing the street. I (23M) really had to get to my moms house, so I (23M) couldnt stop. See, she has a clock that is very old-timey. She called me (23M) and said the clock says 6:09 lol epic! And I (23M) had to get their in time to take a picture and post it to Reddit for the Karma. I (23M) tried to swerve out of the way but ended up hitting and killing all 17 of the children (5F) (6M) (6M) (6F) (5F) (5M) (6F) (5M) (5F) (6M) (5M) (6F) (5M) (6M) (6F) (5M) (6F) am I the asshole? The cops are on their way and I need proof Im innocent.
