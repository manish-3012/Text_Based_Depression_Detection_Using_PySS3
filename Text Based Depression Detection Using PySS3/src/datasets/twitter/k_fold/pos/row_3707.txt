ALL I WANT IS TO TALK TO PEOPLE God I hate myself. Like seriously itâ€™s not that hard just respond with something appropriate, now is not the time to ape brain panic just because someone is giving you the slightest bit of attention. Fuck anxiety. Fuck life. If my mum wasnâ€™t alive I would have jumped in front of a truck already. Itâ€™s 3am and I probably wonâ€™t remember this in the morning, so go fuck yourself future me. Do some exercise, prick.
