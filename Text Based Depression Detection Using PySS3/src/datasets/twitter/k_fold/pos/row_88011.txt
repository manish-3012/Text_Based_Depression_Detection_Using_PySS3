Does anyone else just impulsively clean when theyâ€™re depressed? For like the past month Iâ€™ve been going through a rough patch in life and I havenâ€™t really been feeling myself but Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve been more cleanly. Everything else for me had been a mess, my grandadâ€™s on the brink of death, I canâ€™t go to school, Iâ€™ve barely been able to attend online classes on time, nothing humours me, I feel no motivation to much and I canâ€™t even get a full nights sleep but for some reason Iâ€™ve been cleaning more often than usual. Is this normal?
