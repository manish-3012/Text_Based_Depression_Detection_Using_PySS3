I just got off FaceTime with my girlfriend This is probably stuff thats a bit too old for most of the people on this sub but this is where I feel the most comfortable talking about it.

I just got off FaceTime with my girlfriend. We had a very long conversation about games weâ€™d want to play together and how we could make a thing out of it by streaming and everything. During listing off games she started to fall asleep. She eventually said she loved me and goodnight and asked me to just keep talking. I had a whole conversation with myself about womenâ€™s sports vs menâ€™s sports and other things similar. After a while I started talking about some more really personal things and then told her about what I want our future to look like.

She was asleep but I started describing to her how I want to get married. What I want to do once we are married. I talked to her about children and all the firsts that come along with them. Like holding our daughter at her first heartbreak and taking our son to his first baseball game. I let out my insecurities and talked about what scared me. I described all these amazing things and I hope they all come true in one way or another. I know sheâ€™s the one for me and she says Iâ€™m the one for her. I hope I can spend every day for the rest of my life showing her how much I love her.
