I feel bad I just blocked someone on reddit after lashing out. I fucked up and let my anger get the best of me, I feel shitty. Anyways Iâ€™m only on mobile and basically a lot of complications make it so I canâ€™t unblock them. I feel like an asshole. Iâ€™ve always found some way to fuck up every friendship I make.
