I'm Scared of My Future I matured very quickly as a young kid. I've always been bullied, ever since preschool, for three main reasons:

1. I'm physically weak - I'm slow, chubby, have poor hand-eye coordination
2. I'm socially awkward - Having Asperger's Syndrome, I try to bond with others, yet, with few exceptions, fail miserably
3. I'm nerdy - I have an interest in world history, philosophy, physics, astronomy, and mathematics, which doesn't help me in school trying to bond with others

And that's why I've matured so quickly. As a little kid, I vowed to be like an adult - I didn't want to be like my classmates. So I vowed to become an adult in a little kid's body. Even before that, I've always been in a rush to grow up. When I was a toddler, only a few weeks after I started speaking, I threw out my binky voluntarily, with no prodding from my parents. When I was in kindergarten, I wouldn't talk to other boys and always talk to the teacher during recess.

In addition, my family, with the exception of my father, has ruthlessly treated me like garbage. Every day my older brother beats me until I'm bruised and my mother has molested me. Also, ever since I was in first grade I've envied girls: I wanted to wear dresses and makeup, to have long hair, and be sweet and convivial. But I knew I'd be bullied, and so to this day, I suppress it.

Now I worry I'll never grow up properly. When I'm home alone, I spend my time watching cartoons and playing with toys from when I was younger. I'm worried that when I do get a job and move out, I'll become a manchild. I'm worried that I'll become an emotionally disturbed weirdo playing Pokemon and Scribblenauts into adulthood, watching Adventure Time and Gravity Falls instead of shows for adults. Like I'll be cuddling a large teddy bear watching We Bare Bears in 10 years.

Fuck, man.
