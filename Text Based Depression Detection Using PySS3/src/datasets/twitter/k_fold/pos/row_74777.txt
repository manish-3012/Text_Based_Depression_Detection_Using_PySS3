went on a camping trip in michigan (a Wuhan Flu hotspot) and just recently got back now the whole family feels weird. My dad feels queasy, my mom feels more tired than normal, I have a light cough, and my brother has a strong cough and feels some chest congestion.

may or may not be the covid-19, but we don't wanna risk it, so we're gonna self-quarantine for a few weeks to see what happens

I am a little bit worried
