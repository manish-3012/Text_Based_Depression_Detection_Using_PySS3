Tiktokers better not slither their way over to Youtube I swear, these people better not pollute Youtube and turn it into the same cesspool TikTok is. I donâ€™t want TikTok to get cancelled cause they are just going to hop over to Youtube. It happened when Vine got cancelled. Viners like Lele, Amanda Cerny, and Hannah Stockings came over. I hope TikTok does not get banned so all that crappy content stays in one place.
