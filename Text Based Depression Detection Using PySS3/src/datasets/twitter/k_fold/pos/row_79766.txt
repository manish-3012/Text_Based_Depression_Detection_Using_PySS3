Posting lyrics of songs I like, part 1 She sits alone by a lamp post

Tryin' to find the thought that's escaped her mind

She says, "Dad's the one I love the most

But Stipe's not far behind"

She never lets me in, only tells me where she's been

When she's had too much to drink

I say that I don't care, I just run my hands through her dark hair

Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away

And just let her cry if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing if it eases all her pain

Let her go, let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone, found a note standing by the phone

Sayin', "Maybe, maybe I'll be back someday"

I wanted to look for you

You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do

So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself

Sayin' let her cry if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing if it eases all her pain

Let her go, let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, let her be

No, no, no, no

Let her cry let her cry if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing if it eases all her pain

Let her go, let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be, ah

Last night I tried to leave, cried so much I could not believe

She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago

She went in the back to get high

I sat down on my couch and cried, yellin'

"Oh, mama, please help me"

Won't you hold my hand and

Let her cry if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing if it eases all her pain

Let her go, let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing, if it eases all her pain

Let her go, let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be

Ah, let her be
