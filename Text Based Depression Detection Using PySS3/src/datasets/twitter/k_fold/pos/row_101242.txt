Today I found out my crush likes my best friend. Title basically says it all. Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for a while now and today she texts me and says that she needed to tell me something so I called her and asked what it was. She then proceeded to tell me that she thinks she likes my best friend but sheâ€™s not sure. He has a girlfriend and she knows that but she still had to tell me that she likes him anyway. Now Iâ€™m upset and have no one to because she was the one I talked to about everything.
