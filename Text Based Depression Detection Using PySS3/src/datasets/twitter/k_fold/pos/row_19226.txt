I have a few questions So my dad punishes me in very harsh ways like outright taking my money that I get once a year from far away relatives because I said oh s*** because I seriously hurt myself he doesn't care about me getting hurt at all unless I have broken bones all he cares about is what bad things I do because I get hurt it's fine to have a swear jar but it's not okay to take away your child's money that they get from relatives because he injured himself and said oh s*** I hurt myself, I need help what do I do about this I feel like it's way too harsh
