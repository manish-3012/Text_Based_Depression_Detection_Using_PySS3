So I fell down the stairs So I fell down the stairs about 20 minutes ago and on my way down I hit about 6-7 steps before landing face first on the floor. Only me and my sister are at home since my parents are working and she asked what happened and I said that I fell, once she saw me I said I couldnâ€™t move and that I could barely breathe and she told me to toughen up as she walked away laughing
