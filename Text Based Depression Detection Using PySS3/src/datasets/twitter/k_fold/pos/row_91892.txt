I donâ€™t want to spend Christmas alone ): The holidays come up (in Australia) woo!! Right?
Normally, Iâ€™d be so happy, year 11 finally over and now Iâ€™ve got summer holidays! 
Time for the beach and adventure and strawberry picking and picnics and watching the stars and movie nights and boardgames.. 
only.. not. 
Only this time itâ€™s different, Iâ€™m almost 17, and pushed everyone I care about away. 
Thinking so much of myself that I hadnâ€™t thought about anyone else, 
They say itâ€™s okay to put your own needs first sometimes, but now Iâ€™ve ruined everything. 

Iâ€™m so grateful for the few people who have stayed by my side, despite how selfish Iâ€™ve been lately. I promise to change, or at least try my best to grow as a person. 

And I canâ€™t wait to spend summer with you &lt;3

-DMâ€™s open if anyone wants to chat (:
