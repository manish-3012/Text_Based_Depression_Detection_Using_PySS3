ok y'all this is a stupid question but i want the boys' take: do u ever leave someone u like on delivered, or do u only do that if ur not interested in talking to them? getting v mixed signals from this guy but i know he's shy and stuff so maybe he's just too scared to talk?? but like idk idk. give me the take but i know it's kinda dumb to get concerned about it/is diff for everyone.
