is it normal for girlfriends to call other dudes cute? so ive been with my girl for a year and she sometimes lets me know when she thinks other dudes are cute. especially when its with stories of her 

she just says she doesnâ€™t want to hide that she still finds other dudes cute and that she just finds me more attractive and better and thats why shes with me. 

took me some time to get over that but my moms making me question if this is normal or not. i picked her up from work recently with my mom and she told me a story of a guy that tried asking her out and that she thought he did something funnt and he was really  cute and she felt bad rejecting him. afterwards my mom told me she really didnt like her talking like that and said shes really scared im gonna get hurt.

ngl, kinda makes me insecure knowing how easily she can just find someone else. only thing that makes me feel better is how clingy and protective she is
