Let's take a moment to appreciate our online friend It's very shocking, there are sometimes that makes me think holy shit this beautiful person actually likes me , wow I can't it's been six months but it felt like years since I met you? It's really amazing to me I find people I like online and that they make me feel happy more than anyone else can. It's shocking that people far way can make you feel safe than your own family.

I just hope anyone who has a friend way across the globe to cherish them and if my friend is reading this thank you so much for being with me and I'll always be there for you no matter what. No homo tho I will marry you if you want
