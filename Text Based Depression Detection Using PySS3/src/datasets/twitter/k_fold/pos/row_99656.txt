I feel like my girlfriend is way out of my league I'm (M16) and my girlfriend (F16). I've been dating my girlfriend for only a month, she is a 10/10 in every department. Me on the other hand are a 6/10 face-wise, 4/10 intellect-wise and body-wise I am pretty short, skinny with a bit of lean muscle.

Overall I just feel like she is out of my league (especially physically). I feel confident in myself but comparing to her it feels as if she is can do so much better and there is better options. I don't feel particular comfortable with discussing this with anyone else, especially her so I don't really know what to do.
