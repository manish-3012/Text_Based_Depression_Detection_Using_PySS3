Starting today I'm going to give you a reason to stay till the end of the year You should stay because the odds of you being here is so incredibly small, and the fact you here is almost impossible. By being born you showed anything is possible. And the fact you're here, right now, reading this, is mind boggling. 

I love you &lt;3
