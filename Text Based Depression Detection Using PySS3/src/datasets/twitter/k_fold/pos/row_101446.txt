So I got a splint on a few days ago And it allows me to put things on easier. So today I decided to wear jeans for the first time today, and I was walking into the bathroom and I looked in the mirror, and Ngl I was checking myself out those jeans make my rear look goodðŸ˜³. Self confidence boost for the morning, which is nice.
