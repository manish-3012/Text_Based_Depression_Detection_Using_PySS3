A few weeks ago I saved my friend from suicide I was suspended from reddit, the day I got unbanned I checked all my online friends accounts and one was active on r/suicidewatch. He was gonna commit in a few days but I talked him out of it. We still talk to this day.

I was pissed I got banned (temporarily) but it saved his life in the end. I probably wouldnâ€™t of checked his account if that didnâ€™t happen.

(Btw I know I can check accounts and posts when banned but I just put down the app and took a break, it would of been terrifying if i check before because I wouldnâ€™t be able to message him and talk him out)
