Best way to convince parents that person I met on Reddit (who says they're 17) is in fact 17 and not 50? I have no friends and my parents don't seem to get that nobody my age uses Facebook, so when then asked me to try to make friends during a pandemic, I obviously turned to the internet. Only problem is, they don't seem to believe that there are actual teenagers on this platform, and when I made the mistake of telling my mother I found a friend to play Minecraft with, she promptly made me say I had to go.

So, how to verify someone's identity/convince my parents they're a real teen? I mean, I know their Reddit account, and that's evidence enough to me since I can look through everything they've ever posted or commented, but any tips on convincing the parents? I don't wanna stay alone. It's really starting to take a toll since my last friend finally stopped talking to me.
