Yeah otters are cool but have you ever seen ring tails? Theyâ€™re wayyyy cuter, and make for the perfect pet since they get along with other pets, are super affectionate, good mousers and mainly eat bugs and small rodents. (Also theyâ€™re native to Texas which by definition makes them cowboys, and cowboys are cool [also I live in Texas so, I can say all Texans are cowboys])
