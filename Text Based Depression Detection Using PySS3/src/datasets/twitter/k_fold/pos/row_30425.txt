Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 92 Eight Days Remain.  


Forgot to mention it earlier, but this is a double fact day. That was yesterday's fact, so here's today's! As usual, if you have any questions and/or topics for me to do a fact on, let me know! See you tomorrow!

Fact: When you hear the term "gas giant", what do you think of? Do you think of the four planets in the outer Solar System? Well, if you do, you are technically incorrect! Uranus and Neptune are (mostly) no longer considered gas giants, and haven't been since around the 1990s. Today, we call them *ice* giants, and there's a very important distinction between them and your regular ol' Jupiter-style giants!

To really see the differences between ice giants and gas giants, you must look at what they're made of. It isn't just "gas giants are made of gas, ice giants are made of ice"! The gas giants - Jupiter and Saturn - are mostly made up of two elements: hydrogen and helium. This makes sense, since they are the two most common elements in the Sun, but where it really starts to get good is when you go under the clouds at the very top. Although it may not be made of liquid rock - like we see here on Earth - the gas giants do have mantles. They're made of hydrogen that has turned metallic due to the intense pressure and temperature within the inside of the planet. Under the mantle is a tiny core made of rock and ice, with temperatures there reaching up to 20,000 K (19,727 degrees Celsius, 35,540 degrees Fahrenheit)!

The ice giants are different because they don't just contain hydrogen and helium. Sure, they have some, but they're also made up of heavier elements like oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Their upper clouds are still made of hydrogen, but they're **way** thinner than those seen on the gas giants. Beneath the clouds, their mantles look very different as well. They don't have metallic hydrogen mantles, but instead have mantles made of highly compressed liquid water and ammonia. These mantles would almost appear to be slushy!

The ice giants are fascinating to learn about, and there's still so much more we don't know about them! I know I've said it before, but we *need* to send a mission there as soon as we get a chance!
