Things to be grateful for today Puppy that bites my nose 

The bus route to my best friends house through my city 

His fat fat dog that we are about to take on a walk 

The bus driver that let me go on even though my bus pass was empty 

No traffic and the bus went a mile is five minutes !! 

Yeah :)
