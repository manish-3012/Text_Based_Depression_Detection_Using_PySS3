Does anybody remember Super Minecraft Maker? So I had a small burst of nostalgia today and  I remembered a server called Minecade which had a game called Super Minecraft Maker, the game was basically a bunch of small mini games with some stories sprinkled in. I decided to go back and play it but when I checked the game, there was no Super Minecraft Maker. I know for one hell of a fact it existed but does anybody remember that game?
