ive written 2 poems and i want to share them with my fellow teenagers Stepping and am struck by spring
The beauty of pollen swirls in haze
Vibrant foliage dances in a ring
Showing my front looking face
Wind in the leaves does love to sing
All thanks to the sun and itâ€™s uprising

&amp;

About the conversations I have at night and in evenings with everyone

My beautiful friends, 
Dark grey clouds pass overhead, 
Blocking sun from glowing brick red, 
Melancholic days stop cheerful feelings, 
Yet, I still feel delight, 
Tonight, bliss surrounds me right, 
Winsome ones set my joy alight,
My days now end sunny and jubilant

Writing poems is such a help to me when Iâ€™m stressed

Do yous like them.?
