Please donâ€™t take this the wrong way... I get it why people celebrate having a gf or bf but it gets to a point on this sub where I find a post every 5 posts basically saying â€œmy bf/gf is so amazing/hot/sexy ðŸ¤© ðŸ¥µðŸ˜«â€ and stuff. It does get to a point that it makes me feel insecure with me being single when I already feel lonely as it is. Enjoy having someone but please consider that it could effect someone mentally. â€¢[DISCLAIMER] I am not apposing relationship posts or people talking about their gf/bfâ€¢
