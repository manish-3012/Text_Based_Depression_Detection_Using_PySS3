I gotta get this off my chest So a while back I â€œdatedâ€ this boy for maybe 2 weeks. But he broke up with me because he was embarrassed to bring me to meet his parents because I am black. And theyâ€™re the typical rich whirs family. Idk that just kinda made me feel bad. So I dont count him as someone Iâ€™ve actually dated.
