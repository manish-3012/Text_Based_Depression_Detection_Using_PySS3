Well it happened. My girlfriend broke up with me. This isn't supposed to be a karma whore thing, but here we go. It mainly all started when she posted on her snapchat story that her mom can't support her and her brother. I felt bad and was talking to her about it. We usually say "goodnight :) &lt;3" or something like that when we go to bed, but then she stopped doing that with me. I kept talking to her and then yesterday I asked how she was feeling. She basically told me she liked her friend. (she's bi) and I met her friend before, and well  I was at school and I was being a big baby. I was trying to hold back the tears but I just had to go to the bathroom to let them out. She kept saying please don't cry, and I just couldn't stop. She told me she didn't like me like that anymore but hopefully we can still be friends. I want her to be happy, but I mean I'm not. I liked this girl more than any other girl, which sucked. Whenever I see her name i picture her beautiful face and I just feel like crying. Today she hasn't opened any snaps, and didn't respond when I just said "goodnight" last night. She left me on open. I said good morning today and no response. I think I need to ask a doctor for a new heart, cuz this one's broken.
