The moldy bread When i was in sixth grade we had to make a experiment with bread so i  brought the bread but a friend offer me some bread so for some reason i took the bread that he offered me instead of using my own, at the end of the day i didn't bring the little tupperware thing with the bread, through the year the bread got so moldy and i don't know why i didn't throw it, i got it there till the end of the year (i brought in the begining of the year)
