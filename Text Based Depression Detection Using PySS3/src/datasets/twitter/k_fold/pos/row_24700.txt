Help with parents. I need help, I feel swaddled by my parents, not necessarily spoiled but they just do a lot of things for me. I want to get out on my own and be able to do stuff by my self but my parents won't really let that happen. I was thinking of just hanging out with friends but then you know big rona hit so I kinda can't do that. Any advice would be helpful.
