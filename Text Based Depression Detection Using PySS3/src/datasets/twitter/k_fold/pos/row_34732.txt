I watched my dog get murdered in front of me, I don't know what to do My best friend in the world died today, and I was forced to watch the light leave his eyes. All I did was tie his leash up next to the entrance of our local market, I was just trying to help out and run an errand while I was taking him for his walk. I... I came out of the store to see two bastard dogs from the houses behind the store clawing the life out of him. He was too small and couldn't fight them off, so I beat the mutts away with the milk I just bought. I was too fucking late, and I feel that it's all my fault for leaving him outside and not hearing anything from inside. I feel so fucking terrible right now, he was the most important part of my life. 

Goodbye Reimi, I hope you can forgive me, just wait for me up there, boy, I'll come for you when I come for you
