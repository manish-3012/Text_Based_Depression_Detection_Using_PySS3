Iâ€™ve got a whole house for me only and Itâ€™s getting to make me feel anxious Okay so my dad went out to the Portugal (for personal things) and since he has cats I have to come some time to make sure theyâ€™re alright and since Iâ€™m currently in vacation I thought it would be cool to live in his house by the time heâ€™s not here. The thing is that Iâ€™m really feeling bad. I feel excruciatingly alone. Normally I would love that because I can just relax and enjoying doing nothing but only 2 days have passed Iâ€™m starting to feel bad. Like thereâ€™s always a voice in my head telling "you must do something productive and not waste your day by just relaxing" but Iâ€™m in VACATION and also, I little have nothing to do, i donâ€™t have any chores any homework, nothing ! Itâ€™s really starting to stress me. Any advice or things like that ?
