Some of my friends were just in a car accident My friends were driving down the road when a drunk driver ran a red light and T-Boned them in an intersection. My friend driving died, and the other three are now in the ICU.

I feel like complete shit right. One of my best friends since kindergarten is now dead, and I can't visit the other three in the hospital or even talk to a therapist because of Covid. I still can't get over how fast everything has happened. It just hurts right now.
