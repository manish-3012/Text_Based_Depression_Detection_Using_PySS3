#AllMen was actually trending today? Jesus fucking christ, I hate twitter. "We're not trying to paint all men under the same brush, but we're still gonna trend #AllMen so you *know* that gender makes you a piece of shit" If you unironically believe #AllMen you're a cunt, and you should feel like a cunt. You Cunt.
