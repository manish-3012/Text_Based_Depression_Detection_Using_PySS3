I have trouble expressing my feelings, so here's a poem I attempted  

Cascading down unlimited waves

Infinite ways

You broke my heart

It sounds cliche

But you tore it apart

Shredded to bone

Nothing but ash

And an engraved stone

Youâ€™re full of it

You useless shit

You cut me deep

And now I sleep

Picturing your face

Your ugly, stupid grace

Has left its marks

Jonaâ€™s arks

Crumble before you

Yet I still adore you

You dumb bitch I trusted you

Now youâ€™ve moved on to something new

And I can't control the spinning room

Lying about how I â€œhurt youâ€

If only you knew

How much I trusted you

You dumbass, I miss you.
