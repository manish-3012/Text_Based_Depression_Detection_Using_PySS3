What are some creative zoom pranks? **Note: this is a 2 credit college class where the TA is in charge and literally does no teaching.  The class is a joke and we won't be disrupting anything.** 

Me and some friends are looking to try some inventive zoom pranks to try to make some of the other students laugh.  We need some funny ideas that aren't just kidnappings or green-screen duplications of our faces.  Some ideas we've had are duplicating the teacher's screen, showing up in bondage, creating a feedback loop, and advertising an onlyfans.  Do you guys have any other ideas/pranks you've already done or want to try?

Cheers!
