Hey homies!... I'm going on a suicide mission. So our countrie's government has decided that they will take our Engineering and Medical entrance exams in the next month of September. They want 3 Million students to go outside of the safety of our houses to give a fucking entrance exam which they can even take in 2021. 

They say they won't Jeaprodize our careers for a Fucking pandemic that has killed millions of people worldwide and is still going on a killing spree. 

India is making world records in detecting new Covid19 cases. But, they still want to increase the curve. They are putting fucking lives of 3million families on the line to prove they are capable of handling the Virus. Ain't that great!



Although I hate to say this but please do the thing with the upside arrow button so more and more people could see this post and if you don't mind please tweet using #POSTPONEJEE_NEET

We need as much support as we could. I'm begging you guys to help me save myself and my family... Please help!
