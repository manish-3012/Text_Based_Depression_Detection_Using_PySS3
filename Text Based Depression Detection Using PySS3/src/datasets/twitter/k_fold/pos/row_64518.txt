Iâ€™ve got exactly 23 hours and 48 minutes remaining as a teen. Makes me sad that all those years went by so fast. It really flew and I wish I couldâ€™ve done a lot of things differently in that time. But oh well. Here we are.
Just wish I had someone to tell things too, that would mean a lot. Maybe next year. Just hurts to witness yet another year pass by doing absolutely nothing. Hoping next year will be different. Iâ€™ll try my best. But that never seems to matter. 

Itâ€™s been well. Thank you
