Have yall just encountered something and just like, nah ima sleep. So i hhave a counselling session that im supposed to do now but this time on teams and now i look at teams and realised i didnt get notified of my lecturer messaging me  so i missed that and now other things whhich make me want to disappear or sleep or listen to music and just ignore that it like it doesn't exists or that everything doesn't exist, like you and i dont exist, nothing does and that make me feel better.

It funny how i stressed myself out from having a counselling session, it ironic and stupid.

Now i just want to die.
