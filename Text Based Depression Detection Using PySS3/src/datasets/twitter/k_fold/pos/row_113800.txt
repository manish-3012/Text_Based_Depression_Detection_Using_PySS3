What's your favourite phone innovation in the last 5 years? We're in a weird stage where we're trying to break away from a slab design and experimenting with different builds. We've had displays where the screen creeps over the edges forming a side button, foldable phones and now there's the LG Wing, phones that double up as a projector and phones that can be controlled with an S pen or even a hand away from the phone (Samsung Galaxy Note series/ Google Pixel etc) I'm probably missing other technologoes too. 

What's your favourite innovation on the typical slab design? Personally, if I had to choose either of these to advance, I'd pick controlling your phone away from your phone via bluetooth stylus/hand swipes and gestures.
