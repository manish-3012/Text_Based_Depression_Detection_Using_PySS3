What is wrong with being lazy when youâ€™re not busy? So I woke up this morning, I went downstairs and started making a cup of coffee. My dad mustâ€™ve thought â€œthis is a good time to make fun of himâ€, he proceeded to make fun of me for wearing pajamas all day yesterday (nothing was planned) and mentioned something about how Iâ€™ll be lounging all day. I have a part time job (hours are shit and so is the pay) and I work Mondays and Thursdays at a rate of $8/hr from 4-8 oâ€™clock. I am also the only person who dusts, vacuums, picks up the fucking bird shit (2 cockatiels), cleans the cages, gives them food and water, empties the dishwasher and I do what ever other chores he asks of me.

So what is wrong with being lazy when you donâ€™t have plans or work? Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t do ANYTHING productive, I read, I work, I do chores, and in my down time I play video games and listen to music. I pay for all of my belongings that arenâ€™t necessities, I pay for my car insurance, my gas, and outings with friends (unless my dad offers to pay).

He comes home after his job, which admittedly is pretty exhausting, and does absolutely nothing besides stare and yell at the tv, makes dinner, and then yells at the birds and the tv again.

Am I lazy? And if I am is it acceptable laziness?
