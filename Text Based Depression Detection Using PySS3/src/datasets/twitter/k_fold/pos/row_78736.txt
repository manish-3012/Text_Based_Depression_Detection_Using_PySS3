It's incredible to me that all of us are made out of the same stuff. Bears, dogs, whales, and deer all experience love, sadness, and hunger the same way we do.

I was watching a video of grizzly bears catching salmon, as they do, and the video focused one mama bear who caught her first fish of the day. She was hungry, and I just know that to her, that raw, barely-dead salmon tasted just like a burrito does to me. And the blood and guts of that fish were salty and satisfying just like the sauces and fillings of a burrito are to me. And she wanted to devour that fish just like I would devour a burrito. But she had cups, and so she sacrificed her own satisfaction because she loves her kids and she knows they're hungry too. And in nature, I don't think animals think too much. They basically go off pure emotion. And so that mama bear sacrificed her satisfaction out of pure love, which I think is sweet.
