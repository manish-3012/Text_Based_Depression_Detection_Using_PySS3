Dad beat me up yesterday Got into an argument and he grabbed my hair and threw me aroung like a ragdoll. Proceeds to choke me and drga me around evreywhere. After that he warned me that if i make him mad again he wont hold back. 

The thing is here is i have terrible parents and they act all nice and good around other people. I cant wait till i get older and move away from them. The thing is they want a apology from me. For being "rude" and "disrepspectful" even though i was just making a valid point. My life is so fucking shit and my parents r the sole reason for that. This isnt the first time this happened but they do a ton of other shit terrible shit. Added to that they think im a spoiled kid and always say shit like "ur never gonna survive in college lazy kid" and other stuff. Im tired of my parents theyre doing such harm and they think they're the good ones. I always get envious when i see kids my age with good parents and it hurts alot. I hate them to death
