I dont want to die My grandma recently had a swab test and from what it looks like, she got it. My aunts and uncles and cousins were probably
 were tested too and it scares me if they got covid. I was contemplating suicide and now that death is probably waiting for me, its pretty fucking scary. I dont wanna miss out on life, i dont wanna die early, i wanna live a long life. Im shaking right now and panicking.
