Iâ€™m in a dilemma right now So, the girl Iâ€™ve liked for a while now is ready for a relationship, which is good, but thereâ€™s another dude who likes her. This guy was talking to her on the bus, and accidentally told her he was gonna ask her out soon, so I need to get on her best side, and put the odds in my favor, cause at the moment, they barely arenâ€™t. Should I ask her out tonight, or wait to see what happens?
