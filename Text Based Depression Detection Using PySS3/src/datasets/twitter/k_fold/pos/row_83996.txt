I'm in "random-zone" So i have crush on girl that has been my friend for years but we lost touch about year ago. From time to time i write messeges to check how is she and whatsoever. Nearly every time she answers something like: "good, (i'd like to type here blah blah, but her texts are shorter than my pp), and you sir?". "Sir" really? Or mister, or "and you colleague?". I just call it random-zone since its the way you talk to random strangers, or random friends of your friends that you don't really know but you want to be polite. I want to be back in friendzone when(where?) we talked about anything and everything, no, when we even talked...
TL:DR My crush messenges me "sir" as i was someone random in her life
