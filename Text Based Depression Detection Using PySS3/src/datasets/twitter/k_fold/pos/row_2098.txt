I wanted to talk about engineering students I'm going to try engineering this year and I'm very nervous because I'm going to have a new class and I don't know if I'm going to have difficulties and I saw some people talking badly about engineering students, I just wanted to say that not everyone is like that, including me and I also wanted to say that it makes me even more anxious, I understand what some people mean. Sorry if I misunderstood (sorry for the bad English, I used google translator)
