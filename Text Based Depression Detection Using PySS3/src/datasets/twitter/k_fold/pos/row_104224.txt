happy birthday to me itâ€™s my birthday yayy, but no one cares. thatâ€™s fine, i barely care. anyways iâ€™m sobbing in bed at 3 am because of this stupid bitch iâ€™ve liked since september 2019 and ik he doesnâ€™t like me and thatâ€™s ok but iâ€™m so consumed in the thought of him and i just wish it would go away. i canâ€™t live like this anymore. every night i sit in my bed and cry myself to sleep because of this kid (and other stuff but thatâ€™s for another time) and i just canâ€™t handle it anymore. anyways have a nice day to the stranger who is reading this :)
