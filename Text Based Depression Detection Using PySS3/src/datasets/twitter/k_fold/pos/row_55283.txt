I have problems So, basically i want to become a programmer and I'm slowly learning sum programming languages BUT instead of spending my free time on learning how to code, i just play videogames all the time.

 I just cannot be bothered to do the thing. Please tell me some of the methods on how i can  optimize my time and spend more time coding.
