I genuinely feel happy You see, yesterday, November 6th, I turned seventeen, and it was quite possibly one of the happiest days of my life, so much I wanted to share it with you guys and tell you that you might not be alone.  


Right at the start of the day, literally 12 am, i received a call from my friends and I was like what is this about as I didn't expect anything, I answer and they go, "he's here, 1, 2 Happy birthday to you, etc" you know the drill, then they took turns to say some really positive and wholesome things to me, saying they appreciated me and accepted me just as I am despite everything that has happened jntil that day. I'm not a really kind or socially smart person, and I am sincere and direct, but that combined with not much tact made me a little bad you know. I sometimes feel down and lonely, and I'm basically always negative af, but that call, the messages and calls from family, made me happy.  


And that's not all they did, those same friends prepared me another special call on zoom with even more friends who couldn't call in the morning. And they prepared a power point presentation with messages and drawings for me. I don't know what I have done to deserve all that love and everything but I cried out of happiness mid call. I really needed that.  


So, if you need someone to talk to, or a little advice, DM me, and don't worry about anything, everything you need is a friend who can catch you when you fall and push you again when you feel like walking again
