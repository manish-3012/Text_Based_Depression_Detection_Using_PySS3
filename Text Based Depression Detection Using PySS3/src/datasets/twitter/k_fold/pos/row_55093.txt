A heart racing, a fumbling, a sound of glass clinking Never done this before, breaking every moral formed to date

The burn is nothing, or just don't notice it

Lightness, calm mind, uneasy happiness

Relaxation, senses regained.

Surely this is my true self.

Penut butter swallowed to mask the smell, and a brushing of teeth

Stumbling, music on. Fun.
