I like dark humor

I'm kinda an emotionally soft person.
I don't game 
I'm looking to have fun conversations and whild I try to be supportive, please don't make me the person you just come to in order to dump your emotional baggage. I'm completely fine if you do that. Bit it can't just be a hit and run.
