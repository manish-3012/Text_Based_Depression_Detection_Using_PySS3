I don't care about the state of the sub now. People are now going crazy and shit through these text posts and I just want you to sit next to the fire with me. I just wanted to write down some shit and post it here. [Here, sit right next to me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_LUpnjgPso)

Even if this sub is or will be in shambles, it's still nice to see some people and their achievements through many things right? That girl with her first car, that was nice to see someone get a car. That person that announced that they got into many college programs, I said "Holy shit, congrats." in my mind. For all I know, someone might find an entire dinosaur skeleton in their backyard! 

However, did you notice a trend in the memes of this subreddit? It always goes like this, meme gets popular -&gt; people complain about said meme -&gt; a few days later there is peace there are now a few weeks of calm. I always expect this now when I see a lot of memes that are the same, I always do.

Let's get off topic on the sub, and talk about sleep schedules. Mine sure is messed up. I'm writing this at 1:42 in the morning, and my parents are still awake. But, it is nice to stay up sometimes when you just want to get calm. Sometimes it's terrible to stay awake, especially if you haven't got into an unconscious state in the last 18 hours. Plus, this is just natural right? It is! Your circadian rhythm is reset when you are an adolescent, thus you fall asleep later at night and wake up later in the day.

Screwdrivers are nice. They have flatheads, a head for a guy named phillip. What tools do you think you would need in the future? I for sure know that you would need a phillips and flathead screwdriver, a hammer, and a wrench. Flashlights sure would be useful, but I think our phones got that covered.

Anyways, I took way too long and probably made some people scroll past this post thinking that they don't have the time to read it, but to the people that read this, thanks for reading my near bedtime thoughts.
