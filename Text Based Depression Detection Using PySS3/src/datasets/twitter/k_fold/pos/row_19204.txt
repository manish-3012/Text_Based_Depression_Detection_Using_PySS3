So something happened while me and my bfs were cuddling Ok normal cuddle while absolutely getting bombed in cards against humanity. Except this time he fucking just casually pets me for a few seconds. FUCKING PETS ME. But not in like a kinky way or in a furry way, it was just a general sign of affection such as a hug. The thing is this was actually  r e a l l y  nice (much nicer than I would like to admit). It took me a few seconds to register what had happened but once I did I basically was internally screaming being fueled off of serotonin. So moral of the story headpats are underrated af (11/10 would recommend)
