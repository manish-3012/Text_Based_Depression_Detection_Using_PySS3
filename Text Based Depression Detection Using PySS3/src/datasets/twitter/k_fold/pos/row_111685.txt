I had the weirdest dream My dream started out as a normal insignificant dream. I was doing an obstacle course for some reason idk. But then I just wasnâ€™t doing the obstacle course anymore (I honestly donâ€™t know what happened itâ€™s hard to remember some parts). And then I saw this girl that I know. I donâ€™t know here in real life, but I knew her in the dream. I just knew it was someone that use to go to elementary school with me, that I hadnâ€™t ever really talked to that much. Then we just started talking, i dont remember what it was about but it doesnâ€™t really matter. Then she hugged me and the dream just stopped. It didnâ€™t end. Time didnâ€™t even really stop in the dream. I was just standing there hugging this random person. And I felt so warm to hold someone. It felt like someone actually fucking cared about me. It felt like someone wanted me there. Like there was a reason for me to be alive. And I got that much emotion just from a fictional hug from a fictional person. How fucking sad is that? I just kinda woke up after a little while, and I realized that that dream made me feel better than I did in a long time. And all from just one person who didnâ€™t exist slightly caring about me in a dream. I really gotta stop having such a sad life. Because if I felt better in a dream then I almost always feel in real life, thereâ€™s a problem.
