Nice in zoom class yesterday So yesterday I was in my Health zoom class, my teacher was talking about calories and shit. And while he was talking about the number of calories for something idk I donâ€™t remember, he said something about 69 calories. And then my teacher paused, before saying â€œ69? Thatâ€™s nice.â€ Iâ€™m still laughing about it funniest shit Iâ€™ve ever seen.
