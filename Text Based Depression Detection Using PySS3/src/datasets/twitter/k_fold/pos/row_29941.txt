What does "I'll save it for laterðŸ˜³" mean So like me and this person are texting and they say "So do you promise to send me a picture of yourself if I do" and i say yes

Then they send me a picture and i send one back

The person says "I'll save it for laterðŸ˜³" and I'm confused 

Like what do I say, what does it mean
