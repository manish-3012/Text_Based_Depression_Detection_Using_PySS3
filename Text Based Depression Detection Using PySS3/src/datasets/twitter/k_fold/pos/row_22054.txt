imo dubstep / electronic music fucking sucks on shitty earbuds/headphones. It benefits so much from hifi headphones and then is amazing. I'm listening to marshmello and deadmau5 on these new IEMs (basically earbuds but better) I got and they're just so fucking good. I've heard the wireless earbuds that are considered the best and better than airpods and shit, and they don't come close to this. The funny thing is they are wired, but I got a bluetooth adapter for them and they're still better than the mainstream airpods shit just because they have higher quality drivers which apple and bose and shit won't sell you because they can just sell you their branding instead.
