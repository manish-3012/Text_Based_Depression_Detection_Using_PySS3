I have experienced the most potent form of nostalgia than I ever have in 16 years. Iâ€™m sitting in my room talking to my little brother, when I hear very faintly from my living room,

*â€Thereâ€™s a hundred and four days of summer vacatiooon...â€*

So, because I havenâ€™t heard the song in close to 7 years I rush out into the living room, and slam against the wall in the process (my shoulder still kinda hurts). I make my way out there to see that my dad had put Phineas and Ferb on for himself to watch. No judgment from me though, cause who doesnâ€™t like Phineas and Ferb?

Nonetheless, I am filled with pure, unadulterated happiness. After years of not having heard the theme song to the show, I am able to perfectly recite it, while dancing, all in front of my dad, who is watching me in awe. Suffice to say, Iâ€™ve only been that happy once or twice before in my life. I regret nothing.

And now, I am continuously re-watching the legendary show, and have been able to sing every song so far without messing up. This show is so legendary, that itâ€™s been permanently engrained into my mind. I hope that those of you reading this get to experience what I did, it will change your life.

TL;DR: Danced to and sung the Phineas and Ferb theme in front of my dad, because I havenâ€™t heard the song in years and it made me really happy.
