My dad just pretty much gave me the option of passing Latin or killing myself, and Iâ€™m kinda leaning toward the second option So for some context, I am currently failing Latin for 3 reasons.

1. The teacher fucking sucks and his way of teaching is the literal worst
2. I joined the class 2 weeks late, so I have already been behind
3. I didnâ€™t want to be in this fucking class in the first place. I have a passion for music and art so I was really happy when I was in those at the beginning of the year, but my dad was furious I wasnâ€™t in Latin so he took me out of my art classes and now I have Latin 5 days a week.

We got into an argument about my grade and he was talking at me about how is it possible I got a 40 on a take home quiz and I started to explain that not everything is on google and apparently saying at some point that it was a dead language was a mistake. He started screaming at me and said that I canâ€™t blame other people for the fact that I am a failure and that this shitty grade is going on my permanent record and honestly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be alive long enough to get to college so yeah thatâ€™s not much of an argument point.

My dad knows I have cut myself before and his reaction to it is hit me. I have about 7 really deep cuts on my leg where nobody can see them, but when he sees me poke myself with a pencil when Iâ€™m stressed with homework his reaction is to snatch the pencil and hit me hard on the arm. He also refuses to take me to therapy so Iâ€™m not allowed to complain in my life because I go to a private Catholic school and have a good family who provides for everything I need. The past few months have been really fucking hard for this one fucking class and I canâ€™t.

This was supposed to be a good year. All the people who sucked in school left and I had all easy and good classes. I had a few friends for once. 

When my dad was yelling at me, I was just in my own mind making myself not cry or react.
