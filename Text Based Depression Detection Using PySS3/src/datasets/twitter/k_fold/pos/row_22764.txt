Cant feel emotions anymore So a while ago i decided to try and not feel pain physically and i actually succeeded. Now people can kick my nuts and it will only tickle. I then thought â€œwhat if i also could control emotional painâ€. It has been like 4 months and now emotions are like a switch in my brain where i can turn it off and on any time. This is also great as now i have absolutely 0 crushes whereas last time i had a bunch. I could also immediately fall in love with someone if i wanted to.

Didnt know where to posts this but i see it as a great achievement.
