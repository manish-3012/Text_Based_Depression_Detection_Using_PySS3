Sooo, I'm at the bridge again, thinking that I can conquer my fears, but I was wrong, so so fucking wrong. 

I thought I could do it, I thought I was strong, that I could go to the bridge and look down without thinking about jumping.

I am broken. Slowly killing myself. I need to be fixed. I am not perfect. I'm so sorry, I tried everything I could not to disappoint you. I am not the perfect daughter/friend/whatever you think of me as you imagined. I'm sorry.

I don't wanna starve myself, but I have to. The voice tells me I'm still fat. I don't wanna cut myself, but I have to. The voice tells me I'm too scared to do that. I don't wanna disappoint anyone, but I do. Because I'm fucking worthless. 

I don't wanna do these things, I don't wanna be a burden, but I am, and I'm so sorry.

If I would leave, would you think I did that for attention? Another girl who wanted to be a whore? 

I am so sorry, that I cut myself, that I'll let go. That I'll step into nothing and fall to my end. I'm so sorry.
