Does anyone else feel this way? Idk what's wrong I don't have crazy overly religious parents I have everything I could ask for I should be happy...but I'm not. I just feel disconnected like I shouldn't be here I have no  idea how to put how I'm feeling into words. I just want to be alone. Every night I stay up late past everyone else in my house and I just feel trapped in my own house. I want to just pack my backpack with food, water, and clothes take my longboard and get as far away as possible. I want to ride to the nearest train tracks and hop on a freight train and go were ever the fuck it takes me. Idk what to do I feel like I'm going insane I just need to vent I guess.....
