Whatâ€™s your opinion on the Fortnite vs Apple ordeal? For those of you who donâ€™t know for every purchase in the AppStore (including in app purchases) Apple gets 30% of the revenue through direct purchase through the App Store sÃ³ what Fortnite is doing is making their own direct purchase so that Apple wonâ€™t get their 30% cut so what apple did in retaliation is blocking Fortnite from the AppStore and now Fortnite is just dissing apple every now and then. But before choosing a side please keep in mind that Epic games did violate the terms of use of the AppStore by doing their own direct purchase
