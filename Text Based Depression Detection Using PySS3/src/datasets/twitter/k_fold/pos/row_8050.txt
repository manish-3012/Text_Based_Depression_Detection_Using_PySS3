I just remembered that my ex exists and now I canâ€™t stop thinking about when we broke up The reason why is because I donâ€™t even remember why or when exactly we broke up. I think it was around last spring but Iâ€™m not sure whether it was early or late spring. I was pretty broken mentally at the time and I spent a lot of time just sleeping my days away. The only other thing I remember from around that time is me putting on John Coltraneâ€™s album Ascension and getting back to bed. 

How the fuck do you even forget shit like this?
