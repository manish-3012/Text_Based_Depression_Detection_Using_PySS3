Today a something unbelievable happened Today i was with school and my class in park we had some special training there. After some time of me reading of boom under tree and not much socializing with my classmates because they don't much like be cause they are happy and so innocent and i am a..... I am me a redditor and introvert guy. After some time i changed position from under the tree to better one so the sun will shine on me. Accidently i sat next to my 2 classmates who were fine just we don't talk with each other a lot and theyr friend from other school which also had a special training there. After some time i joined their conversation and start taking with her and at the end it was just me and her taking about people who we know and stuff it wasn't long conversation but at the end she asked me for my Instagram and left. Now at home a realized what happened. It feels weirdly good and happy.
