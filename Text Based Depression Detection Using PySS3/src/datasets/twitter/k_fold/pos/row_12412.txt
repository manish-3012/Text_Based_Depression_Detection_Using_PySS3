Random song lyrics until I get a girlfriend day #3. From the song How Did You Love by Shinedown â€œThe one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love, how did you love?
It's not what you believe; those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love, how did you love, how did you love?â€
