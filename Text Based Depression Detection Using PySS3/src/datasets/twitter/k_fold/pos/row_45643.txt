I tried to kill myself and my mom noticed So this is nothing new, i try to kill myself very often but this month is the worst . My mom has very high expectations from me, she literally wants me to score more than 75 in every subject out of 80

Of course  I wasn't able to score more than 70 in any subject and mom's been reminding me how useless i am since the report day so i just can't resist hurting myself and no matter how much I try,  nothing happens to me, I recently tried to cut my hand but instead of killing me it just left a big scar and mom noticed she didn't say anything but I heard her talking about that with dad

I can come up with excuses most of the time but the scar is near my nerves, so please help me with excuses
