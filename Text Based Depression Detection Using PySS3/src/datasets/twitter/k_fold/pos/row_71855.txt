i hate south east london ðŸ˜­ especially stockwell/brixton, istg itâ€™s where all the crackheads get together. i went to a restaurant with my mum and sister and we sat by the window, and then a guy outside notices my mum and knocks on the window to try and get her attention, what for? just go on with your life smh- she didnâ€™t even notice btw lmao. but fr i hate going there, one other time a man smashed his glass bottle on the floor less than 2m away from me...
