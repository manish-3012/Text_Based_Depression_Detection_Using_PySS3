How are people able to go on discord so easily? I have been in the App Store trying to download discord for the past 30 minutes. Not because it wonâ€™t download, itâ€™s because I keep on thinking about how everything could go wrong. And itâ€™s making me more nervous to download it. I just want some help on ARGs. But what if theyâ€™re on a call? Phone calls are terrifying, for a girl I have a deep voice, so what if they donâ€™t like my voice? Or what if they think Iâ€™m stupid. Texting people is short of okay, but calling is another thing. (Just so you understand I have social anxiety)
