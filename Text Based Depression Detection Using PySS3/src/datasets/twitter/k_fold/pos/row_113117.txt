Plan #653 to visit my girlfriend To all who did not see my earlier post, I'm in a long distance relationship, and I'm trying to bridge the gap between me and my girlfriend! My previous attempts have failed, but I have a new plan! 

So my previous plan had me waking up in the E.R, and that gave me an idea! What if I strapped a wheelchair to each of my arms and legs and surfed to my girlfriend's home? How does that sound?
