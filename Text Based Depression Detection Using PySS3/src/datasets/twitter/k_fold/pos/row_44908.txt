Iâ€™m scared to ask my friend out for valentines. Hey teens, I really want to ask my friend out for valentines, I made a Minecraft flower in a paper pot for her. We play Minecraft together on my realm for a while, and we sorta recently rekindled our friendship. We get along well and have similar humor. And tomorrow we see each other at school and thatâ€™s when I want to give the gift and and the question, but the problem is I have been very unsuccessful with other girls in the past and never asked anyone out since. Im just so nervous I donâ€™t know wether to go through with it. And I didnâ€™t want to ask my parents for advice so I came to you guys.
