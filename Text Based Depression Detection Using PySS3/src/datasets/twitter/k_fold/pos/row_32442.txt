I finally got my first real, proper job TL;DR: My first job has reignited my love for life. 

Not expecting many people to care about this but I finally got a job! I left school almost a year ago now and itâ€™s been super difficult finding a job because of my age, location and this little thing that happened that you mightâ€™ve missed, think itâ€™s a global pandemic or something, idk. 

But now I work in a garden centre and honestly itâ€™s very chill and I high key love it. Itâ€™s very tiring though, like I thought I was tired after school but oh boy that was nothing compared to this! Not every job will be like that and I do still enjoy what I do, even if Iâ€™ve only been there for one day.

Sooooo yeah, if u read then thanks for reading. Just wanted to share my joy I guess. Just remember there is a world beyond school, and life is friggin awesome in it.
