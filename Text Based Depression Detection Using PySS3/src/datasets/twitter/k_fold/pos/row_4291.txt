Which anime protagonist has suffered the most and why? I'll say subaru from re:zero, he has a power called "return by death" which makes it so he can get cheakpoints and when he dies he to those cheakpoints. This sounds good but because of this he had to people and some of his friends die in front of him multiple times. He's been tramatized alot.
