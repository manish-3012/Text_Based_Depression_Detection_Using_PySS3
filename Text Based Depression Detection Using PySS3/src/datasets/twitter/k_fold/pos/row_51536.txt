I still like him. We used to be together, but then he ended up leaving me for her... They broke up though.

I sent him a text of how much I love him, but it seems like he blocked me I told my guy friend (also his friend) to send it to him, he said he never replied to it.

Itâ€™s been two months since we broke up.
We havenâ€™t talked since then.

I saw him staring at once last week.

I still like him, but I know he doesnâ€™t like me anymore but I donâ€™t wanna give up.

 I donâ€™t know what to do.
