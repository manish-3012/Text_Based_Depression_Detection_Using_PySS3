My friends just ditched me to go talk to girls So idk where really to ask but but does anyone have advice to meet new people during all this because I would love to have more friends or maybe even a gf because I really only have 2 friends one is always talking to his gf and the other lives 9 hours away from me. Anyway I just want to be as happy as my friend is with his gf and all of his friends, so does anyone have any advice on how I can meet more people. 

I know this was a long rant I just needed to get some stuff out.
