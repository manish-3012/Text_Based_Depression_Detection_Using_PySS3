My parents are taking over my life. I need to vent. I don't know where to post this, but I just need to vent. My parents have recently begun taking my phone and computer at night after I stayed up a little late fixing problems with a server I own. I'm aware this is bad, but I use my pc as a way to escape my daily life. My parents track my location, control who I'm friends with, sign me up for sports \*they\* want me to do, and ignore things I want to do. If I bring any of this up, they always accuse me of bullying or hating them.

I know they want the best for me, but I don't feel like I have my own life anymore. I want to move out, but I'm too young and can't get a job to feed myself, and I have virtually no savings. I also feel like my problems are all in my head because everyone else loves my mom and dad.

Ive had thoughts of cutting after nearly 8 months clean. My body looks especially ugly to me, and I can't resist the urge to starve myself again. Every time my life is looking up, something throws a curveball my way.

I don't know if I'm actually struggling, because so many people would kill to have parents with money, but I feel like I would rather live on the streets. I don't know if I'm looking for a scapegoat to blame all my shortcomings on, either. I genuinely feel so stuck, though.

Sorry for being such an edgy teen, but I just needed to spew out all my feelings. :)
