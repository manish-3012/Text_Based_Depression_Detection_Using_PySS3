HOLY SHIT SHE SAID YES Hell yeah, confessed to my crush and she likes me back! fucking pog  


  
Edit: to ya'll who feel lonely, just tell the person you like that you like them, if you're close friends and enjoy their company. Just ask that you want to be friends even if they don't like you back. Sure, you'll feel lonley, but there is ALWAYS someone out there.
