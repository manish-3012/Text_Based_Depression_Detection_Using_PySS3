Poem thing. Feedback? Nothing was was the same, and I feared it never would be again.

Months had passed since the accident, and it had begun to take a toll on me, the days got longer, I tire easier, fog seems to be manifesting in my mind. My perception of the world around me is getting more alien to me by the day. 

I look forward to the moments where I feel most safe.

Showers, meals, the feeling of my coffee warming up in the morning.

I feel like a shadow of myself, only existing if my real self is present. Never had I had so many people around me in my life, yet felt so alone.

Itâ€™s almost as if the more Iâ€™m comforted, the less I feel it. It feels common and not special, like a kind gesture more than genuine concern.

Iâ€™m still here though, hanging on by threads, peering into my friends and familyâ€™ lives.

Watching.

Observing.

Youâ€™d think I would cry myself to sleep at night, but I donâ€™t. I want to, but every night I find the odd scrap of dignity and self worth I have, and hold back the tears.

Maybe thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve held on these past months, not wanting to go until I really needed to, until I fully broke down, fully crossed the line that is insanity.

I need to start over, to put all of this behind me, to push forward and sow my future anew.
