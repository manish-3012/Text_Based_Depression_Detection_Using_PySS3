My 1 am ramblings Hello! Itâ€™s 1 am and I should definitely be asleep. Anyway have you ever thought about life? Itâ€™s a big concept isnâ€™t it. Now if you were religious itâ€™s a lot easier to think about life, weâ€™re created to show Godâ€™s magnificence or sum shit (idk Iâ€™m not religious). However, for any non-religious folks, what is the point of life? Nothing we do will have an affect in the grand scheme of things. Eventually the universe will die, our legacy will NOT live on and everything we did will have been for naught. So I suppose life is meaningless. But it is definitely fun, so many small moments you enjoy in life. Itâ€™s still all for naught when you die though. Sometimes Iâ€™m extremely curious what comes after death, but I can wait and see
TL;DR life is meaningless, enjoy it
