How has your school/work schedule been affected by the pandemic? I ask this because I wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation as myself. At the start of the semester, the school days were split up between last names. (A-K went on Monday and Wednesday, L-Z went on Tuesday and Thursday.) Some of my friends went to school on the opposite day as me, so the only time I was able to see them was outside of school. A few months went by, and the school board decided to join both A-K and L-Z. This was an interesting experience for me, as the people I went to school with nearly doubled. My question is if others have faced a similar experience.
