Stupid crush that wonâ€™t go away So new school year and all right? Senior year and all that jazz. So I Had a bad time with a girl back in sophomore year and kinda swore off of High-school relationships, thinking them pointless and inherently temporary. 

So itâ€™s a new school year and this girl from my old class texts me asking how Iâ€™m doing? Nothing unusual lots of my old friends are and were girls right? So we start chatting since we hadnâ€™t talked in a year and have been stuck in quarantine all summer. Before I know it weâ€™ve been talking for 5 hours itâ€™s 2am and weâ€™re laughing out asses off. 

First I chalk it up to quarantine stress getting to us but itâ€™s been three days and I canâ€™t get her off of my mind, I keep thinking how beautiful she is or how funny she is or how sheâ€™s one of the few people I can have Interesting conversations with and Iâ€™m starting to fear Iâ€™ve got a serious crush. What do I do?
