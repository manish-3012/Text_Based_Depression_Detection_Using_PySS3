Ya ever go back and read a book from your childhood and realize how dumb it is? Like I used to really like the dork diaries series back in middle school

And itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve just now realized itâ€™s absolutely trash, but itâ€™s just so I guess â€œgenericâ€?

Like with Diary of a Wimpy Kid, it feels like an actual middle schooler with Greg being a remorseless asshole and sociopath with no sympathy for his friends or family with his only goal in life to bring harm onto those around him like any kid

But in Dork Diaries, Nikki is basically one of those characters where everyone likes her and if they donâ€™t theyâ€™re the obvious villain, and Nikki can only do good things or quirky funny things

Like besides that, dork diaries is alright I guess, but I really hate stories like that

Also Nikki dabbed and did orange justice. ðŸ¤¨
