ice lolly thatâ€™s a funny name. i donâ€™t actually know what theyâ€™re called

iâ€™m eating one right now after like 3 years. i had these really odd food rules which included only drinking water or energy drinks. i saw these popsicles as frozen juice so i just didnâ€™t eat them

obviously i didnâ€™t follow 100% of my â€œrulesâ€ but for some reason this one really stuck but look at me now

itâ€™s really funny actually. iâ€™d say no to ice cream on a hot summer day then drink like four times the amount of calories in alcohol that same night

i donâ€™t know how my mind worked like that but it did
