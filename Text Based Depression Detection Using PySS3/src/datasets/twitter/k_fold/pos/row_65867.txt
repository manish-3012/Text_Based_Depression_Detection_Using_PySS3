Yâ€™all know more about this? So Iâ€™ve had a rough week (need to get a higher dose on my antidepressants) but thatâ€™s besides the point. So me and my best friend were having a convo on  her family, cuz itâ€™s shit (anti lgbtq+ pro trump yada yada yada) then she made a joke â€œI want to say Iâ€™m non binary to spite themâ€ and I said say smth like your bi cuz itâ€™s more believable then, then she says â€œI amâ€ my response is clearly â€œNaniâ€. So I was apparently the second person she came out to and I was obviously supportive (Iâ€™m no asshole) then she tryâ€™s to give be a run down on what lgbtq+ means cuz I was having a hard time with spelling (always do and always will) and she also said all of her friends are lgbtq+ so I had to ask the obvious question that was a bit questionable tho so I ask.....what about my ***** (my crush) and she said â€œfind a different crushâ€ so thatâ€™s unfortunate but whatever. Anyways Woop my friend trusts me that much and now wtf do I do. I explained her family so wtf am I supposed to do to help her. That just made things so much more complex because sheâ€™s already near depression cuz of everything (showing almost every symptom and shit) and now I have this much more to work around and meanwhile Iâ€™m as straight as I am pale. The snoo isnâ€™t even as pale as me. Halp



Also please be quick cuz she got reddit recently and Ill have to deleted this.
