Teenagers of Reddit, thereâ€™s a woman on Instagram who squashed a cat until heâ€™s dead and her account is still up! Dear Teenagers of Reddit, There is an instagram account named angelaalvarez507_ It is a cat torturing fan group and in their website they fucking squash a cat until his eyes pops out

Itâ€™s so fucking cruel and sad. And itâ€™s been 3 WEEKS AND SHE STILL DIDNâ€™T EVEN GET A FUCKING BAN!

Please everyone, letâ€™s report the wix website, and report the instagram account. At least letâ€™s prevent sick motherfuckers meeting each other online.
