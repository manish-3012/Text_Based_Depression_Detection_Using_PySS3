My gf and I are having a pregnancy scare. Me [M15] and my gf F[17] (today was her birthday) made a bit of a mistake. We were getting intimate and she wanted me to put it in and I did. I didnâ€™t go past her hymen and I didnâ€™t cum inside of her, and I didnâ€™t even go for 20 seconds (not bc I didnâ€™t last long but bc somebody was coming) next weekend she comes over and brings condoms, and this time I â€œpop her cherryâ€ the second I saw her face I stopped because she looked like she was in a lot of pain. I felt like ass because of what had happened and kept apologizing, and she just kept saying it was okay. Earlier she had told me she was gonna start her period soon, and that when she got home she could tell the difference between period blood and the blood from â€œpopping her cherry.â€ Abt 2 days after she realizes precum pregnancies are possible and I was like yeah did you not know that and she didnâ€™t. So she took a test and it was a very faint line. It was only 9 days after we had unprotected sex and she was on birth control. I wasnâ€™t worried at all because she said had her period and I honestly didnâ€™t think it could happen. But she was crazy worried so I was looking stuff up like crazy. By doing this Iâ€™m sure I was only making my fears worse. I just want clarity. I know we are gonna have to play the waiting game until she gets her next period but I donâ€™t know what to do. We are both young. We both have parents who would likely kill us, and I donâ€™t want to lose her. I told her that Iâ€™m not going anywhere and that I will always be there for her. I know itâ€™s impossible to have a kid if you get your period, but everything Iâ€™ve seen says a feint line means positive. I donâ€™t know what help Iâ€™m asking for. I just want to know whatâ€™s happening.
