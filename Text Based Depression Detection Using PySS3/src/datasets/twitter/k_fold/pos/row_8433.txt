I skipped school to get my homework caught up I somehow forgot to take into account that I have panic attacks and flashbacks while doing homework at home but I have an absolute deadline tomorrow morning and if I went to school today I still most likely wouldnâ€™t be been able to focus bro I can do all of this in like 30 minutes easily but teachers need to either teach something or let me do my work when Iâ€™m actually motivated to screw this entire system.
