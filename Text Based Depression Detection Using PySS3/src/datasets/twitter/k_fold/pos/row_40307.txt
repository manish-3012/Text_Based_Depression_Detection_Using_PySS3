Special Ed 1. Iâ€™m tired of hearing the same things over and over again. â€œHow are you doing?â€ â€œDo you have any missing work?â€ â€œHow are your grades?â€ and the baby talk to try and hype things up â€œThe weekend is tomorrow!â€. Itâ€™s dehumanizing and demoralizing. 

2. Back when we had to go to school, paras would stalk you, and if you took one second too long on a question, theyâ€™d give you the answer. Then they say you should be accountable and do everything on your own. And everyone in the class would see it. 

3. Theyâ€™ve kept me in by saying that I donâ€™t do all the work by myself, and need their help to learn self-accountability. But I canâ€™t do that when they give me the answer for a question I took a second too long on. 

TL;DR, Special Ed is very taxing on my mental health, and I think Iâ€™d do better if I was out of it.
