Dude I love my friends So we're on online learning. I was busy doing something personal that held priority to me. I was around 8 minutes late for my geometry class and I thought that I was screwed because hes a strict teacher. Of all periods right? When I show up to class I notice that I was marked present. Turns out my good friend tells the teacher that my power went out because of the weather were having where we live. Man just saved my ass and I didn't even ask him. True bro moment.
