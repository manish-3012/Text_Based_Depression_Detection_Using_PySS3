I hate myself and i have a good reason Bad things kept happening to me in the last year but the worst one was my fault. I had a girlfriend and she was depressed and after 6 months i got overwhelmed and broke up with her in the worst moment ever and since then i regret that fucking day and hate myself. Three weeks after the break up we had an argument and i blocked her and again, i hated myself even more. Now i found out she has covid, and i've been hella worried about her so i reached for her, apologized and asked how she's been doing. She's fine, she doesn't want to hear about me ever again because she hates me and i hate my fucking self. I would do everything to fix what i have done, to see her smile again but how do you fix something like this? I don't know what to do, it was my first relationship ever and i ruined it by being a coward and now i find myself crying everyday.
If yall have any questions or suggestions please let me know but PLEASE don't go too hard on me, i'm already broken.
