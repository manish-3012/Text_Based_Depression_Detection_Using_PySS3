my french teacher is pissed with me because she gives a ton of work &amp; iâ€™m taking care of my mom/ house at the same time. so iâ€™m doing â€œvirtualâ€ learning right now and i only have a problem with one teacher. my french one teacher, iâ€™m a sophomore and this is my second year in a public school(i used to go to a private school, very small, everyone knew everyone) so iâ€™m still getting used to four classes a day and sped up curriculum, not to mention we arenâ€™t even in zoom classes we just go online and work for 90 minutes at their pace. iâ€™m in french one because i dropped spanish, the teacher i had for spanish quite literally told me i was dumb, just didnâ€™t want to work because people like me (black people) arenâ€™t good workers, i wonâ€™t pass, and more including some seriously triggering things. 


my mom broke her ankle 11 weeks ago but had to have surgery a month ago because her leg wasnâ€™t healing properly, she now has a cast on her ankle and is only moving to go to the bathroom other than that she stays in a recliner. i do everything for my mom which i have no problem with because she doesnâ€™t need me to do much for her, we also have people bring food, if not i have to cook, i do the dishes, laundry and everything else, i have to take care of our dogs and cats too. my dad is a teacher and is also in school right now so when he comes home he normally fixes his food and goes straight to his classes so he canâ€™t help to much. i typically get up 10-15 minutes late for school because of how late i go to bed because iâ€™m up so late working.

oh and i just got diagnosed with ADD on monday  on started meds that make me have head and stomach aches and donâ€™t help, iâ€™ve also had to go to the doctor a lot and end up missing full days of school (we canâ€™t help it my doctors 45 minutes away bc i live in a small town and i have to get blood work or meds or something like that).

iâ€™m only a few days behind in french, in another class of mine iâ€™m almost a week behind but she understands why. she sent my mom an email about the fact that iâ€™m falling behind and i only sent her a half page of notes. my mom already knows and isnâ€™t mad. iâ€™m starting to get pissed because she keeps saying that â€œiâ€™m not taking good notesâ€ when she emailed me and said â€œthe notes look good.â€ iâ€™m stressed because she doesnâ€™t help or respond to emails until after iâ€™m out of her class and canâ€™t go back and fix whatever i needed help on, iâ€™m the only person who can help my mom because iâ€™m an only child so thereâ€™s not anyone to help, we arenâ€™t in zoom or google meet so iâ€™m not learning as well as i would verbally, iâ€™m just reading a screen. also she assigns 34 slides for 90 minutes. before anyone asks, i cant attend school physically  because both of my parents are at risk.

is anyone else dealing with anything like this? how do i deal with this and do i talk to the teacher? does anyone with add have any tips to help focus?
