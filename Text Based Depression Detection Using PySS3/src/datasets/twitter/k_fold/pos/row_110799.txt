Some girls don't care about dick sizes Okay hear me out-

I'm a girl, and I honestly don't care about how big my partner's dick is, and the girls that I'm friends with think the same. It's something about you that you can't change, and the girls with a brain actually understand that.

If you have a small penis that's okay. Hell, I honestly prefer small and average over big ones, and I'm sure many others do as well. Plus, I'm pretty sure bj's are easier to give! Just gotta wait for the right girl (or guy!) Don't worry if you're small, because if someone decides to break up with you over dick size, at least you figured out they were a jerk, and who the fuck wants to be with a jerk? If you can't give a girl an orgasm because of your size, you still have your hands and mouth. Just learn to use them and I'm sure you and your partner would both have a good time :) Also, I'd rather have someone a small or average size to take my virginity rather than something big that could potentially hurt like hell. However, if I end up having sex with a guy who is big, that's perfectly okay with me too! I'd just make sure to have good communication with them.

Now I'm not gonna leave out the ones who are huge. Most people think "Bruh they got a gigantic dick why would they be self-conscious?" There are some stories of girls crying because their partner was too big, so some men are afraid they'll hurt their partner. Don't worry. Ask if they can handle it, and if they can then great! If they can't, just go slow and try not to go all the way in, and always have communication. Ask if you could go deeper, or if they're in too much pain and they need a break. Communication is key for you and your partner to give each other a good time :) If you can't get a girl to orgasm, once again, you got your hands and mouth! Ask them what feels good and you guys will both be perfectly fine.

You guys shouldn't worry too much about dick size. This even goes into height! You don't need to be 6ft or taller. I'm 5'2" and my boyfriend is probably around 4'11" or 5ft. If a someone actually loves you, they'll care about who YOU are more than your height and dick size. And don't be sad if you haven't found that person yet. You're young, and still have the homies :&gt;

But that's all! I hope this post gave all of you men a bit more confidence in yourselves :D
