Hey kids, old boomer in here with a burning question to ask So I'm an old 27 year old boomer with a 13 year old nephew. Wanna get him a cool gift that he'll like. What are all of you teens into these days? Is Skechers a cool brand to get a pair of sneakers/running shoes from? Or would he like an among us shirt? Thanks a bunch my fellow kids.
