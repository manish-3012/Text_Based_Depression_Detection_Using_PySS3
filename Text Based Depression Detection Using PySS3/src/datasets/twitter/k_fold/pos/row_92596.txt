I got vaccinated today. All I want to say that it's not a joke. It's not just a "cough" and it's not just a "flu". It's much more than that.

And I'm not some immuno-defficient guy. I have perfect health, get sick once or twice a year, and even then, it's barely a cold.

After getting a vaccine, I'm terribly cold, everything hurts and I can barely keep my conciousess. I'm afraid to think what it would feel to catch an actual thing.


TL;DR stay safe guys, 'rona is not a joke, and you shouldn't treat is as such.
