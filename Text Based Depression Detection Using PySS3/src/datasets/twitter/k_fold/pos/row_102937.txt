Iâ€™m going to do something fun and entertaining Iâ€™m going to try to start playing air soft if my dad lets me, the reason I want to is because all my friends play a sport or something and all I do is play video game and watch anime during school and summer and I can play it during a pandemic because you more than 6ft a part and wear masks I know the consequences and Iâ€™ve looked at the equipment and guns and in total itâ€™s about $500 in total
