Hereâ€™s a weird dream I had. I had this dream that I was cooking at a golf course eating food, I was somehow teleported to be the one cooking after I ate the food as Gordon Ramsey comes in, so Iâ€™m 15 cooking with these older dudes and itâ€™s some sort of kitchen nightmare, the food is horrible because no one ever let me do anything since I was too young and I just prepped stuff. We are out individually to cook our own meal from the menu and he hates the other guys food except mine. He congratulates me and he fixes up the restaurant (the kitchen was dirty but the produce was organized to some extent) and then when the show ends we play some golf together at the golf course and I lose my clubs like a retard, the dream ends with Gordon giving me a firm handshake saying good job and he goes into his car and leaves.

Thank you for listening to my TedTalk
