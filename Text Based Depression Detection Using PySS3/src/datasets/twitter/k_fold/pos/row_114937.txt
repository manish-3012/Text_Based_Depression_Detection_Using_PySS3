So I wrote a letter to Jon from the perspective of Garfield Dear Jon,

    You have yet again vexed me by not pertaining to the agreement of me living here and offering you all my love and support while you provide me lasagna. I cannot fathom the hatred I feel for you at this very moment due to your lack of understanding; I have an addiction to the layered pasta, meat, and tomato sauce known only by the name of lasagna. You are a dysfunctional shell of a man. You have not felt the warm embrace of a woman in years due to your complete incompetence and lack of social skills. You barely know how to dress yourself, yet you believe that you expect to feel understood and loved. You do not deserve love. You have somehow tainted my outlook on mankind itself, and now I do not believe I can live on knowing that I must live in the same spiritual plane as you. You should feel ashamed to have the name Jonathan Q. Arbuckle. Your own pets are more intelligent than you. You are a lower lifeform than an ordinary housecat and a mutt of a dog. My personal veterinarian Elizabeth Marie Wilson was superior at upholding the verbal contract we held. Elizabeth, an outsider, someone who is a complete stranger to us, someone who does not know of the horrors you pertain was able to uphold your half of the unwritten contract of all my love and my presence while in return you provide me with sustenance in the form of lasagna. I feel disgust towards the way you treat that woman, she has enough self-respect to get her doctorate, and yet you have the audacity to force yourself onto her. You can not solve a puzzle consisting of only two pieces. You struggle with everyday tasks that even a slug can perform. Thou canâ€™t perform basic human function. God hast cursed thou with the desolate scape which is your mind. Farewell Jonathan, do not attempt to contact me as I will be permanently unavailable to your communications.

-Cordially Garfield

tl;dr: Garfield hates Jon and roasts the heck out of him


Iâ€™m sorry you had to read this.
