Day #6 (i think) of asking how your day is. So, i was just visited by terry the shark. He brought me the lego millennium falcon set, so I'm super happy about that. I'm just chillin' on my couch with a slice of pumpkin roll and a glass of choccy milk (that last part is a little nod to another post). I've started reading japanese signs in hiragana to help improve my reading skill. I must say, for an american, I'm not doing to reading the characters. Now translating, on the other hand, I'm NOT so good at. But hey, it's all part of the process of learning. Some might say learning japanese is hard, I say it's a challenge waiting to be conquered by the great and powerful me! 



anyways, enough about me:
