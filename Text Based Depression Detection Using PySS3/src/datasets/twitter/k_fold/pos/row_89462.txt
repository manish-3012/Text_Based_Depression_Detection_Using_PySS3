Do you guys just feel like shit everyday. Anytime you are around your friends you feel like failing them and you shouldn't even be around them. That feel like your just a shell of something that was never there and you just aren't yourself. Like anytime you go out in public you basically have to put a mask that makes the feeling of being a shell even worse. Like you have to build mental walls just to keep yourself from breaking your friendship's and yourself.
