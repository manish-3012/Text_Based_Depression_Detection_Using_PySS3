Whenever I think of my schedule I realize it's strange In 8th grade a few people got to take high school biology I was one of those people to do this they add another class to your schedule so in 8th grade I took bio and physical science. This caused me to take chemistry freshman year and now I'm taking AP bio it's just a strange distribution of classes.
