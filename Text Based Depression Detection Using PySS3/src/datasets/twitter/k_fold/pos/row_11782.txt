Describe how you feel using an oddly specific object. I started this thing in my art class at one point where you describe how you feel using an oddly specific object because normal words for feelings aren't perfectly accurate. I'll go first. I feel like slightly soggy bread. It's not really soggy, just barely wet enough to be considered as soggy.
