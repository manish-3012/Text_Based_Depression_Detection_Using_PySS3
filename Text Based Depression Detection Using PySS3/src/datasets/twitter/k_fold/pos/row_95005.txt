Why JoJo gets referenced so much The reason why JoJo gets references so much is that:

- Many non manga readers/ anime watchers love this series, like me (although I have gotten a basic love for action manga).

- JoJo references can help. It has helped me learn a bit of Japanese romanji like ã“ã‚ŒãŒ ã  ç„¡é§„ è²§å¼± å‘ªã„ã® æ™‚ ã‚’ æ­¢ã¾ã‚Œ å‹•ã ã§ã™ã­ (translated to kanji through phone, donâ€™t know about the Kanji differences).

- Let the fans enjoy stuff, itâ€™s a popular series for crying out loud. Let us Avdol fans say â€œYes, I am!â€ At posts we think are from JoJo fans.

- Iâ€™m annoyed by a lot of JoJo fans too, read the manga asswipes! (If you donâ€™t got time donâ€™t read but 95% hate when you even mention Gappy cuz â€œSpoliers!â€) God I hate those people...

And thatâ€™s all for this rant. Also JoJo isnâ€™t gay, youâ€™re gay if you actually care about it having gay stuff.
