What's a great videogame I probably haven't heard of? Sup, guys. I never post here, but I'm confined, not only to my house, but actually quarantined in my room, as I'm the only one in my house with covid. I'm so bored and I'd love something entertaining. I don't play a ton of videogames, so a new one would do pretty nicely. any suggestions? (pc only)
