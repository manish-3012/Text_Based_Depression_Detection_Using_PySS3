games = addictive to teens, trash alright this is how the story goes I have really not happily played at least one game in my life, when i was 12 (rn14) I used to play  mobile games in my fathers phone but right now everything is really fucked up last fucking week I had a exam so i was really stressed bout my exam and right now it's finished so i thought of playing a game (just csgo the game was laggy like my life) (last i played a game was like 5 months ++) as i was playing it hasn't been at least 30 minutes yet but my godamm brother came and pressed the switch off button randomly, it's just making me angry every single time..I even had a PS4 i think so last year my brother took away and it's sleeping since last year in my brothers room..when the lockdown time I asked my brother if i could play it since (lockdown=bored) but my brother said I'm playing too much (what actually happened last year was there was just one fucking game which my brother played it half and I played it half and then i didn't had any other games too play so what I did was I was playing the played game again and again...I even had money to buy like 2 games so I asked him can I buy a game and he fuckin replied "NO"...)I just really get jealous every single fucking time whenever my friends or my brother starts to talk about games!!

I'm really thinking of going to cyber cafe but my family aren't letting me!!

NOTE: I'm not trying to tell that gaming is my life and shit it's just a thing which I really really love to enjoy it!
