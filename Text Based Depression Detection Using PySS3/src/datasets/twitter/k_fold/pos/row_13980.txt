Urgent: how do I text acquaintances/friends after a long time? Help me catch up with some old acquaintances/friends please. This a serious post.

Iâ€™ve been stuck at college for a year and havenâ€™t been in contact with a lot of people from school who I used to hang out with. Never really had too many friends or any if you take away childhood friends. Suffered and still suffering from severe social anxiety and donâ€™t know how to approach them. This is the second time iâ€™m catching up as there was a brief 3 month period when we werenâ€™t in touch either. I know I generally get invited when they know iâ€™m in town (sometimes to catch up / sometimes because they feel bad for me having known me for nearly my whole life and discluding me- i never truly know). 

So I really donâ€™t know how to approach them anymore. Iâ€™m 19M and really donâ€™t know how to text them. Last time I just let them do the talking but I forgot how it went. Last time I only messaged my closest acquaintances and then they just helped me meet everyone, even taking a vacation with them at the end. This time I really need to reduce the awkwardness and need to know what Iâ€™m going to start off with and I want to try and prevent awkwardness in the conversation. Please can someone help out here?

I was thinking -

Got a couple options but none seem right. This stuff is really hard for me. How would yâ€™all initiate? Please can someone help out here. I ask here because most of you are of the same age range and have considerably better social skills than me.
