Fine, I'll ask her out. It's this month or never. I have until UIL at the end of March or it's over. I'm asking her after Spring Break since there isn't enough time for me to go on a date beforehand.

I'm not afraid of rejection either. It happens. It's happened before. It might be a punch in the gut to begin with but it'll go away eventually. She doesn't have any classes with me next year so  Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
