I just.. pooped standing up. I wondered if it was possible to shit while standing up. I had tried it before multiple times but it would just result in me peeing. So, I came up with a strategy where I would just pee until I was completely empty, then stood up and tried to shit. It worked too well. A massive turd just shot out of me and I was able to watch it fall in live action! Once it landed, it made a huge splash and got everywhere. When I tried to wipe, shit just got on my hand and it was very disgusting. I wanted to wash my hands so badly, but the water had to be turned off in my house so that the repairmen could fix the sprinklers. With that happening I knew I had to improvise. I saw that there was a bar of soap. I tried to use that, but you gotta have water in order to use a bar if soap, so it just stained the bar of soap. So, I tried the shampoo in the bath tub and it just stung really hard but didn't clean anything. It just had to have been hiding in plain sight.. Yes, the hand sanitizer! I rubbed my hands down hard with that hand sanitizer, but it was still pretty ineffective. But with enough hand sanitizer, the poop had been erased! So, I ran outside my room to try to find things that would continue to clean it. I wasn't in very much luck. I thought of running all the way to some muddy lake in my neighborhood to clean it, but that'd just get me more diseases. I tried rubbing my hands on my cat, but that didn't seem to help, either. Soon, I remember there's bottled water in the basement. I use that with the hand sanitizer and the soap and it saves the day!.. 

Did I really just type out that entire thing? Don't do what I just did, you'll really regret it.
