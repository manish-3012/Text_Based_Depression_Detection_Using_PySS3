OKAY WHO THE FUCK GETS SUPER PARANOID WHEN THEY'RE LISTENING TO MUSIC ON THE STREET OR IN CLASS Like, I listen to music with my earphones, as one does, and I always get reeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllyyyyyyyyyy self conscious that everyone can hear my cringey ass music and now I'll be known as the kid who has shitty earphones (They're not shitty btw) that can't keep his shitty music to himself. Like I have to constantly pull out my earphones and if I hear them from 1 cm from my ear then I HAVE to turn the sound down even tho no one wants to go 15 ft near me cuz of covid. 

So like, does everyone get this or am I just paranoid weirdo who looks like a fucking loser who constantly takes out his earphones like a creep?
