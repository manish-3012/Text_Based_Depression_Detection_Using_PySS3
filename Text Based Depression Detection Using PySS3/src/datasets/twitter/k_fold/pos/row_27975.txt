Wore a skirt to my first day of this school year and I feel so liberated because of it. For context, I'm a boy who has been wearing the same thing every day, a red hoodie, blue jeans, black gloves, boots, and mask. But for my first day of school I wore a skirt because I absolutely despise gender stereotypes. And I feel kind of refreshed and more confident.
