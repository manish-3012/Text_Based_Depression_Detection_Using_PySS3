what's it like to have close friends ? the ones you consistently talk to, have actual conversations, get to go out with, hang out when you feel like it, maybe get to know their parents n vice versa, maybe getting acknowledged by their parents like youre almost their kid, freely sending them messages when something comes to mind, venting n stuff. must be nice to even have friends.
