My phone got infected with a virus I'm sorry, 13 viruses. The fuck?! I was on a website that my friend recommended I can watch movies on and made it clear that I needed a VPN. I went on it about 20 minutes ago without a VPN and I've got Apple telling me my phone has 13 viruses. I was shocked to say the least. I've downloaded an app that will protect my phone and I hope that's the end of it. Things just keep getting worse for me and also, I'm such a fucking idiot. I'm writing this on my phone rn and I hope it doesn't break or something cos I'd be very upset.
