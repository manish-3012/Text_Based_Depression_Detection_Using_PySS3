Is it just me or has humor not moved this year? I was scrolling on almost every social media today: Reddit, Twitter, Instagram (shockingly), and even facebook. All of the memes and jokes that I scrolled by were just the same jokes from like last year or before. 2020 in general has been nothing but recycled material from years ago. Even the new "memes" that are out either felt dead before they were popular, or just recaps of previous memes. Am I the only one who feel like memes are losing its touch?
