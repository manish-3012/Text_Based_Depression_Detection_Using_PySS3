I missed a big chance We have our exams going on and I was texting wi' my crush (we are actually good friends and that's kind of a problem) so anyway, we were discussing the paper and then, she said something along the lines of " oh shit I forgot to add that thing" , so I wanted to ask, "in what" , which in my native language translates to "kisme" and I could have written kiss me and I'm sure she would have come up with a good reply and otherwise I could've blamed it on autocorrect. I feel wasted
