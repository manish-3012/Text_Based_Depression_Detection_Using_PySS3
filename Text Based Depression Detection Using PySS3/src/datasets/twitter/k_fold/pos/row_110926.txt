Attending an all boys school sucks a lot I've been attending this school for two years, and goddamn I feel so bad.



There's a lot of bullying, there's no respect for anyone, you basically have to be an asshole as to not get called by names by your juniors.


Not to mention everyone is so goddamn horny. There's no minute where no one is talking about sex or porn, and this effects everyone. There are drawings of dicks on a lot of places.



It gets very lonely too. I haven't felt the urge to have a girlfriend more than before. I always see on the internet how sweet girls are, and I've also talked to some girls irl (I know, rare for a redditor like me). 


Not to mention I have to attend this shithole for two more years, that's basically until I graduate from school altogether. My parents refuse to change schools even though I've made it as clear as day that I hate this place.


I haven't even mentioned the fact that it's a residential school so I don't get to be home a lot, don't have my phone and have no way of listening to music. 


Just kill me already
