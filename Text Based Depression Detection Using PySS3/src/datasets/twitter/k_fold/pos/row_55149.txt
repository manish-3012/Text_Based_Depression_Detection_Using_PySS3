2 years, and a blue cheese icon What am I doing with my life? Why have I spent 2 years on this damn app?

Because I had/have no social life and my anxiety peaked during this time leading to panic attacks at school and in public. This app allowed me to see so much of the world and people who enjoy the same things as I. Ive been able to be a part of communities which I love and have found hidden interest that I would never of had gotten without this app.

Thats all I have to say. Thanks guys for a pretty awesome 2 years.
