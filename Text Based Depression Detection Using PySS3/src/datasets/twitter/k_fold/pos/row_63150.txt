This is probably the most stupid post ever but I don't know what to do I have been feeling really nausea all day. Tonight my mom is planning to make my favorite dinner but I'm not going to eat dinner because I don't want to throw up. I can't ask her to make it another night because she was going to make it a few days ago but I was nauseous then too. She seemed so excited to make me happy by making my favorite dinner but I had to ask her to save it because I was nauseous a few days ago and still am. She can't wait longer or some of the stuff might go bad. This is just making me feel really annoyed because I don't want to make my mom sad by telling her I don't want her dinner but then I also don't want to throw up the food she worked on for me.
