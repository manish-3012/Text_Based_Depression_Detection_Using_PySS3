Is it weird to treat a not-so-friend to lunch for their birthday after the pandemic? We have talked several times, but all over text or snapchat.. we know each other from high school, from which we graduated last year. However, we sort of lost touch now but itâ€™s their birthday next month.

I wanted to send them a message like â€œHappy birthday! ðŸŽ‰ After this covid situation I will treat you to lunch :)â€
