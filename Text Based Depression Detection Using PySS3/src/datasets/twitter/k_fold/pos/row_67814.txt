I did it. I just got home, and wow. One of the best nights ever. Bit of backstory, I was always the shy kid and kinda a loser in school. Even after I became popular from things Iâ€™m not proud of, (fights) I still felt lonely. I moved cities and have since been really happy. I met a gorgeous girl weâ€™ve been friends for awhile. We had a thing going on for awhile but weâ€™re busy and our schedules never line up so we stayed as friends but tonight she asked what I was doing tonight and I was free. We drove around and listened to music and danced, and well you know. It feels like itâ€™s finally right we understand each other and Iâ€™m comfortable with her. She is with me. Iâ€™m not like that with anyone else, I never have been, even with my ex. Iâ€™m tired of girls hitting me up for hookups, I never went through with it cause Iâ€™m not that type of guy. I wanted something real and I finally found it. This sounds corny as hell but sheâ€™s really not like other girls I know. Iâ€™m myself with her and sheâ€™s herself with me. We can talk about anything with each other. We both really let it all out, opened my heart for her and she did for me tonight. Iâ€™m so happy man
