"Character counts" I hate that people judge others so fast. I do it too but I hate it anyway. Yes, humans do that intentionally in some way but we can limit that.
We can try to get friends with people, get to know them and so on.

Many people say that character counts and that it doesn't matter how people look like. Anyway they reject not so beautiful and fat people because they dont know how they are.

People that get rejected easily are incredibly polite and are the nicest friends. But people never get to know how nice they are, because they reject them.

Also in love life those other people dont get any chances to know other people because they get rejected. Give them chances. Get to know other people. They may have great abilities that others dont know about and stuff.
