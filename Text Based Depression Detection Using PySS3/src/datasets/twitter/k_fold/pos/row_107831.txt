stop being awkward and just text your crush as long as they are not in a relationship that you know of you really have nothing to lose. iâ€™ll tell you this it will hurt less to get rejected now then rejected later if things donâ€™t work out. just get the rejection over with,or have a good relationship with your crush. but donâ€™t sit there like a dingus watching their snap stories. unless you like someone whoâ€™s a total asshole the most they are going to say is â€œnoâ€ and if they say anything ruder than that or attack you,you dodge a bullet.
