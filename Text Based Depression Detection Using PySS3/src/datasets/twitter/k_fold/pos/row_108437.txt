Was I and the people around me just a super weird kid back then or? I remember when I was small there would constantly be instances where somebody steals something (small, like a pen) from a friend's house and sometimes I did it too and felt guilty. Also, whenever I went to my friends' house we'd all look at each other's private parts in the corner and be weird, and I remember once we were doing it in a public garage parking space thing, am I the only one... in early elementary, maybe 1st or 2nd grade my friend also talked about PORN and even showed me once, btw im a girl
