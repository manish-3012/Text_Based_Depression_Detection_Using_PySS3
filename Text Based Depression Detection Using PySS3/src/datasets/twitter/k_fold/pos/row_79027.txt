Anyone else left handed? Like Iâ€™m serious cause Iâ€™m the only person in my family (besides my grandmother who died when I was 7, and my great grandfather who died when I was 13).And I feel like Iâ€™m the only person I know who is left handed so if ur left handed let me know Iâ€™m not alone thank you for ur time.
