a classmate got publicly humiliated/shamed on instagram... Two of my classmates (a guy and a girl) got into a disagreement over DMs on topics like homophobia and transphobia. The girl screenshots all of the DMs and makes a public post with the first image as #shutthef\*\*\*up(nameoftheguy)friday.

The comments are FILLED with people shaming the guy. Anyone who left a reply remotely expressing disappointment for the girl publicly humiliating the guy gets bombarded with replies like "you're defending a homophobe/transphobe" "you're part of the problem". I have no involvement with the post at all, never left any replies, etc., I just feel bad that a person was publicly humiliated like this. Exposing DMs and creating a hashtag that directly targets the person just seems too far for me. Nobody defending any sort of opinion should "deserve" this sort of harassment. The guy engaged with what he thought was a friendly debate on private DMs, and next thing you know he gets "exposed" and becomes an immediate target for bullying.

Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with the guy's opinion. But I don't agree either with how the girl went about the situation. What do you guys think of this?
