did you know 7?Û[qtÄšcsâ”‚a?Ó¡LWUÂ®

the string above is an encrypted message that says ```I'm gay.```

it uses random characters, so that's why the formatting is weird

i haven't made a program to encrypt/decrypt it yet, but i have the whole algorithm written down in my google docs.

and no, i didn't use some crazy ass enigma cipher. the algorithm is actually pretty simple but it's made to look confusing
