Rant (sorry) Okay sooo.. this might be long. Idk yet. I guess weâ€™ll see. You also donâ€™t have to read this I just need to get it off my chest. 

I want SO FUCKING BADLY to be in a relationship. I want it so bad. I want the corny hand holding bullshit and the cuddles and the movie dates and the sneaking kisses behind parents backs. But I also want to have fun too. I want to sneak out and meet up with them. I want to go for late night drives. I want to do things weâ€™re not supposed to... but I am so fucking scared. I am so scared of getting hurt. And I am so scared of him losing feelings for me when we do start dating. (Nobody in particular rn just saying). And I hate it. I want one so so so bad but Iâ€™m a coward and canâ€™t. 

Also. Iâ€™ve been super in my thoughts lately right? Well... idk about yâ€™all but lately (for context Iâ€™m a relatively good girl. I donâ€™t really do anything out of line) Iâ€™ve been wanting to go drinking and smoking and partying and having sex and going driving (I canâ€™t drive) and sneaking out and going walking alone at night by myself. And Iâ€™m a very impulsive person. So I feel like Iâ€™m just gonna snap and let lose and Iâ€™m kinda scared but also excited... like I know itâ€™s wrong. But Iâ€™m craving the adrenaline rush Iâ€™ll get from knowing Iâ€™m not supposed to do it and doing it.

Thatâ€™s my ted talk.
