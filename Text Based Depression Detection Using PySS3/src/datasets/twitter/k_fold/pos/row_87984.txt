How do I convince my mom to not cut my hair? I think I look better with longer hair. She wants me to get a stupid ass buzzcut, I hate how I look in general but i hate getting the same stupid fucking haircut. I want to grow my hair out. When I asked, Her only reasons for me to get my hair cut was the classic: "BeCaUsE I SAiD sO!" I also wanted a mohawk but i got told that i would look like a hoodlum. I have a round face so if i got a buzzcut/undercut my head would look like a fucking Bowling ball.
