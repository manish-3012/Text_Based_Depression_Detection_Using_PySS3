Racist teacher funny story I was sitting in my lunch class (because of Covid we eat in classrooms instead of the lunch room) and the warning bell rang meaning we had about 3 minutes until the actual bell rings. We start packing up our things and a few kids are kinda shoving people around at the door and getting a little crazy. My teacher stands up and yells in front of everyone, â€œstop running around like a bunch of wild Indians!â€ And the entire classâ€™ jaws dropped.

(This all happened today and I get back to school on Tuesday so if anyone cares Iâ€™ll keep you guys informed)
