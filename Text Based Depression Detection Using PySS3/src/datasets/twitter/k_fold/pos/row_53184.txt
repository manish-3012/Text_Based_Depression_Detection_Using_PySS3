You ever just wake up one day really freaking dizzy? Because thatâ€™s just what I did today. It wasnâ€™t just like a brief period or anything, itâ€™s the evening now and my sight is still trying to get funky. It is certainly a hell of a time to have a messy room when iâ€™m stumbling like an alcoholic just to get myself coffee.
