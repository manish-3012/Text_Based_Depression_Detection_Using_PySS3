LOVE at first sight do exist IDK man i always thought that love at first sight or love is just bullshit...Its been almost 1 and a half year i think..So i walk to the bus stand with my friend everyday after college for coming back home cuz like our college is like 30km away from our home...So it's like 50min bus ride or so..So it was Friday of july 2019 or june i think..My friend was absent that day due to he was sick so after college(12std) i was walking to the bus stand which is like a 10/20 min walk from college..That day was a cloudy day and it was raining just a little,so i always had a n umbrella in my bag so i was walking to the bus stand and I got a auto(3 seater taxi u could call) and i sat on the back seat and there was another student from another college seated on the front seat so i was grinning to the fact like "hehe i got back seat i will seat comfy u get rain"...Suddenly i saw this girl from the seat where i was seating..she was at the foothpath just a little distance from me...She had bought a bottle and she was drinking water from it and i was like in awe and believe me when i say this "it was like everything was in slowmotion"..Her way of drinking water and walking everything with her bagpack and the mobile she was using was like so fascinating..I felt something in my heart...I was like soo fascinated while looking at her..She hand gestures and movements everything felt out of this world..After that the Vehile took off and i was thinking of her the whole time...After that i would always see her at that same exact time on fridays and Saturdays specifically and i was so excited on that specific days to catch a simple glimpse of her..It felt very good...But i didn't know what was her name or anything and after that i think i saw her a total of 6 or 7 times and from that time i never saw her again...I would go in ghat bustand from like 1o clock till 3 and i would wait for her but never saw her again..I thought maybe in 2020 when she will give her 12th or 11th exam i will see her(because i knew for fact that she was 1 year younger than me because i asked that student his standard because he and that girl were from same clg and same time they were there so it is logical yo say that she was in the same year)..but due to corona 11th exam were cancelled so i never got the chance.. I'm planning for this year when she will maybe give her 12th std exam which is on april i think i will catch a glimpse of her).. Believe me when i say this...I never thought before seeing her that a girl can be this beautiful and pure..IDK im in love maybe...And it's been almost 1 and a half year since i last saw her and till date my heart feels crazy whenever i think about her..IDK love a first sight do exist..and sorry for the long ass essay and sorry for my bad English (English is like my 3rd or 4th language)
