Break Through the Darkness (136) When we face our traumas, when we face our pain, when we face our anxieties, depression and so on, it won't be met with happiness and peace, it will be met with everything that we were avoiding, until that moment.

I have learned through the past few years that when we face our vulnerabilities, when we face our insecurities, when we face things that make us feel sad, or cause pain, that eventually it will get better and that we are doing the best possible thing for us, **facing it head on, rather than continuing to live in fear.** 

It does take time and I am constantly being shown and opening doors to traumas that have been deep in my subconscious that do take a lot out of me, but I know its all for something greater. **Moment by moment, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, we heal. Together, Separately.**

Through our lived experiences though, they are meant to be shared and they are meant to be heard. The things that **you have lived through will always be different to what every single other person has lived through.** It takes time to share but once you start sharing, the **impact that it will leave, will be astonishing.** Our pain, our anxiety, depression etc., is meant to be face head on in our own time and then shared when the time is right, **so share, when you're ready.**

**I love you.**
