Did you know?  

**It  is actual Muppets canon that Kermit the Frog, in some way, had a role  in bringing down the Twin Towers in the terror attacks of September 11,  2001.**

In a Muppets Christmas film  released in late 2002, Kermit is shown a glimpse of what New York City  might look like if he had never been born. Among the scenery of this  alternate reality NYC, we find none other than the Twin Towers proudly  standing in the background. They were, of course, long destroyed in  Kermit's normal reality. And yet, in the world without Kermit, the war  on terror is missing its powder keg spark. Who would've thought that  green piece of fuck could Kermit a terror attack on US soil, but there it stands unimpeachable... We have concrete, canon proof of involvement.  Why the world hasn't stopped and asked further questions is only  further proof of a media cabal keeping this conversation away from the  masses.

*The Twin Towers would  still be standing if it weren't for Kermit the Frog. Al Qaeda was the puppet all this time, and Kermit the hand within.*
