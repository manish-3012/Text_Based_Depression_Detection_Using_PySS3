How do you stop living with guilt? whatever that is still making me guilty now happened years ago but i realise it did leave a domino effect to my life and i can't stop feeling guilty about it every day (no joke)

i've apologised, been forgiven and made amendments to my mistakes and everyone had moved on already but i can't stop thinking about what i did even though i don't want to
