The periodic drop in quality of r/teenagers People have become concerned about the quality of posts recently. I think itâ€™s a good time to address what I see to be the root of the issue.

I think that the self-post weekend is too long and I notice the quality of posts deteriorate rapidly during this time. Weâ€™re awkward teenagers and most of us just donâ€™t have much to say and I think we have to recognize the fact that it is simply easier for most people our age to relate to each other through memes than through discussion. Maybe we should create a dedicated subreddit that focuses more on the discussion side of things.
