Hey question to girls here or anyone tbh it donâ€™t really matter all opinions This girl in my class we were definitely vibing hundred percent. Iâ€™m not gr8 at signs but even I was starting to convince myself.

But last couple of days itâ€™s been dead. I was gonna meet up with her this week at class (some is online some not)but tbh a lotta effort so might not bother.

Point is, she kinda ended it maybe a bit badly. She just hung up the phone and said in text sorry I get awkward sometimes saying bye. I was thinking we were def like low key flirting but now Iâ€™m questioning it.

So why the sudden change yk. Cuz I know something happened itâ€™s like idk tuff. I also donâ€™t wanna push it itâ€™s kinda on her Iâ€™ve given her the benefit of the doubt in case she doesnâ€™t prefer contact first and stuff but ima leave it now. 

Anyways rant over. Sudden change of feelings is this normal or idk.
