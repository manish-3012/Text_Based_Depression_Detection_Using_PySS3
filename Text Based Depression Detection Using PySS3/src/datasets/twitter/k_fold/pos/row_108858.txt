New bodycam footage of George Floyd arrests comes out... He told the officers to put him on the ground because he was claustrophobic and refused to get in the police car every time they asked him... He was also crying the whole time... Innocent men don't cry they get angry

I'm not saying he should've died but I'm not sure he died from getting kneeled on... probably cause he was high as balls
