One month without making myself throw up :) So iâ€™m using an alt to post this because I donâ€™t want anyone here to recognize me, but itâ€™s been a month since I made myself throw up. For the first week I felt really sick and really bad about myself whenever I ate anything, but now thatâ€™s starting to go away and I can eat almost full portions at every meal with only a slight nag in the back of my brain telling me to throw up. Iâ€™ve gained two pounds (.91 kg) back since then and Iâ€™m now 101 pounds (45.81 kg). I know no one really cares but I just wanted to share this because Iâ€™m happy for myself and Iâ€™m ready to stop looking like a skeleton :)
