We live in a society Were you are sexist for calling women out on their bullshit, were it acceptable to replace men with bone marrow, when scientists can replace women with bone marrow and they would recive backlash for replacing women with bone marrow, whereâ€™s the back lass for them replacing men with bone marrow, we live in a society that leans towards women problems not men problems, we live I. A society where barely anyone knows about prostate cancer but everyone knows about breast cancer, we live in a society where everyone believes the women, and not the man, we live in a society where men canâ€™t show emotion. Like wtf and most of them are not pushing for equality now they are pushing to be superior. Thank you for reading my ted talk, we live in a society where men are thought not to hit girls but girls are thought to hate us.
