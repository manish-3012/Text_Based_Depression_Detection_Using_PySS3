Some thoughts about sixteen. Seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen seventeen *seventeen*

Guys i made it through sixteen which is honestly surprising. My advice is probably trash, but take it or leave it. One thing I did consistently this year whenever anything bad has happened (and a *lot* of stuff has happened) is to tell myself to wait it out until the next day and see how things are. This got me through weeks and weeks of stress and anxieties about things, which is probably still not very healthy compared to getting therapy or something, but I didnâ€™t really want to go get therapy honestly. Feels weird. Sixteen was a rough year in some spots. It had a weird up and down feeling. *WOW I GOT MY LICENSE!* followed 4 days later by *WOW I WAS IN A CAR WRECK AND NOW MY CAR IS LITERALLY WORTHLESS*. You know what I mean? I made lots of mistakes, but I learned a lot of stuff. 

ANYWAY

I know a lot of you are ready for 2020 to be over, but take it one day at a time. Like many of you, my routine has kind of made days blur together because i pretty much do the same things every day. Pick a new hobby! Doesnâ€™t work out? Thatâ€™s not a problem! Read a new book! ~~not mein kampf~~ Try to make a new dish! Iâ€™m going to be trying to make handmade pasta soon which will be a first. Just donâ€™t preoccupy your mind with the thought that youâ€™re ready for it to be over. Again, this is just my perspective, but dwelling on stuff like that has never been healthy for me, so i would generally give the same advice. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Iâ€™ll give another update at eighteen.
