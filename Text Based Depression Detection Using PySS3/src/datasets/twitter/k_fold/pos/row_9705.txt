Pancakes have nothing to do with actual cakes So it's my grandpa's birthday today and my family went out to eat lunch, I order some pancakes for some reason and when we got back home my mom wants me to make a birthday card of the pancake as a background to wish my grandpa a happy birthday. I said that it makes no sense to put a pancake as a background because it's not even relevant to birthdays in any way, but she was just so stubborn that I am forced to do this birthday card thingie 


Parents are just so illogical and so stubborn
