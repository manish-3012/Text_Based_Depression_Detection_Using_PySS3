i hate it sm when ppl say â€œdonâ€™t change yourself for others, especially for girlsâ€ like thatâ€™s such a dumb statement, ofc girls are gonna wanna date guys that improve upon themselves, like donâ€™t use it as an excuse to be a loser with no hobbies, like i never picked up half the things i do today id still be a virgin without my first kiss. literally just make sure you work on yourself, donâ€™t lose who you are, but donâ€™t be afraid to make yourself better
