Exam in 2 days, what would you do? I have an exam in 2 days which I have to pass or I fail the course since itâ€™s worth a fair portion, itâ€™s online and set up in a way that no one monitors how we take or what resources we use so it is stated that itâ€™s open-book.

This means we have the ability to â€œcheatâ€ using online sources such as calculator tools that calculate the answer for us without using the equation and searching for the answer to theory questions you donâ€™t know.
