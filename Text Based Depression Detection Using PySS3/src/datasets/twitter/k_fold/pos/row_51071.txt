Guys, I got online classes coming up in 2 days what should I do?!?!? I know I should just relax and don't panic but like my laptop is literally broken. I'm not even kidding. I had this laptop for 6 years straight and it was working pretty good until one day it just showed a white screen. My brother's gonna try to fix it up tomorrow though but I don't even know anymore.

If it does get fixed it doesn't even have a good webcam. It's blurry as hell. 

AND ALSO WE HAVE A FREAKING DRESS CODE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR CAMERA ON AT ALL TIMES.

AS IF THAT'S GONNA BENEFIT MY SOCIAL ANXIETY.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW HALF OF THE PEOPLE IM IN CLASS WITH IT'S CRAZY.

So, I guess what I'm asking is that, to the people who are currently in school for a while now, do y'all have some advice for me?
