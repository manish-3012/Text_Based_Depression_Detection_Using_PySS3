DO I TEXT HER OR NOT? Okay background. I met her for the first tine a few weeks ago cause her and some friends along with me went to the beach. I talked to her a bit but not much. Last night I went to a birthday party and she was there. Her and I talked for about 2 hours without a lull in the convo. I got her snap last night. Do I text her?
