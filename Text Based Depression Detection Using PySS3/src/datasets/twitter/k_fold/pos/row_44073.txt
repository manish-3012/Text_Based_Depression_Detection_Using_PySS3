Ok I Acrually Made It 3 Years Without Tryna Kill Myself Again This Time â€¼ï¸ This Is Not As Big Of A Deal As 5 Years Without A Repeat Attempt But I Think Its Pretty Cool

Also Im 12 Days Clean From Self Harmin After I Relapsed After 9 Months Clean [My Longest Streak Since I Started] So Hopefully I Will Be Able To Hit 9 Months Again ! I Think That Would Be Very Sexc Of Me

Sorry For Typin Like This But It's Too Late To Rewrite Everything Lower Case Coz I Dont Feel Like It
