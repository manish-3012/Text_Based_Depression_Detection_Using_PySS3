When school returns, get ready for mandated discussions about "racism" and "the pandemic" My School's reopening guidelines outright states that the first weeks of school will include dialogues on race as well as the effect of the pandemic. Get ready for school sanctioned social ostracization if you refuse to trash the police, trash the president, and generally shit on America and our history. 

For me, I'm not bending the knee. I'll speak up to defend the police, and it's Trump 2020 till the last. But there is virtue in staying silent. Liberals are very sensitive and unreasonable people, they don't understand that people can come to different conclusions and have different viewpoints. Their go-to response is to attempt to silence you, call you "racist", "sexist", and a billion other words that have lost their effect due to their overzealous use. The more their media-powered narrative tells me I am wrong, I become more certain that I'm right.
