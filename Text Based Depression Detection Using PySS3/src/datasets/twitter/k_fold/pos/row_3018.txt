Is it just me or is the world kinda boring? Everyone lives the same way. We wake up, brush our teeth, eat our breakfast then go to work or school or collage then we spend most of our day at those places. We then come back home and do the same things we did yesterday to keep ourself entertained until tomorrow and we repeat this process until we grow old and die. Nothing interesting ever happens in life and everyone lives the same way.
