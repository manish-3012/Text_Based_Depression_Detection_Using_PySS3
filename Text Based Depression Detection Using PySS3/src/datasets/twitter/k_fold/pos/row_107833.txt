Can someone thatâ€™s like not dumb but not too smart please explain what the FUCK â€œall real numbersâ€ means when talking about domain and range? Iâ€™m a big dumb and I donâ€™t understand. My teacher and classmates are really smart and when they try to explain it I just get more confused. Iâ€™m not a math person.
