Any bird owners? I have 2 budgerigars, a male and a female (male is from Australia and is 3 years old, female is from Czechia and I have had her for a few months now. She is 3 months old)

My female layed an egg. 1. And the next day another one. They haven't hatched yet, but she seems like a good mother and her boyfriend is feeding her and everything.

Any tips?
