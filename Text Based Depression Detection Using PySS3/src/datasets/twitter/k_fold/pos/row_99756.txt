Yeah so idk why Iâ€™m saying it now but I feel like it A while ago I realised that I was bi and I was completely sure that my parents would be fine with it so one day I came out to them....

It went bad. The whole of the next two weeks I was never left alone because I was being hounded by them (especially my dad) about if I actually am or what P*** do I watch... this went on for so long and was so constant that I eventually decided to go back into the closet and say I was straight.

No clue why Iâ€™m saying this Iâ€™m not really looking for attention or anything I just felt like posting.
