Today I sacrificed my dignity to win a trivia competition For context, I'm the captain of my school's trivia team. I also really like anime, though very few people know that about me. We had a meet today, and there was a question that went along the lines of "This phrase, translated in Hindu as (something I don't know how to spell), is also said in Japanese as  "aishite imasu" though more commonly translated as "daisuki"." That's when it hit me- I knew this meant "I love you" from watching stupid romance anime. I knew I had to answer because I knew I was right, but at the cost of letting everybody know I'm a bit of a weeb. I buzzed in early and answered shamelessly, giving my team the advantage. 

My friends teased me afterwards, but it was funny nonetheless.

tl;dr: Outed myself as a weeb in a trivia tournament, for the sake of my team.
