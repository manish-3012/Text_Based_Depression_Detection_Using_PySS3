My mom just had a fit because I did more than 1 hour of screen time It is stupid I am only allowed to do non school screen time 1 hour after school on weekdays and the whole day on Friday and Saturday but even then I get yelled at when I am on for more than 2 hours. this is so stupid bc I am 16 and will be turning 17 in a few months. My parents are 50 to 60 years old and they can just get by with figuring out their phones. My mom gets mad at me when I am playing xbox like  I was doing drugs.(I don't do drugs) It is just stupid.
