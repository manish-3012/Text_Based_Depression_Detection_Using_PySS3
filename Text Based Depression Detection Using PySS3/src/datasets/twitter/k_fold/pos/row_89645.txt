PEOPLE ALWAYS CHECK YOUR MICS DON'T DO THE SHIT I DID So i was in online school and i had my camera off and my mic off,or at least thats what i thought,the fucking mic was on,i was eating pasta,just vibing with my teacher in the background and suddenly she asks me:
"a_stupid_14_year_old,are you eating? She was chill with it and she even said what i can translate as "bon appetit" from french,my social anxiety did the big boom and i turned off the mic instantly,and i dont plan on talking again this class,F M L
