I'm Not Depressed But.. I'm definitely not ok. Recently I've just felt empty inside. Like I cant feel anything. I don't like self diagnosing so I'm not gonna just assume I'm depressed.  I wouldnt say I'm sad tho. Empty is definitely the right word. I just feel no purpose in continuing. I don't know what's wrong but something is definitely wrong with me
