I hate a certain bot for this sub Dear Magic Eye Bot, why do you have to be so cruel? Just because a post shares the same template as a previous post or has resemblance to a previous post doesn't mean it's a repost. The 'slight modification' is the thing that you just choose not to look deeper into. I know that you're a bot and you're not perfect. But to be very confidentially wrong every time I post a meme here is not cool.
