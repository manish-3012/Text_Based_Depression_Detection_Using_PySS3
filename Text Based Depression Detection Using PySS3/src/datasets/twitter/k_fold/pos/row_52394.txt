The sentence "From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs." Do i agree with that? Only partially;

Only with "From each one according to their ability", since you can't ever demand someone to do or give anymore than what they're able to give, that's otherwise overexploiting a person

But,

I disagree with "to everyone according to their needs", since if in life you only posses everything you only need, life will get boring, and ultimately meaningless. Many experiences are something that people don't necessarily need, but they're what makes life, well, life for many people. This part of the sentence is only good if someone is in a place in life where they cannot afford everything they need. Otherwise it's not good.

What do you think?
