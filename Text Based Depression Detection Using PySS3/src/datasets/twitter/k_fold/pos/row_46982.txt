Why is life so terrible Iâ€™m stuck in this shitty life 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I donâ€™t want to be. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to be alive. I hate it. Itâ€™s a continuous loop of pain and torture. I get shouted at by my parents for playing video games the only thing that makes me happy. Idk if i can go on.. thereâ€™s one way to end it and I face it every day. If I was to do it. Would it even affect anyone? Will my friends even care. Would people care or am I just someone who would be forgotten. And for the people who think this is for attention. Fuck you. Downvote this for all I care. I just find this server as a safe place to go as we are all teenagers. Iâ€™m 14 for anyone who wonders but who would..
