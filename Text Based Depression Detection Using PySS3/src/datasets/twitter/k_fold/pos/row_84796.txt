What kind of abomination is that? So, I went out with my grandparents to a Mexican restaurant. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but I figured I'd find something. Well, I decided to get a cheese steak burrito. On the menu it literally said, "two burritos with cheese, steak, and cheese sauce on top. Served with French fries." 

Well as any normal person would, I thought the fries would be on the side. Nope, they put the fries *in the burrito* plus the burrito had other stuff that the menu didn't mention, guacamole, lettuce, and black beans. All of which I don't like.
