Mine is: Once i was on bike going shopping in shop right in front of my crush's house. When I was like 10 meter from the shop i met her just cassually saying hello nothing special. When I arrived home she called me saying that she likes me and i paniced don'd laught at this but i thaught its troll call from either 1 of her friends or her surrounded by friends wanting to just make fun of me *damn anxiety* i said after having my phone completly turned off for 3 days straight 1 year afterwards i met her again and she was just awfull she still looked briliant but her personalyty was completly different then what i thaught she was with guy that is known for drinking alcohol doing illegal graphity and smoking and she was behaving even worse than him at this point i am completly thankfull for the anxiety what saved me from this and i have a 10 months infoor cat that completly took my anxiety and empty place at my heart away
