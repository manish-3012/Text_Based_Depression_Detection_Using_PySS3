Little comments built up on my and now I want to cry. All throughout my teen years so far, I have kept a good handle on not letting little comments hurt. BUT TODAY... someone said something to me and I DONT EVEN KNOW THEM and it made me want to cry. Anyone have any tips on how to deal with this or an explanation on why something so small could make me feel so small?
