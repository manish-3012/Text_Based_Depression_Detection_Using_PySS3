Itâ€™s okay to not want to wear a mask The difference is made by IF you wear it. For example, I donâ€™t want to wear a mask, but I always do, no matter what. Meanwhile, Karen doesnâ€™t want to wear a mask and will not under any circumstances wear a mask because it violates her â€œrights.â€  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
