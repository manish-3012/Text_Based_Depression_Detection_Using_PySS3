Is this a sign that im too confident with myself? So my whole life ive hated myself and how ugly i am, but i still have a couple friends. So about a week ago at late night youtube just started recommending me a shit ton of motivational and self love videos. I watched as many as i could and what i got from them is that i have to get myself out there, be myself, that i have to believe in myself, and that in order for people to like me, i have to love myself, so i did. I spent an entire week just trying to motivate myself and be more confident (while still being myself) just to build up my self esteem. I got super confident but today i had a dream that shattered everything. In that dream, i was hanging out with my friends and a couple extra people and we went to a party and hung out all night, and people were taking lots of pics and vids. I made sure not to drink or vape but when the night was over, different people in my group were telling me to come over and each one of them showed my face in their vids or pics and specifically pointed out how ugly i am and told me that we can no longer be friends bc of that. My heart was absolutely shattered and i was thinking if i was over confident the whole time. Was i?
