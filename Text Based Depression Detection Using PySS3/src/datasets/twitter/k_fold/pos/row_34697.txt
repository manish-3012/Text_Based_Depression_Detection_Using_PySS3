I know this is a really overused phrase but: â€œDo anyone else feel like they were born in the wrong generation?â€ To explain this more: I just often feel like world moves a thousand miles an hour. And that I in general have more in common with people of letâ€™s say my grandparents generation. And I in general am not on the same wavelink as my peers.
