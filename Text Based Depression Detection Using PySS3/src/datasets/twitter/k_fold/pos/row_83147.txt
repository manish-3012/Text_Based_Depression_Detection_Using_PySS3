I need help. So .. there is a girl that I like a lot. However, I don't know whether it is mutual and I wanted to ask you whether you have any good tips on how I can "enhance" our friendship. Please answer only seriously. We have already met a couple of times, I don't know if it was a real date .. so she has already hugged me a couple of times, also said once that she likes me. But I am a shy person and mostly never know whether this is meant in a friendly way .. I am happy about any help!
