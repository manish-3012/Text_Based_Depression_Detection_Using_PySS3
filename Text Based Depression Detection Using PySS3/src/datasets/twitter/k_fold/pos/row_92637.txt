Can somebody find a good DVD reader. I recently have experienced a nostalgic urge to play the game Borderlands. But since my laptop doesn't have a disk reader I have look on Amazon for it. But most of the disk readers have very shit reviews. And with that, since I'm an idiot I have this irrational fear of my disk not being read because it's a game. Now I'm asking Reddit. Do you guys have any links to good reliable disk readers on amazon? Thank you. (Oh and would be nice if it shipped to the EU).
