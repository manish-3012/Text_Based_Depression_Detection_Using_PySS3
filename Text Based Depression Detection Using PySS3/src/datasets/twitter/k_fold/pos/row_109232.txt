My doctor thinks trump was sent my god to fix the u.s.a Ok real quick this not my doctor its my dads but I still hope you enjoy. So Iâ€™m just chilling minding my own business and my mom comes though the door and says â€œI now know why your dad does not like to go to the doctorâ€ and I said why and she tells me that my dad went to the doctors to get a check up and he says to my dad that itâ€™s dumb that heâ€™s wearing a mask. So now he thinks masks are dumb and that trumps a saint. So he gets everything done and during the check up on the tv the news comes on about trump and he says â€œyou know god sent that man to do his holy duty. Yeah like trump is real holy, then as he gets out of the parking lot he sees a truck with a trump flag and a make American Great again hat.
