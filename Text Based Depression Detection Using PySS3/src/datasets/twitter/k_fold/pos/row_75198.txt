How do you guys usually caption ur photos? Personally, on my Instagram most of my photos are uncaptioned because a picture says a thousand words, and a few more don't add anything to the post. 

Like if a girl posts a photo of her and her friends hanging out and captions it "Hanging out with my besties!ðŸ¥°" It doesn't add anything to the post. We can clearly see what your doing and the caption just wastes time.

The only time that I caption a photo is when it needs some certain context provided with it for it to be significant.

Also a whole page with no captions just has a nice esthetic to it.
