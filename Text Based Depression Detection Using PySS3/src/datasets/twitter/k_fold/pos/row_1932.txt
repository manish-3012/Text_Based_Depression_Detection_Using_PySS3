I just want to be loved  im feeling lonely, sad, not important i just want to experience the feeling of having somebody be there for you, somebody that cares for you and loves you (and the other way around of course). I never really had great chances with girls because im a coward i never managed to tell a girl that i have fellings for her and i hate myself for that that i never let something out of me i probably wont find someone for some time. Every night i just sit there and think about it if i will ever be loved and i cant find an answer for that. maybe i dont deserve a lover maybe im destined to be all alone or not. whatever i do it always stays the same. ill be thankful if somebody could cheer me up or something because i cant get this out of my mind
