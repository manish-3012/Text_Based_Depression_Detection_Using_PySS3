help im fjfjjsjvj before i get into this iâ€™m explain a bit about me and the situation i guess, iâ€™m lesbian and in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. iâ€™m slowly loosing feelings for her but she really really likes me and sheâ€™s a great person so this is hard. iâ€™m just not attracted to her anymore, i feel like my love for her has been platonic. i like this one person, i donâ€™t want to cheat but i donâ€™t want to wait a long time until i break up with her. this whole thing is a mess but i really need advice on what i should do
