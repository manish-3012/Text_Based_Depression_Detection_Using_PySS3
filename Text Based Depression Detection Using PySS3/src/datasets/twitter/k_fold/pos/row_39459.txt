really don't care about covid really dont care about covid. I know people will hate me for it, but I genuinely dont care. I dont want to wear a mask so I'm not going to wear one. I dont care about you or your family. I know its selfish but I've been so emotionally drained by all the shit going on in this shit hole country that i just dont care anymore.

"But my kids...!" 

"Fuck your kids."
