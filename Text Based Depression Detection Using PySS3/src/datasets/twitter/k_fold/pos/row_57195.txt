a beautiful song this js I do it for my streets
I do it for my hood
I do it for my momma
I do what's good
I do it for my cat
I do it for my dog
I do it for my hamster
I do it for my fish

Oooh I do it for my hood
I do it for my hood
Oooh I do it for my hood
I do it for my hood

If you wanna come to my hood come test me
I'm chillin' in the streets hanging out like my testes
I do it for my city
I do it for my hood
I do it for my city
I do it for the streets man

Oooh I do it for my hood (pop, pop, pop!)
I do it for my hood (yeah!)
Oooh I do it for my hood
I said I do it for my hood

I'm selling cocaine in the streets like groceries
Except it's not groceries
It's cocaine
I never have sex with a condom on
Cause I wanna repopulate my city
My city
My hood
Repopulate my hood
Repopulate my hood
Repopulate my hood

I do it for my city
I do it for my hood
I do it for my city
I do it for my hood
I do it for my cat
I do it for my dog
I do it for my bird
I do it for my fish
