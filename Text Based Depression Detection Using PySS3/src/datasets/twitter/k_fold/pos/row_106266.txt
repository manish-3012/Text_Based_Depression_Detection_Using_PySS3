I got news today that ny auntie is completely sober from drugs! My auntie has been on pills, cocaine and much more since i was around 2 and after around 13 years i recently found out shes off drugs from my nan. She is now back on track and i thought i'd tell you guys, all of the fear i had from the amount of overdoses she's been through and even a coma at one point is now gone. This is the longest she's went without an overdose too, it became a frequent thing in 2016 when my cousin was born and was immediately put into care, but now hes back with her and everyone is happy!!! Please stay away from drugs, you're not just putting yourself in danger its friends and family too.
