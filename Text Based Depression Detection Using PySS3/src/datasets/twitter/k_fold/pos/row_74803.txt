Alot of teens DONâ€™T hate school we dont hate school or the teachers or the education system. what WE hate is that they teach us to be scared of failing. its either you PASS or you FAIL, itâ€™s an A or a B but thats not how it works in real life. the ones who are MOST successful are the ones who have FAILED the most. itâ€™s not about failing. FAILING comes from trying. being a FAILURE comes from quitting. They should teach us kids NOT TO QUIT.
