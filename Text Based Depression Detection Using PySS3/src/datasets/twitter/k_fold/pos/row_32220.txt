i want to live my life, but my parents are strict hi, so im a teen girl, 15. and i have like 0 friends, and cant drive. BUT, when im much older, and this pandemic is older, i can drive, and when i have friends haha i want to live my life. i want to sneak out, go to parties, maybe even smoke once or twice, drink, have sex, etc. i just wanna live my life the way i want and be a teenager. and yes ik all of u are reading this probably wondering what im thinking, probably calling me trashy, etc, but i promise im not. i just want to live life without regrets. obviously none of this is gonna be happening anytime soon for many reasons, and im also too scared haha, but when the time does come to sneak out and be rebellious every once in awhile, how do i do it??

see, my parents are insanely strict. i mean theyre not strict on some things, like how i dress, or little things like that. but theyre strict on SCREENTiME, friends, bedtime, they limit junk food, etc. they would NEVER in a million years let me go to a party where the parents would be gone, or if they didnt know the parents etc. and our house has an alarm (no cameras, but an alarm). how am i gonna sneak out and do whatever. can someone give me actual life advice, yk excuses, tips, etc.
