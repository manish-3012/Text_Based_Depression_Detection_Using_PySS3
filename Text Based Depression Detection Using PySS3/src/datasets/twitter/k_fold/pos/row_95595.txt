I just discovered something or rediscovered I dunno I was taking a bath and I remembered a technique from JoJo (it's an anime). The dudes can conduct energy through breathing. So I thought maybe I can do it too!. There was a pail with hot water and I brought in another one and filled it with cold water. I took luke warm water and placed one hand in the hot and one in the cold water. I breathed in a pattern and I could feel the hot and coldness in both hands. So I took them out and placed it in the luke warm water and started breathing. And BOOM the hand which was in the hot water felt extremely chilly and the one in cold water felt hot!!. I don't think I've seen this before but thank you for reading my TED textn
