Girlfriend broke up with me. Kind of happy in a way I mean we did have a great time at the start, but for the last month she lost feelings for me. She only told me last week but I could tell that I was before. We weren't going to see each other for two weeks a couple weeks ago, and I aksed her if she wanted to hang out. She instantly said no, I have work to do. Last year, she would make time for us to hang out. she's a busy person, but she always tried to balance things. Well, for the last month she didn't bother to even make time. At school she treated me like crap, didn't care about me and what I wanted, always tried avoiding me. I even asked her to be there for me because I was having a bad time. She said she would, but put a ton of distance between us. 


Last Monday, I brought this up. I said that I feel as though she has taken me for granted, and even not treating me like a friend. I said that she was treating every other person I know better than me. I then asked if she still liked me as a boyfriend. She said that she loved hanging out with me and that she had so much fun, but she doesn't see me as a boyfriend. 


She said that nothing much is going to change, we will still see each other at basketball, Karate, school and when we hike, just without the status. She said that she still wants to be close friends. It's strange, because she didn't put any effort into the relationship and let it go one sided, which made me sacrifice some things to continue the relationship. Not worth it because all I got in return is she treating me like an acquaintance. 


Well, right after the breakup she was treating me so much better than when we were in a relationship, like at the very start of our relationship when we were at a school camp with no stress, 5 months ago. It's really confusing, and the night after the breakup we talked for 3 hours on the phone, and did the same the night after. She still wants a drawing that I made for her with a message saying "may we have an amazing future together," which makes me wonder why she still wants it. 


Its really confusing, and it's making it hard for me to get over the breakup. But now that there is school holidays for two weeks, I can have some space and learn to love myself again. She never loved me back, and it took 4 months for us to kiss. We're 15 by the way. I don't think she was ready for a relationship, because she never knew how to act or what she wanted. I'm kind of happy that we aren't together anymore, because  I wanted things that she didn't, and she wanted things that I didn't. So it didn't work out I the end, but we had a lot of fun.
