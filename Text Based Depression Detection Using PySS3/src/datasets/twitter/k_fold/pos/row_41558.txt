I just had to tell someone so I'm telling reddit Today was my class' first day with this new teacher, while she was introducing herself I was smiling about something else, she got really annoyed about that and asked me why I was smiling, I simply said I was happy. She didn't like that answer and shouted at me for a minute or 2, then asked : " Do you smile like that in other classes? " I just replied only when I'm happy. The whole class, including my crush, burst out in laughter (I know it sounds extremely unfunny but it was hilarious in the moment). 

Notes :
-English isn't my first language so sorry for bad translation or any other mistakes.
- This might be normal for some of yall but I have very low self-esteem and this was a big boost to it
