Am i crazy for this? So i have a lot of trouble with homework in school, and i admit itâ€™s mostly my fault, but iâ€™m not the only reason, Every time i do 1 homework 2 new ones appear, and when i do 3, 6 new ones appear, and my dad doesnâ€™t believe that as much as i do my homework, they just keep multiplying. Anyone else has a similar experience? Or am i crazy?
