My school thinks im suicidal and i dont trust anyone anymore Just now, my dad told me my math teacher said I was suicidal. He said I was crying in the bathroom and said I wanted to die. What I actually said was that I missed my best friend who moved away but ok. Recently the vice principal also said the psychology department was "observing" Me. I didn't bother asking why though. But a lot of teachers, especially my math teacher, send me to either the school therapist or the principals office when I cry. And thats a problem because I cry when I'm stressed. I don't even know if I can trust the school therapist anymore. Shes so nice but I don't want to talk about my feelings because all the adults in my school treat me like I'm mentally unstable. I've been questioning it, think I might have adhd but probably not. But I'm definitely not suicidal and I dont feel comfortable talking to anyone in my school about anything anymore. Maybe I should just shut up and wait until I move to a new school.
