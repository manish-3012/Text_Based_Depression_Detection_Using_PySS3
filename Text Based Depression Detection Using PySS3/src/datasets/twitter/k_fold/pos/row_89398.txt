My weekly routine lol Monday morning, I wake up. Depression hits me as I realize that I have to go to work. Drink coffee, and then get to work. Tuesday morning, I wake up. Happy that Monday is over, but still sad that itâ€™s so early in the week. Go to work. Wednesday morning, I wake up. Still 3 work days left, but hey, itâ€™s hump day! Go to work. Thursday morning, I wake up. Weâ€™re getting closer... go to work. Get home Thursday night, alright bois itâ€™s almost Friday! Starting to get excited. Friday morning, I wake up. Itâ€™s Friday! Go to work happy and cheerful! Get off work at 5:00... run out the office screaming and yelling like a madman â€œITS FRIDAY NIGHT ITS THE WEEKEND!!!!!â€ Hop into my car, drive home way over the speed limit, get in bed, order a pizza, watch TV. Eat pizza, wait a while for it to get dark, then head to the nightclub. Get there, meet up with my friends, get super drunk, dance all night, get home at around 4 AM, and pass out in bed. Saturday... afternoon, wake up at around noon. Hungover, relax at home and watch TV most of the day. Saturday night... oh boy, here we go. Go out after dark, and do tons of crazy shit. Have fun, party, more clubbing, meet up with friends, just have a great time. Get home late that night. Sunday morning, I wake up. Still a bit hungover, but I get up, get dressed, brush my teeth, and go to church to repent of my weekend sins. I have accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior, and I cleanse myself with communion every Sunday morning. Get home Sunday afternoon, meet up with some Christian friends, and do some Bible study and prayer. Sunday night comes along, and I reflect back on the amazing weekend I have had, while starting to get sad because I know that the next day is Monday. Monday morning, I wake up. The weekly routine restarts from here. What is you guysâ€™ weekly routine?
