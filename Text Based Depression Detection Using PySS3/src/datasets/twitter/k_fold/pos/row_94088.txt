I haven't died of radiation poisoning So y'all probably remember my last post about me playing around with radium. 
I'm still alive. My Geiger counter arrived today and it looks like my room is mostly fine. There is a small bit more radiation than in the rest of the house but nothing to worry about. I will probably wipe the floor a few more times and it should be all good. 
As many people pointed out radium emits almost exclusively alpha radiation which gets blocked by the watch case so having the watches around should be ok too. And since I probably didn't spill ingest or inhale much radium I also won't die any time soon (atleast of radiation)
I also contacted the federal institute for radiation protection and asked them how to dispose the watches just in case. Not sure if I'll do that yet I might just sell them.
I will never work on an old watch with lume again that whole thing gave me a good scare.
