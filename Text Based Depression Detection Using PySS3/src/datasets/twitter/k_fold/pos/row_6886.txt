I don't think I had any real friends in high school For years I have thought that I have had good friends in high school. But I have graduated and looking back at it, I don't think most of these people whom I worshipped were actually my friends, except for maybe one or two people. Now that I think about it, they've only used me as a toy to make them happy. They would squeeze all the funny and humor I had, and when they were done playing with it they just throw the toy away and go off in their own little groups. Fucking sucks. Because that's not what true friends do. True friends stand up for one another and help one another. Friends fight for one another and support one another. Not just use the other person as some sort of toy that you throw away once you're done using it. I'm now in college and it's safe to say that I am never looking back at that again. Fuck high school
