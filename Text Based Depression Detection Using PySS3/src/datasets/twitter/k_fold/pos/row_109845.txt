Sparred the second time lol This is taekwondo.

I went against my friend because there weren't any other people in my category. We sparred 3 times and each one had 2 rounds. 

First sparring we weren't really warmed up and were getting used to sparring (I mean we hadn't sparred in like 2 weeks). There wasn't anything interesting except the one time I hit a front kick to his face and him wheel kicking me after I tried to hop towards him.

After that there were 2 other sparrings while we relaxed.

Second sparring was a little better,he mostly dominated me. Our sensei told him to get into a clinch because I am taller and it was easier to throw kicks then step back for me at a distance. Immediately after the round started he tried to get into a clinch, I managed to get some kicks to stop him but eventually he got there and just ripped me apart. At the end I got a little mad so I managed to get a tornado kick after a roundhouse,but lost by one point.

He jokingly mocked me after he won so I was half mad half laughing.

I went ballistic on him the third sparring because 1. I was mad, 2. It was the determinative sparr 3. Sensei told me to get him into a corner and hold him there.

I ran at him which wasn't a great idea, that's why he welcomed me with a kick,after that I gave 5-7 unanswered kicks and held him in a corner. I was absolutely tired at that point but,as he told me after we finished,I hurt his leg,he was trying to rest so couldn't do much. He start winning me after he got really close. I managed to catch up giving my all into my kicks after he got tired. Then we had a "golden point" if that's a thing in english( I translated it directly so it can have a different name). Basically,if someone has the same points,they have a round where,whoever hits first,wins. 

And,Yay,I won.
