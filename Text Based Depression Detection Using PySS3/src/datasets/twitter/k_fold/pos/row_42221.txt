Saying "trans rights are human rights" is stupid. Of course trans people are real people, why would you need to say that they aren't? Even if you don't agree with them, that doesn't make them any less human. Saying trans right are human rights just shows that you admit that trans people are not like others, therefore segregating against them. I'm not trans, nor am I in the LGBT, but seeing trans people getring segregated against just doesn't feel right for me.
