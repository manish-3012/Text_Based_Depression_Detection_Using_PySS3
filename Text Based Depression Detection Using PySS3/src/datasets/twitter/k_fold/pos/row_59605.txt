Idk guys, I can't really live anymore I've done mistakes that I cannot forgive, even if others have. I thought I was a good and caring person, in fact I am, but I wasn't in the past. 

I've always believed of myself as a good person, I did good things in the past that I'm proud of, but at the same time I was a shit. What the fuck... I have never seen a person split in two parts like I was. 

And now my guilt doesn't make me enjoy life anymore. Whenever someone smiles at me I feel unworthy of that smile. 

I can't even play videogames, not even my favourite one, The Last of Us. I so deeply love its characters, what they have meant to me, that now I only feel pain looking at them. And I know this sound dumb but it is true. 

Small things meant the world to me, even the frickin The Last of Us, and now I'm unable to do a lot of things that I enjoyed. 

What is the sense of anything of this anymore... I currently only live for others pleasure, my sister's, I even hurt her but God knows why that beautiful person still love me like no one else, my family's, my friends. But I, personally don't enjoy anything anymore. 

My only hope is that therapy will help, and I hope it will all my heart and soul. But this wounds... Sorry guys if I'm posting so much here but you're the only community that I find friendly and that will hear me.
