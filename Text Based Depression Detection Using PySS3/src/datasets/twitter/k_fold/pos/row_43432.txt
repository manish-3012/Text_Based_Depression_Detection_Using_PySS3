It boggles my mind how some people think causing violence in a video game will make me a violent person Games like GTA Online and CoD Modern Warfare are literally based around the concept of killing people, not to mention the wide range of military equipment both games sport, be it jets, tanks, bombs or whatever.   
  
I just fucking hate it when I cause havoc in GTA Online and some moron goes â€œYoU mUsT bE a ViOleNt PeRsOn IrLâ€. Because it doesnâ€™t fucking work that way.   
  
I consider myself a good quickscoper in CoD, but does that make me a professional sniper? No.
