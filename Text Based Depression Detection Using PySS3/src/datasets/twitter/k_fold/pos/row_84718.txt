Guys I got food advice. Real simple food: extra virgin olive oil, vegetables (frozen or fresh) and onion soup mix. Make it in a pan, put the veggies in until most of the ice is gone, then put in the olive oil and wait until the veggies are getting a little crispy, then put in the onion mix and make sure it gets all over and then keep it in for like ten minutes.. I generally eyeball the Measurements, but a decent base is 1 tablespoon of oil, a quarter bag of veggies and half a pouch of onion mix. I usually get the california mix of veggies, but others work too.
