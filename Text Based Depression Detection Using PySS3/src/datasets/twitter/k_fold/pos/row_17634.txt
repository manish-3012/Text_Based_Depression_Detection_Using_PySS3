Talk to yourself more Recently, i've started to talk to myself more when i'm alone or while i'm studying. And boy it has helped me alot. Talking to yourself makes you like yourself better too. Not just talking to yourself in your mind, but actually whispering out loud to yourself. Trust me, it lets you know more about yourself and love yourself even more.
