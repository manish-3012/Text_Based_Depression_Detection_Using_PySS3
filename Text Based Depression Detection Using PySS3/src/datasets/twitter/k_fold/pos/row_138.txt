Anybody else enjoy cooking/baking for others? Made my boyfriend cookie marbled brownies yesterday and he loved them! Ngl it makes me so happy how much he loves my cooking. Iâ€™m currently learning how to Khmer (his ethnicity) food for him. Heâ€™s got a big appetite so whenever he asks me to make him something and seeing how quickly he eats it all is amazing
