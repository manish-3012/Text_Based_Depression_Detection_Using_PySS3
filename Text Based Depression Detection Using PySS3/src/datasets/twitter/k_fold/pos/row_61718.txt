Big accomplishment made, and all of that to waste. Basically, I finally mastered a complex piece on the piano (Clair De Lune, search it up on YT if you don't know it), it too me around a month to practice the whole 5 minute piece. Then my music teacher asked me to perform the piece in front of the whole school. Now, I have a lot of anxiety but I really wanted to toughen up and so I sought this as an opportunity to become a braver person in general. Well, all was going to plan until there was 13 cases of Covid-19 amongst staff, I was in close contact with a covid student and 181 students had to self-isolate, and because of the lack of staffing (42% of total staff not in school, more staff had to isolate before), I never got the opportunity to play in front of the whole school. Such a shame. I had  friends who wanted to hear me play, but I feel bad because now the opportunity has gone to waste.

I'm also pissed because my dad said he'll buy me Cyberpunk 2077 if I do, but now it looks like the chances of me getting Cyberpunk 2077 is slim. God hates me I guess. sigh
