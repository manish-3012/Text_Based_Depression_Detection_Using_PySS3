I really need your help Long story short, I really to gift my close online a digital drawing of her dog as a birthday gift. We live really far away from each other so I couldn't think of any better birthday presents. Unfortunately, I am no good when it comes to art. So it would mean the world to me if someone could do this.

 I have nothing to offer as compensation. So it's understandable if noone would like to.
