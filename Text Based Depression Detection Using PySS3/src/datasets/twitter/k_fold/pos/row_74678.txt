I don't feel like talking abt this somewhere else People on tiktok and insta keep sexualizing ''my hero academia'' characters and its creepy af

I know people do it for horny 14 year old girls but it's kinda bad

I mean, there are not only 14 year old girls on social media (proof with the recent posts talking about p*dos) 

And my friends don't want to agree with me smh

I'm tired of receiving links to mha tiktoks on our group chat and the others saying it's ok

I really want to talk abt it smh
