Adults on this sub man Now first of all, being an adult on this sub is fine.

But, some people that I've been having arguments with point out that im just a child. 
Well no shit, Harold, how did you find out? And by pointing  out the fact that im a minor, i will assume youre an adult, on a subreddit for teens, lurking in the shadows, while you ask your 55 year old mom to bake you an other batch of biscuits, you keyboard knight.

 I bet you eat your mother's biscuits with garlic, you twat. Please dont "bully" people for being teens... On a sub for TEENS. Its like me going into a retirement home, and bullying 87 year old uncle Josh for not being able to outrun me. Since you probably cannot comprehend all this, i will sum it up for you: Fuck off

Oh and people dont forget: stay safe, covid sucks ass
