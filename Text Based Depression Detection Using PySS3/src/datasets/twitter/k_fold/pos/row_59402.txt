Welcome to My World Ya know, I've been thinking about this since the pandemic started. I've watched almost every teenager I know go crazy over doing online school - they hate it! It's amusing because I did online school for 7 years before going to college, and when they kicked everyone off campus, I just did everything online again, just like I did before. Nothing really changed for me, 'cause I was used to it. All I could think was, "Welcome to my world!" Is this the case with anyone else, or am I just that weird online school kid? Lol
