Would you consider this wrestling? Why or why not? When I was 10 years old, me and my friend (both boys), used to   physically lift/carry each other in each other's arms. Like, my friend  would hug me around the legs, and hoist me up for a few seconds. Is this  wrestling? What would you consider it?
