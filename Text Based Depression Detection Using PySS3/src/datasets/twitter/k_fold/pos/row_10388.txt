I am creating a band. Yes, you heard that right, a band. But not a "boy band" like you people have nowadays. Real bands. Bands that play real music instead of fucking electronic talentless crap.

Well, i am a guitarist, and i love playing thrash metal, generic heavy metal and hard rock. If you are-

A drummer
A guitarist
A vocalist
A bassist

Sharing my interests and if you are interested in forming a band with me, please dm me. I'll be grateful. Thanks.
