Worst funneral in my life About a year ago i went to the funeral and my mom's friend keep talking shit like "i want your son for my daughter" out loud and that is fucking disgusting and most of people are gossipping this is terrible wven worse is i dont know any one there i hate going in public even more after this
Gotta mention the nicest guy in here (alive)
He just simply says "yo nice shoes" why can't every one belike this 

Not to mention how shit they did the funneral 
They dont even care about the man who died
