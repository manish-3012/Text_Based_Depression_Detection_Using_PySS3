â€”i skipped school this whole week because i stood up all night playing league and couldnâ€™t wake up 

â€”havenâ€™t eaten a meal for a week and a half so now iâ€™m dizzy and weak as fuck but iâ€™m not hungry at all

â€”iâ€™m on a crackhead diet of alcohol coke and monsters all in the same day for a few days. awful feeling.  

â€”havenâ€™t gone out in a week until today 

â€”fucked up my sleeping schedule and canâ€™t sleep
