For fellow LGBTQIA people It is extremely difficult being yourself in such an intolerant world, but you can still live an amazing life nevertheless. Remember that you are loved for who you are and that there are incredible people out there. Thanks for being here because you have truly made my life better and have made me more comfortable with being a trans person as well ðŸ’™
