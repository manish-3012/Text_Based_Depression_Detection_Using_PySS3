Iâ€™m failing every single course in my high school. Yeah, it was not click bait. Iâ€™m failing every single course due to homeworks. I have no plans now, I canâ€™t recover and it is possible my parents will not pay for the second opportunity. Iâ€™m done and I donâ€™t know what to do.

142 IQ test two years ago, fuck you, you were so fucking wrong, high school, fuck you, good grades on junior high, fuck them, and overall, fuck you COVID, you are going to destroy my school life.
