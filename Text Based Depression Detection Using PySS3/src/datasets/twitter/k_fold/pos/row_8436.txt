Uber eats rant What in the actual fuck. Me and my brother ordered some shit and as soon as we pressed order i thought about if my sister wanted soemthing, so we cancel the order and as I go to my sister to ask if she wants anything, I get an email saying I was charged a cancellation fee, okay, pretty normal

#fucking 34 dollars cancellation

Apparently â€œthe restaurant already started the order, so you were charged $34â€ but we cancelled right away. They did not fucking start the order, they didnâ€™t even grab a plate by the time we cancelled. And it was 30. Fucking. 4.
