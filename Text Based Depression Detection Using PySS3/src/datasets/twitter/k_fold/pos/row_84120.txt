Uh so I have like a question So basically why so much staring? So the last few weeks, like 5+ boys have been looking at me as I walk past/around my locker, during gym, between periods, etc. itâ€™s getting kinda weird. Some of them multiple times a day. Is this normal with boys? I dunno Iâ€™m just worried that whereâ€™s some rumor going around about me or someone told a friend they liked me or something. I mean Iâ€™m like the definition of ugly. I wear glasses, Iâ€™m actually fat, but I do wear lots of leggings lately and hoodies some days, and the boys arenâ€™t all part of the same friend group, I believe thereâ€™s like 2 clans and some of them have been looking  at me, is this like normal? Do boys just like to stare at people at lot? Should I be concerned?
