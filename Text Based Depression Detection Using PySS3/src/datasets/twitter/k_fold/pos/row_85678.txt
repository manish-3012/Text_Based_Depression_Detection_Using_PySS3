Bro why do other teens go to each other's houses and drink. Like fr my guy i get vaping occasionally because you have bad af anxiety but what's up with the vodka drinking. Like damn I'm friends with these kids but at the same time I want to be an actual adult and tell them why that's wrong and it's not worth it. Nobody gives a f*ck that you can drink alchohol. Get a f*cking maxed SAT score if you want to brag about something. Like fr you think you're mature enough to drink alchohol but you're the opposite because you think that you're mature enough. Dumbasses. Like I might be un f*cking cool or something but at least I'm not weak willed enough to be pressured into drinking by my friends.
