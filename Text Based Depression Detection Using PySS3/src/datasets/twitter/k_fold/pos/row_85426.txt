Imma finally share this to strangers i don't know Last person I dated, I had no idea what was happening. I felt to much of a connection between us two, my hands would sweat all the time when I was around her, I had no idea what was happening when she asked me out. I said yes without knowing what I agreed to, but I didn't regret it. I was so sad when I heard what happened to her. She was caught hurting herself, and I blamed myself. I wasn't there enough, I never got to hug her, I never got to do anything. I hope she didn't commit the thing, she would've been out of the shelter by now, i could talk to her, i could do what I needed to do, show more affection.
