I just had sleep paralysis... 4 times this night... Last week I had my first. I was terrified. I couldn't sleep well. Now I just kept falling back to sleep, waking up, and had 2 minutes of horror while keeping my eyes closed because I didn't want to see who or what hands am I feeling pushing down my chest. 4 times...
