Would you consider dating a virtual woman if the best virtual woman you could date is not in your league? **Canâ€™t edit title: I meant if the best real girl you could date is not in your league!**

Also I hope you understand what Iâ€™m saying about a girl not being in â€œyour leagueâ€ I know itâ€™s a confusing phrase but I just donâ€™t want to hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings tonight especially if theyâ€™re a girl.

I thought about if I could have the chance to date/marry my favorite VTuber and ditch my fiancÃ©e, I would probably still pick my fiancÃ© but itâ€™s a close call.

Do any of you have a crush on a VTuber and are you willing to say who she is? ðŸ¤”
