If your suicidal please read this. Dont do it. Yea this may sound corny and what not but after reading an article about some 11 year old boy who took his own life i just cant afford to read another article finding out that another kid killed their self. I swear on everything you got someone out there who cares about you. Theres too much to live for especially if your a teen just to throw it away and take your life. I used to be depressed and suicidal and i thought suicide would eventually be the answer. No. Times gets better. Life will get better. The moon is a very pretty satellite for Earth and just go outside and take a look at it. Isnt it beautiful? In the morning at sunrise go outside and take a look at just Nature. Isnt it also a beautiful thing? A parents worse fear is to outlive their own kid. Its gonna be a process but you'll get through it. It wont last forever. I really like to remind myself that pain is temporary. Whether its mental or physical pain, its temporary. Just think of all the times you've laughed with your friends or ate your favorite meal, if you weren't alive you wouldn't have experience that laugh with your friends or that tasty meal. Think about all the goals you'd like to accomplish. If your not here to accomplish them then who will? If your not there with your friends to also laugh about the joke then it wont even be funny anymore. If your not here then what are the people who care about you going to do. Once you take your own life there's no coming back.

Please stay, you matter.
