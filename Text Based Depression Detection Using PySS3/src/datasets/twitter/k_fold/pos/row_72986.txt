My mom took away my PS4 controller It was for having an F in a class but I brought it up to a B just by doing the assignments but Iâ€™m always nervous to ask for something like that back because itâ€™ll either go great or go wrong and sheâ€™ll keep it for another week. Anyway what should I do with this free time
