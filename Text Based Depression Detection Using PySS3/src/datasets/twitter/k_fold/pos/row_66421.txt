Being short sucks Being a short dude fucking sucks. Why does that gotta be the first thing people comment on. Or the only thing they notice about me. People are always pointing it out like yeah I know im short piss off. God I just wanna have a growth spurt so I dont have to deal with this shit. Who knows maybe itd help my low self esteem if I was normal
