WHY AM I SO EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO PEOPLE I DONâ€™T LIKE I have this guy friend and I donâ€™t think we have ever liked each other in a romantic way. He is 100% not my type but every-time I see him with other girls, I get so jealous in some weird way?? Iâ€™m not just telling myself I donâ€™t like him, because Iâ€™ve tried to imagine every scenario possible and I donâ€™t see anything happening. This guy, we donâ€™t even talk personally unless its a group-chat weâ€™re both apart of. These feelings are so annoying because I know he is not my type and I donâ€™t ever see a future with him. Maybe itâ€™s because heâ€™s good-looking but I need some validation from other people to get over this guy I donâ€™t even like. These weird feelings always happen when heâ€™s with other girls and it just ruins my day. P.S Iâ€™m not hating on him or the girls; the problem is my annoying feelings!!!
