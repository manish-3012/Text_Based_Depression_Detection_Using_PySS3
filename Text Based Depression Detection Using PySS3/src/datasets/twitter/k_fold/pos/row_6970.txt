*happiness noises* Hi guys and gals I just wanted to say that thereâ€™s this girl Iâ€™ve liked for a while now and recently school has started up again. Anyway at the very end of the day we wait for each other at the bottom of one of the staircases and honestly, thatâ€™s the best part of my day! Anyway just wanted to share with people how happy I am around her, thatâ€™s all, thanks for reading this.
