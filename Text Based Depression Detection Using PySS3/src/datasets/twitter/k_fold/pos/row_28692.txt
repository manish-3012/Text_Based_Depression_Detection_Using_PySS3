I've always looked back at my past when I was happy but one question always lurked in the back of my mind. Did I ever know I was truly happy? This has been on my mind for the past couple years now. But got worse ever since quarantine. Its really made me think about how much better my quality of life was but now as I get older I realize that its just stagnant at the moment. Not getting better not getting worse. My one hope at the moment is 2021 is better but my hopes have been wrong before.
