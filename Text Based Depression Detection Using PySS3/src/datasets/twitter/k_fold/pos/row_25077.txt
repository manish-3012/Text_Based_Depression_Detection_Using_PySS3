You ever take a survey and realize you actually have exactly 0 friends. It's kind of sad when you think about it but it doesn't really matter. I supposedly helped a person on here with research and it was then I realized I have literally 0 friends. Anyway just wanted to say something I don't know why I'm not looking for friends, karma, or awards just felt like saying something. Sorry if I wasted your time.
