Fellow graffiti artist My friends recently started a youtube channel on their graffiti art. I myself am terrible at graffiti, but they asked mtle to try and spread the news on their new channel. I know it is very uncanny to post this channel, but i like my friends, and I want rhem to have a good time with this channel

Here is the link only if your interested. I might try out graffiti, if i can EVER figure it out
