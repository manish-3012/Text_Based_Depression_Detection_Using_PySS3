Lunch seating You got the cool table the female table the table of asses, the table of losers and a couple friend groups sitting around. I however sit in the corner with my homie and discuss Star Wars and Lord of the Rings lore. Once a year we do dramatic Lord of the rings reading then do a marathon where we watch the extended editions back to back to back.
