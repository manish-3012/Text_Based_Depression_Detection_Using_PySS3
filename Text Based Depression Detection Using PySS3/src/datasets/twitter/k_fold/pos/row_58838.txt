i just took part in the biggest brained Among Us play ever things to remember: i was black, and i was imposter with dark green (DG). there were 7 people in total when the game started.

me and DG are both going opposite directions, me to nav, them to electrical. i vent over there, meet with DG, and ended up getting a double kill on purple and lime. i quickly vented back over to nav. by the time someone reported the bodies, both me and DG were far enough away that we were cleared of suspicion. when the bodies were reported, i went into the chat and said the following: "both me and cyan are imposters. if you don't believe me, vote me out, and vote them out after." so, everyone voted me out to see, and when they saw i really was imposter, they voted out cyan, who was really a crewmate. now, there was only 3 people left, Dark Green (imposter), White, and Pink. DG killed Pink, and got us the win.
