I'm failing every one of my online classes I expected this year to be fun, I got into concurrent classes so that means I'm taking college psychology, english composition, trigonometry, and calculus, my schedule looked great before school started. Then school started and the work pileup immediately started. I have 7 classes and about 2 assignments a day for each. I physically can't do this, I don't understand how anyone is expected to do this. I'm wrong though as my principal told my parents most people have adjusted so there's no excuse for me. I also don't understand how despite constant work we go through lessons insanely fast. I had to teach myself acceleration while doing a physics test, I understand calculus and trig but I do the assignments too slowly, infact I don't even know what lesson we're on in either of my math classes now. It just feels like a losing battle no matter what, if I do a history assignment it's a waste of time since I'm not doing a physics assignment due in a couple hours or if I do math it's a huge waste if time since on knewton I take  2-3 hours to do a single lesson. What's even worse is because of the sheer amount of assignments there are so many 0s I couldn't recover from this even if I did everything perfectly. I've recovered from awful grades before but this hole is too deep. The school councilor messages me every 2 days telling me I'm fucked and I'm so close to telling her I'm just gonna kill myself with this amount of work.
