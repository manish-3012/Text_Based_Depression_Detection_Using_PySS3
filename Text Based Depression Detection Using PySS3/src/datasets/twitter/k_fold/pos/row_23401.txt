In a lose/lose situation at the moment So my school quarter ends in two days. My teachers decided to give me ten assignments TODAY due at midnight and Iâ€™m on the verge of absolutely breaking down. Is anybody else having the worst time of their life with school right now?? I genuinely just want to cry forever at this point. Iâ€™m usually a straight A student but I canâ€™t get myself to put effort into my work. What should I do? Not doing the assignments is not an option. I have to do them or my mom will get mad. I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m trapped where I am. Please help.
