Maybe if.... Your entire class is on a group chat frustrated that they can't get it, you need to change something. Maybe if the honors class in a tiny private school looks like they went to hell and back after each class, you need to change something. Maybe if at least one of your students is feeling like throwing up before each class, something is wrong. Maybe if both of your sections are terrified of getting on tiny answer wrong in a really hard honors class, something needs to change. 

But the teacher's all remote, even when the students are in person. So how is she supposed to know?
