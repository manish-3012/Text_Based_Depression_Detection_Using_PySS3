My entire Sanctuary on the r/Teenagers Server was destroyed by the mods. They said I was on "nowhere's" land. And me, a player who joined 3 days ago received an eviction notice 7 days ago. (note that the sanctuary for new players as well as my highway was built 2 days ago) . I did not receive any note from the mods whatsoever. I logged on where I last was and immediately suffocated and died, losing all of my itens. My chests were also destroyed (with no warning). I joined this morning at around 9:00 left for an hour and bam. All my shit is gone. Well crap.
