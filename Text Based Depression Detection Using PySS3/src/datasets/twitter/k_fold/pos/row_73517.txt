My friend says Pokemon isn't an Anime lol He said I should *never ever* classify Pokemon as an Anime, he said I'm very uncultured on Anime looool. He also asked what's my favorite anime manga, I said Pokemon lol. That made him go crazy ðŸ˜”

Today he told me, he has faith in me on watching One punch Man, idk if I can live up to his expectations lmao

I haven't really been watching, playing Pokemin since 3 years , so idk tbh if Ill like One punch Man, but I guess I'll try
