What do I do So today in school I had insane migraine attack all of a sudden at like 10am 2nd period.
Basically i was normal until 1st period i swear my eyes were disabled I sat at the front of the class and everything was on board kept disappearing when I focus on the word and I can barely see things next to me. I even got in trouble cause I wasnâ€™t writing but I told her I couldnâ€™t see and she just said I needed glasses and basically mocked me in front of the class and the whole class laughed I didnâ€™t really care tho but I actually thought I need glasses. At 2nd period my vision was normal and I donâ€™t know how but I just continued with life and then there goes my whole head. Slowly and surely my head was aching in the right side. But it wasnâ€™t very sore. It was when it was at break time where I cannot handle myself. I actually scraping across the corridor next to the walls to the office. I told him my head is aching and i felt vomiting.(I thought I had COVID) they then told me to put my mask on and everything and isolated me and somehow the news went around the school. When my parents picked me up I went straight to bed and took paracetamol and my mum went to get the test thing for covid. Then guess what. I felt asleep then woke up at 12.30 my mum checked up on me to see if I was fine. And I was there like bro why am I still sleeping completely forgot I was sent home I thought I was late school lol. Then my mum got so pissed off tbought I was faking. (The thing is I felt normal lol) I checked my snap and got like so much people saying â€œdo u actually have covidâ€ like bruh what do I say lol
