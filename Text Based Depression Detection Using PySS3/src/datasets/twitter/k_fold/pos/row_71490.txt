There is a girl in my class steals glances at me for 1 year daily Now it's my last year in highschool and lucky for me we are in the same class again, and she still doing it!

I think I'm the reason of that I had a crush on her since the first look and I was talking about it with my homie, and I think she heard us since that she never stopped smiling at me and giving me side looks.

Is she into me?
Should I make the first move? I never did.
What should I say?
Am I sure she's not manipulating me?
