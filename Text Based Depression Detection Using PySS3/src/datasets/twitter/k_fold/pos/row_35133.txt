I feel like Iâ€™m overthinking this. Help? So I wanna but this hoodie online but Iâ€™m not sure what size to get it in. I looked at the size chart and I guess my question is, if I get the size that more closely fit my measurements, will it be tight? Or is that already accounted for?

I hope you get what I mean with this. Any help very much appreciated
