How can I make money if I'm under 16. So I have recently become interested on getting a new pc as my current laptop cant handle some of the games I have been wanting/trying to play, so I decided that I'd make myself one. The only issue is that I'm making it out of Asus ROG + RTX parts but my broke ass cant afford anything other than a mouse pad. SO I have been trying to find ways of making some money and as I'm under 16 I cant get a job.
