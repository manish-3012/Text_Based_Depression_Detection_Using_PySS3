I GOT A PC So for Christmas I was supposed to get a PC and a monitor, but the PC still hadn't come in yet. It was around the first week in January when my parents starting looking at the place they ordered it from, and it turns out they ordered it from a place with terrible reviews and they never came until like 4 months after order. The other day we canceled it and ordered a new one from Microsoft. It came in today, and I got it all set up. Triple monitors, soundbar, mic and Webcam, etc. If you want to get a PC, don't order form Lyte Gaming. It's garbage.
