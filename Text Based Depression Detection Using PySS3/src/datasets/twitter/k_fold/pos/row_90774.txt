Why doesnâ€™t racism go both ways? I know this will seem like a â€œIâ€™m a 15 year old trump supporterâ€ kinda post, but hear me out. 

The movie Ghost in the shell, was based on the Japanese manga. The main character thatâ€™s played by Scarlet Johansson is supposed to be an Asian character but a white person is playing her? Ok I get why people get mad, you canâ€™t play rolls outside of your race.

But in the new Peter Pan movie, Tinker bell, the WHITEST character in the universe, blond, white skin, blue eyes, is played by Yara Shahidi, an arab. But people are encouraging that? I have no problem with her playing tinker bell by the way, but then why isnt it ok for Scarlet to play an Asian character?
