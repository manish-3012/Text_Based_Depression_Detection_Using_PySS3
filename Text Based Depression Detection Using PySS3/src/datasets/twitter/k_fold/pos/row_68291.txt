About school shootings So i have a few questions about school shootings. In my country you cant get a gun not even the police have guns they have tazers and batons. Why is it so easy in America to get guns? A kid can get a gun so easily and its just fascinating that people sell them to underage kids or hell ordinary people. Ive heard American schools say like "Only 3 school shootings in 10 years" when if a kid gets caught with a small knife it makes it into the news and lasts about a week. And its not even private schools or anything its every school it doesnt matter how good/bad it is.
So my questions:
How easy can a kid get a gun? 
How often are school shootings in your area? 
How is it to go to school everyday knowing that you may die to the hands of a classmate or a friend?
