So I translated the lyrics of a song... The original song is in Spanish and for some reasons that donâ€™t matter I ended up translating it to english. Of course I had to change some words so it sounds better but I think my translation is pretty loyal to the original. Without further ado hereâ€™s the lyrics (original song in the comments).

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Iâ€™ll come back when you least expect it
When the sun is no longer hot
And the light, artificial
I will come back, with a sad stare
And the sky all over my nape
Walking Iâ€™ll arrive

And I get lost in the past
Itâ€™s been so long and Iâ€™m just tired
Of looking for you, I canâ€™t find you
Is it that you vanished?
Or is it all a fantasy?

Searching in the corner of the earth
Where nobody can convince me
That I will never find you

Iâ€™ll come back riding in my memories
With the light of hope
And the comfort of an â€œafterâ€
I will come back on a summer night
When the sea is dancing
While hearing your song

And I get lost in the past
Itâ€™s been so long and Iâ€™m just tired
Of looking for you, I canâ€™t find you
Is it that you vanished?
Or is it all a fantasy?

Searching in the corner of the earth
Where nobody can convince me
That I will never find you

[Solo]

And I get lost in the past
Itâ€™s been so long and Iâ€™m just tired
Of looking for you, I canâ€™t find you
Is it that you vanished?
Or is it all a fantasy?

Searching in the corner of the earth
Where nobody can convince me
That I will never find you

Searching, where are you that I canâ€™t find you?
Is it that you vanished?
Or is it all a fantasy?

Searching for that day of the week
Where one cold morning you told me â€œIâ€™m going nowâ€
