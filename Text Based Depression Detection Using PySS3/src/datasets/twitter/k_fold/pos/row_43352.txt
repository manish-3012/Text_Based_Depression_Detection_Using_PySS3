A friend (and person i like) loses her account constantly The person i like (yes i feel uncomfortable saying crush) usually forgets her password or something, today was the 3rd time she sent me a friend request from a new account and it's just very funny to me how much she does it.

I don't know i was bored and just wanted to write something to un-bore myself
