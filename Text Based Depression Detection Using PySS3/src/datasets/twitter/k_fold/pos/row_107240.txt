My 100th day on this Reddit account Iâ€™ve had Reddit for about two years now, and with various accounts. This is my 100th day on this account, I remember when I made it I wasnâ€™t in a great place, Iâ€™m just posting this as kinda a reminder to myself, that as of now, Iâ€™m happy to still be here so yes. Thatâ€™s cool.
Thanks to those who make Reddit an enjoyable place .
