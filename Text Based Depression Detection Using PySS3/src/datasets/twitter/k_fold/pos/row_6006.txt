Oh my God I'm so embarrassed help... I was having my classes (online) no one is at home, my teacher calls me, to read some shit, I get a call and I'm like...

"What is it I'm having my classes" (in angry voice and I'm assuming it's my mother)

I get to know it's my relative and I'm fucked up, I tell him sorry a thousand times and tell that my parents are not at home.

I feel so guilty fuck. 

Aaaaa.
