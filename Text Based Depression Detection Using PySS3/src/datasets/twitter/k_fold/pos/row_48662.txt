Anyone here who works on longer term writing projects? I've met a few nice people who like writing on here sometimes on this account and my old one

So I thought it'd be nice for some of us to form a bit of a small group to exchange tips and progress, help each other with things and chat a bit

I'm starting a Reddit group for now but maybe I'll make a discord if people want it later on
