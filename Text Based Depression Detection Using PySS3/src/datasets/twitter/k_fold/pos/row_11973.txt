Iâ€™m really anxious for school The title describes what Iâ€™m talking about (as titles do) but basically, my mother is forcing me to go back in person, (mom and dad divorced, mom got custody) and itâ€™s not even the whole virus thing that makes me super anxious. Of course Iâ€™m nervous about getting the virus, all that stuff. (I live in the shitshow of a country called the U. S.). But thatâ€™s not the big thing that makes me anxious. I am very much an introvert, so this quarantine has kinda been my dream. Sitting at home all summer, playing games and watching YouTube videos? Hell yeah, sign me up. So when I think about going back to school I canâ€™t help but feel anxious about how little free time I am going to have. My school starts at 9:30, and ends at 4:20. When I get home, I have at least 2 hours of homework every night, and then itâ€™s usually time to start making/eating dinner, I watch TV for like 30 minutes, and then itâ€™s time to go and take a shower, and get ready for bed. Like, there is no time in the day for me to just chill out and watch YouTube videos, play Minecraft, just do the things that I enjoy and use to destress. And during the weekend, I usually have very little time. 2. Short. Days. Thatâ€™s all I have during the week to myself. And then it usually takes about half a day to go and see my horse (he doesnâ€™t live on our property, he lives about 30 mins away) and then it takes at least 2 hours to finish all the chores my mom assigns me, and another 2 to do my laundry. Then cue the whole dinner thing again, and thatâ€™s an entire day. Like, during the school year, I have no freedom. Itâ€™s horrible. And every year I always feel so anxious about going back to school and having my free time and hobbies stripped from me in sake of â€œlearningâ€. Every year, I go through my shiny new planner and look at the dates when we have an extra day off, when spring break/winter break is, just every precious extra second I have. And it makes me depressed. During the school year, my life is just consumed with the same day over and over, and staying on a strict schedule on what I have time to do. I fucking hate it. 

(This post might sound really entitled and spoiled, but trust me, Iâ€™m in no way like that. I just really love to have some alone time, and with school, itâ€™s always another thing on top of another thing.)
