im tired of my parents i'm tired of my parents treating me and my brother s like shit. they constantly act like we're nothing and constantly yell at us. we just got breakfast and my younger brother was asked to get my mother some ketchup. my oldest younger brother said to another that he doesn't like  ketchup then my stepfather (their real father) got in his face and screamed at him to mind his own and no one asked him. my mother out ketchup all over his food. later while we were eating my step father yelled at one of my little brothers to stop playing with their forks without saying a name. i asked if he was talking to me and he yelled well obviously i wasn't as loud as he could so i yelled back that he should've said a name. i then got yelled at by my mom  to never talk to an adult like that because apparently they're some super gods not worthy of some disobedient children like me and my brothers or at least in her mind she thinks they are. she then left the kitchen where me and my brothers where eating. me and the brother who got ketchup all over his food earlier silently switched the food on our plate so i would get the food with the ketchup. we of course ate the food we switched fast because mine clearly didn't have ketchup on it and his did. as soon as i finished eating i went to my room and got to typing this cause i was still mad. my brother came into my room and thanked me ( me and him share a room). its been this way since my mother met my step father. before then she was actually really nice and wasn't all high and mighty towards me and my now 18 year old brother.

tldr: i'm tired of my oppressive parents who doesn't like me and my little brothers to have opinions
