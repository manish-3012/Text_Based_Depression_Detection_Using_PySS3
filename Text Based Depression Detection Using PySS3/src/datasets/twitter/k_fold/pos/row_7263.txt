Itâ€™s been one of those nights... Or rather, Iâ€™ve had one of those months but tonight is especially strong for some reason. I just started my last year of public education, my senior year of high school, and I canâ€™t help but feel like I wasted whatever time I had growing up wishing that I was older. At the time, I thought it would be so cool and fun to grow up because anyone I knew who was older seemed so cool to me when I was younger but as I grew up, I realized that life, I guess, is more enjoyable when weâ€™re younger. I canâ€™t help but think, I wish there was a way to know that weâ€™re in good old days before weâ€™ve left them behind because of there was a way, I wouldâ€™ve enjoyed every last second of them. I remember being 12 and 13, four and a half years ago, or even younger than that, and all the memories from then seem like a different personâ€™s. I remember being so stress free, happy all the time, unlimited energy, no responsibilities but now, I find it hard to even get out of bed in the mornings. A lot of my friends Iâ€™ve talked to about this have told me they felt a similar way and it seems to be universal in growing older. I think the worst part of it all is Iâ€™m old enough to realize that when I look back in ten-twenty years, the age Iâ€™m at right now will seem like a blissful dream. I know itâ€™s pointless thinking about it because thereâ€™s nothing I can do now, I canâ€™t go back and tell myself â€œEnjoy those little moments while you can and stop thinking about the future for nowâ€. If you made it this far, thanks for stopping to hear me out. Good night.

TL;DR - Enjoy being younger, donâ€™t waste your time wanting to grow older
