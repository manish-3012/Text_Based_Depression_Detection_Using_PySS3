People who remember things about you are the best kind of people Yeah this could be made into a joke about being a stalker or something, but thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m referring to. 

Iâ€™m talking about the people who remember your favorite ice cream flavor, the music you like, your birthday, your petsâ€™ names, all that. It shows they actually care enough to remember the little things about you. Itâ€™s such a good feeling, to feel cared for. 

I donâ€™t have this feeling often, but when it happens, it totally makes my day.
