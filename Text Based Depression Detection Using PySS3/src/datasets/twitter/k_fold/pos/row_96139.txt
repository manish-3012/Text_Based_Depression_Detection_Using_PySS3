Z's poems (#1) The eyes of the damned

One calls them intimidating and looks away

Yet the damned yearn to bask in theirs

Granted the chance the two pairs meet

But alas as they gaze into each others own mortality it is bittersweet 

Lure the damned like a sirens song

An intoxicating gaze

The gates are open

And the damned stay damned
