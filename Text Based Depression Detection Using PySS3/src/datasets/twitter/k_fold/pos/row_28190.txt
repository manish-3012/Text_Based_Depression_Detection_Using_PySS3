Iâ€™m not saying their wrong but itâ€™s still not fair Since all the corona stuff has happened Iâ€™ve stayed in and out of the 100 days or so of quarantine Iâ€™ve only gone out once and that we were in the park, while my sister on the other hand has gone out multiple times sometimes without even a face mask, had spent the night at peoples houses, had multiple people over to spend the night non of witch had a face mask but when I ask to get of at a parade and stay for a little I canâ€™t say hi to no one I canâ€™t get close to no one and I canâ€™t hug anyone, Iâ€™m not saying their wrong but itâ€™s just not fair
