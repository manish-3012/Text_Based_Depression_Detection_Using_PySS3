"Did you finally get that crusty old man out of your room?" Your mom asks you for the 7th time today. You gaze upon him, his skin drying up and flaking away. Catatonic, he trembles and only let's out soft groans of fear. You don't know how he got there, he probably drank himself into a corner one day. He never moves, he never utters a word and he never stops to replenish himself. He breathes and he just exists, and lives in the fabric of time in some kind of way. Once a man, now a home for spider webs. A spider egg sacred bursting open burrowed into his nostrils being the only occasional change of routine. You look back at your mom "I already told you I'll take care of it in a bit". Deep down you know you are only procrastinating.
