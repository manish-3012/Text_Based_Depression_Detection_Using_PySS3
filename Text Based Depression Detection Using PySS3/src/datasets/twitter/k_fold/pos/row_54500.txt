I feel like I care about making money more than a lot of people, and I dont understand why. I am always thinking of ways to make more money, all day every day. But then teens are using their time for friends, dating, working out and shit, etc when they don't have enough money saved up to be safe. In reality the world is very fucking dangerous and scary if you don't have many 10s of thousands saved up and people underestimate that somehow.

And like every day I'm making money so I can move out of my shitty fucking parents house and actually start my life instead of being controlled etc, with the limited time I have on earth. And money is the only thing that can save me. Idk how you could not fully prioritize it, it's the most essential thing in the world.
