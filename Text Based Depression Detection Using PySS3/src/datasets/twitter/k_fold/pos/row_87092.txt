Im straight and proud. so everybody be posting how they gay, , and all that.

well i am straight and proud.

how come we dont have our flag?

EDIT , i didnt say i was oppressed, i was genuinly curious 

also, alot heck all of my friends are gay, or LGBT and theyre always saying ''FUCK STRAIGHT PEOPLE'' and im, well straight,

so im not trying to act ''opressed'' i just dont support hating on straight people, we're not all homophobic. yup and i posted it here cause i know my friends will read it. 

i hope this puts things in a clearer perspective
