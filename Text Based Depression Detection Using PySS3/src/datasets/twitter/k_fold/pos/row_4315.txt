Observations Iâ€™ve made Most communist wonâ€™t accept that their ideology never works in practice and are quick to fall failed communist states something other than communist.
 People who talk shit about other sports in a non-joking manner generally donâ€™t understand that other people can like different sports.
 People who are born in summer like summer more than winter and vice versa. 
People are often to call patriots nationalist despite not being nationalist.
 A lot of people will label you as a racist if you donâ€™t support BLM.
Thatâ€™s all for now
