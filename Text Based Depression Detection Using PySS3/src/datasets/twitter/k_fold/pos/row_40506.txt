I just can't have my own things I just want things to myself, and no one respects that. Their response when I say that I can't use it is "YoU'rE nOt UsInG iT" as if that changes anything. And then I say I don't want them to use it just because I want my things to STAY my things, and then they say that they don't know how I can consider myself part of the family.

YES, MY OWN FATHER SAID THAT. JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO USE A FUCKING TREADMILL.

NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE RESPECTS MY PRIVACY OR PROPERTY AND I AM SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED ABOUT THAT.
