Finally made some friends at my new school  Long post so tldr finally found someone who has the same Interests as me in online school.


Making friends on online school has proven to be very hard because they donâ€™t allow personal info to be told to anyone else in the chat. Taht includes stuff like, phone numbers, Snapchat, online ids etc. and I couldnâ€™t find anyone in the chat who had any of the same interests as me so it was a surprise when I saw someone who made a reference to Wanda vision that people who didnâ€™t watch the show probably wouldnâ€™t have got and so I said â€œis taht a Wanda vision reference?â€ And she was like â€œYOU WATCH WANDAVISION?!â€ And then the teacher instantly shut it down. Whatever I think, Iâ€™ll message her at that counseling thing tomorrow. And lo and behold she loves DC and marvel just like I do. Happy to finally have made friends lol. Thanks for reading if you did. â¤ï¸
