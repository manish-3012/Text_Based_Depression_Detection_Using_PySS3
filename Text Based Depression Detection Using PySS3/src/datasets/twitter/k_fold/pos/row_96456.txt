think you can hurt my feelings? think you can hurt my feelings? my parents slut shame me for wearing modest tank tops when itâ€™s hot outside and call me a horrible child even though i respect them no matter what and love them regardless of everything they have said to me. they also ridicule me for being too skinny. iâ€™m not underweight?? and i eat so much and struggle to gain weight too- weight i donâ€™t even need. i get straight as and bs. dont do drugs or drink. they just think iâ€™m awful because they noticed i have more fun with my friends then i do at home. maybe i do enjoy being with my friends more. i love driving around the city and living in the moment. my parents hate that i love my friends for some reason. i never even told them iâ€™d rather spend time with my friends. they just noticed that i was sad one day and instead of asking whatâ€™s up they yelled at me for always being unhappy. i donâ€™t even expect them to check up on me anymore. i have great friends that iâ€™ve made who always make sure iâ€™m good. but it hurts so much. my parents still have the power to hurt me and make me cry everyday. i try to make them proud but it doesnâ€™t work. i canâ€™t fake smiles around them forever. iâ€™ve only tried once to tell them all of this. they didnâ€™t get it. anyways they would hate that iâ€™m sharing my feelings with anyone but them, even though they donâ€™t care, so thatâ€™s all. 

ps: sorry for sucky spelling i donâ€™t feel like looking this over hehe just needed to rant because i feel awful at the moment 

tl;dr if anyone needs it: my parents hate me because my friends make me happy. thereâ€™s a reason they make me sad and my friends bring me up. i wish my parents lifted me up because iâ€™m not a bad kid.
