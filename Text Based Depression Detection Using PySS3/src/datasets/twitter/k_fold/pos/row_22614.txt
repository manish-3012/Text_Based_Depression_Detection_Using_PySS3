I feel like I actually have depression and it scares me Recently my mental health has gone to shit, I don't have motivation to do anything that would improve my future, I don't have motivation to do anything apart from playing video games, I'm eating way less then I should and way less then I normally do, my sleep schedule is also fucked up - sometimes I don't have motivation to go to sleep and I just stay awake but even if I'm going to sleep already then it's very likely that I'll wake up in the middle of the night after 3-4 hours of sleep.
