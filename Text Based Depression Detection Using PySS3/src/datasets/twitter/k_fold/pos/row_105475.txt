do you ever wonder what your dog would say if it suddenly started talking? It would be pretty cool ngl. I talk to my dogs in a baby voice all the time though.  They would probably tell me to stop doing that cause it's cringe af. 

Seriously though my dogs have seen me do such weird stuff in my house when no-one else is there, if they started talking it would lowkey expose me ngl. 

Anyways wbu guys? would your dogs have any tea to spill if they started talking randomly?
