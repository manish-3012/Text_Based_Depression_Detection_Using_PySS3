I just want to talk about my mom for a minute. My mom is so fucking amazing. For context, she has been a Mormon all her life and she raised me the same way. There's a lot of strict rules associated with Mormonism, along with an endless barrage of shitty messages about people who don't follow those rules. But ever since I decided that the Mormon church isn't true (there's like a billion reasons, go ask r/exmormon if you're curious) she's been nothing but supportive. Like, *super* supportive. She's bought me coffee as a souvenir type thing, not tried to preach it or change my mind (aside from some fairly reasonable arguments right at the beginning), still treated me like a human being (which is a low bar, but the bar has been set pretty damn low by a lot of other Mormon parents with disbelieving children), she even offered to pay for tattoos as a birthday present (which I thought about but ultimately declined). For anyone familiar with the Mormon religion, that just *doesn't fucking happen*. This doesn't even scratch the surface of all the ways she's been supportive over the years, but these are the things related to religion which is a hard hurdle to get over for a lot of people. 

My dad is kinda shitty though, unfortunately. I really hope they divorce so I can cut off contact with him someday while still keeping my mom in my life.
