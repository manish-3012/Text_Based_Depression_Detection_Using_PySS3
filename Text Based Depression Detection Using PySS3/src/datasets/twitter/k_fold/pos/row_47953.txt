Do you ever have this perfect image of yourself in ur mind and wish u where like that? I do. I wish I wasnâ€™t so weak (personality and physical wise) and was more independent. People only know me as the shy girl who never talks and I donâ€™t know how to change that. I want to change my personality, habits, life style, and physical appearance but I donâ€™t even know where to start.
