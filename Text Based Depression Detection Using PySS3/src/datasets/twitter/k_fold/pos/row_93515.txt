Everyone, have a very merry Christmas. God knows I wont. Tonight something happened to me. I suffered a massive seizure while sleeping and hurt my head badly as a result. I'm in hospital currently and i can't feel my legs. I wanted you all to know that you're all wonderful people. No matter what. Gnight now.
-Geekerston out.
