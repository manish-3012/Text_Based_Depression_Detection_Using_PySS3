So baisiclly, I can't communicate So baisiclly, theres this girl in one of my classes that I see almost every day, and I'm just trying to have a conversation with her and you know, become her friend, but I can't seem to gain the courage to talk to her. Any advice?

Also one more thing to mention, I'm not good at communicating in general, but not at an introvert level.
