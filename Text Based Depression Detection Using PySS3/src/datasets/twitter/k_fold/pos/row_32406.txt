I'm doing art commissions but for free I'm feeling generous today so I've decided to do any drawing of a character from anime for free... Yes, free. No catch, no sign up, nothing. Just list an anime character in the comments and the first 5 people to list their commission will be done for free.

And as a bit of a promotion you can even add a custom character with the anime character of your choice.

I will post them on reddit with their username or if you message me your Instagram, I'll tag you with your commission.

The drawings will have more quality than the others that I have done so it will take some time but I will finish it as soon as possible 

Rules: No nudity, no gore, must be from an anime or it wouldn't count.

2.kuroyukihime (accel World) 

3.Karma akabane (assassination classroom) 

4.Felix (re zero) 

5. EN (DOHEDORO) 

Done, its closed thanks to does who submitted a commission I will post them as soon as I can.
