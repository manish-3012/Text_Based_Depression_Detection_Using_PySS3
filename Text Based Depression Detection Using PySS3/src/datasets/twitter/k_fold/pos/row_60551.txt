Hereâ€™s a long rant I promise Iâ€™ll stop posting? I hate the fact I have to be heavily dosed with antidepressants 24/7 to live life like Iâ€™m happy and I hate the fact we got a dog because I wish everything was normal and I could be alone and I hate the gender dysphoria and I just want it to go away. I canâ€™t stand this rn and I know itâ€™s the depression talking but I may just end up gone because that is too much to handle. I have no reason to exist anymore except for a lack of willpower to do anything about that

I canâ€™t write a song heck I canâ€™t even think rn.

I hate this
