Honestly why even bother. So my neighbors have been mentally abusing my grandmother bcs we came from Bulgaria and settled into Greece, the whole fam (me, my brother, my mother and my grandmother) was together in the first 2 years until my mom became a flight attendant and had to move to Paris, one year later my brother joined her and now I'm here with my grandmother. She doesn't speak Greek and when the neighbors called the police on us and yelled at her since the dogs were barking. I suppose she had a mental breakdown after all that bull and my mother started talking about moving to France, but I don't want to move, I got a class I actually like, friends that I like to spend time with and the whole process of learning another language again just sounds really exhausting. So rn I just don't want to go to France but I guess I got no chance of staying here. So I'll just listen to depression music while reading books that tear my soul apart and eat pizza until I look like a hipo.
