I will start a youtube channel but i want it to be special Like title said, I want to start a youtube career, not becuase the money or the fame, just for practice my writing, acting, singing and gaming skills. I want it to be a lore  driven channel. 

It will tell a story trough several kinds of videos, such as gameplays, sketches, animatitons and very other stuff. For example. We will look at the protagonist growth as a person with minecraft. At the start of the gameplay he will be terrified of everything and will be lazy as hell. As he plays he will become a slightly better person
