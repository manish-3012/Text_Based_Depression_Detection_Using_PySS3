The first time i am anxious about my exams I got into sixth grade last year and online classes have been absolute hell, it's so hard to learn and sometimes the school opens but my mother doesn't allow me to go because she's worried for my life. Now i have to read a 400 page book for my english exams because i didnt have the book before, everytime i think about my exams the anxiety just kicks in. I don't know why I made this post, i don't know if i made it for a rant or a call for help, but i just had a desire to make this, thank you for listening to all my rambling
