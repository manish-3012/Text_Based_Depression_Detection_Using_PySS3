I need advice my older(19) brother committed suicide. We just finished his room renovation and yesterday he moved in. He was in university, had friends and generally was optimistic person... His death was very sudden for us. I feel like I wasn't giving him proper attention and care. This accident made me rethink a lot of things. 
This occasion was exceptionally traumatizing for my mother - she was in bad relationship with my brother, despite all her efforts, but recently everything started  to improve and then this happens.
I want to support my family and my younger brother (he doesn't know) but i just don't know how. I need advice.

P.S. sorry for my bad English
