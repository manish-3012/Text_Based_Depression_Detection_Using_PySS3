i donâ€™t think he loves me anymore :/ i met this guy online about 5 months back, and weâ€™ve called nearly every day since. we love each other, but recently heâ€™s been a lot different. 

he calls me baby all the time and one night we talked about how he never says my name and that sometimes off if he did. well on tonightâ€™s call he didnâ€™t call me baby, just my name. and he didnâ€™t say i love you, when he normally does.

at one point he even said â€œfist bumpâ€ which heâ€™s *never* said.

we accidentally interrupted each other by talking at the same time and he said â€œokay somethings off.â€

maybe iâ€™m overthinking but fuck i donâ€™t think i am. maybe he just wants a reaction too because he seems to say stuff thatâ€™ll hurt me then apologize and say â€œiâ€™m so sorry i know that hurt are u okay.â€


he fell asleep on call and i donâ€™t want to hang up because i know iâ€™ll end up crying :(
