Sorry for posting the topspin on the wii tennis ball post so often. Because my Reddit glitched up, forced me to wait to post, didn't tell me that it was posting it repeatedly, and now I'm swarmed with many people like you angry at something I didn't do who doesn't understand my side of the story.  Now you know.
