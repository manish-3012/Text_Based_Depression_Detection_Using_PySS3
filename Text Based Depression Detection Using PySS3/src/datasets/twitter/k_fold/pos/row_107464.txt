I threw up and my mother is mad at me. I got up this morning feeling great, getting ready for school when I threw up. My mother was at work (Her work is right next door to where I live) so when she came over I told her, she believes that I'm faking and trying to get out of school, she's gonna take my PC away and I was planning on buying more ram today for my PC (with my money) and she now refuses to drive me. Any advice to have her be less angry at me?
