Bring Me Back To 2016 I miss this time so much, I miss hanging out with friends in the after school program until 6 pm playing on the playground and having so many fun moments and not having a care in the world. Following trends. Also I was extremely because I was in the sun 10 hours a day. Gaming mightâ€™ve ruined my life that Iâ€™ve looked back to when I became a gamer at 11. Self reflection is painful cause I look back at better times and fantasize about somehow going back in time to experience it.
