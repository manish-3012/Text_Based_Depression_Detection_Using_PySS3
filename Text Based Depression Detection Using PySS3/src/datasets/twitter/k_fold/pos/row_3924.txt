Is it harder to imagine humanity having a future? I wasn't interested in anything set in space until I finally played Mass Effect after a friend recommended it to me. I found out that shows like "Babylon 5", "Farscape", "Firefly", and "Battlestar Galactica" influenced Mass Effect.

Why was space sci fi more popular in the 90s and early 2000s?

The dominant pop culture TV things of the 2010s were Game of Thrones, zombies, and superheroes.

Space has come back on TV with "The Expanse" and "For All Mankind" but they are nowhere near as popular as the 2010 pop culture phenomenons even though Game of Thrones and the MCU infinity saga have ended with the Walking Dead concluding very soon.

Has it become harder to imagine humanity having a future?

What would it take to get society to dream of space again?
