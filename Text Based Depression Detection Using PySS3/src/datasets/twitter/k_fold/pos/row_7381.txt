So, me and my friend just opened up hentai on the school computer Context:me and my friend are both crackheads. So, this happened while our class goes to the computer room. After many of us finished our task, the teacher allowed us to use the computers, we both use the same computer. I typed "hentai" as a joke and he pressed enter. After we satisfied ourselves, he went to delete the history. Plot twist, he didn't actually delete it but he deletes everything.


Long story short:we opened up hentai and he deleted the history except for hentai
