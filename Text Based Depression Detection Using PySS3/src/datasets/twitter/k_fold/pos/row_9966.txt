Has anyone else noticed how Famous Birthdays has some of the dumbest people that are incredibly famous for no reason? I was on famous birthdays because I want wanted to see what it was. It has so many undeserving people on there. Mainly Tik Tok stars. Like, who tf is Chase Hudson and Charli D'Amelio? Most of the popular guys are all just douchebags that have no life whatsoever.
