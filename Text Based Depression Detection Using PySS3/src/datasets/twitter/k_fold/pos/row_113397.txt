Why does it burn when I pee? Today when I went peeing it burned. So I read some advices on internet and started drinking more water. It's much better but I still feel it a little. Do you think it's a serious problem? I will definetely visit a doctor if necessary but the first day I can go is Wednesday. So I just wanted to ask for some advices and if you ever experienced that. Btw I'm a girl and I'm on my period right now but I'm not sure if it can cause burning while peeing. Thank you everyone :)
