I have no friends but whatever I have social anxiety and autism (high functioning) and I have no friends as a result of it. Also because Iâ€™m a lazy motherfucker who has no motivation

Iâ€™m just accepting right now and committing to a life of solitude, cuz really who needs friends or a significant other? Thereâ€™s plenty of fun shit I can do on my own. I can go out to a restaurant, a club (after covid ofc), a movie, anything, and I can do it alone. Trying to form any actual meaningful connections with people takes more effort than itâ€™s worth.

Iâ€™m not a bad person, I can be happy on my own, and Iâ€™ll be fine. I have you guys who I can talk to at anytime, and thatâ€™s all I really need.

Also if ur wanting to leave some dumb cliche advice in the comments, donâ€™t even reply
