i just wanna go to school man literally been stuck at home for months and haven't been outside in 2 weeks cuz of the pandemic

where I live school is reopening just recently and my family forced me to participate in full online learning rather than hybrid (go to school for some days and learn online for others) so I can't even talk to friends irl. It's frustrating watching people's stories on instagram and seeing how much fun people are having hanging out when my mom doesn't even let me go to socials previous to covid. 

these past weeks I've just been sitting around on my bed doing nothing but reading, watching youtube, chatting online, and generally wasting my time. I'm pretty tired of being bored all the time and just wanna interact with people in real life yk?

so this morning my mom and sister leave the house early for a doctor's appointment right. im woken up by my dad, who barely comes upstairs (let alone into my room). He starts lecturing me about how reading novels now isn't going to improve my writing (though he was telling me to read more books like 2 weeks ago) and how I should be spending my time excercising or studying physics and math. He talks about how it was a mistake to buy me a phone and a mistake to let me build a decent computer and a mistake to let me have this much freedom in these crucial years of highschool. Thing is, he's told me these things plenty of times in the past, and by the end of each lecture he always says something along the lines of "nobody else in the world would say this for you" and "I've given up; this is the last time I'm saying this." He rants on: apparently I'm being spoiled by my mother, who supposedly would blame any failure of me and my sister on my father, and who does nothing but pamper her children. He then lays out a schedule of sorts for me, with the implied incentive (threat) that if I don't follow this plan of his, he'll confiscate my books and electronics. I'm to do 2 hours of studying for physics and math each, and for every 30 minutes of exercise I do, he'll "allow" me to play an hour of video games.

Speaking of which, the previous talks always included how much time I spent playing games. Well since the last lecture, I've made sure to limit my everyday consumption of video games to one hour, though he still sighs loudly from across the house whenever he hears my keyboard clicking. it's discouraging and kind of scary to be honest when he does it because I know he's disappointed at me.

Anyway I'm posting this on reddit because while I do have friends, there's a certain restriction on what I'm willing to tell them. Posting it online somewhat anonymously to strangers is comforting I guess since others may be going through similar experiences and it's nice to know I'm not alone.

Thanks for sticking through this rant with me? wow I'm just realising now how this all is so whiny and "first world problems".
