My mom got bit by a dog and a car slid down a hill The day started an hour ago and itâ€™s probably been the most eventful morning ever. I woke up to my mom screaming, so I ran out in the backyard and my dogs were fighting. And since that cold front is coming in, the entire deck was just a giant ice sheet. So I slipped, got up, and broke up the dog fight, one of my dogs bit my mom in the process. So my dad and my mom went to the emergency room and on the way there, they saw an AWD SUV skidding down the hill because if you havent noticed, people in texas have no idea how to drive on icy roads. When they were on the highway, they saw a Mercedes that had skid, bumped into a wall, and got its wheel somehow stuck in its bumper at a 90Â° angle. And now im at home eating raw cereal becaus I didnt realize we ran out of milk. Someone help
