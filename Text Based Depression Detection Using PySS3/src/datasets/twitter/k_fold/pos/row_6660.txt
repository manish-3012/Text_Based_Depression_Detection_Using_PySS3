school and work has literally destroyed the passion for the everything i like. i used to love art, i would paint everyday. on fridays i would stay up late listening to music and drawing in the cold of the night. i wanted to be an artist. 

art takes a lot of time and i never have any spare. i havenâ€™t drawn or painted in my over a year. i donâ€™t want to become an artist anymore.

when i lost passion for art i started play video games a lot more than i used to. i feel in love with and discovered so many new and beautiful games,, like titanfall 2. 

now games just feel so boring and iâ€™m so unmotivated because i never play them. i feel bad and it isnâ€™t as much fun anymore compared to when i used to play a lot.
 
recently i got a waitressing job, and i have been dumped with so much schoolwork. 

I cannot play video games after school because i take the bus home and it takes up half of my spare time, when i get home i do homework and then itâ€™s dinner time. after dinner i sleep, get up at 6am and go to school. 

so i cannot do anything i like on the weekdays. great, 5 days gone. 

but what about the weekend!? 
oh thatâ€™s right i have work on saturday. 

but hold up, i have sunday free! wow! 

wow kaitlyn! you get one whole day to spend with your boyfriend or your friends! one day! and the best part is! you donâ€™t get any days to yourself if you do actually wanna be a normal teenager and socialise. :)

so good job school. good job for ruining the girl with perfect grades. good job for making her so fucking unmotivated by loosing interests that she no longer can keep up with those perfect grades. good job.

good.

job.
