Iâ€™m trans but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to transition (please ignore this itâ€™s just venting) *What if I regret it?*

*What if Iâ€™m not happy?*

*What if I donâ€™t look good?*

*What if no one respects me?*

*What if everyone hates me?*

*What if Iâ€™ll be lonely forever?*

*Instead Iâ€™ll just cry from the closet*
