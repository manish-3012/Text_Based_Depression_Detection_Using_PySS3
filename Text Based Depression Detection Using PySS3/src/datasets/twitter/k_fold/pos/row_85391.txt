Do you get irrationally angry at your school? I go back to school mostly online soon, and one of my teachers sent us an email saying something like â€œwelcome back! I hope you had a nice break and are ready to start the second half of the year full of hard work and lots of positivity, and I know we will all make the best out of this situationâ€ and I got super pissed off for some reason. It just rubs me the wrong way and it might just be me but I feel like Iâ€™m being mocked
