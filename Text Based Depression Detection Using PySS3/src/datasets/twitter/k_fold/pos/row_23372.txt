Rant about mom So I wasnt able to connect to one of my classes and my mom asked me what they learned in the class. I was able to connect long enough to hear that. Anyways, we were reviewing the scientific notation and, since I wasn't able to connect, my mom said for me to review the stuff anyways. She got mad at me for saying I already know how to do it and said that "tHeY'Re tEacHiNG iT FoR a ReaSOn. WhAT iF yOU DoNT kNOw EveRYtHiNG." I'm a senior in highschool and they're reviewing scientific notation. I swear, if I had to review the ABC's in my English class and I missed that, my mom would freak out if I didn't look it over again.
