How the fuck do people have bedrooms in their attic So my attic is extremely hot and it has those glass fibers everywhere which Iâ€™m assuming a lot of attics have(idk much about attics.) I keep thinking about how cool it would be to have a separate room to hang around in and no one would have any idea where I am in the house until they find out about me going there obviously. Do people with rooms in there just have a different kind of attic or something? I have one with a door on my ceiling with a ladder and I have another that you just go through with a door like a normal room. Itâ€™s way too hot in there to be in there for long periods of time and Iâ€™m lowkey scared that there are rats running around in there
