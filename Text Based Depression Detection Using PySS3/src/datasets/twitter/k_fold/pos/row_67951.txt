I don't know why I even try. My parents will never be as proud of me and love me as much as siblings. My sister has gotten straight A's for years on end and wants to be psychologist. My brother got accepted into a program for gifted and above average intelligence kids and he is pursuing a career at NASA. I'm not all that smart though I try, I always seem to fall behind in work performance, and my goals are obscure and I don't know what I want. 
At school I keep faking my personality to gain favor with people, leaving what I am behind. I feel like I'm only making attempts to impress people to make them like me but fail and use humor and stuff to keep avoiding my real feelings. 


I just feel like I'm not enough, and I'm sure it's true now.
