Guys i'm sad, i'm mad and I am angry [Discussion] A while ago I made a post about how there is double standards against muslims. When making that post I was not 100% convinced  what I was saying but with recent events in france and throughout the world I am infinetly sure that is ther is an evident bias against muslims. 

It boils my blood that in france you have state approved bygottery agaisnt muslims who just want to live their lives and get along. 

Yes indeed a muslim did kill that teacher and he has infact been condemned by majority of the muslims, and many muslims youtubers have apologised in behalf of all muslims macrons still refuses to apologise for his islamophobic comments, masquerading his comments with the label of "freedom of speech". I support freedom of speech and I believe he has the right to say that, but not even 2 months ago he made it illegal to desecrate the french flag in public and in private or share imaeges of people desecrating the french flag. So why does he feel it is okay for him to use his freedom of expresssion to spread hate against a minority but we can't retaliate? 

I may sound like an asshole here, but the main point which I am trying to get across is that "freedom of speech" is only being used as an excuse to spread hate.

Sometimes I wished I could just pass on my thoughts to people so it would be way easier to explain.

If Anyone wants to debate peacefully and calmly do so in the comment section.
