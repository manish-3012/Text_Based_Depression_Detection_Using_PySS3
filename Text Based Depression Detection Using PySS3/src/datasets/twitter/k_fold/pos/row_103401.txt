Sometimes internet is good So today I decide to play among us and after a couple of games, I join a lobby with semi decent settings, on meeting 1 this person says that she has a mom who is on drugs so she has to stay with her grandmother. 

So I do what I had to do and keep encouraging her and motivating her and vouching for her. After round 1 she thanks me for giving her emotional support.

Then the time comes where I have to play my last match and somehow I get imposter (1 imposter) so after a few kills I vent infront of her to show I am imp. Idk if she even saw me vent or she was busy doing her download but we stick with each other and I kill everyone except her.

When we go back to the lobby I say goodbye and she says goodbye but before I go I asked her is she had any socials, she replied that she isn't allowed socials bcuz her grandmother said people who use social media become prostitutes. She thought I didn't understand what prostitute meant so she said "it's the women who sell their body parts in their pants". (Lmao she seemed pretty young)

After I left the match it like struck to me how small kids like these have abusive parents or parents that are not in a fit state. It made me feel kinda sad and content with the fact that I had such nice parents with a stable life.

Well that's it, I just wanted to share this story with you guys. 

If I have any spelling errors pls ignore that cuz I am writing on the web version of reddit on mobile.
