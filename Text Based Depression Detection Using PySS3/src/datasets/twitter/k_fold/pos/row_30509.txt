I have a question for the girls of this sub reddit How would u want a random guy to start up a conversation with you and what goes through your head when a random guy looks at you?

The reason I'm asking is today i was in the mall and i saw a cute girl, then she looked at me and i forgot how to be a normal person. This made me over think and i started thinking about going and talking to her but i didnt know what to say to her. I stood there for about 15 min then she and her mom came out and her mom just looked at me while she looked away. They walked away and like 5 min after they left my mom came and we left. I wanna know how to start up 
conversation with girls in the future
