PSA FOR GUYS: DO NOT WEAR JEANS AND BOXERS ON A FIRST DATE Tldr: If you wear jeans and boxers on a date you will likely chafe/crush your balls. Also this might be a bit gross. 

So. Yesterday I went on a double date with my gf, one of her friends and *her* bf, who is one of my close friends. We decided to go to Downtown to explore Chinatown and a mall. I made the mistake of wearing jeans that were a little bit too tight and boxers. 

This being the first time I was seeing my girlfriend in person for over a year, I was freaking out on the inside, and outside too, because every little thing she did gave me a boner. Her laugh? Boner. Holding my hand? Boner. Sitting in my lap and cuddling? Boner. Everything she did gave me a fucking boner. And we were walking around in Downtown for four hours causing my balls to chafe. To make it worse, the boxers I wore rode up on me due to my constant erection and were choking my balls like they were Jimi Hendrix. 

By an hour and a half in my nuts were just red paste being held together by a thin layer of skin, and it hurt like hell. When the date was over, I immediately ran to my bathroom and made sure my closest friends were alright, and they looked like someone beat the like they owed them money. They aches for the rest of the day and night- no matter the position. I could be floating in anti-gravity and they would still be sore. 

So, as a warning to all other guys: unless you have amazing willpower and can control your boner at will, do not wear jeans and boxers on a first date, or any date for that matter, because they will smother your balls like a trash compactor.
