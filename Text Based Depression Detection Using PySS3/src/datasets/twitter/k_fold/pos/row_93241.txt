Just another rant that you see quite often  I feel really uncomfortable in my body but this is me. This body is mine. This is who I am. I've had this body for almost 16 years so I know everything about it I need to. I've wanted to be a girl since I was like 9 and now more than ever. But it's not possible. I would do anything to be one. Yes, I could do surgeries and take hormones but that would make me feel even more uncomfortable about my body and it wouldn't be the same thing. Because males and females have different muscle and bone structures. If I did take hormones and all that I wouldn't be what I want to be. I also just want to free of all obligations and expectation and just disappear. So the only choices would be to either die or keep living on and just go somewhere else. I don't want to die instead I want to live. So I'm going to leave and go somewhere after highschool because then I know enough about everything to be able to do atleast something. I don't want to stay here my entire life so leaving as soon as possible is for the best.If I end up dying somewhere along the way then so be it, there's nothing I could've done about it anyway and at least I got somewhere. Staying here and living just to work for someone I know nothing about and I don't care isn't what I want to do with my life, I don't dream of labour for others.I don't want to spend my life sitting in front of a computer screen either, I want to do something more natural for humans because that's what I am. I have always been better suited for practical stuff over theoretical stuff anyway. I will never be what I want but atleast I won't be nothing. I may  be forgotten but at least I will have lived.
