I love my nose. In my opinion its perfect. (I'm not saying other noses are ugly, I love all sorts of noses, I'm just kinda biased toward mine) I don't know why, I just feel like its so perfect. Its not too pointy or round or long or short. I feel like it is at the perfect angle, not too buttoned, or flat.

I feel like it has all the perfect dimensions. It doesn't look awkward or out of place. 

Too bad the rest of me is ugly as fuck.
