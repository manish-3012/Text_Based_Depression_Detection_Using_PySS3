MY CRUSH SAID YES As today is still valentines day (for a few more hours at least) I had decided to ask out my friend of a few years. We had hung out all the time during the pandemic and I figured now would be the time to ask. I don't know what else to say here, because she said yes. I have never been so relieved though, because I was certain I was to be rejected.
