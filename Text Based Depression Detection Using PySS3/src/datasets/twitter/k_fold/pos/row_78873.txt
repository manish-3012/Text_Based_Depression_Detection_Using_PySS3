What the fuck is happening I don't know what to think, the music I listen began to sound better, there's this funny feeling inside me. I don't want to sleep, he also said that he was interested in me

He's not the best looking person, I was obsessed with obsession itself. I was in love with misery. Now, shit feels real.

I should sleep, it's 4 AM
