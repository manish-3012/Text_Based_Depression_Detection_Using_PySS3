Need help Just to clarify it, this is absolutely confusing so i need advice. So a few months ago,  my best friend introduced a girl (at the time his gf) to our friendgroup. The relationship didnt last long, and she remained in the group. A few days after, she started dating another boy from the group. That didnt last very long either, cause she made out with a female friend of mine and has in general problems, commiting to relationships. Since then she was having this ongoing netflix and chill thing with my  best friend againg. Everyone thought, that was just sex and not a real relationship. Now to the main plot of this shitshow. So yesterday, me, the female friend i was talking about,  and another male friend where hanging out with her and we had a few drinks.We where all mildly drunk, when we decided to lay down and chill for a bit. So we where laying there and casualky cuddled. Then both the girls start making out and we join in. This went for like ten minutes, and the girl this whole story is about, seemed very pasionate when we made out. I dont know how this happened but during this, the female friend starts unclothing the other girl and eating her out.( ehile we are still making out and touching eachother) I have a crush on that girl. Today i visited my best friend and he told me he was in a relationship with that girl and he told me he was very happy. The day we all made out, she told us, they where just fucking. Now i feel like such an asshole because i dont want to tell him, cause i have a crush on her and she should tell him herself. Wtf do i do now. I feel like im betraying my best friend but, being intimate with her felt so goddamn good. If you made it through this whole thing, please let me know, what you would do
