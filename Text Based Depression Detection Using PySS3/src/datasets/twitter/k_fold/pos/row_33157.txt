Some of you are insensitive little pieces of shit and I hate all of you who say #AllBuildingsMatter No Iâ€™m not directly attacking anybody in this sub Reddit whatsoever Iâ€™m just directing it towards everyone because Iâ€™m fucking sobbing. 

I have never actually listened to any of the phone calls of people on the planes or in the buildings or crying and begging for help from the operaters asking what to do or the one man saying "weâ€™re all going to die" right before it hit the building. Those building were made of fucking steel columns, that plane should have crumpled on impact but the bombs went off in the plane and that's how it went through. I can't even tell if I'm spelling shit right because I can't stop crying but I just can't help but think what if I got a phone call like that from my mom, or dad, or my boyfriend knowing in minutes they would be dead. 

One woman who was 50 described her last phone call with her husband who she met when she was 16 years old and he told her that he was trying to find a way out and he couldnâ€™t get the stairwell was just filling with smoke and she asked him if it hurt to breathe and he said no because he didnâ€™t want to worry her. And they just talked about all their happiest memories together before he just wispered over and over I love you before the building just cracked. And she called his name over and over and there was no response. 

Over 200 people jumped out of the building that day. Just Imagine, the roads littered not just the bodies of the trapped people in the trade centers doing anything to escape, but of the people they landed on. One man who jumped landed on a firemen and killed them both. I just prayed to God that I or anyone I love never have to experience this first hand or have to hear a phone call from them or me saying I love you one last time. I don't want anything like this to ever happen again. That's my Ted talk, just remember and respect those affected.
