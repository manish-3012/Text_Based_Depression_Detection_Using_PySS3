I was forced to send photos to someone and found them on a site should I tell my parents? Long story short I was black mailed by this man and forced to  send lewd photos. They weren't anything extremely NSFW, its was mainly lewd faces he took screens of them, and put them on a site. After a few months this happened I decided to see if they where posted on anything. I took a selfie of myself, reverse imaged it and found them... I want to tell my parents but I know I'm gonna be disowned and kicked out what should i do?
