I have a feeling that she's the one I don't have too much experience in dating, but some. And always when I've been in relationship I've been like yeah I do like him, and at the same time still being jealous about other guys girls.
           But she, she if the fucking one, I swear it. I start to almost cry when I think about how close it was we didn't even start talking. I knew her somewhat for few years and thought she's like two leagues above me. And I still think, she's also gets compliments from other guys often and if they don't know about me they start to flirt with bad luck. But I am the luckiest and happiest motherfucker right now. 
I had to tell this someone, other than her.
