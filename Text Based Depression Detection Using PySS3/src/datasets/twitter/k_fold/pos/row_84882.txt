What language should I take next year? Options: 

1. Spanish 2

2. German 

3. French 

4. Japanese 

5. Chinese 

6. Italian 

7. Sign language (I picked this one because Iâ€™ve had spanish for the past 4 years and Iâ€™m tired of it and thought itâ€™d be nice to switch it up, but I lowkey want to take Japanese or Chinese, but I feel like thatâ€™ll be too hard to get a good grade on)
