For those struggling with anxiety; a personal collection of anti-anxiety tips As time went by I collected for myself a short list of things that can help with anxiety (both long term and situational) and I'd like to share it, maybe you'll find it helpful too.

`
Quick highlights of general tips:

long term:

1. Sleep long - sorts emotions + other benefits

2. Meditate (although significant benefits not proven)

3. Exercise - consistency &gt; intensity or duration

4. Live in the moment

5. Limit sugar, refined carbohydrates, caffeine

7. Protein rich breakfast -&gt; blood sugar doesn't drop so quickly

8. Keep urself hydrated

9. EAT BREAKFAST

10. Get up always at the same time (doesn't matter when you go to sleep)

________________________________________

situational:

1. Don't get hungry, keep a snack - blood sugar would drop -&gt; release stress hormon cortisol

2. Get warm - alters neural circuits &amp; serotonin

3. DEEP breathing - 3 in (pause) 3 out / 4-7-8

4. Hug - releases oxytocin

5. nap - sorts emotions

6. exercise

7. Shout/punch/release emotions

8. Dance

9. anti-anxiety songs (scroll down)

10. Hot shower -&gt; benefits of warmth + pressure combined

11. Massage - if not full body, hands massage (with a creme) or hair massage is good -&gt; releases endorphins

12. Put head below heart (may not work)

14. Splash cold water on your face - initiates diving reflex -&gt; slows down heartbeat -&gt; suppresses fight&amp;flight

15. Eat something, fat or protein is best

Apart from this, trance works too (has a specific effect on brain).
______________________________________

I'd specifically like to point out that effects of meditation may be really very small compared to other things you can do (e.g. exercise).

I always treated anxiety as a a separate entity - a fucking idiot that I (as the confident and rational young man that I am) am not willing to submit to, so I'm fighting against him :D

A thing that I personally want to work on now is improving the cause instead of suppressing the symptoms - and I believe that the cause in me is overthinking, so that's what I'm focusing on.

Good luck everybody :)
