Since some people want an update on my fight thing, I've made the update. The guy I was fighting apparently was angry that I insulted him This exact insult was "Your just bad at the game" in our argument we had, This prompted him to challenge me to a fight and i asked him about it and he asked if we could delay it till tomorrow because he had to do laundry, I allowed this and a few hours later he called me back and he said that he was calling off the fight as he told his dad and his dad told him to be the bigger man in this situation. If anybody wants any questions about It I am willing to answer them
