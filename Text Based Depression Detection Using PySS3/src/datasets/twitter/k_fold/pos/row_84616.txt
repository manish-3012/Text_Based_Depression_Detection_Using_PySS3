I think my friend is a paedophile. Its as simple as that, I think my friend is a paedophile. We play xbox together most days, which means I speak to him in the party. All the boys are on early after college but as it gets later some go offline. Me, a couple others and my suspicious friend are usually the last online. The reason I have these suspicions is because some of the things he says out loud are very sus. Like one time he randomly asked me if his girlfriend has to be double figures in age. I kind of just awkwardly laughed that off but stuff like this happens often, nearly every night. I'm kinda thinking he has a sick sense of humour, but he could also just like kids. Idk what to do, help?
