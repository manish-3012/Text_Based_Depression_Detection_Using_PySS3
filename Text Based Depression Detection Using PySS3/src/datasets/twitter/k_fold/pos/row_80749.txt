My brother is trying to make me sick So, my brother is trying to make me sick. I've contracted pneumonia a few days ago (I still have it). So anyways, my bigger brother (17) is trying to make me sick. He's been coughing in my room often, and even overheard him coughing DIRECTLY at my room while I was trying to sleep. My parents aren't doing anything, not even grounding him or such. What should I do, or what type of revenge should I take at him? (I'm 15)
