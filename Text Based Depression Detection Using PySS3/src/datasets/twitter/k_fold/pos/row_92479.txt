Im about to play the biggest mind game ever So recently I've gained a tendency of playing my DS in my room, when I really should be sleeping. I just discovered my parents have beem eavesdropping on me, and that's how they figured out I had my DS in my room in the first place. They promptly  went into my room and took it from me while I wasn't looking. Of course I'm pissed about this, so I've came up with a plan to get payback. I'm going to make them think I have hundreds more. 

So now I know my parents eavesdrop on me. Part of my plan includes me saying things such as "They may have taken one of my DS, but they didn't take this DS." And if this doesn't get them interested, I have a headphone case that makes a sound similar to buttons being pressed on a DS whenever I close it. I will pair these two together to trick them. 

Now it's time to initiate the plan. Just hope it works. Side note, you may be wondering how my parents wouldn't know if I had more DSs. (What's the multiple of DS? DSs? DS'?) Well basically I have a lot of games. I have a PS4, Nintendo Switch, Tablet. If they don't think it's a DS, they'll think it's another gaming related gadget.
