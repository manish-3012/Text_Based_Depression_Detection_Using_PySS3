GUYS I FOUND OUT WHAT Y=mx+b ACTUALLY MEANS So the m is slope which is the rate of the line (like how much after every x it would go a certain value.). The x is any x on the grid you want to know. By multiplying the x and m you find out where the Y is. The reason why there is a b at the end is to show the y intercept. The y intercept is important as it is the initial starting point of the linear function.
