My friend's story. **She is not on reddit because her parents think social media is addictive (Bad addiction) so this is her story I will be posting this in parts or edit it in the future.**

They over estimate her ability as a person. She has migraines which is getting worse and she believes that her parents think she is faking it.

She first started to notice it back in 2019 she had just moved to a boarding school.

Whenever she asked her parents for a new notebook or marker or any stationary they used to tell her they were tight on money.

But when she went to school they started buying things like crazy, her room became a storage unit for things they didn't even use and got her brother new toys they said that this was their way of coping with her being gone "Retail Therapy".

(Which she and I both agreed on it being complete Bullshit)

They visited her once every 10 days which she thought was very sweet of them and if they weren't able to her Grandfather (May he rest in peace.) would.

One time they promised her that they would visit her on  a Friday. They didn't come and didn't picked up any of her calls for a week  she panicked because her father's health was unstable at the time she was worried if something had happened to him.

Finally after ten days  they picked up and told her their car broke down but didn't gave any reasons for the calls.

They just said that her grandfather will come visit her on Sunday. And that's it.

Later on she cried, her principle(An angel) comforted her saying that they just might have network problems. And let me tell you she never cries in front of people.

**This is the only part that she wanted me to write she will tell the rest later if there are people willing to listen.**
