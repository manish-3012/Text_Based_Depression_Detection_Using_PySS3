Pro tip when there's frost outside Pro gamer tip here: if you have a wooden back porch and you take your dog out on a leash, if there is a bit of frost a a thin layer of ice, I cannot stress enough to wear boots as today I took my dog out and I slipped on the ground really hard and hurt my right arm, left knee, and my neck/back pretty bad. To sum it up, when taking ur pupper out on a walk and there's frost outside, please for the love of God wear something like boots or anything not plastic.
