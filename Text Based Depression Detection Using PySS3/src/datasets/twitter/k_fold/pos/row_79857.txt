My dad got rid of my cat A year ago my my mom rescued a abandoned kitten Recently the cat started to poop in the basement becuase my brother wasnt cleaning the litter box. Yesterday the cat threw up on the carpet and my dad decided to give it for adoption. Today my dad said he was going to go to the human society. I asked for him to see if my grandma would take the cat in and he agreed. When my dad came back home he said he gave the cat to a random guy who wanted it. He didnt even get his number or check whether he was a suitable owner. He also didnt call my grandma first to see if she would adopt it. My dad doesnt even feel any remorse for the cat and is laughing at me for crying. I'm not sure what to do or whether I will ever see my cat again. 

Does any one who experienced their pets being rehomed have any advice for coping or getting the pet back?

Also I'll link a picture of the cat when I find out how to.
