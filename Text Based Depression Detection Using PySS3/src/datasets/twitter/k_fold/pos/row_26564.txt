I knew the Instagram stealing from reddit thing was bad but like I just recently got back to school and I heard this group of like 7 kids I knew quoting memes they saw on Instagram. I just stood around and listened for 5 mins and *every* meme they were talking about I had seen on reddit like a week ago wtf
