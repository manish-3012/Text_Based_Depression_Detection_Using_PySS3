I'm a fucking piece of shit who can't even get good grades and I'm ruining my own life It's my fault, I have been believing on the fucking lies my parents told me, that I'm a 'genius' and I can achieve many things. Absolutely fucking not. I'm so dumb that I can't bring 70% in my test, I am dumb for believing my parents lies, they told me those because I'm their kid and not a genius. I pushed myself out of my limits and still suffering the low grades. THEY FUCKING LIED TO ME. I don't care they love me or not, but I am starting to hate myself for being a failure. I know my mom hates me for my failures. I am contributing nothing to society, other than my failures. I am suffering with my own failures, sometimes I want to put myself out of my misery, I miss when I was a 5 year-old, at the time I never cried and was happy, I never cared about anything bad happening, I was in my own little world.

My parents fucking lied to me.

I hate them for doing that to me.
