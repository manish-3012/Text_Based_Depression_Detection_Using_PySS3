Passive aggressive pranks So a year ago from now my cousin and his family came to live with us for a year but his family left so he was the only one living with us. He never works or does anything, heâ€™s rude but not noticeably rude (in a subtle yet annoying way). He comes from a pretty rich family so he refuses to clean. His family is coming in around half a month. I want to annoy him and his family in a subtle, passive aggressive and annoying way but they shouldnâ€™t be suspicious about me. Does anyone have some simple prank ideas?
