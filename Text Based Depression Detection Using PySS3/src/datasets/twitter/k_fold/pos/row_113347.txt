I know this isn't a specific LGBTQ community but I didn't know where else to post because I'm really happy right now So in around August I discovered myself as part of the LGBTQ+ family and since then I have really been putting off telling my family because of anxiety. I came out to my mother and twin brother a few months later, my brother (T) is alright, but it could have gone better with my mum. It's not that she isn't supportive, it's that she doesn't understand. I have 6 siblings in total, but 2 of them are under the age of 3, so I came out to my 3 oldest siblings today. My oldest sister (H), oldest brother (J), and other sister (M). 

Because we all live miles apart, and Covid, I had to tell them over text, which isn't always ideal as sometimes you want to sit down and have a proper conversation with them about it but it simply wasn't possible. So what I did, with the help of T, was ask how many sisters they thought the family had. When H unknowingly answered 4, T corrected her and said 3. From there I explained. 

I couldn't have been happier by H and J's responses, they were really nice and supportive. 

H: Oooh I get you now

H: Well you're my sibling no matter what the description :)

J: So proud of you!

J: Can I still call you [a nickname of mine he's always called me] 

I said he could, because it didn't bother me.

I know I'm really lucky to have such supportive siblings, M came on a bit later and said she loves me no matter what, and some people don't have that. To the people who can't come out due to family issues or did come out and it went well, I hope that someday in the future your family accepts who you are or you find people who love you for who you are. You aren't alone in this world, and someone will always be out there who cares. 

If anyone is like me, and struggling to come out due to anxiety issues and isn't in danger if they come out, here are my really unprofessional and probably bad steps and my advice to coming out over text are as follows: Talk to someone you trust, map out a plan with them of how you'll come out (maybe go on call with them if possible, for moral support, I was on call with a couple close friends for most of today and it helped), then just take the risk and tell who you're coming out to. Unless you have proof your family is homophobic, chances are they probably aren't (Although you might want to make sure you have evidence first, for safety). I'm sure that if your family loves you, they'll accept you. They'll have to accept you, because it's who you are and if they want to disown you over that, it's their loss. They've just lost someone that's stronger and braver and more amazing than they will ever be. It took a lot of courage to finally talk to my siblings, and the outcome was better than I ever expected. If you need a friend for moral support, then I'm always willing to help. Remember, you'll be accepted and loved by someone out there, never give up! You're strong just for accepting yourself, and you don't need your families approval to be who you are.

And also, if you think being LGBTQ is bad, just downvote and move on. Keep your opinion, however hateful and stupid (don't come for me for saying that), but don't comment about it because I don't need to hear it, you don't need to waste your time, and other people don't need to hear it. Thank you.

A reminder if someone needs that moral support to come out and they have no-one to be their moral support, I'm very happy to help. Just comment or DM me, I'll try my best :)

This is a bit long, sorry. I just had to say how happy I am with today's outcome. Have a good day, and stay strong out there.
