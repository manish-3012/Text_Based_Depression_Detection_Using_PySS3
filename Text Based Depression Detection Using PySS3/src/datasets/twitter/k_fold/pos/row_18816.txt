How do you bring up something to your parents without them getting mad? For instance,

I hadnâ€™t taken a shower for about a day and a half since I was busy. Two nights ago ish. My dad brings it up this morning that I stink badly and I need to take a shower. Ok fine Iâ€™ll do that. He then says that he smelled it yesterday literally less than a day after I took it. I wanted to ask him why he didnâ€™t say anything then and is flipping out now. Of course if I ask he would just get mad, and in his words, â€œbe in a shitload of troubleâ€. As Iâ€™m leaving, without saying anything, he says, â€œdonâ€™t worry itâ€™s not a big deal.â€
