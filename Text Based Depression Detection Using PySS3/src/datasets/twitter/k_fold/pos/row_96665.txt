My teacher let out a bit too much while talking about incest So basically, it was english and we were reading this poem. It had a reference to the ancient Pharoahs of Egypt which lead onto the topic of how there was a lot of incest among the royal families and it evolved onto other royal families and the effects of incest.

Eventually the topic went onto my teacher talking about how he reached out to his distant family. He said that he was researching into his family tree and ended up getting in touch  with one of his distant relatives and they ended up having a meal together. He then went on to talk about one of his 3rd cousins being half chinese, half australian. He described her as a young women, then rephrased it to young beautiful women. Idk if it is relavent but he is at the upper end of his 40s.

This may not seem all that bad and if I am honest it probably isn't, but at the time the whole class went a bit uncomfortable as that was the worst possible time to say that. We were literally talking about incest and brings that up. Bit weird.
