Depressed people, i have helps So I'm not depressed personally, I'm actually a pretty happy person, but like one of my friends is. I told her to try and go on a walk. They did that and told me they felt better. 

I'd pick one with nature and not many people around, trust me try it. It's a great reason to convince yourself life is worth living of you're suicidal
