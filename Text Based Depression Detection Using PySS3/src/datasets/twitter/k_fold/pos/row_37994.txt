Looking for advice to gain weight Iâ€™m a guy, and Iâ€™ve been skinny pretty much my whole life. Iâ€™m so self conscious about my weight that I havenâ€™t shown my bare arms in public in literal years. My metabolism is way too fast for me to keep up with. Any tips, regarding food, or just anything in general is appreciated.
