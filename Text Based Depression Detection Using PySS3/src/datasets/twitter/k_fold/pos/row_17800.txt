I've become emotionally numb I thought I was getting better. I thought that this low point was over.

I am not getting better. I had just went emotionally numb. I feel so empty.

I've been thinking alot about killing myself. I wont be able to do it because I'm too scared to die. So I'm not in immediate danger of muting myself. 

Maybe I have depression. I don't know. I just don't think I do.

I should really go talk to a mental health professional. Or anyone really. Talking to people is hard. I'm terrified of talking about my problems with someone. I'm scared they will just hurt me. Or that they won't care. That's why I haven't reached out for help.
