How would I go about hacking into a command console for minecraft on a server i don't own? So my friend is hosting a minecraft server and i want to troll them.

there server is hosted on apex hosting and has no plugins so authme isn't an option.

and as a bonus is there a way i could get the command line connected to cmd?

Maybe i could connect as the server using cmd in some way but idk

Any help would be great lol
