Iâ€™m slowly going insane Been doing online school for a year. All I know is wake up, smoke a bowl, get on a game, smoke another bowl, etc. etc. until the day ends. I havenâ€™t talked to anyone in a long ass time, and my social anxiety is crippling when I try to. Iâ€™ve gotten taller (6â€2) without gaining weight so I look like a Holocaust survivor or some shit. Iâ€™ve got a lot of shit to work through but the loneliness is the worst of it. Itâ€™s a cycle of being too anxious to even talk to someone, but hating myself for being alone. Iâ€™m an Instagram addict but scrolling through that shit sometimes really highlights how lonely my life is. Not trying to get too heavy on the fucking teenagers subreddit of all places but sometimes I just need to vent and I thought maybe someone my age could relate.
