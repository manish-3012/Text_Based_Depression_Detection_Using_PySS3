Bro i just had the STRANGEST realization Couple years ago i had to call 911 for my dad cuz he was having a heart attack, and i can remember everything up to when the ambulance got there. I remember I was crying and losing my shit but thats it, its like my brain got rid of the memory cuz it was traumatizing.
