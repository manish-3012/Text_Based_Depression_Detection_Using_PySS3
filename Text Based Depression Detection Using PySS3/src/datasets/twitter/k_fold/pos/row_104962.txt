My family not celebrating Christmas while the family of my friends do. made me question stuff... Like if itâ€™s already so boring with family, how is it gonna be like without family? alone, when I move out of my parents home. What am I gonna do then? Am I gonna be crying like a loser and drink alcohol because I donâ€™t know what else to do? It also mad made me question lost of other stuff. 

Itâ€™s  probably dumb but itâ€™s just what my brain made me think.   
Iâ€™m actually upset ever since... :/ 

But merry Christmas to everyone that does celebrate Christmas! And donâ€™t let me being upset make you also upset.
