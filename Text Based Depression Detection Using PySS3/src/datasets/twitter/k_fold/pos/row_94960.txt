If you know french, I need some help! Hey so I'm going to France this summer, and wanted to learn some good phrases to learn. I already know basic ones, like "how are you", "What is this", and "Where are you?". But if you guys had some other good phrases, can you comment them, along with what they mean? Please be serious though.
