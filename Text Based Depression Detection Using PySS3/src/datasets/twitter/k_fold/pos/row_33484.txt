I'm really fucking lonely Second time writing this because fucking reddit didn't fucking post the first time. But I really like really need a girlfriend. My best friend has been In a relationship for a few weeks now and I'm not jealous or envying because I don't resent him in fact I'm like happy for him. I'm not even like horny like of course I want to have sex but mainly just because I havnt tryed it yet. Like I have a couple of friends but they're all edgy male teens so they're not like tender which I don't expect them to be that's what a girlfriend is for which is why I really need one. On my worse days I feel terrible that having sex is basically my only life goal. I'm an-com and I don't really believe in white picket fence or flashy cars so I don't k is what to do with the rest of my life. At least I'm not a perfectionist as much anymore.
30 by bad flower came on as I was writing this (the first time) and really sum up what I'm feeling except he's obviously 14 years older than ne which does not give me hope
