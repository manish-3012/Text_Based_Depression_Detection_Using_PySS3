I want to start a Suicide Hotline. The title says it all. I would like to start a suicide hotline, but I donâ€™t know how to get started. My visions for this hotline is to make it text only, but this is why: Like most of you, I have school each and everyday, so I donâ€™t have time to answer calls. I also work, so I just wouldnâ€™t have any time. Iâ€™m on my phone a lot, so I can respond to texts.

My main motivation behind this is after seeing the post that blew up yesterday, I learned about SHLâ€™s and how much they suck. I want to create a place where people that need the help can come and get genuine messages, instead of automated messages that just say â€œyouâ€™ll be ok.â€ Those donâ€™t do a thing. They just make you feel more isolated. I want something thatâ€™ll make people feel able to express their feelings anonymously. 

So what I would like from anyone who would want to help is maybe a small team of people who know how to make a website or chat area, a few people other than myself that would be willing to respond to messages, and other techy people who maybe know how to allow people to create an account. 

I donâ€™t expect this to blow up. I donâ€™t expect to be able to achieve a dream this big right now. If nothing happens, this will fade away, and Iâ€™ll have to try again another time. If you would like to help, DM me with what you would like to contribute to the project.


If youâ€™re reading this and youâ€™re someone who feels you would like someone to talk to, Iâ€™m on Reddit all the time :)
