pls send help i just stayed up until 6am in a minecraft world. my house is a 3 by 3, but it looks like a small mansion from the outside. i live right next to a ravine, and he fell asleep while in it, and i had to fight off mobs and try to wake him up over headset. then, he came to my house and we put our minecraft beds next to each other and i feel oddly accomplished with myself...
