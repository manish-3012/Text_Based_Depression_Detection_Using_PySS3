How do I move on? For a while now Iâ€™ve liked this girl, and tonight both her and another guy I know openly admitted to liking each other while we were on call together. I know this shouldnâ€™t affect me that much, and it really doesnâ€™t. I know that the relationship likely wonâ€™t last either, but I think itâ€™s unhealthy to keep waiting like that, and Iâ€™ll only be torturing myself. I want to know how I can move on, because I really did like her, and I was close to asking her out, but I guess I missed my chance, and I doubt she reciprocates feelings. Overall Iâ€™m just not in a great mood, because for the last few months Iâ€™ve been dwelling on this one girl and it was kinda for nothing, which makes it really disappointing for me. I also havenâ€™t been in a relationship ever, so Iâ€™ve been kind of interested in one lately, but I donâ€™t think that itâ€™s likely to happen anytime soon. I also just need something to vent to. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll get over it eventually.
