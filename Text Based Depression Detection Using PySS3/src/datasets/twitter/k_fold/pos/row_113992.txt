Not to be political or anything but HOW THE FUCK DOES WATER EXIST AS A LIQUID I know Iâ€™m gonna sound like a total dumbass now, but I need someone to explain it to me. How the fuck does a bjillion molecules consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make water?! Last time I checked, hydrogen and oxygen are both gases. How the fuck do the molecules make water? I really need someone to explain this to me, none of my science teachers ever listened to me when I said I didnâ€™t know how it worked. In theory, shouldnâ€™t those atoms make some sort of other gas? How does it make a liquid?! Please this is driving me fucking insane, I need help. If thereâ€™s anyone big brained reading this, please explain the science to me. I swear Iâ€™m not usually this dumb, Iâ€™m a well educated 10th grader. But this shit is so fucking confusing to me, please help me understand it.
