Welp. That's ironic. I think. I used to sometimes stare at my crush in math class. She sat to the right and slightly north to me. The teacher had to change everyones seats for some reason... My crush got my old spot. I got her old spot. I think shes staring at me now. That's just ironic I guess. Not really sure what ironic means but I think that's it.
