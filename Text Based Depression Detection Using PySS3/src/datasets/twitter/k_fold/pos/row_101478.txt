A story that started out about me hating haircuts but ended about me telling you all about my father I get this feeling like I'm about to be cut every time I feel the razor or scissors cut my hair. I am uncomfortable around electric razors but scissors are okay since I use them for other things. I dont like looking at barber shops or even thinking of them. 

My dad didn't like me having long hair. He said it made him look bad. It's my damn head, I should be able to grow out my hair if I want "father". (At a campground) He forced me to shave once or he wouldn't feed me, I called my mother and she said that was bullshit and told dad about it. Later my stepmother came up to me and said that we were trying to have a fun time at camp so I told my mom about that and she didn't like it.

Lost track here. I had my hears clipped by a barber when I was 4.

(Kinda off topic) my dad has two boys, I am the oldest by 8 years. Grady is 8 years old and is a little brat that screams when he thinks hes in trouble. I first met my dad when I was 2, he didn't know I existed until then, I had fun at his house asking to stay over longer and playing on the Wii. Then he moved into a nice big house and that's where things started to turn. My stepmother was pregnant. I got less and less attention but I was fine with that and I understood why, a baby is on the way.

After a few years grady was a okay little dude. He was nice but listened like a brick wall without its hearing aids. He would do the opposite of what I asked him multiple times not to do. One time he blamed me for something he did and I was the one to get into trouble and had my phone taken away. My dad didn't care what Grady did but always listened to the fucker. My dad clearly had a favorite and it's not me.

He tries to make me look my best but I really dont care, I could be wearing a shirt that's says something along the lines of "fuck this dude he sucks" but I would draw the line at racist shit; cuz fuck that. But not give a shit at all, why should I care about what someone else thinks of me? I shouldn't, that's why.

I have a horrible sense of smell. I cant smell the ass of a 3 week old rotting corpse 5 feet away from me. I try to smell as best as a 16 year old can. But i cant tell. When everyone says something about how they smell cow poop I say "well I can't smell too good" and then dont do anything (I actually enjoy some horrible smells), my dad says some shit like "you do smell bad". It makes me annoyed that he has been saying that for years now. Well shit dad, it's not like I'm fucking taller then you and have more hair then you did when you were 25.

I'm a mechanic, my dad is basically a secretary. I tell him every once in a while about what I do at work but one day i told my dad and stepmom that i drove an electric car 20 feet and they said i could of been arrested for it. Fuck no, its not the damn road, the cop (we only got 2 cops where I live) could of been in the car with me and they wouldn't do shit since they suck anyways. I actually drove my big ass illegal as shit truck down to the gravel pit and back and I drove great but I could of stopped way later. No one honked at me and no one tried to stop me or scream at me, I think I did a great job. If I told them that I would be grounded for forever.

TLDR: I'm not my dad's favorite kid and he is strict about dumb ass shit.

TLDR for the hair bit: fuck getting my hair cut imma be a wild man.
