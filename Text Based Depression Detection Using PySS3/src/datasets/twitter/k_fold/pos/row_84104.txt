God I fucking hate the IReady platform Why must this disgusting program make up a story that takes up half of the lesson, like just get to the fucking point. The characters they make up are constantly annoying, and you have to wait for them to finish their pointless conversation to answer a question. Not only that, but it won't let you get anything less than a 70, like a 60 is still a fucking passing score. But **no** they have to make it so you get a C or higher because fuck you.
