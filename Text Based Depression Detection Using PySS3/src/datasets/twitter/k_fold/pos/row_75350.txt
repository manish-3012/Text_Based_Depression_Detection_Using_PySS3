Christmas is going to suck this year Itâ€™s going to be the first Christmas without my dad being here with us 

My mom and sister are doing Christmas Day at my sisters new flat with my Nan going there also. Which I find stupid because sheâ€™s only going to move out of it in a year or so. 

I donâ€™t really like change so this is going to be hard anyway. 

My mom has a new boyfriend ( who she denies is her boyfriend but at the age of 18 I can tell) she says he wonâ€™t be here on Xmas day but I know he will be around the days before or the days following. Meaning I canâ€™t relax and enjoy the time 

I have no choice but to spend Xmas day alone at home which I perfer but it will be hard and sad. My mom doesnâ€™t even want to decorate for Xmas as she just wants to put the tree up at my sisters place 

Iâ€™ve got to buy and wrap my own presents as my mom says if she gets them the only way I can have them is at my sisters place 

Tldr: Iâ€™m going to be at home, alone, on Xmas for the first time without my dad being alive. Unwrapping my Own bought presents alone. Iâ€™ll try and enjoy it I guess
