I'm feel sad So in my country, my grades are from 1-10, and the highest grade is 10.

And if you get all 10s in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades, you get a medal, and a laptop, and you have something to flex on your classmates with.

So I got all 10s in 7th grade and in 8th grade

As long as I don't get a lower grade than 9 this semester I will be able to get all 10s because yearly grade is calculated by average semester grades, so if I get 9 this semester and 10 in next semester, it's still 10.

I have 10s in 8 subjects, 9 in russian.

But chemistry, chemistry is easy for me, I understand it.

I had 10 in class work, but I did really bad on the exam

And it wasn't even my fault! The teacher gave us some rules about oxides and then we had to take the exam, didn't even teach us how to use those rules.

So i got 4 in the exam, and my score in chemistry will be 8.

And that's so bad because even if I get a 10 in next semester (8+10)Ã·2 equals 9.

All the hard work I did, in 7th and 8th grade, to get the highest scores in everything, are lost because of that damn teacher.
