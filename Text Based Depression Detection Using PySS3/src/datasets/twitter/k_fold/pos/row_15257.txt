So I found some good music mmm So. Music recommendation. 

I briefly listened to The Dear Hunter in the past. However i never really opened up the notes app and wrote down the story that was being told 

So upon relistening and reading others interpretations ive figured this much out about the story 

It's about a prostitute in a city who is being hunted down by her previous clients for reasons i dont know yet, she finds out shes  pregnant with a child who is to be cursed with a horrific life of sin and pain unless she raises him out on a lake away from the city. She leaves her job as a prostitute behind to raise her son in a sheltered life where he wont need to know the truth. She raises her son to be unlike the people that were hunting her down in her past.   However while she lived on the river, a church was established in the city. "The pimp and the priest" is the name of an antagonist were introduced to. People at a bar the mother (Ms. Terri) used to frequent, rat her out to the church and the priest hunts down Ms. Terri. Eventually her past catches up to her and the priest stabs her to death in front of her son. Her son (the dear hunter)  is left to never know his mothers past. Unable to continue living in his home he gets on a train to seek out who his father is. He makes his way into the city which supposedly will corrupt him. Ironically Ms. Terris lack of honesty with her son and desperate attempts to protect him had no effect as he would remain cursed. The fire may be gone but the flame still remains 

The story is filled with a ton of beautiful symbolism. 

Im only through 1 album and 3 songs on the second one. I cant wait to see where this 5 act story takes me

I really suggest you guys give it a try
