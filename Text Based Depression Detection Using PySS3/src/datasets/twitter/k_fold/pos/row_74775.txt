My dad bamboozled me I was in my room playing games at 12 in the evening and I am not supposed to be gaming but I was allowed to be on my computer for like browsing the web because my parents say I get hyper after playing video games my dad walks in and says â€œtoo slow dudeâ€ and I immediately give up and say yeah I was gaming the next day he says he didnâ€™t even see me he just said it randomly to check.
