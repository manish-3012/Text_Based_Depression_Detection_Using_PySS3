Something made me happy yesterday that relieved some stress from the staar test (didn't get canceled for my school) As I was waiting in the line or the restroom (one person a time during the staar), the hall monitor teacher said to me "honey, that's the men's room", and she was astonished and slightly embarrassed when she found out I'm a guy because I said "yes'm, I am aware." As a femboy, this makes me really happy because it makes me feel more feminine.
