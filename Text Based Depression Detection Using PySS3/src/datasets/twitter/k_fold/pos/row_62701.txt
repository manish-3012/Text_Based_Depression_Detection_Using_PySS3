Circles by Kayla
I don't think you know this,
But I loved you at the start.
I don't think you noticed,
You were the master of my heart.
They say that distance makes the heart grow fonder, 
There's no lie, but I don't think I can last without you any longer
If I'd just waited a little more
to talk to you, to confront you,
Then maybe I'd be fully in love with you

Not saying that I wasn't already before,
But if I waited I would've loved you even more,
I didn't think that was possible,
But I guess there's always More to know
Oh did you know that I just love you so
I Love you
I Love youuuu
I know you don't know it
But I wish you loved me too

But when you didn't respond to my texts for a while
I wondered was it really worth my time?
I know a few little  hours seems pretty small
But I know that you had the time to respond to them all
If you knew that a half sentence meant so much to me
Then why didn't you just give me what I need
Baby you bring on the dopamine
You why I have such high self esteem

Yet It always the same cycle,
 we both bicycles 
First you ignoring yet you say you're busy
Second you apologizing so I don't get in no tizzy
And Last me just forgiving cuz what else would I do
Girl I'm blind with you
We just go in circles
Wish it was true
That you loved me too
