Hey Techies can I get some assistance? Remote school sucks, and of course my parents just want to make it worse, so they went to my guidance counselor and got all my school passwords, and now of course they think they have control of how I want to manage my time for assignments. They're also changing my passwords and saving their own personal ones since they don't fucking know how technology works. Is there any way I can ban certain devices from using my Google account? If anyone could help with that it would just make my life 10x easier. Thanks!
