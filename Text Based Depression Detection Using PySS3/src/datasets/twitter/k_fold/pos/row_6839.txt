I want my boyfriendâ€™s band, Rats On Acid, to get more fans. I am so proud of them. I love my boyfriend very much, and the lead singer and bassist of the band are two of my closest friends. Their band, Rats On Acid, started releasing music just this year and I am so very proud of them!

They recently hit 3257 monthly spotify listeners and their most recent song, Like It Like That, has 4655 streams already! Their most popular song, Love For Hate, which was inspired by the murder of George Floyd, has 2k views now and has so much love on it! 

I would love to see their social media grow as much as their YouTube and Spotify. They have a facebook, insta, twitter, ect. They made a subreddit for their band ( r/ratsonacid ) too! It would mean the world to me to watch my boyfriendâ€™s band have more fans. Thank you.
