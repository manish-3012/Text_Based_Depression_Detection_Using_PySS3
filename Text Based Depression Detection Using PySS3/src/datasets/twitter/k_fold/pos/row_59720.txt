My school had a trend of shitty, illegal tattoos so I participated! Some girl in my german class told us how a tattoo shop near us wasnâ€™t carding anyone so naturally my friend group went and got some. I got a turtle on my wrist and my close friend got a bee behind her ear. The trend continued with someone getting an off center chest piece around her boobs and two hands holding each other but with like an extra finger accidentally ? Another girl got a flower and the stem didnâ€™t match up. My tattoo wasnâ€™t as bad, bad line work but I got a touch up, somewhere reputable. A lot of people continued through the year, and Jesus were they horrible. Please stop
