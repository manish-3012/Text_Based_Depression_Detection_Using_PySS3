Why tf do we have to go to school in person I just don't understand it, in the UK whenever schools open and people go in cases skyrocket and the gov know that but send people in anyway, this whole thing could be over if not for their incompetence. If they actually cared about the cases and listened to the people and the scientists who advise them not to do this corona could have mostly been gone in the UK but noooooooo they want to open schools and claim its for mental health but if you really cared you wouldn't be putting lives at risk.
