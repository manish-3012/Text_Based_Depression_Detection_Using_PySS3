Is it wrong to do personal body stuff on holy days? Im kinda ugh and I really wanna do some nono stuff

But I feel bad about doing it on easter 

Is it bad to do it?

I see it as a sin but not a terrible damning sin just something that's like kinda sorta bad. But since im 50/50 on if its bad I feel scared about doing it on easter, christmas, etc
