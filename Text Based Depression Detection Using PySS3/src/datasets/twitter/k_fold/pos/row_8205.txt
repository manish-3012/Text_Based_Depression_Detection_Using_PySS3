The Rat Theory With this post, anybody who knows me IRL that sees this will very likely be able to piece together who I am, but fuck it, because I donâ€™t care anymore. I have come to present to this sub my theory/analogy about life.

Imagine a lab rat. The rat lives a routine life, within a maze. The rat is kept motivated by cubes of cheese placed by scientists throughout the maze. In the end though, the rat surely comes to resent the scientists, and almost certainly dreams and longs for an escape from the maze to a better life. Simple enough, right?

I believe that almost every life can be compared to the lab rat. We are all rats, scurrying about in our own little mazes. We are kept motivated by the little cubes of cheese given to us by whatever higher power does or doesnâ€™t exist (Scientists). At the same time, we come to resent this same higher power for holding us captive in our shitty mazes, and we dream and work towards the hope that we one day escape to a greater life.

I implore each and every one of you to try to apply this to your own lives. Embrace your inner rat. Identify your Maze, your Scientists, and your own little cubes of cheese. Most importantly, never lose sight of your dream of escape. Donâ€™t let the temporary substitutes for happiness that the universe gives you (cheese cubes) distract you from your true life goals.

Thank you all for coming to my Ted Talk.
