why am i so terrified of boys? so idk how to say this, im almost 16, bisexual and have never kissed anyone. i was in a relationship in 8th grade but that means nothing bc it was nothing and i broke up w him lol. and the thing is that like i could kiss anyone if i wanted to but itâ€™s so scary. the hottest guy could ask me to hang out and im just like no. and i canâ€™t explain this at all i donâ€™t get it? i get really really anxious and sometimes i worry im a lesbian but like im really attracted to some guys just not that many and i get really scared to do anything with them. idk just need advice or insight or something
