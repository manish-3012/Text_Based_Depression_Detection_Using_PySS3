Am 15(M) How do I come out as atheist My parents are both into separate religions.
One being a Catholic, and the other a hindu.
Recently I've been pondering life and shit to come with the conclusion that I cant really belive in a higher power without doubting whether or not I should be listening.
I know at some point I will have to tell them, I just can't really consult anyone near me.
