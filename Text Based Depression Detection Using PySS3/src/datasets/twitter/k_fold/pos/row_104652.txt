There are some girls at my school that piss me off They wear black to school one day and pretend to be depressed, but the next day they are fine. Thatâ€™s not how depression works. If you are going to fake depression, at least commit. Like my dog, and my grandma died and a bunch of other crappy shit happened (this happened last year, but Iâ€™m fine now) It really pisses me off and other people I know who are struggling with this stuff too.
