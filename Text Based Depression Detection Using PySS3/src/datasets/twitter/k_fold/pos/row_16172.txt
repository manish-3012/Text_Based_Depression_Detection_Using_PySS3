So I said the N-word. I'm a Filipino right and I said "[n word not hard r] same" to someone who said the n-word in a rather self deprecating manner, like "niðŸ…±ï¸ðŸ…±ï¸ðŸ…°ï¸ I wanna die" on twitter. We didnt mean any hate speech but people are getting angry at us. Did we do something wrong?? Please educate me properly thank you.
