Tried making food, now Iâ€™m crying. Fun times. I just want to cry whenever I have to eat anything, not in the â€œoh Iâ€™m lazyâ€ way, just, I feel like Iâ€™m eating too much even tho it could be literally almost nothing, it always feels like I want to throw up right after eating, because Iâ€™ll look fat and ugly and nobody will love me. And then Iâ€™m being told that Iâ€™m selfish and everyone gets mad at me, I just donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing wrong.
