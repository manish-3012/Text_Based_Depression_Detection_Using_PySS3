Why must it be this way So Iâ€™m in an Xbox party with the girl Iâ€™m taking to, and for the last 2 days sheâ€™s been really loud and enthusiastic and talkative and all that good stuff. Today sheâ€™s just quiet asf and I keep trying to poke fun at her or make conversation but sheâ€™s not talking. I eventually ask her eh sheâ€™s being quiet and she tells me to quit overthinking and just roll with it. Like, bruh, you act like you didnâ€™t just become a new person. 

Iâ€™m just really frustrated right now. I left the party but sheâ€™s still playing and idek what to do. Iâ€™ll probably just act normal tomorrow morning but Iâ€™m worried sheâ€™ll think Iâ€™m having a grudge or some shit against her. 

Why is she this hard to talk to, lmao
