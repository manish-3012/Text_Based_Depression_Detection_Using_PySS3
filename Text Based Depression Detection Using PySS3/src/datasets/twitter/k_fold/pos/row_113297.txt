Posting lyrics I like day 3 Sometimes I just wanna die I know I know  
Sometimes I don't have no where toâ€…go,â€… to go  
Whenâ€…the night comes everything moves soâ€…slow, so slow  
On the upswing only one way to go, down below

  
I just wanna die some times I'm just being honest  
My girl say she proud of me I think she being biased  
Fighting back my demons but I can't make any progress  
On the 21st will be the day it finally process  
What does mean I do not know  
Stuck in the dirt I can not grow  
Making my heart cold as snow  
Only thing I know how to flow  
Only thing that I want is hope  
Every day feel more like a joke  
Regrets they sit in throat  
When I talk they make me choke

I say I'm a god but i never mean that  
Browsing comments sections fiending for some fan feedback  
Positive reinforcement senpai really need that  
Feel I'm dying making music just live on every track

Trapped in sorrow who has solitude that I can borrow  
No tomorrow living in stasis my soul is empty hollow  
Pop a bottle I need to do that but spirits hard to swallow  
Made a vow to myself that's a path I would never follow

Wanna be good I just wanna live a little  
Angel and a devil I'm just somewhere in the middle  
Angel and a devil I'm just somewhere in the middle

Jigoku no Mori this the remnants of my story  
Bouta file away these secrets my songs my memento mori  
Will I sit in purgatory or will I ascend to glory  
That's the question that I'm pondering when I get off to yeah

Sometimes I just wanna die I know I know  
Sometimes I don't have no where to go, to go  
When the night comes everything moves so slow, so slow  
On the upswing only one way to go, down below  
I just wanna die some times I'm just being honest  
My girl say she proud of me I think she being biased  
Fighting back my demons but I can't make any progress  
On the 21st will be the day it finally process
