My friend just called me He asked if I was free. I started getting excited because I heard that they were like 5-6 ppl there, so I tought he was gonna invite me over. I said yeah, Im free, and then he asks me to send him the rules to this board game I have because one of them lost it. Nice. My dumbass tought, since yesterday was my birthday, they are gonna invite me over to celebrate. Only one of them wished me happy birthday. And Im playing league of legends with these guys daily and theyre asking me to play with them. What the fuck do I have to do to get invited to places? Its not fucking corona since they already were together, wtf is this
