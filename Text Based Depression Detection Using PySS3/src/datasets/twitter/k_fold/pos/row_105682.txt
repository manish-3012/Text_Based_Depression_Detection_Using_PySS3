Thought I had gotten into major trouble at school lol.  I managed to make myself a V-tuber avatar, and get the OBS virtual camera plugin working, so I joined my google meet (for school) today as my avatar just for shits and gigs. I made sure the background and everything on screen was SFW too. I accidentally joined on my personal account (which would be a security breach, and they couldn't tell it was me on another account because of the avatar), and I got IMMEDIATELY *banned* from the call. Not kicked, *BANNED!* I was FREAKING OUT, I though I had gotten myself into major trouble with the avatar, just to realize I was on the wrong account lol. I rejoined and it was all cool, but that was scary lol.
