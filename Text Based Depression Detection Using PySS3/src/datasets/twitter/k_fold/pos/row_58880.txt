Digimon ReArise is the most anti-micro-transaction mobile game I've ever played Before I start, I just want to say that I'm not trying to shill for Bandai Namco, I'm just talking about a game that I really enjoy.

I've been mildly hooked on this game, Digimon ReArise. 
It's nothing super special in terms of gameplay (It's 5v5 turn-based), and certainly not in terms of graphics. That said, it's quite enjoyable, and that's probably because of how little the game wants you to use micro-transactions.


The only item that you can purchase through micro-transactions, rubies. Rubies can be used to purchase items in the shop, or you can spend them to summon digimon (20 for 1 digimon, 200 for 11 digimon). Rubies are super easy to obtain through the battle park (PVP) as long as you have a semi-competent party. You also earn rubies the first time you beat a level in the story mode and Dimensional Vortex, and you earn two rubies the first time you beat a level for each digimon in the clash battle opponent roster. There are also more ways to earn rubies, but I don't think they need to be mentioned.
