French toast French toast is one of the easiest but best foods on this planet. All you have to do is mix eggs with milk, and mix them until that are like what you would use for scrambled eggs then you need to put the bread in them until they have soaked up some of the eggs. After that you will put the toast in a hot pan and wait til they are cooked and bam! You have breakfast. 

The nice thing about this is that you can use different types of bread like sourdough or something and find what you like!
