Why is everyone obsessed with Germans? Teenagers on this sub are constantly feeling the need to mention Germans, German engineering, or make a half-assed comment in German. 

Am I missing something? Why is the need to act German so popular? Or say â€œAs a German I approveâ€ to a meme that never mentions Germany in the first place.
