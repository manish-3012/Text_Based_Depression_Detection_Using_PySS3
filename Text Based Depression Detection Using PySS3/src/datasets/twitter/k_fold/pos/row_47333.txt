I just want to fucking sleep A little while ago my stupid sisters friends went into my room and sprayed glitter perfume on my bed, a lot of fucking perfume. Now, Iâ€™m allergic to perfume and get really itchy when I touch this kind of glitter. I have shook off and washed all of my bedding and itâ€™s still fucking there. I canâ€™t sleep on my bed and I fucking love sleeping there. Does anyone know how to get rid of glitter, Iâ€™m literally in misery.
