I might have a plan for Valentine's day So I started talking to a girl not to long ago and I think things have been going really well. I definitely like her but I'm not so sure if she likes me. She sais I'm super funny and she laughs at nearly everything I say. She's super supportive and all around an amazing person. And to see if she likes me on Valentine's day I'm going to ask her who her crush is and if sais anything other than "I like you" then I'll tell her I like her. I don't think I'll ask her to start dating or anything like that but at the very least I'm gonna tell her I like her. Wish me luck everyone
