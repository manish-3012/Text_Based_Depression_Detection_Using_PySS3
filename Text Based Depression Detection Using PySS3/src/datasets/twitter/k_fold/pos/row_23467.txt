My dream last night I had this dream that I was on a farm with this lady and her family. For some reason all her children were strawberries and the strawberries were alive. Idk why but she had to ditch her husband but I told her that we could take all the strawberry kids alone so I dumped them into the back of our trunk. There were thousands. She was crying like crazy and we drove away
