Found a poem I wrote when I was like 15 and about to turn 16( I am 19 now) Sixteen? No problem, I would still remain a teen

Only one year older than now

And would have to stop playing with dolls

I tried convincing myself

When the last night I was crying

Crying quietly and steadily

Crazy, isn't it how people have changed?

The one's whom I called my best mates have left me

The ground has swept beneath me

My teachers, who encouraged me to learn

Are now asking me just to memorize and run

Run behind the A grade

And not asking me first to be a good human

My parents? Well they're here

Supporting me while I stare

Stare at the world with questions left unheard

Soon I would be sixteen

And all of it would change

My school and my best mates

They would all disappear

I would be treated like an adult

And asked to be perfect

But how do I tell

I can't be that girl who has it alright?

How do I tell

I have fell

Fell many a times

That I am not perfect

That i ain't got those glossy locks and pretty skin colour

That I am not responsible

That I still hate being alone

And would love to hug my bear

But the date is coming near

And all those dear seem too far from near

If only they knew how hard it is for me

I am turning 16 , the world I began to see
