I have never been drunk in my life, but I'm pretty sure I'd get agressive I am very easily annoyed. Because I'm basically constantly annoyed, bottled up feelings and all that. So I get the urge to punch people in the face, especially if I think that what they're saying is stupid, I don't do it obviously, which adds to the bottled up feelings, I'm quite timid I guess, I'm kinda shy, ^(working on that) and generally reserved person, I quite dislike confrontation, but since I constantly have the urge to punch stupid people in the face, and I won't make sense if I'm drunk, I think I might just get really agressive if I'm drunk. More reasons not to drink.
