Im getting tired of waking up I dont dream every time i sleep, but every dream, I find a girl, like her and get in a relationship, all just to wake up thinking about that and realizing i shouldnt be happy, because nothing changed.
Lately these dreams have been feeling longer, but the time it takes me to realize it was fake is instant. Being alone sucks, i know there are bigger problems and i sound petulant saying all of this, but it just sucks and I wanted to vent
