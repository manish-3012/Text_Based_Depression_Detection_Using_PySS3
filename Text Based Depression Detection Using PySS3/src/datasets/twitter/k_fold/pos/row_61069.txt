I miss her man So this is gonna be a long rantish type post so ignore if u want. So back when I was around 9 or 10 there was a new girl in my neighborhood and eventually I introduced myself and we hit it off. This would be around 2014 and we remained friends for a few years hanging out almost every day that is until around mid 2015. My mom and step dad divorced and my step dad kept the house so I was only over there around 1 weekend a month or so so I would barley get to see her anymore. Now throughout this whole friendship she had always tried to hint to me she might be moving away by saying hey Iâ€™m moving and then I would get all sad and then sheâ€™d be like ahh itâ€™s just a joke I got u and then I would be upset at her for doing that to me but I just got used to it and didnâ€™t believe her when she kept saying it eventually. Well one day I went over to my stepdads and he told me that she moved away to Florida. I never even got to say goodbye man that was probably the best friend I ever had and I never got to say goodbye. I guess she couldnâ€™t bear to tell me that she was moving but it hurt more realizing I never got to say goodbye. She helped me grow up by introducing me to so much stuff since she was a year older than me hell idk why Iâ€™m typing this fuck night-time man gets me in the feels to much
