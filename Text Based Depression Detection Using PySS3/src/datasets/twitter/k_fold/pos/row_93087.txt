Trigger warning âš ï¸ How do I end my life when I'm too much of a coward to do it? I'm serious when I say that I really have nothing to live for. I'm a depressed bitch with a social phobia, both of which have conspired to sap me of any ambition in life. The person I live with I drive crazy with my fears and depression. He doesn't deserve to deal with what I put him through and probably would be happier with me dead. Oh, he acts supportive, but I think he's really not very happy at all. He's struggled most of his life to make ends meet and I think it would be a gift to him if I got out of the way so he could enjoy his life hopefully with someone more stable than me.
