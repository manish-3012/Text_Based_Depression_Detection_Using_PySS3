i think my mum knows about my SH My mum walks into my room and says "do you know anyone who cuts themself". And i almost shat myself because i thought she was onto me. A few days before this i left my slicey boi on my desk over night, i thought no one saw it but i could have been wrong. I say "what do you mean" and she says "people who cut them self for fun because they like pain". The reason i cut is different to what she explains. We talk and i am quite sure she dosent know. She does know that my friend cuts, she then tells me that only idiots cut and they need to face a 'real challenge' to show that life isnt that bad. She was saying this to my face and i wanted to die. This has been the worst converstion of my life and i hated every second of it. Sorry for bad english and thank you if you read this
