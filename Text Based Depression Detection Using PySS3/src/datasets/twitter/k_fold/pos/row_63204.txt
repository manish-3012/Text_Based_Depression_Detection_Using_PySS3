No shit guys I feel like I fucked up So I have (or had) a friend
But uh... 
We had like an argument yesterday, about online school  nothint special tho. 
Normally we sit together in class, talk a lot etc. but today I entered the class, he was sittting with the other guy (also my friend tho) and he didn't even say "hello" when he saw me

Idk, shouldn't I give up? 

(Also note that I'm too scared to ask him if we're ok)
