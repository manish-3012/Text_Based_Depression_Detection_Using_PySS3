Standing for mother nature and spreading awareness through a new movement.(please support)  

I am writing this post in all the communities i can just to apologize to mother nature as a human because today I realized that how much harm I have caused to mother nature which I think everyone should realize.

1)I would like to apologize for all the paper I had wasted.

2)For all the crackers burnt

3)For all the waste I threw on road

4)For letting so many green trees cut in front of me.

5)For wasting electricity by watching TV and sleeping while watching without turning it off

6)For many other non eco friendly acts I did but do not remember right now.

I would request all who are reading this post to start a movement with #IApologize and apologize for all the bad deeds(in context of nature around you) even if indirectly done that caused harm to nature

just to spread awareness so that mother nature can be revived and the harm caused by us could be healed.
