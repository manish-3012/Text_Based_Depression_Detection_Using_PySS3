An update on my situation First off I want to say sorry for the length of this and secondly I donâ€™t have great luck with relationships. Iâ€™ve been dumped because people all of sudden were lesbian and bi. Which Iâ€™m fine with I would of just liked to been informed instead of being told you arenâ€™t ready for a relationship. Well anyways a month after this girl dumps me I start to get feelings for this other girl that Iâ€™ve known for a pretty long time now.(mind you this is the week of midterms) I told her when the other girl broke up with me and all of a sudden she texts me without me ever giving her my number. So we begin to talk more often and whatnot. Her friend group on the other hand didnâ€™t like how I was dumbed so they told everyone in the group to reject me if I ever asked anyone out. People I thought were my friends were making bets on who they thought I would ask out next. They were right. I did over FaceTime because she made me tell her who I had a crush on. So afterwards I told her I wanted to tell her in person she agreed to forget I said anything. So we go into the music room where no one was and I told her how I felt. She stood there for a minute and told me she felt the same way. Weâ€™ve been dating for 8 almost 9 months now going strong. TL:DR : I asked a girl out that I liked for a little while turned out she liked me back.
