I went to the store today and something weird happened I went to the store today cus shopping with my mom and a little kid probably 10 came up to me and was like. "Are you lightning cus your myqueen" I was so confused cus I'm a guy and he was a guy to. That I shrugged it off and walked away.
10 minutes later and here come the kid and what I'm guessing was his big sister to come apologize to me.
