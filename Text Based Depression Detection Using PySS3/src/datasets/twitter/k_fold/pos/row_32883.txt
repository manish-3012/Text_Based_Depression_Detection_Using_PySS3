Thinking my about the few days before quarantine hit. Monday: Went to the movie theater with a friends to watch Onward, then fucked around at the mall. We didnâ€™t have school for whatever reason

Thursday: literally the last day of school, we had a band perforce at a different high school. (Yes I was in band. Just make fun of me in the comments lmao). And my fried manage to swallow a hotdog whole during lunch. I wasnâ€™t there but I heard second had from a friend. 

Friday, the day quarantine hit: Literally went to meijer because I had a coupon for free coffee. But had to wait 40 minutes at self checkout because the like was so fucking long. Got so socially anxious and forgot to use the coupon and paid the 10 dollars ðŸ˜

Sorry just journaling to myself. What about yâ€™all?
