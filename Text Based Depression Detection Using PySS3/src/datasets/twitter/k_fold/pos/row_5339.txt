My friend and I are getting dinner tomorrow night She said she wanted to â€œdress upâ€ a little and wear a dress. Idk what place she wants to go but sheâ€™s gonna tell me when i pick her up. should i consider this a date? we went out to dinner twice in the past month but it wasnâ€™t anything where we had to dress up
