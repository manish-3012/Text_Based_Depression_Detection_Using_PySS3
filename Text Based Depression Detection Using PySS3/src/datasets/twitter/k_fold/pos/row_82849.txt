Iâ€™ve never wanted someone dead, apart from right now. A little 13 year old kid in Reading was killed yesterday by a boy names jonjo, Iâ€™ve followed the story from a few hours after it came out, found jonjoâ€™s Instagram, messaged his mates, and this kid is pure scum, there are bad people on this planet, but this kid offers NOTHING good. Iâ€™m pretty useles, one of the only things Iâ€™m good at is making ppl laugh, but jonjo is pure scum and the video of the stabbing angers me a lot because it happened in the posh town of Reading, near London. And Iâ€™m poor af, this was a kid who had wealthy parents, a nice house (I found his address) but he went to go stab an innocent 13 year old boy over some girl. I wouldnâ€™t be unhappy at all if he died. Eye for an eye. But I want it to be slow and painful. If u wanna see the video dm me. Itâ€™s pretty horrific especially with all the people standing around doing nothing. Rip olly stephans â¤ï¸ðŸ•Š
