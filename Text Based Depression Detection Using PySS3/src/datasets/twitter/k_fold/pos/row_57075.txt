when your Christian teacher tells a student theyâ€™ll probably go to hell for not believing in Jesus iâ€™m a Christian myself but it isnâ€™t anybodies job to determine where youâ€™ll go in the afterlife 

a different girl in my class ended up crying because her grandma died that weekend and to have her teacher tell somebody else theyâ€™ll go to hell made her worried that her grandma will go to hell..... like donâ€™t say that to your students ðŸ˜ƒ
