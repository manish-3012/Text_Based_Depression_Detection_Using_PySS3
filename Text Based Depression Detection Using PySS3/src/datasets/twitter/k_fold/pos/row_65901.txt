Goodbye Reddit. I am leaving reddit. I am struggling with depression atm, and social media is not helping at all. in fact, it may have caused it. So, I am deleting all social media effective immediately. I recently watched The Social Dilemma, (if u haven't seen it go watch it now, its on Netflix) and that gave me enough motivation to treat my addiction to screens and likes. I might come back when I feel happier, but for now its goodbye. I will be deleting my account as well. I encourage you all to get off your phones and enjoy life while you can.

Goodbye Reddit.
