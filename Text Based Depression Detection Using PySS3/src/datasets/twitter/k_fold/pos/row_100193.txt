Let's Talk About Female Simps So here I am, visiting Mexico and laying on a couch bed at 6 in the morning thinking and talking about female simps.


Now before we get into the main discussion, I'd like to point out that the word for female simps already exsist, which is Thot. Now this word was made for the same reason Simp was made, which was to classify something with a meme to better use and have the other person know exactly what were talking about. And for those goobers that dont know:


r/NiceGuys = Simps

 r /NiceGirls = Thots


Now some of you are probably gonna say that using Thot is offensive, but is it really worse from just calling them a ~~slut?~~ And if anything, us guys would find it offensive as well and we'll ript in the streets about it. u. u


Anyways back to my original thought: So ya'll know when we see a nice cute and innocent girl post a picture of themselves on here of their cars and such, it's pretty predictable to see a swarm of comments of guys being simps, right? 


Well, no matter what, in all the posts ivr seen of boys postin pictures about their dog or fish that they caught, theres not a single thot comment anywhere! It's really weird and baffling to me that we dont call them out and make memes about them.


Now, there may not be thots online, they sure as hell exsist in our school lives. It seems that we see a lot more thots roaming around our hallways instead of seeing them roam around in between topless pictures of dudes on here.


Now why is this? Honestly I think what one of the main causes is possibly because in school life, the thots have people to back them up and cause sissy drama and spread some rumors. But on the internet, I dont think they have anywhere and anyone to go to. And it's not like they can make a rumor on here either. The second some "mean" post is posted on here, everyone would look at it, call the person a fat dumb liar and downvote the thing to hell, unless the poster has like 50 alt accounts on twitter dot com.


Hope yall enjoyed this weird random thought that I woke up with. I hope I dont get swarmed by simps/thots telling me how much of a scum I am to the earth, because i already know that I am! ;)


Hope you have a good day everyone!
