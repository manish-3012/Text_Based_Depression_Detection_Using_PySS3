Goodbye everyone Hi, you may not know me, but i just want to say goodbye to the few people who might actually read this. I'm taking my life on Wednesday but i'm making this post now to say thankyou. Everyone here on r/teenagers has always made me laugh. But i can't do this anymore, there's nothing left here for me. Even hell can't be much worse than this. I'm so miserable i can barely do anything, i'm tired here. If you really want kind of an idea look at my profile but idc. I don't want to bore you guys with my sadness. But before i go, thanks to everyone that's made my last year and a half a bit less bleak. Goodbye, my free trail of life will end as of Wednesday, until then, stay bald, stay fresh. goodbye, i love you.
