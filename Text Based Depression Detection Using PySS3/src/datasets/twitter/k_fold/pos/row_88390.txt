Personal finance survey Hi there,
My friends and I are starting a podcast that helps teach teenagers and preteens about the basics of personal finance ,investing and much more.  We wanted to better understand what the current level of knowledge that most teenagers have in the subject. If you wouldnâ€™t mind filling out our survey, it would help us better understand what we should cover on our podcast. Thanks so much for filling it out and I hope to get our first episode out soon.
