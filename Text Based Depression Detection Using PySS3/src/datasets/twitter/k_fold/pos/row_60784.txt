I broke a school window and I am scared. So since I am an idiot I cracked a window in school. It was pretty thin and it was opaque with like a net in it (dunno how to say). I am definately getting caught cause there was a camera, then again I still had an an hour after the incident and nothing happened. Anyways how much will they charge me? )':
