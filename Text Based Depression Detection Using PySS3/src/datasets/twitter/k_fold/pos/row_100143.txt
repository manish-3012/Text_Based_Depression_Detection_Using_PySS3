Just needed to vent How long do I have to endure this? I'm almost a fucking adult and yet I have had my teenage years scarred just because of that man. Just because he's drunk, does that give him the excuse to do anything he wants? The trauma and the toxicity I have had to face because of him. When he and my mom fights, yes I have gotten used to it, but it still has a massive toll on me and I can only endure so much together. I broke again after a long time today and now I'm crying on the floor of my bathroom as I am writing this. I started studying at 11pm and he started berating me and undermining my efforts and was implying I was only putting on a show and not doing any real work, and I snapped back. Then he came barging at me and I feared for my life. But he only smashed the keyboard on the ground
