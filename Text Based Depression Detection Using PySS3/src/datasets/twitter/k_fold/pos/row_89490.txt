Caffeine and sleeping If you fall asleep with a good amount of caffeine in your system, the amount of time and intensity of REM sleep increases pretty considerably. 

I just woke up from a bang energy drink nap and holy shit that was crazy. It took me probably 40 seconds to tether myself back onto reality. 


There was lots of falling and messianic prostitutes and insane landscapes as well as infinite recursions of my own death. 

FedEx was also there. 

try only if you are worthy.
