How to report unfitting ads on YouTube If anyone else has found any porn ads you can post them at r/ReportYouTubeAbuse and a bot will reply with links to different forms you can fill in and report. 

You need a link to the ad, but I lost it, so instead I linked to the channel the ad was from. I also took a screenshot 

Just though this might be useful as I've seen a few posts about it here.
