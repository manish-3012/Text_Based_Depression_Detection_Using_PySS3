The origin of my common used user name... Uninator was a character I liked to draw in my freshman year.

He had blond hair, freckles and wore a shiny armor and with a pink horned helmet which creates rainbows, he also had pink wings. His bestfriend were Starleo a lion faced star and Meteo a living pink meteor that creates rainbow colours in the universe.

Now does he live further as my gametag/username.
