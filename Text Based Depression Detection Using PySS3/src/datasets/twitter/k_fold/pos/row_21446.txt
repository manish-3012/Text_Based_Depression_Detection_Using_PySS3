I want a gaming laptop for my birthday, my parents keep saying "wait until Christmas" The problem is that I really don't have any good devices to game on, plus I need a new laptop for school because the chromebook I had previously is not charging(I could probably fix it, but the thing is unbearably slow). There are school chromebooks at my school but they are slow and since I'm a forgetful person and I forget to sign out, someone is probably going to do something to my account. I don't care about getting any other gifts if I get this laptop but my dad is stubborn and my stepmom agrees with my dad.
