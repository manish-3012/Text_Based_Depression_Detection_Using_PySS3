I got my result from the corona test that I had Thursday back and it is positive So I have the corona virus, I'm not really sick, only my throat hurts and I am tired really fast.



The biggest problem for me is that I must stay in isolation and need to avoid contact whit every other living being, including my family. I never felt so lonely despite all the supporting massages I got from friend. The thing that also bothered me was that some of my friend are going to hang out tonight and I can't go.


I already feel super lonely and I still have a minimum of 4 days to be isolated
