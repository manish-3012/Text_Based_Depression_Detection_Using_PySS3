J*st got my f*rst christmas present in a while! No,  really. I just participated in a secret santa, and got a My Hero Academia blanket and an OK Boomer shirt. I'm so happy (others also noticed me being very ecstatic), especially since I hadn't gotten a gift in a long time.

Thanks for sorting by new and happy holidays y'all!
