Jesus Christ i fucking hate reddit video ads Occassionally some subs have posts with videos in them and of course i want to hear them. So i click that sound button to activate sound. After watching the video and scroll down and BOOM LOUD ASS FUCKING SUPER MEGA EPIC RPG MUSIC BLASTS MY EARS AND RAPES MY EARDRUMS, fucking hell IT WAS 3AM. I did not even watch the video! I just scrolled down a bit and once the 3 fucking pixels of the upper part of this fucking ad is on my screen it just starts with the fucking music. My god, if it wasn't so loud i would have no problem, i'd just scroll past them but when teeny tiny bits of the post that is the ad are still on the screen and i click another post that is absolutely unrelated to it, i can still hear its fucking music. Fuck you ads, you have no rights to be that fucking loud in comparison to normal videos.

Nobody asked and everyone has this problem but god damn i just can't stand that shit. 
Elimination of all ads is imminent.
