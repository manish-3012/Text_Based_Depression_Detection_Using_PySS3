Why do girls want to be bad all the time? I donâ€™t mean to sound like a boomer...iâ€™m a teenager, i just have never understood why girls want to be â€œbadâ€ and boys as well...I know not all teens are this way but i see a lot of kids that are... like the song that says â€œf*** being good iâ€™m a bad b****â€ why do most kids always go for this personality? Iâ€™ve just never understood....
