I know this sounds bad but... I don't really know how to talk to/flirt with girls. like how the fuck am I supposed to get a gf. 
mabey its cause I lose all confidence when I try to talk to them. why can't I just have tons of cash. then I wouldn't have to talk. they would all like me. 

I just want to cuddle. I can't keep posting my problems on reddit. why do I have problems, I come from a good family, a good house, a good neighborhood, a good school. I can't be depressed. 


can someone help me make sense of it all. like why am I like this. am I I doing to much, relying on strangers too much.
