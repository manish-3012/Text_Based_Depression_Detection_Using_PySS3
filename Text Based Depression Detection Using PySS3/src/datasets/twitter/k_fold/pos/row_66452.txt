I need advice So, last year, my I had most of my classes with my best friends M and B. One day, B and M started dating, and I was really happy for them, but after a while the realization came. They were constantly hanging out with each other, and so I never had anyone to talk to, since all my other friends had their own friends they preferred over me.

My school is small, so there are about 50 students in 10th grade. These 50 students get slit into 2 different groups, where one group all has the same classes, and the other one does too, but theyâ€™re different classes than the first group.

This year, M and B broke up, and I am in a class group with M and my other friend Z. B is in the other class group so I almost never see him. M and Z have now basically became best friends, so I theyâ€™re usually always hanging out with each other, and Iâ€™m facing the same problems as last year. Iâ€™m not even sure what to do anymore, I feel so lonely surrounded by my own friends, and I know I should be happy for my two friends becoming friends as well, but I canâ€™t. I need someone to talk to so bad. This fucking sucks and Idk what to do.
