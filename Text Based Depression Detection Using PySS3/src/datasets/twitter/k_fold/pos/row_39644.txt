just made a fucking terrible mistake... I wanted to watch something halloweeny on Hulu. My mom has control of the remote. She picked, believe it or not, BOBS BURGERS. A SHOW SHE HAS NEVER LET ME WATCH BEFORE. And my stupid wrinkly brain said I didn't want to watch it. And to make it worse i wanted to watch it (i have pirated it on youtube). God dammit
