I made a 2020 song! (To the tune of "Hallelujah") *We started out with Killer Bees*

*And possibly World War 3*

*And then came COVID-19*

*Australia started to burn*

*The world will probably stop to turn*

*God really hates us this year*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

&amp;#x200B;

*Kobeâ€™s chopper came on down*

*The Wuhan Virus spread all around*

*The Chinese got in a fistfight with India*

*The stock market crashed*

*We are stuck in Quarantine, and they all say 2020*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

&amp;#x200B;

*Elon Musk shot his car into space*

*And people are being judged by their race*

*The Notorious RBG has passed on*

*Oh God, how can this year get any worse?*

*I swear someone laid a curse*

*Upon this whole world, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

&amp;#x200B;

*God is laughing up there above*

*â€˜Cause he doesnâ€™t care about us, love*

*The President just got the Virus*

*Someone tried to announce their baby*

*But Cali will be erased (maybe)*

*This is the worst year, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

&amp;#x200B;

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*

*2020, 2020*
