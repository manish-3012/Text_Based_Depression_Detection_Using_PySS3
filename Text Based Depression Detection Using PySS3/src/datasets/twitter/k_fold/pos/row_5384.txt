Toxic Feminism is real. So Today, in a discord chat of a youtubers channel, a girl said she likes boobies. So I replied "You can just look yourself naked in the mirror". Guess what happens next? I get banned. Like, If can't take a joke then why are you making one? If a guy said the same thing, He would be booed for being a perv. And It's perfectly fine a girl to say the same thing.
