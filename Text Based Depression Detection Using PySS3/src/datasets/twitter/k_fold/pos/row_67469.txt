I had an idea and I need help with it So, my Spanish teacher knows when we are using google translate because he recognizes grammar and stuff that he hasn't taught yet. Well, he has given us a google spreadsheet with all the words he has and will teach us, along with all their conjugations. I was thinking: "since he has given us this word bank what if I made a translator for his class so that he wouldn't realize if we were cheating since everything translated is stuff he taught us?" The only issue is I have no idea how to code in google spreadsheets. Can anyone help me out?
