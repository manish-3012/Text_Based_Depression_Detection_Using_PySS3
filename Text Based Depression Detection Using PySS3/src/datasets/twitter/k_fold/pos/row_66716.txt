Why have i been feeling off lately? I've been feeling really off lately. It's really hard to explain but its starting to feel unbareable. I am in a complicates relationship but we're basically official. We wont be allowed to date until may because her parents wont let her date untill she's 16. I saw her for the first time in months yesterday and after that it just amplified it so much. I dont know what it is and it makes me feel, weird. Please help?
