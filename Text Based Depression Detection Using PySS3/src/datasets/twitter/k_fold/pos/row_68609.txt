My cat went missing My cat that we got 7 years ago went missing in early July, we've been searching for him like crazy but we haven't found him. Is there any reason why a cat would run away? He had a pretty nice life, we live in the countryside and he had plenty of room, he was outside most of the time, he was pretty healthy, I don't know what to do, is there even a chance he is alive?
