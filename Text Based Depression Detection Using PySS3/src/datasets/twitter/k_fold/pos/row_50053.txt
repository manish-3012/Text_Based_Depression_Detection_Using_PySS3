Venting about a video game meant for fun because some fellow crewmate ruined one match. I know Among Us or any game for that matter is mainly for fun. But this game in particular was just one I needed to get off my chest.

So I primed the shields and orange saw me do it. Me and yellow saw a body on nav and in the meeting, this orange dumb fuck said I faked the shield priming. I almost got voted out first round which I probably won't be mad about anymore had this not happened. I sus'd him and when he left, it wasn't even him that was impostor. This orange dunce called me out for faking a visual task. This would bite me in the ass later as we voted out one impostor. There was now 4 left: blue (me), yellow, brown, and cyan. Brown had one task left and then someone sabotaged O2. After I fixed that, I went to go back to cams and saw cyan dead. I begged brown to vote yellow and he voted me. We lost and I couldn't even return to the game to rant about how orange completely lied and fucked me up for that entire game.

This was honestly worse than the last time I had to rant about this game. That game, it was entirely my fault for not being convincing enough. This, it was that orange son of a bitch that ruined everything. He was a fellow crewmate and he saw the shield lights flicker and he said I fucking faked it? How stupid could you be? I think it's because some people don't know that priming shields is a visual task yet, but I'm sure he knew. I mean, why would he report me about it?
