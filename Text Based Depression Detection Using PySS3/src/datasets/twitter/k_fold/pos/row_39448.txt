Thank you r/teenagers Itâ€™s my first year on Reddit today, but instead of spamming you with shitposts I want to thank you all. 

Thank you for being there in support

Thank you for being positive, accepting and kind when I felt insecure about how I look

Thank you for hearing my rants and frustrations, and giving me advice for how to get through them

Thank you for the memes, most of which are funny

Thank you for supporting me in my music, the amount of people that even decided to take a listen is more than I could ask for

Thank you for the advice on how to ask out that girl I havenâ€™t asked out yet (sorry)

I donâ€™t wanna get all sappy here, and while we arenâ€™t perfect, this really is a great community and I thank you so much for everything. 

Have a great day. Enjoy a slice of my Spotify cheese.
