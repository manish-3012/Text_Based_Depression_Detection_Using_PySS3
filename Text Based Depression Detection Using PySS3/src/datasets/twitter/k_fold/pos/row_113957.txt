Bruh Iâ€™m not saying its a bad cause but have you seen this ad? Its about veterans committing suicide but it starts like its a video game and has the map in the lower right and the dialogue in the bottom left and records all the speech and the map moves with the guy, and I thought it was an actual video game at first, then a cringy post, then I saw it was an ad and was like â€œhuh, kind of an odd ad but at least they support itâ€ and I was wondering if you saw the ad and what you think
