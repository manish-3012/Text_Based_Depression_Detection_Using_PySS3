I'm doin a sad Idk I been really sad lately and I'm not sure why. I just have these episodes where I can be super happy one second and literally nothing happens but I get super depressed the next. I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts as of late and it's taking everything I have to not act on it. I'm kinda running out of energy and patience to stop myself from doing it. Can I has some support please? I need it rn. Also I'm very tired so imma go to sleep. If you leave a comment I'll get back when I wake up. Gn, sweet dreams everyone
