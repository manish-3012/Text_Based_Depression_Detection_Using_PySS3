Let's hear some opinions I dated this chick back in 8th grade and she broke up with me cause I touched her leg to early in the relationship. Apparently after that she became infamous for selling nudes and giving nudes to random dudes. Now my friend who lives next to her is telling me she likes me even though i hate her.

I'm thinking i might get a friends with SLIGHT benefits relationship.

Oh and im in 10th she's in 9th
