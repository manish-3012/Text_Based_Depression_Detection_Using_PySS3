Singapore is the most anti-teenager country I can think of And it makes me ashamed to live here.  
  
The minimum age to start learning driving is 18, opposed to 16 in the USA.   
And even if you do get your license, you canâ€™t get a car unless youâ€™re very rich.  
  
Iâ€™m not. My dadâ€™s car is meant for his work, so my license is pretty much useless for my personal life.   
I just got it so I could drive vans, make deliveries and earn money.
