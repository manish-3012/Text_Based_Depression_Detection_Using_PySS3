Why is everyone so happy about Biden Like I get that Trump wasn't a great president, but is Biden really an improvement? I mean Biden has openly said that he dosen't want his kids to grow up in "a racial jungle." Not only that but he's old as fuck, like can he even walk up the White House stairs at this point?
