Do you also sometimes forget what food you just wanted to eat? I just saw something tasty in the fridge but then my mom wanted my to do something. And when I came back to the fridge I was really looking forward to eating that special food. But I had forgotten what it was. I just knew that it was in the fridge, that we don't have it often and that it's super delicious. Even when I looked for it in the fridge I didn't find anything special. Did my taste change in that short time? Did someone take the food item? Is it still there but I just can't find it? We will never find out... 
Well and now I'll just eat a sandwich or something.
