It's like 6 AM where i live and i just woke up because of sleep paralysis I hate that shit. I've had a lot of those before so i'm kinda "used" to it, but it is, still, a terrifying experience.

And now that i woke up already and have nothing to do, i'm just going to tell what happened that probably caused it.

I'm at my grandma's farm giving support and company to her and my father, since my grandpa died a few days ago.

I slept on the couch (because it's big and the only place that i could sleep without my back hurting for the next 2 days) and woke up at 3 AM to get a cup of water, hearing a few weird noises but hey, i'm on a farm right? So i go back to sleep.

I know it's irrational, but the thing is, i'm a bit anxious, and a bit paranoid, so those noises probably increased the chances of the event occurring.

I had a lucid dream, one thing that i love and hate at the same time, love because, well, it's a lucid dream, freedom, after all, but hate because it lasts 2 minutes and then it goes all wrong.

With "goes all wrong" i mean that most of the times i have a lucid dream, it suddenly turns into a fucking horror movie from one second to another.

In the dream, i'm at my street, just walking peacefully, i look at the alley on my right and there is a figure, just standing there, menacingly, it was fucking terrifying, it was tall, like 8-10 ft, and i could barely see it because of the dark, but still, for some reason, terrifying, i ran to the nearest door and tried to open it.

And then it happens. I wake up, but can't say anything, can't move, only see, amazing. But as i said before, i had a lot of those already, so it lasted like 10-15 seconds and then i actually woke up, cold like ice, but woke up.

TL;DR: heard weird noises at 3 AM and had a lucid dream, wich probably caused the sleep paralysis, and now i'm here
