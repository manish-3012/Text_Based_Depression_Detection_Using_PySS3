I hate living in australia Well i dont hate living here, but the fear of looming bushfires and dangerous animals just ruins summer amd australia for me, i just want to be relaxed and not thinking about that this summer i might be woken up by my family rushing everything out of my house and into their cars and loosing things of great value that we just forgot, and the possible risk of my friends bring killed in a bushfire too
