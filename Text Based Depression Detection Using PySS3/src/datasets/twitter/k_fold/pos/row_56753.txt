I just applied to McDonaldâ€™s for my first job, feels not so great I really didnâ€™t expect having to apply to my last-resort, but here we are, 17 and still unemployed. Time for the depression to sink in more than it already has. Who knew getting above 90% in all my classes would still result in me being unemployed and useless.
