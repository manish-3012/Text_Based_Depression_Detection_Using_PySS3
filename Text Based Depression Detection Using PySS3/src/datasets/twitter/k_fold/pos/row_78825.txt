Bored boys bars (don't cringe on me 2 hard lmao) Ay yo yo 16 yrs old
Male from Canada low n behold
When I wus 13 I broke the mold
Tryna live life so full n so bold

Now I'm tryna think of sum smart 2 say
Although prolly came 2 me yesterday
Bored asf on my phone rn
Scrolling thru the subs like a mf snow plow

Hmu if u wanna, if u don't that's fine
I'll make sum time to write the rhymes
N read the signs 
Between the lines
Behind the blinds 
To find a mind 
Who won't decline
To climb the climb

Getting drunk
Is part the trunk
I carry around 
They call it junk 
I call em punk

Left hand b topped with cream fill
Eat too much ya might get ill
