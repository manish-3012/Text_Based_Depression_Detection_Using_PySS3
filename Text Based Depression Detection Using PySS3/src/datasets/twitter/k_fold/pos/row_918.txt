I think my girlfriend's father is forcing her to leave me I'm afraid that my girlfriend(14) will leave me(m, just turned 17) because her father is against the relationship. I understand that the age difference is bigger than in an average relationship, he thinks that I'm only in it for the sex, that's not the case though. Whenever I'm with her I feel butterflies and when she smiles at me the world stands still, she makes me feel like the happiest guy alive and I genuinely care for her and don't want her to get hurt in any way, in case you're wondering she has told me that she feels the same way about me.

We were texting eachother when she pretty much disappeared for half a hour, when she came back she sent a snap of her hand bandaged up, she has had self harm issues before, just like me, a month or so earlier we swore to each other that we won't do it anymore for each other. I asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story.

Then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity, to which I replied "whenever you feel ready, making you do something you're not comfortable with is the last thing I want to do". She then asked "what if I won't be ready?", I replied "you'll know when you're ready".

Then out of nowhere she texted me "I know that would be a reason for you to leave me", I replied that I would never leave her. She started telling me that she wouldn't fulfill my needs and I would need someone else. I told her that all I would ever want is just to be with her and that having sex is not the point of the relationship.
