I kinda think I might be becoming a better person Iâ€™ve been trying for like 5 years, and I think its working. Maybe meditating has helped. Iâ€™m actually started to feel less like a shitty person


Or maybe Iâ€™m just nice on reddit idk, because redditors have been telling me Iâ€™m nice. But being nice on reddit is still a step in the right direction.


My mom also told me we might be able to start volunteering (in covid-safe ways)


I think the only struggle currently is stopping talking about politics.
