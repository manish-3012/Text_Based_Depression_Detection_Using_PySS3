Community appreciation post: Thanks for the day guys Today I pretended (really badly) to be a bot on this subreddit trying to rickroll people. Just wanted to say, you gave me my best 1st April day (in my country we don't do that much things so). It was fun pretending to be a bot and fail miserably to rickroll you. Thank you for it. You are awesome.

(If there were doubts no, it was never a bot doing it)

(I'm sure you don't care, but today I won't be redrawing any of my old cards)
