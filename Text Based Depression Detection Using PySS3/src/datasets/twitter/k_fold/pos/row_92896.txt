Help with talking to an exâ€™s friend I like. Ok I need some help here, I moved to a new town like a month ago and started dating this girl I had met online who lived where I was moving too. We didnâ€™t really connect so we ended it but she was always posting stories on insta with her friends and I thought one of them was cute so I followed her and she followed me back and followed my private account. I really want to message her but I donâ€™t know how to start it off or want to say thatâ€™ll just sound generic. Please help guys!
