Is he really a friend or isnâ€™t he a friend at all? So before I explain, I wasnâ€™t looking for attention nor am I into the â€œoh are u okâ€ (Iâ€™m a massive introvert) and hate attention, anyway....

So awhile ago I crashed my car (It was storming and back end slid out and i hit a Barrier). The car was a write off and Iâ€™m lucky to be alive. I posted a photo of my car being fucked on Snapchat (couldnâ€™t be bothered sending it to the people who are close to me so just posted it) and the thing is, few of my mates asked if I was ok (this night proved who was real and who wasnâ€™t) and Iâ€™m grateful for them but.

My point being is: I have had this mate since I was like 5, grew up with him and known him all my life (basically a brother) and Iâ€™m still in contact with him/he lives near me. This night, he didnâ€™t even message me at all. Didnâ€™t ask if I was ok, didnâ€™t bother to do anything, just looked at my story and thatâ€™s it. Still hasnâ€™t bothered asking or anything. 

I donâ€™t expect him to message me, he has his own life to live. If someone is truly your friend, should they make sure youâ€™re ok and that youâ€™re not hurt? 

Itâ€™s been going through my mind for awhile. I thought that this mate was a brother but he didnâ€™t give 2 flying fucks really and yea, I donâ€™t know anymore tbh.
