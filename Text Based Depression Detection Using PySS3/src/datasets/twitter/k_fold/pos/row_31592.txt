i know nobody will care at all but please read it my dog went missing he is little and dosent stand a chance to surviving other dogs it has been a time with really bad timing because i am moving out from my childhood house bc bank debts and illness and i struggle with this feeling of aimlesness and sadness and my dog as messy or poorly behaved he was he pulled me out of really hard times but now that o dont have it around and that i am leaving him at neighborhood known for its violence it just breaks my fucking heart knowing that a hachiko thing is going to happen, should i look for help? but at the same time i know that people will just shrug it off.

i just don't know what to do with me anymore
