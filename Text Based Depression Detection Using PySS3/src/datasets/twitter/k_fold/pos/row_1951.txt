I need help So, basically, I am in the middle of a horrible situation.  First of all, all my family cares about right now are reports and grades, ok, and my median is getting lower. My grades started off pretty well and now I'm scared because they are descending. I always get distracted and have trouble concentrating during the lessons. All I'm asking here is if anyone can tell me how to calm down. Please. Thanks.
