i dug myself into a hole :( pls give advice hi. 

i recently started talking to this boy. iâ€™m a freshman so itâ€™s kinda like a first time really â€œdatingâ€ anyone since middle school doesnâ€™t count lol. 

i was supposed to go to the movies with the boy on thursday but now my mother said sheâ€™s not really sure about it. he already bought tickets and everything too and she doesnâ€™t know

i have no idea what too do cuz i feel so bad i cant just ditch him and he also bought the tickets. what should i do?

also side note, my moms not really keen about him anyway so i try to avoid talking about him, iâ€™m worried if i tell her about him more sheâ€™s really not gonna want me to go with him. 

maybe sheâ€™ll change her mind bc he bought the tickets? idk iâ€™m afraid to ask. 

thx u for reading 

also heâ€™s a nice boy, she just doesnâ€™t like him
