Day 2 of advice I wish I could give my younger self People are much better than you think, you maybe are wary of others, distrusting, unsure of who they might be, but don't push others away completely, even if you keep them at arm's length and don't become best friends, it's nice to have people to turn to, so make friends here and there and if you are wary, don't get too close.
Sometimes you'll be at a new place and randomly see someone you know, if they're a friend you can easily have a conversation to pass the time, knowing a lot of people can help out a lot, but also if those people enjoy your company it will help you feel more confident in yourself. Also, if you have things to hide, feel free to hide them, everyone has their secrets, but if you feel you need to tell someone, friends are great for telling things to, just make sure you trust them with what you tell them.
So don't push other away because you're shy or scared, embrace friendships as they come, make an effort to strike up conversations with classmates if an opportunity arises, you'll find you have more in common than you think.
