Did my friend try being with me? So I recently had this thought running through my mind about a friend which Ive known for years will call him (Alex).Alex has been my friend since elementary he always throws compliments at me saying how smart I am and how funny I am  he always ask me for help when we have math homework and stuff we were really close with each other some of the kids in our class said â€œAre you guys gay?â€ and i could see why they would ask that we were always near each other and sometimes he hugs me or puts his arm around my shoulder and a couple times he held my hand which made my face turn red now I didnâ€™t mind this because I believed it was just    H O M I E  love sometimes before class I would lay down on a bench outside and he would sit near me and look at me and just smile one time he called me cute and during class kids at my table would take my pencils as a joke but he didnâ€™t like that he would argue with them telling them to give it back I knew they were just joking but watching him do that for me made me feel safe around him.When March came around I started getting real feelings for him but we all know what happened during March â€œAll students will have a week off of school due to COVID restrictionsâ€ a week turned into a month and now it will almost be a year March 15th will be the day school closed I lost feeling for him because well I donâ€™t see much of him anymore 

I donâ€™t know if this belongs here but I thought i just share Ill delete this if people ask me to
