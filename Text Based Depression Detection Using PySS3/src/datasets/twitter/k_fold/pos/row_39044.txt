Things a 21st century teen should know *I am gonna be writing this in order of waking up to ending the day*

&amp;#x200B;

**Routine and Habits :** One of the most important things in life is to make every second count, the human brain has a limited quantity of willpower and you can be very easily overwhelmed by choices. The best way to get stuff done is to make a very fixed schedule that you will try your best to follow will make life much easier. 

For example waking up at the exact time everyday then brushing your teeth till a given deadline and having breakfast at a given deadline, this ensures you have time saved for everything your heart desires and you don't get distracted

&amp;#x200B;

**Food and Health :** Food everyone knows is important but the only reason I am touching this topic is because sadly 90% of the knowledge you have about *'Healthy Food'* is marketing and mostly false, 99% of that knowledge might have come from biased research.

 This age is literally the best time to set how healthy you will be and according to recent studies and reviews a diet high in refined foods especially carbs is bad and I'm not gonna say much other than try to forget advice from most people and learn from online resources that are up-to-date and fix your knowledge about food, many books are out there if you want to read them like the "Salt Fix"

&amp;#x200B;

**Data and Time are Money :** I don't think many of you out there realize how valuable time and data of a person is, before you touch your phone or say something remember that the industries want to get your attention on them because that makes them money, your time is money for them - the more time you give them the more they earn. 

Data is a gold mine for harvesting and using for harvesting even more time. I don't want you to cover your cameras or don't use a voice assistant, I want you to know that every move you make connected to the internet is being tracked. Switch your apps, use Google, FaceBook and high risk vendors mainly Chinese companies should be avoided. 

Data is so valuable people steal and sell it on the DarkWeb. This data will be turned against you when you are an adult on a path to success. Just look at current examples where one wrong Tweet ruins careers

**Addiction Comes in many forms :** There is a big issue for non-medicinal addiction that is overlooked too much, everyone knows drug bad but what they may not realize until their life is damaged or sometimes ruined is that today's teens are addicted to many things and have withdrawal symptoms to things like NSFW content, that in particular is a big issue because it can alter the mind's perspective to the topic entirely and it rewires the brain because the mind learns from looking at things. 

Taking an example from the real world, There was a time when an ASMR Star held a competition where viewers could get a chance to have dinner with her, the winners when at the dinner table didn't bother to give attention to her and had their eyes glued to their screens to her live stream. 

This is an extreme example and I might get called a Boomer for it but you need to understand that I am not trying to tell you phones are bad I am telling you that life should exist in the real world rather than starting an imaginary family that after a while ends you up in crippling depression and destroys your social life

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals and Achievements :** There is one thing I see a lot and that is many people I meet don't have concrete life goals and have not planned out how they will deal with tomorrow. The most important thing in getting success is to pursue what you love and only what you love, you will not be able to fit in anything else. 

Let's take my friend for example, he is very talented, can code well in Python and can program mini computers like a Arduino to some extent, built things like a tesla coil and a 30k powersupply winning awards at competitions. Guess what is he studying and how well is he doing. I will tell you because of family pressure he is studying a medical major and has failed Biology already. 

Surprise? shouldn't be because he wants to be something else but tries to put his foot everywhere like business just  to get some freedom. Don't live a life thinking I should have done that rather than this, live a life you are proud of. This is the time to decide and having blurry goals will always put you in failure at some point if not today or tomorrow, it might be regret 10y down the line

**Money and Making it :** The thing that the world revolves around, the thing that separates you into classes, the thing that decides if you starve or help others. Money sadly is the most important thing in life and many would not realize this because they want to be kind and this will appear very controversial to a young innocent mind but you should trust me when I say people want to be next to you if you have money in the real world out of friendship. 

The kind of people that could possibly lead you to success. You need to learn money management at a very young age, You will benefit from it a lot. Good places to start is to start writing down your expenses and analyzing how much is going where and how much can be saved. Try to make a budget and enforce it. This will allow you to purchase things even if it's a small candy bar with the peace of mind that you are saving enough to enjoy the entire month or week. You will not have to count cash every time you need to make a purchase because you have a concrete idea of how much cash you have

Making virtual wallets or containers will help you divide cash for things like snacks, friends, emergency, new phone, new charger. I like to keep 2 emergency funds personally but that's your choice to set those

 Don't have money to begin with? That's not a reason to ignore that it is not too late to learn and you can take a head-start from everyone else who has money and can't manage it.

 Learning how money will work in the future is one of the best things you can learn in the topic, having a rough idea of living expenses of common things like rent and food should be known by the age of 16. Learning how the complicated system of credit cards and debit cards work. You can try to get a debit card at a young age if you can afford to maintain it because you can't really qualify for a credit card in most cases. Would love if someone added about taxes because in my country they are just sales tax which we don't need to do much about

Investing for the future and looking at yourself and asking what is your net worth, yes you can have a net worth of even 3$, your net worth is the amount of stable assets you have that can be traded for cash easily. Your electronics or vehicles wouldn't really count because they depreciate a loot especially when in use. Small things like proper traditional watches can be considered something that doesn't loose value. Something like a budget Tissot if bought in a sale wouldn't depreciate much and has the potential to appreciate in value. Many people use watches as an asset, not the best but it's an option you can't really loose because you can wear it. It is just an example and you should use your imagination for this

**Public and Internet Image :** You should start building a public presentable image from today. Have a separate account with your real name and a separate account for the LoLz so it doesn't effect your image. You don't want to be rejected something as big as a job opportunity because the employer saw you as a careless risk taking person while in reality you get work done very well and stick to the rules. Things that might offend someone can turn on you very quickly like we touched before.

Try to not make everything public, you don't have to tell everyone what you did the entire day. You need to maintain some privacy, people are out there lurking and stalking and you don't want to be taken advantage of. Many people sadly are exploited of their insecurities on the internet and many devastating things can happen

Start writing a rough CV and a set of professional oriented accounts which you keep active to show the person you actually are. If you are not into social media that is fine but if you post a lot just be careful. You should list your self on places like LinkedIn so you have a presence in the professional world. The modern world runs different than it used to do 5y ago. A simple reverse image Google search can expose a lot 

***Writing all of this because I thought I should help people and always wanted to help people and day dreamed a lot about it, if it changes someone's life for the better I have achieved my goals and I am only stopping because it has been a good hour of typing and I'm tired. Love to take questions but it's bedtime so sorry if I don't reply. I only wish that this subreddit moves towards helping teenagers and making their life better and I saw a gap in that I wished to fill. Have a wonderful day and I am sorry for mistakes I might have made up there***
