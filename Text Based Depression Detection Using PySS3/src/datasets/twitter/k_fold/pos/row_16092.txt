I feel depressed but I don't want to talk about it because people don't believe me or say it is attention seeking I say I want a girlfriend and it feels like everyone thinks I'm a sex crazed desperate monster but I'm just really lonely and when I try and communicate that it feels like everyone looks at me skeptically and if I speak about depression they're all like "lmao ye same" "haha cool" "nice one mate" and carry on making depressed jokes that make me feel sad. Now I can feel myself starting to lose the will which I feel guilty about because I "have a fine life with all of your music stuff" but that's too material and I just want to have someone to talk to
