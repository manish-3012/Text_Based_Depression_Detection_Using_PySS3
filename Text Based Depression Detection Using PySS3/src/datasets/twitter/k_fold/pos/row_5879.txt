The art of not giving a shitðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž Yeah,so i' ve seen a lot of people act insecure throughout their teens and mid-twenties...the simple but noble art of not giving a shit starts now----1ï¸âƒ£. don't overthink- let's be honest most guys and girls overthink about what to wear or not,just.... don't...
Wear anything and everything you like.
2ï¸âƒ£. don't fear about public opinion- if you are in public (away from anyone who knows you),  most of us try to downplay our behaviour and try to fit in.....do what you want to do but keep in mind this simple line" they don't know me,I don't know them,the probability of meeting these guys again is next to zero,so I'll do whatever the hell I want to do",this simple line changed my behaviour from public awkwardness to public indifference and I count that as an improvement.
3ï¸âƒ£. Try not to fit in with the ordinary- there are a lot of people who do crazy things just to stand out, there's no need to do something drastic, try to stand out by being better than your peers,be it in academics or sports....and try to think what is different about me,then act on the points about yourself that you think are different from the others.
4ï¸âƒ£. Consider yourself superior- this is an unpopular opinion but hear me out ,you should have a few points about you that are unusual or different than the norm,be proud of them...you may appear as slightly arrogant but,treat everyone with kindness(no joke or cheesy line intended) help everyone you know  in small or big ways, it's all up to you.

This was my opinion on being confident, it's a different journey for everyone but be strong and try to be proud of yourself, I appeared a little arrogant to my teachers,but 15 days later my classmates and teachers began to think of it as a part of my charm,so I guess.........it worked .....do keep in mind that these tips are not for online sites, everything is different there and if you "dare" appear arrogant ,well you're Satan's spawn.....
