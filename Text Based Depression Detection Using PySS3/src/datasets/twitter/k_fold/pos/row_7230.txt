Am I the only sixteen year old to have smiling lines on his face? I don't want to call them wrinkles but that's what it is. I started to form them last year only a little bit but since then and especially those two to three months I have seen them go down  and have now reached my chin area. I feel awful about them and it ruins my day just to catch my reflection and see them.I don't smoke or do drugs, I eat like an average person and I have seen fat people or snokers in my age who don't have them. If anyone has had the same or similar experience please let me know of your methods.
