Existence makes no sense at all I mean how can something exist from nothing, because if the universe is a loop that explodes and implodes in a loop it still had to start somewhere and if it was not al loop how did it start out of nothingness and what cam trigger such much energy if theres nothing

And then all the nature laws, how the fuck can gravity exist, yes i know its the curvature of space time but what is spacetime and how can it be applied in a 3 dimensional world

And where does time end? Or the universe? Infinite cant simply not exist but whats betond the endge of the universe then? Or how can time ever stop then? How did time even start 

And how tf can something be alive and be self aware? I mean how can a pile of mean think and write these words? It just doesnt make sense 

Fuck these thoughts dont go away... i want just to live simple but i cant stop thinking

Nothing makes fucking sence here
