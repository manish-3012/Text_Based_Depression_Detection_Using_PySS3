WTF LEAVE ME ALONE itâ€™s been a year since we dated, my ex says â€œIâ€™m outâ€ when I tell him that Iâ€™m not fixing anything regarding me changing my phone number to avoid him. I said that if he wants me to talk to my family about why Iâ€™m still talking to you even though thatâ€™s why I changed my phone number, then he needs to prove to me that itâ€™s worth the stress and that he can make it worth my while and that he wonâ€™t hurt me again. And he goes â€œok then Iâ€™m out.â€ So In my head Iâ€™m just like okay bye good riddance, I donâ€™t need people who make me miserable sticking around anymore, especially him. And now heâ€™s harassing me, adding everything to fucking talk to me, making alts and shit to contact me. LIKE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SAID OK IM OUT?????:&amp;:@:@:@/â€˜skKjskdksl Iâ€™m fucking angry
