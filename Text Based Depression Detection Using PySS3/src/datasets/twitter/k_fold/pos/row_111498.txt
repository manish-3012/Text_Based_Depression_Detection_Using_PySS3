My mom said I was hideous, and then my history teacher agreed. Now you might remember my last post about my mom calling me hideous. Iâ€™m still upset about that, but today I went back to school. This is sort of a continuation of my last post. 

The first thing that happened was as I was talking to my history teacher about how my parents think my hair is ugly. He said, in all seriousness, â€œI agree. Your hair is pretty gross.â€

Then for the rest of my classes, everyone made fun of me, every teacher and every student, except my health teacher and my science teacher, along with two girls at school (Iâ€™m a guy).

I honestly love my hair color. Itâ€™s so cool. My aim isnâ€™t to look good. In fact, thatâ€™s kind of the opposite of what I want to do. I want to look like what I want to look like - and I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s ugly to you or if itâ€™s pretty to you. But hearing â€œyouâ€™re so uglyâ€ and â€œyour hair is so disgustingâ€ all day from the people you care about and the people you have to talk to every day and the people you have to learn from can get to you. 

And itâ€™s really starting to get to me. 

I donâ€™t know if I should dye it back. I donâ€™t want to, but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to take this day to day bullying from everyone around me. Sure, Iâ€™m the bullied kid at school. Iâ€™m fat, Iâ€™m bi, and Iâ€™m trans - of course Iâ€™m going to get bullied. But now on top of that theyâ€™re bullying me for dying my hair like I wanted it dyed. 

I canâ€™t have anything, can I.
