Guys I'm in deep shit So for French class, we had to do a skit, all in French, but it's not that long or anything, a simple short skit. So I'm in a group with my two buddies, let's call them f1 and f2. F2 had the bright idea that we should use puppets for the skit,  but me and f1 can't record it in person because you know, remote learing and the state of the world. But f2 who brought it up, was like "I got puppets, a camera, a tri pod, and my brother will help me film, and I know how to edit." So me and my f1 sent him our lines, and he said he'll get it done. And he said when he's finished he'll send it to us on Skype so we can review it before we submit because the teacher will be playing all the videos of our skits in the meet.So the project is due tomorrow morning, and we started Friday. No video in site. Apparently, according to f2's brother, he just started editing at 10 pm, it's due like 7 30 am. And apparently, he lied about the puppets, he only has 1. So apparently there's an Olaf from frozen plush in the video somewhere. And me and f1 are going to have to find out tomorrow morning with the rest of the class. If f2 doesn't finish (and if the video sounds like anything what I've been told it's like, I hope he doesn't finish) then we can just read our lines over the meet. But creativity is 45% of the grade. I'll update you guys tomorrow by 12 pm.
