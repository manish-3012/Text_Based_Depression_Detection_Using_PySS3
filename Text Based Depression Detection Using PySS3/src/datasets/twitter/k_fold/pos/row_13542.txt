GUYS I CANT EVEN EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM RIGHT NOW I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY CRUSH PLAYS NINTENDO. WHATS EVEN BETTER IS SHE PLAYS THE SAME GAMES AS ME, who would have thought that MY crush plays animal crossing and PokÃ©mon, the way I found out was I was in the same class as her form teacher and I was talking about Nintendo games (PokÃ©mon, animal crossing etc) AND THEN THE TEACHER COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND SAYS â€œHey (my crushâ€™s name) are u playing Nintendo? Itâ€™s fine I just wanted to know what u were playingâ€, my heart stopped. As I looked up my crush replied â€œum animal crossingâ€ I GOT SO FUCKING HYPED, then the teacher said â€œwait do u play those PokÃ©mon games as well?â€ She replied â€œhaha yes i do I play PokÃ©mon shieldâ€ THE SAME EXACT COPY OF POKÃ‰MON I HAVE. That made my day and I just had the need to tell someone so yeah.
