It's All Falling Apart!! Im 15... I wanna be a singer but my family wants me to do a job that's gonna pay off... I really love singing..... That's my first love.... The first thing that's always with me.... To share happiness.... To share sadness.... I wanna give the next gen.... What I got the best.... The feeling of having  something other then the schools homework.... But I can't do it.... Why ?.... Cuz I can't take it anymore.... Everyone hates me.... My classmates ignore me..... My family members thinks singing as a career is worthless.... And all I loved was songs And games........ But I just can't do it anymore.... I am fed up of people ignoring me.... talking behind my back.... everone thinks I'm a worthless person with no value in life what so ever..... WHAT SHOULD I DO ???!!!!!
