My girlfriend tried to commit suicide Last night my girlfriend wouldn't pick up and it turns out that she took some pills and she was trying to commit suicide. I know she was having a rough night and I just can't stop thinking that if I was there then things would be different. Idk I'm spiraling and ruining ur guys' day is my favorite hobby so I'm gonna go in sulk in my own selfishness now, bye
