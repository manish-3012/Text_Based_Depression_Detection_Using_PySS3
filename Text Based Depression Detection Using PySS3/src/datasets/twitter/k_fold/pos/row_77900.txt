My mom is being too much My mom and bro wanted to watch a movie together and it's a comedy movie and I just don't feel like laughing and I haven't enjoyed it so far so I left to watch something else on my own and she's fuckin pissed at me. Why the fuck can't she understand me I just don't feel like it today. I gotta get up early tomorrow and the only holidays I have after tomorrow is probably a month later. I literally Don't understand her. Does she want me to force myself to sit there and watch something I don't like for a good two hours when I could be watching something else?
