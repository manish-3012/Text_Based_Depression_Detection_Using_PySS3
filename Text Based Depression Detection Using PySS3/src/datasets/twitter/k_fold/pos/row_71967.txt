This was about 5 months ago and I just felt like I should rant about it instead of just leaving it to myself. I have a story of true pain. So finnaly got my crush to like me and we would get all snuggly but we weren't dating because we wanted to wait we planned on dating if nothing happened in the next month out of no where my best friend start a talking about how he likes her and how he's liked her for a while so i willingly gave up my hopes and dreams of having the company of a girl  and they dated for about 2 months yhen broke up thru text and she decided to start hating me after dating my best friend which was a blow to the heart but it gets worse because my friend doesn't talk to me for 3 months after it happened and he instead starts hanging out with a guy who I hate and is a horrible person and it hurts most that he chose that guy over me for a while.
