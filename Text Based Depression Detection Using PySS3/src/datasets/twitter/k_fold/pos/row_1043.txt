Sick of Oldheads on rap threads on Reddit. Every time anything relating to "modern" rap/hip-hop is posted there's always a flock of hivemind oldhead redditors coming in saying Eminem is better. They always condemn any drug addicted artist/ deceased artist killed by drugs. Even though their Lord and savior Eminem was once addicted too. I'm sick of the "I'm better than everyone." Mentality on this platform. :/
