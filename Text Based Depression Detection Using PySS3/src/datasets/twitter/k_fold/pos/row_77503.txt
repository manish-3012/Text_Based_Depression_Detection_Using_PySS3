Question for my Mexican/Hispanic/Latinx/Spanish speaking/etc. people So idk if a lot of people will find this relatable or not, and this doesn't just apply to Spanish speaking people. Anyone can relate :) I just didn't know how else to word the title lol, sorry. But anyways

So my mom is outside in our garage just sweeping and cleaning a bit and she has some Spanish songs playing. I went outside just to see how she was and I was like, suddenly hit with this wave of nostalgia. When I was little, like 4-6, we would always have music playing, (like literally everyday. We'd be playing music at some point throughout the day) and my mom would be cleaning, my dad would help out, my brother and I would be playing, running up and down the stairs, dancing in the living room... and I was like 'damn. life was amazing back then.'

Back then, I could run around without a care in the world, just belting out Spanish songs with my dad, dancing and just being a kid. Life was just so much better back then. Now I'm stressed about school and life and honestly, it doesn't suck, but compared to back then, it's crappy haha. I'm not depressed or anything, but I just really miss those times where I had no cares and was just worried about having tea parties and drawing and dancing and just having fun. COVID definitely hasn't helped at all.

Does anyone else relate? Like, do you guys ever remember those amazing childhood days without a care in the world just filled with love, laughter and fun? Sorry if this makes no sense, I just felt like getting it all out cuz being stuck at home, I don't really have anyone to vent or gush to about stuff lol. 

Anyways, that's all, byeâœŒðŸ¼
