the ACTUAL definition of feminism (since this sub doesnâ€™t rly seem to get it) so basically i saw this post called â€œregret is not rapeâ€ and while i TOTALLY agree w that the comments under that vid where legit terrible. the op was calling people femenazis etc, they were also being totally respectful when people where talking about boys issues but then when it came to girls issues they were just going OFF. 

iâ€™ve noticed a lot of posts about feminism and misandry and i see ppl totally misrepresenting feminism a lot of people seem to think that feminists just want to be above men (the name it self has such a bad rep) but thatâ€™s totally not the case. YES there are some girls/women who think that they should be above men and think down on them and while they might call them selfs feminist their are NOT. feminism is about getting ride of the patriarchy as a whole. (also if you donâ€™t know much about the patriarchy you can read about it [here ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy)

feminism is about uplifting both men and women and eliminating the patriarchy and stario types that still have a very big role in society. for example men feel the need to hide their emotions so the male suicide rate is really high.

also iâ€™ve noticed that BLM gets hated on the same way that feminism does. the argument is basically that both movements exclude other partyâ€™s like other races or men but thatâ€™s legit not even the case.
