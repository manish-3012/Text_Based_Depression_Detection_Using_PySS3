So is it just me or if youâ€™re doing some sort of an activity you have to take a shit the day before? Like. I do Taekwondo 3 days a week and let me tell you. I have to and I mean absolutely *have* to shit the day before or risk having the need to take a shit right before or in class. 

It canâ€™t just be me right.
