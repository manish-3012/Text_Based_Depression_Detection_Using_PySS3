I graduated early and i couldnt even get into a college Why must american college be so expensive
I busted my ass all year to be able to go to college this fall
But college costs the price of a small house
I wasnt even able to go to a damn community college

I put so much of my self worth into how well i did in school so not having any schoolwork to do for a year is making me feel so awful i could crawl into a hole and die

I know a lot of you guys dont wanna be in school at a time like this and i truly wish i could take your place rn
