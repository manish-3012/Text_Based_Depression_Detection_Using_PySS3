Ew you guys are so dry rn I made a promise to myself Iâ€™d sleep at 12:30 at least, itâ€™s almost 2 am which isnâ€™t that late but it is for me bc Iâ€™ve not been getting enough sleep. I know people who can get away with not sleeping at all and theyâ€™re all active and shit. I cannot be a productive human being without enough sleep but here I am. It sucks posting around this time tbh
