this is a bit of a hot take but hear me out ok so listen feel free to believe in what you want to believe you do you but imo the Christian religion is a cult same with pretty much all other religions they have all these rules thats not my only point  think about things like the bible i mean it was made by some guy probably mentally ill but still its just like any other holy book also heaven and hell are most likely fake because the Christian religion took the entire idea of hell from the ancient Greeks also science has proven things like evolution which meant no adam and eve dont get me wrong i think Jesus was a real guy and was a very good person but over time people deified him they saw him as more than a human i think he did good deeds but i dont think he walked on water or performed any miracles ok now that i have made everyone here angry ima head out and also this isnt just some athiest i was raised in a christian family but for awhile im questioning it also if god is all loving and all that   why do people who do horrid things get to walk away unpunished just my 2 cents but please give ur thoughts in the comments
