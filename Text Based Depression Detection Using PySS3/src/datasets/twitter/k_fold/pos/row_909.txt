Went to school for the first time in 2 months today and my friends decided to try and go through my phone without my knowledge Not upset at the prospect but...

Recently I started dating my friend and itâ€™s one of those cases where it looked obvious from the outside that we had a crush on each other.

Well today my girlfriend let it slip accidentally and itâ€™s spread faster than fire and that led to some of my friends trying to go through my phone when I left it in my pocket for PE (physical education).

I donâ€™t know what to do because these people make up like 70% of my friends and Iâ€™m scared because I have some private shit on my phone (nothing illegal but just shit you donâ€™t want sharing).

The friends didnâ€™t make it past the Lock Screen but Iâ€™m fucking scared theyâ€™ll do it again.
