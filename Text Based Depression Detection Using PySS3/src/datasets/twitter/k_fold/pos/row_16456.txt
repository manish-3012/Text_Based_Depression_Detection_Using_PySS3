I'm just fucking done with life I already made some more of these posts, but as a quick summary: got depressed, tried to commit suicide, I did do it but my parents saved me before I passed out, became depressed again. That's basically the story. 

I became depressed because my life was going shit, like absolutely shit, and it still is now. I lost most of my friends (most blocked me for no apparent reason), the person I had feelings for fucking hates me, so much stress from school, the few friends I have left rarely talk to me, and just today I made a new friend that I enjoyed talking to that already blocked me for some fucking reason.

I told myself not to try to do that thing again, but I see completely no way my life could get better, it's just completely shit rn. I'd like some of youse to consider this post for a moment and maybe say a few nice words, but dont bother, nothing is really gonna help me at this point.
