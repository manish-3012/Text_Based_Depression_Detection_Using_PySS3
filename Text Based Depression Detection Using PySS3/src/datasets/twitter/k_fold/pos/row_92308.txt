I need a lot of advice. To start, I have clinical depression. I stopped taking my meds because they gave me bad side effects, so it never went away. Today while doing homework we uncle started yelling at me, then told me my mom hates her life because of me and left and I donâ€™t know what to do. I wanna fucking kill myself right now and Iâ€™m at the end of my rope here. I canâ€™t go on doing this any longer.
