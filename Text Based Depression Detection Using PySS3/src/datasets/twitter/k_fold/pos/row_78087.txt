when will parents ever realize that grounding their children (taking away electronics) does not work? I mean seriously Im in 9th grade and when I was in 7th I had a teacher that hated me and I was grounded the whole school year and even when I turned things in he gave them a bad grade when I had made sure I met up to his standards
