i love it i love how awkward we are... my first ever relationship and honestly it couldnâ€™t be better, even tho were long distant and donâ€™t talk tooooo much but honestly youâ€™ve made me smile every time, we take it slow and i love it, you seem so serious but i find it cute of you, you have a way of being that motivates me.
i want to make you happy and smile the way you do to me, cause i truly care for you than any other man iâ€™ve meet in my life...i worry to much i could just tell, is that right? 
a guy who repeats the same routine, a gamer, a guy whom i truly like, i have so much hope for our plans to become a reality &lt;3
