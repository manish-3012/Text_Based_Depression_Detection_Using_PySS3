[serious] My mom's reaction to my breakdown I just had an overload bc of the stress of life and schoolwork. I'm in 10th grade btw. I couldn't get something to print and that just set me off. My mom walks in on me crying and is bombarding me with questions. Then she tells me to calm down.

How helpful.
