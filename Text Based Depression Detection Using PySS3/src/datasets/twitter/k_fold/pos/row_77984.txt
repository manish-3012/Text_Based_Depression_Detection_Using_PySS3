Hielp!! Need name for doggo. Recommendations welcome. I need a name for my new doggo but cant come up with anything.

I dont want something too generic(like tiger, snowy or some shit like that) or something too ughh(like Alexander, Papastathopoulous, or whatev)

Just want something not too common but not too weird.

References: doggo is an amstaff, black with white paws and a unique white diagonal line on his forehead, immensely playful and loving.

Other pets I currently have, a doggo named Sif, three cats named NoÃ«l, Assta and Albert.
