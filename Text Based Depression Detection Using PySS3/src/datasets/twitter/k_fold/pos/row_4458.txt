Sadly, the judge denied our petition to get a restraining order.

My guess? Aside from gender, race &amp;amp; and age biases...

My Mom stalled for a LONG time. This shouldâ€™ve been done immediately, instead my Mom purposefully kept putting it off. She promised this back in June - 6 months ago. I only finally convinced her last month. We filed for the petition last week, and the most recent major incident we could 100% prove was 5 months ago. Thereâ€™s been events since then of course, but not easy to prove itâ€™s her.

**But then... a miracle happened.**

My mom realized one of our neighbors is military.

She talked to him.

Turns out he was stationed at the EXACT same base that sheâ€™s at right now. We forwarded them the document I have compiled, and him and his wife were able to take it straight to her commander. The FULL version. 37 complete pages of everything Iâ€™ve saved since 2017.

And today our neighbor informed my mom that my stalker has officially been issued a [No-Contact Order](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-protective-restraining-orders-3354203) by her commander.

Definition:

â€œNo contact orders are like the restraining order in the civilian world. These orders are issued to protect the safety of another person or of several people. It could be issued if a person in authority suspects inappropriate actions by someone in their command.â€

This means... I am free. Finally. Iâ€™m 19, and the person whoâ€™s forced herself to be the focal point of my life since I was 14 is finally gone.

Even if she tries something again - it will definitely be the last time because she will get in SERIOUS trouble. This is essentially the military version of a restraining order.

Iâ€™m so happy for the neighbors who practically saved us. My heart was heavy thinking Iâ€™d have to return to this subreddit with bad news. But this is great news. Iâ€™m FREE!
