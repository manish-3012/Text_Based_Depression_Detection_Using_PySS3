Why is menâ€™s mental health not talked about nearly enough? Why is menâ€™s mental health not talked about nearly enough?

I live in Australia and I wouldnâ€™t say I have a huge friend group in and outside of school but I still know that 1 friend of mine has attempted suicide, one cuts and my Dad committed suicide 3yrs ago. All male. And I have not heard much at all in terms of awareness of menâ€™s mental health at my all boys school apart from the average â€œooooh ask your friends if they are okâ€ like itâ€™s bullshit.
Is it that hard for the school to make time for us to miss one lesson every few weeks to educate us on things like this? Like what to do if your friend is self harming or wants to kill himself? Is it that important that we learn that one skill or can we learn skills that could literally save lives? Iv not always been in a good mental state either and literally no one knows because I just donâ€™t know how to talk about these thing.
Iâ€™m not claiming to be an expert or how this would even be executed Iâ€™m just sad that these things arenâ€™t taught to us by the institutions that are meant to prepare us for the future 

Sorry for bad format I am on mobile
