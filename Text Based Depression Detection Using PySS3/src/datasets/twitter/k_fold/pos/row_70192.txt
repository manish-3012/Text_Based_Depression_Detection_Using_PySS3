So I f'ked up about 2 years ago About 2 years ago, my bestfriend's gf said that he liked me and I turned her down saying that she was in a relationship with my bestfriend and I dont want to break the brocode but 2 months later she broke up with him and within the next 1 month, I asked her out. At that time, I really didn't think about it but now, I think that my bestfriend was hurt because of this decision and I am really feeling guilty because of it. I justed wanted to share it with y'all.
