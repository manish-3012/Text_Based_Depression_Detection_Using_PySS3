My school's thermometers don't work I've been doing legit school for a month or so and I noticed something. My temperature had been 36.2 or 36.3 for the entire time not matter where I came from(cold room/Warm room). It became very obvious when I got sick (It was only malaria don't worry) and my temperature increased obviously but guess what? 36.2 like usual. So some people definitely got in while they were sick (like me).

P.s I didn't really have a say in whether or not I went. I went to my mother's hospital and I was covid negative so I went. I missed 1 day after I crawled to my mom's bed because of how much pain I was in.
