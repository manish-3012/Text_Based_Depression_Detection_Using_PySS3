Fuck senior year Of course I get this shit. I have t applied to college yet fuck I might not even graduate. This year is shit and honestly itâ€™s not due to corona per se itâ€™s due to my school fucking us over. Senior paper due 2 months early? Sure why not. Iâ€™ve been getting fucked left and right by my administration and Iâ€™m done with it. If youâ€™re a parent reading this talk to your fucking kids and make sure they are doing okay and make sure they know youâ€™re open to talk. This year has been terrible and Iâ€™ve dealt with depression bouts before but nothing serious but holy god this year has been hell. Honestly Iâ€™d say for the past 2 months Iâ€™ve wanted to kms. Iâ€™ve seriously thought about it. I doubt I will but still I donâ€™t think film study grade should have a student thinking about how easy it would be to just do it. My school is so high pressure and we donâ€™t get any mental breaks. Itâ€™s top 100 and Iâ€™m not saying that to brag Iâ€™m saying that so you all might understand how much shit we put up with. Life is a day in day out hell of testing and essays.
