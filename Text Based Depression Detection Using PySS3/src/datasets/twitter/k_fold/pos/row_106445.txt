Fitness people out there- How to improve stamina? Title really.

I just sprinted about 20 (5 second intervals or so) seconds up the road to catch my bus and I've only just recovered about 10 minutes later- my chest felt tight and it kinda hurt to fully inhale. That sorta thing.

How can I improve this??? I absolutely hate running- I tired and quit after a few days it was so boring. I don't feel out of breathe when I dance though, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong??

Where else could I post this?
