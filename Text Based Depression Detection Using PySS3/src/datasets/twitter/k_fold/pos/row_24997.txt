No bullshit life advice? Soon to be (19M) i am having the worst days of my life rn. After a failed romantic situation that later turned out to traumatize me i have been regularly going to a therapist and taking meds for the past 9 months give or take. The thing is, after it happened i was fine, everyone said move on on, work on yourself blah blah and i did exactly that. I worked out, i picked up my hobbies more often and after 2 months depression hit hard. I failed to like myself, i did everything i could, and life has only gotten worse.. ruined relationship with my parents, horrible grades in college, deteriorating social life.. been pretty much isolated with no one to actually talk to for the past 9 months.. except my therapist which doesnt reply often.. I tried everything but i failed to make myself happy .. all this bs about having to love yourself first and not depending on anyone.. when i was happy i never wanted a partner .. now i am so desperate for someone to lean on.. i really dk
