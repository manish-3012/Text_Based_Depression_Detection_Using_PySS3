My teacher said he loves CBT!!!! He was asking about our weeks and then he said  he lives CBT? Obviously I was shocked when he said this! But then he said, â€œdo you guys know CBT?â€ Then he said it stood for classroom bonding time. (If you donâ€™t know it does not stand for that) I canâ€™t stop laughing, he has no clue what he said.
