Im tired of this Basically my mom wants me to talk more about my interests because for the last year i've been quiet around her and most of my family

The reason i stopped talking was because every thing i said would lead to a lecture or her being annoyed for some reason and me shutting up. But now she wants me to talk more... great

So i started talking about my interests (random things i think about or stuff i'm interested in) but every time it goes like this

*I tell her whats on my mind*
Her: i dont know, you should study this career about whatever you just said because idk (dismissed) 
what a great conversation, ill totally want to talk again because its so fun to talk with you!

Or it ends up annoying her because "why would i know? You should google that instead of asking me"
Great! Next time ill just shut up

Whats more, she's exploding on me and my sisters faces for every little detail as a way of releasing her stress from work

we've talked to her about this a million times yet she wont change and we have to change because were on the wrong. So now the only way to get rid of that problem is being 100% perfect without a single flaw she can get mad at
