We need to disable awards on posts labeled serious. Seriously. There are too many people who will do anything or say anything for awards. If we could disable the awards then the people who are actually going through something or want to discuss something serious can be heard but then we can discourage the people who fake things. Its not a 100% fix but its something. I think its a shame how you can't tell fools from real people with real problems.
