My crush is gonna leave middle school soon and I'm still afraid to tell her what I feel I really wanna tell her what I feel but I'm still afraid of the response. I was always bad for making decisions, so I will ask Reddit, should I ask or not?
Note: i'm from Poland, high school starts when you're 15.
