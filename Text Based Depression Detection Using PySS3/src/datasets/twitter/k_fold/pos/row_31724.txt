How to not cry when confronting people I've used the advice on google such as breathing in and out but that just makes me choke on my saliva and distracting my mind just makes me say some random crap

Plus this even happens while trying to create the future confrontation but thinking of it even brings tears. Mostly common on family members

Any advice?
