â€œso you like victorious but you donâ€™t like law and order special victims unit?â€ 

â€œmy ravioli is having an identity crisisâ€

â€œcan you postpone your death so we can do bingoâ€

â€œmy legs are sweaty and my noodles are goneâ€

â€œnothing says true love like hey i know where an artery in my leg is lemme shoot it and bleed out real quickâ€

â€œdead ppl are my favorite minorityâ€
