Does anyone have any advice to help me make more friends? (Serious post) Hello, I am a 15 year old California male. Some background, I used to live in this apartment place 2 years ago with a bunch of kids which I would play with almost everyday. But due to a black mold problem in our apartment complex we moved to a new house which is next to a elementary school, so there is barely anyone my age around here who I could hang out with or relate to. I have been homeschooled for the past 3 years. The feeling of loneliness has really gotten to me. Is there any advice you guys could give me on making friends when quarantine is over? I plan to enter high School when quarantine is over, I'm also extroverted. Please give serious answers, this shit has been killing me.
