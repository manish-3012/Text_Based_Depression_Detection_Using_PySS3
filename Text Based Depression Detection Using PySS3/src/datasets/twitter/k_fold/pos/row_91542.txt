Alright y'all'd better fuckin listen up I've been seeing a lot of posts on here about NNN being cancelled due to Covid.



No. 



The practice of not wanking for a month has nothing to do with a pandemic. Oh, you're in online school? That has nothing to do with trying not to nut (I would hope). Do you go over to your friends' and stay there a month trying not to wank? Probably not. All you bitches are just feeling sorry for yourself that the rest of the year sucked. 



When people say "I've been informed NNN is cancelled," what the fuck is the supposed to mean? Your friends just decided they weren't doing it? Is their some sort of Council of Wank Elders that voted to cancel this activity? Probably not. And even if that holds true, who's to stop you from practicing NNN anyways?



Of course, you aren't forced to do it. That's fine. But at least say that you aren't doing it because you don't want to. Anyone who claims it's cancelled due to Covid is just a massive pussy making excuses. If you don't want to do it, just say it like that.



But I would urge you to at least try. I know a month can be difficult, maybe excessive. But it's not just the struggle to distract yourself  to not be horny, it's also a journey. A mental journey. We don't realize how much sexual desires control our lives. Try not wanking for even just a week, the should be doable. You feel like a whole new person. Maybe you may try to get involved in other hobbies to distract yourself from the horny. I would encourage you to, too, if you are struggling.



Overall, if you don't want to don't want to do NNN, that's fine. But don't be a bitch about it, don't make excuses. Just say it. I personally think you should all at least try for a few days, you may find it's not as hard as you thought.



On that note, hope you all have a good day. Stay safe. And good luck to all th pe brave souls participating in No Nut November.
