I just witnessed a car chase 15 minutes ago I was walking to the shops when there were a bunch of sirens going off. Then a white bakkie came speeding through the traffic with the horn thing at full blast, swerving like mad with 2 police cars behind. 

Im home now but can still hear the sirens but there are ambulances all over so Iâ€™m guessing the chase is over.
