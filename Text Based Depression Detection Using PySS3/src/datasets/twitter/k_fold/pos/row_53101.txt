HOW DO I KISS A BOY HELP H E L P SERIOUSLY HELP ME I AM IN DISPAIR I F15 am going on a date with a boy M16 I've been crushing on 

He's really chill, he literally just texted me "hey do u wanna kiss" and I though he was pranking me

Anyways it's my first kiss AND date EVER, I am TERRIFIED and NERVOUS. I've never kissed a boy or a girl or anyone, so idk what to do. 

By example, what do I do??? my friends told me to just kiss and I'll figure it out from that but FUCK OFF GUYS WHAT DO YALL FUCKING MEAN???? ok I'll lean in for him anD WHAT NOW?? WHAT DO I DO WITH MY TONGUE?? HEY?? HELP??

How do I tell him that I would very much like to him to be playful with his hands, idk the term in english and now this sounds extremely sexual, like how do I tell him that i don't mind, I'd actually like him to touch me??? Without being awkward????? 

I have so many questions, he has kissed before and i feel like I'm scaring him with my nervousness, GALS, I NEED HELP HERE, TEL ME TIPS ANYTHING WHAT DO I DO WITH NY TONGUE, PLEASE I-


Edit: lmfaooo why are people pissed??? Wtf I'm just a dramatic teenager making a scene what

But anyway thank you so much for calming me down, i can be a little too much sometimes, and it's not that big of a deal, it's just a kiss. From the boy i really like. Aaaaa I'm gonna kiss him ok ok I'm fine now hehe
