How do I talk to my (M15) girlfriend (F15) about sexual boundaries and desire? We've both been dating for 3 months now and we're incredibly close. We talk every night and she's shared so many things with me that no she hasn't told a soul. I've recently found her incredibly attractive and because of how close we are I think it's best that we set sexual boundaries and talk about sex in general. The problem arises when we get to the fact that she's very shy and I don't want to make her uncomfortable or feel weird. I know she'd forgive me but I still don't want to put her through that.
