Imagine, you have a ton of work, projects, and essays to write and to finish by the end of the week. Do you have to sleep at 9?   Now this isn't pointed to anyone but one of my friends, Lisa, who I am deeply confused by. My school gives tons of hw for each week for every subject, even the side ones. So you have a load of Art, English, History, Embroidery, and etc. of essays, projects, tests, and more. And you have to do this, every single week. At that same time you sleep at 9 every day and complain on how much work is left and how your so sleepy by having so 'little' sleep? Dude sorry but what? Lisa I know you. Even if you slept at 9 you are definitely not the type to study fully in those hours. The type to start but then a few minutes later get sidetracked by a youtube video that was originally supposed to be just for music. The type to pretend to study then open a hidden tab of a game. The type to get caught using gadgets late at night by their parents. I was hoping the pandemic would teach you a lesson or two about being a better person and not procrastinating. Maybe I just have to wait a little longer. I hope you change dude and stop your "I don't care" attitude.
