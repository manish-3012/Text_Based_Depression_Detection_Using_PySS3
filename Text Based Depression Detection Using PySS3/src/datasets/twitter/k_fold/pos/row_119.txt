Need help remembering a name of an old toy I remember when I was younger, back in 2010-12, I remember the kids around me used to have plastic balls, with a magnet on the bottom, and when stuck onto metal, would explode into a creature, and then was folded away by hand
I remembered them a couple days ago, but for the life of me remember what they were called, I don't think I ever knew lol

If someone would b able to tell me what they're called, I'll be indebted 2u
