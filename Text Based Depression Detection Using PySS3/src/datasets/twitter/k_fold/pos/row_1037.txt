Just a random rant about life and death and wanting to die idk I just can't help myself but feel like... Indifferent, I'm just so apathetic to basically everything, and if there's something that makes me laugh or feel happy then it gets worse because i have to feel nothing again and that's bad.

I don't want to kill myself, but the idea of dying isn't so bad, like by something you can't control, I probably don't have the guts to do it myself and I lost my train of thought lol, brainstorming this is a shitty idea but why not.

So basically something like dying while sleeping, at least a "peaceful" death might not seem to bad, I know there are people who love me and all that but I don't feel much, I try liking people too, but after all the times I was rejected, I can't bring myself to love anyone or simply I haven't met her yet, even if I don't know if that's gonna happen.

Don't worry it's not a goodbye note or some shit like that, it's just a teen ranting while being a little bit sad, I keep hoping that it's a phase but the more I live the more I think I'm lying to me, but I truly hope it will pass
