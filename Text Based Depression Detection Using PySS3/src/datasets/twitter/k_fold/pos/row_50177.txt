How does one obtain a GF? Aight I know this is Reddit and probably not the best to ask for relationship advice but here it goes.

So Iâ€™ve liked the this girls on my robotics team for quite a while now and developed a bit of a crush on her. Weâ€™re in the same grade, and sheâ€™s really smart and nice. She has some issues but everyone does, weâ€™re human, not enough to make her awful tho. Her dad is a really great guy and I talk to him periodically. 

But, how does one simply work up the courage to like ask someone. Iâ€™m not an overly attractive guy, but Iâ€™ve picked up on hints and thereâ€™s a few (other) girls that I think like me. But i donâ€™t know about her. She like giggles a lot sometimes at my not-so-funny jokes. One may say Iâ€™m too young, but how? Do I wait or approach her or say nothing at all? 

Thank you,
Sincerely,
A lonely teenager that wants a bit of love
