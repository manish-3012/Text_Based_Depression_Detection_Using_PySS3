What do I say to someone that keeps saying â€œy u pressedâ€ all the time to someone that doesnâ€™t say anything out of anger or malicious intent? Thereâ€™s this one person who always says â€œy u pressedâ€ when somebody makes a statement or a good point during an argument on a discord server. They always act like the victim in every situation even when nobody said anything to them or in every story that may or may not be true. It annoys me and my friends not just in the discord server, but in real life too since we all know each other irl. When we defend ourselves by saying itâ€™s just a statement and we were just pointing something out they just reply with another version of â€œy u pressedâ€ and it ends there. What points can we make to make them stop saying it since it is quite frustrating to deal with?
