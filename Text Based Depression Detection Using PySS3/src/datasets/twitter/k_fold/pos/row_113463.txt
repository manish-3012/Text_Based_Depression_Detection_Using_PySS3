Is this cute or nah? So basically i have this idea for my girlfriend, im going to dedicate a notebook to write in every time we hang out. Im going to say what day it was, what we did, how i felt, what i was thinking, you know the whole shabang. Well for our 1 year im going to give it to her along with her favorite flowers and her favorite candy, i dont have a lot of money so i cant get her some big fancy gift but i thought this was cute and i want some feedback on it. Any ideas or revisions?
