I need gaming friends Hi, I am looking for new friends to play videogames with. I play in latin america and I am 14. My friends are fuckers who make me buy games that they later dont want to play. I play in PC (obviously) and can play a variety of games. Just want to try this and see if I can get a good person. Also, memes before sweat.
