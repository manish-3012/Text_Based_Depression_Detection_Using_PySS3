I hate everything I hate everything. I hate not being able to casually enjoy things without being quizzed on it. I hate my sister. I hate my school. I hate being talked over in class. I hate being ignored. I hate being lied to too. I hate living in this dumb house. I hate my dumb dad. I hate not being able to share my ideas. I hate my stupid voice and stutter. I hate being treated like a child. I hate having to do everything for everyone. I hate being raen advantage of. I hate being stupid. I hate being asked for my opinion just to be ignored. I hate people overstepping my boundaries. I hate being disrespected. I hate getting left on read. I hate getting ghosted. I hate being a girl. I hate knowing that others will base my worth on my appearance. I hate being judged. I hate getting made fun of. I hate everything. I hate not being able to convey my emotions properly. I hate having anxiety. I hate adhd. I hate the stupid fucking bababooey memes. I hate people who knock others down. I hate everything. I hate how incompetent, lazy and nosey my sister is. I hate how manipulative and creepy my dad is. I want to burn down this stupid house and jump into the ocean.
