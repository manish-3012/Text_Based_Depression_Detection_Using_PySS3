Rant about looks I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ugly but I personally donâ€™t find myself attractive. I also have good days and bad days and most days itâ€™s me being self conscious however I feel awful about myself. Iâ€™ve always been told I was pretty but I donâ€™t think people look at me right, itâ€™s hard to explain. My face is too big for my features and I think my eyes are too close together and my entire bottom half of my face is a mess I donâ€™t know how to rest my lips in a way that is attractive and I have a little chin dimple which I hate and I have a pretty weak chin. my side profile is horrible. Anytime I say anything about how I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m good looking my boyfriend always says says how beautiful I am and stuff like that which I obviously appreciate but sometimes I just want to rant and say what I donâ€™t like and I feel as if heâ€™s obliged to say that even if he didnâ€™t think I was. I just wish I could feel better about myself and watching girls my age who are gorgeous and modeling or celebrities it really puts me down and I donâ€™t rlly need any advice I just wanted to rant but if anyone does have any itâ€™d be appreciated!
