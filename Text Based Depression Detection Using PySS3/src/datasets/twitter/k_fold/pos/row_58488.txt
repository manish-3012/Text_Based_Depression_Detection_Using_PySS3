My girlfriend broke up with me She didnâ€™t even text me it, she sent someone to do it. My heart sunk down. It hurts, and to everyone that has been broken up with, I just want to say, donâ€™t say anything bad about her or too her. It hurts. Go talk to someone that can help you. You canâ€™t hang onto her. I hope this has helped someone, Iâ€™m here for you amazing people.
