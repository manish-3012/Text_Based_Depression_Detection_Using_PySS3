This be a post about relationships and crushes or whatever I'm seeing a lot of posts about people being sad about not being able to talk to X girl/boy because they're going to for sure hate them or something, and that their crush is too good for them or something. Please guys, listen to me. Finding people attractive and crushing on people are two different things. If you're crushing on people for the sole purpose of being attractive, try \*not\* to. 

**There are many different qualities that make up a person**, and appearance is something that people have little control over other than what makeup to put on and what clothes to wear. Falling in love with every single girl/boy that has pretty blue eyes is going to leave you sad and depressed because there is a large amount of people with blue eyes and a large amount of people in that group are not going to like you. Recognizing that "oh hey, that person is cute as hell" is a lot more healthy than thinking "I want to spend every waking moment with this person because their freckles make me implode." 

**Also, stop having such little amounts of confidence in yourself.** I know it's easier said than done, but say you really like this person and it goes deeper than appearance. You have the same hobbies maybe, or maybe her bubbly personality is wooing you over, or maybe he's a really kind dude. You think, maybe you'd hit it off super well, but wait, I don't have any friends and I suck at everything and I-

***PLEASE stop thinking like that, especially when you haven't even TRIED talking to this person****.* 

I get that confidence is acquire sometimes, but **don't just cancel any means of anything ever happening just because you're too scared to talk to them or have such little confidence in yourself**. A lot of people have shitty confidence in themselves, hell, *I have shitty confidence in myself sometimes*. But from being myself and acting myself, which is something anyone can do, I've been able to meet some cool people and yes, have even dated some of them. 

Acting like yourself only going to attract people similar to you. Who cares about the people who aren't going to talk to you? If you're a buff jock, you're gonna attract people who like that or are similar to you and dissuade groups like avid book-readers from wanting to talk to you. If you're really into anime, you're going to attract other people who like that anime and related mediums while maybe dissuade those aforementioned jocks from wanting to talk to you. ***OR WHO KNOWS, SOMETIMES EVERYONE CAN JUST LIKE EACHOTHER AND COEXIST :DDDD***

And one last comment**, don't immediately go for a relationship. Be their friend** ***first*****.** People like to divide friendship and relationships into two different groups, but in reality, relationships are just elevated friendships. You're only going to want to date someone you can be really good friends with. Not only is this a healthier relationship to be in, but it's more likely to last since you're only dating people you click well with rather than someone you just met. You're not going to know the bad parts with someone you're not close with, and the person you spent liking for the past month could have been a total dickbag without you even knowing. 

**TL:DR**: Moral of the story is, don't form heavy crushes on people you only find attractive, give yourself a chance, be yourself, and don't jump straight from stranger-hood into relationships.
