Is it selfish to value yourself over everybody else? I used to be a crowd pleaser, then I got more assertive. Now Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m too selfish. I get being kind and all of that, but I just donâ€™t see the point of it. It makes everyone feel good, but at the end of the day it will get you nowhere unless you help some super mega rich dude
