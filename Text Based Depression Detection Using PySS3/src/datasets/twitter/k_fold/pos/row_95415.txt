u/Thesavagepotato06 was told that reporting to the police, reporting the user to Reddit, and contacting the mods r/reddit.com could help

Lonely boy was banned also. u/Thesavagepotato06 can make a new account. I don't see how she should be unbanned because she broke a rule. This happened to an account with the named Glittering in it. She/he said a person was a nazi and homophobic and she/he gave out his name. She/he was banned but people weren't saying she should be unbanned. Do the mods support Nazism for banning or removing he/his post. HELL NO. Do the mods support pedophilia for what happened now. HELL NO. u/Thesavagepotato06 broke a rule and lonelyboy broke a rule. They were both banned. Now they need to handle it on their own.
