I hate myself sometimes Everyday Iâ€™m on Snapchat and I see many stories of couples together with the same bullshit like â€œomg 4 months everything is so great with youâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â€ I really feel envy about those guys because they are all attractive and probably have decent social lives while Iâ€™m at least a 3/10 and do nothing but play on the PC and pet my dogs which are the only things that keep me somewhat happy. Why couldnâ€™t I be that good looking and be less of a recluse. I hate how everyday is the same. Nothing excites me anymore. 


I just wanna hug goddamit thatâ€™s all I ask for.
