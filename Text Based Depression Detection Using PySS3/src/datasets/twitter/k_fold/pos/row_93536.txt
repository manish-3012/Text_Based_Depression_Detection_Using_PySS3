I'm going to delete this in a while. Just need to clear my thoughts. Is it wrong to become so attached to someone that you feel physical pain when they leave? That you feel like you're missing a part of you and you need to somehow fill that part again but you don't know how and now it feels like you're a pathetic leech hanging onto people that you hope will make you feel better but after they leave the pain is worse than before? What's wrong with me? I can't take this anymore. I feel like I'm going to implode and just wreak havoc on everything and it's killing me. I hate this so much. What's wrong with me? Get. Yourself. Together.
