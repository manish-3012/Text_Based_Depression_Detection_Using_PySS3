Big Sad Hello, I donâ€™t really post here on reddit but I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to since all my friends are busy and I shouldnâ€™t even bother them with bullsheights in the first place.

Iâ€™ve been avoiding one thing that I loved because it has caused emotional shenanigans in me and that is reading Manga/Manhwa or idk what you call those. Reading stories used to be fun and exciting for me but as the years went on, itâ€™s starting to mess with my emotional state. I mostly read BL because I am a smol closeted boi and Iâ€™ve always wondered what itâ€™s like to have a relationship as two guys. Some ends with happy endings but most would end in a very tragic way and whenever I read a new story, I cannot seem to go past the conflict part of the story and would just stopped reading altogether.

It feels like a dumb bitch move to avoid it but the motto â€œface your fears/problemsâ€ only made things worse as Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression since I stepped foot on this world. The last Anime Iâ€™ve seen was â€œGivenâ€ and I didnâ€™t know this one has a sad story and I thought watching BL Anime would give my little gay heart a bit of happiness but oh boy did I thought wrong. At that point, I legit cried after years of not being able to do so.

I donâ€™t even know what this post is all about tbh. I just want to express a portion of my feelings since itâ€™s starting to get hard bottling them up.

Seeing all posts about getting a partner or even just talking about yall crushes,, they make me in awe, like you guys are really out here feeling all that â€œbutterflies in your stomachâ€. But for some reason, it also makes me sad, in a way that I donâ€™t think I am capable of those things. Considering how I cannot look at conflicts in stories, how much more if it were in real life.

And I know that maybe â€œi am not readyâ€ but this has been going on for years and the thought that it could still go on makes me even more sad. Itâ€™s like a cycle or something, i dunno im dumb as hell. I can tell my friends are tired of hearing/seeing me talk about this thing. Honestly idek what the hell I am talking rn if you made it this far, sorry for wasting your time. 

Hope you have an amazing day and life, stranger.
