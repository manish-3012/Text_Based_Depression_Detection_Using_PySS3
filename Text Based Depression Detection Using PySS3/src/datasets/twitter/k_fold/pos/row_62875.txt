Is anybody here good at drawing? If so, can someone draw something for me? I'm terrible at drawing, so that's why I won't draw it myself. 

it's fine if nobody wants to do it, but I would appreciate it if someone did.

the thing I want drawn is eight feet tall, it has 8 legs like a spider, a neck like a giraffe, a head like a mushroom, skin and eyes like a crocodile, very sharp teeth, and a body (like the torso area, obviously.) like a horse.

I know, I know! that's quite the list of features I want for this creature, but I really want a picture of it, and obviously they aren't real, soooo...yeah...I also want it to look like it has some sand on it's body.

(I totally understand if nobody wants to do it, I mean, I'm not paying anyone or anything, but yeah...I'm sorry! if I had money to give to someone, then I would.)
