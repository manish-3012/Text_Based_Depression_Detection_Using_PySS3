Iâ€™m watching this one criminal minds episode So thereâ€™s this woman stuck in this giant facility and had to find her way out before this guy kills her, and I really hope my hunch on who this guy is is correct, but sheâ€™s found her way to the kill room so she knows sheâ€™s in a slaughterhouse and she just RUNS AWAY. LIKE DUDE, IF THERES A KILL ROOM IT MEANS THE CATTLE NEED TO GET IN SOMEHOW. You could just follow the path that brought the cattle in and you could escape in like ten minutes tops. At least itâ€™s a better idea than wandering the halls aimlessly. Anyways, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve needed to get off my chest, this lady is being so dumb rn and now sheâ€™s getting chased by a dog for it.
