Itâ€™s my birthday! Time to change flair

Not that exciting, I got two shirts and some candy lol. But thatâ€™s what happens when you donâ€™t wish for anything. The shirts were really nice though.

I did have a good day yesterday so that kind of makes up for today if nothing ends up happening.

My parents woke me up early so they could sing for me, so Iâ€™mma sleep for a little bit longer
