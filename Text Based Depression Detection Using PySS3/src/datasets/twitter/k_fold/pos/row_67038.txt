Science fair So I'm in 11th grade IB chemistry, and we are required to participate in the science fair. I've looked through so many websites for ideas, but nothing has interested me very much, and the few things that seemed interesting are either too simple (like 5th grade) or have been rejected. I'm really done trying to come up with something. Do any of you have any suggestions of potential projects or websites I can go to? I've tried ScienceBuddies, education.com, thoughtco.com, and I think a few others. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
