Me and this girl have been in the talking stage for about a month and sheâ€™s coming over to my house today to hang out Problem is, I have no clue what tf to do, Iâ€™ve been hella antisocial my whole life and I donâ€™t know wtf people even do when they hang out, could anyone help and recommend some activities to help get rid of that awkwardness?
