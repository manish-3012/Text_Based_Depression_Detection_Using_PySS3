Talk to me guys... I'm tired,exhausted,anxious,fairly depressed.

Any joy i get quickly dies off.

I'm trying my best to hold everything together,but the stress of Exams and tests are just killing me on the insides, plus,my parents are expecting high standards from the first exam and i feel like i fucked up really badly.

This is the only place i can really vent without being judged.I need your help.
