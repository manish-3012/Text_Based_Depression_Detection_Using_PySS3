How do I tell a guy I donâ€™t like him romantically I know this guy has a crush on me, and heâ€™s a great guy donâ€™t get me wrong, heâ€™s an amazing friend. I just donâ€™t see him romantically.  Especially because it would be long distance and I am a very touchy and cuddly person. 

I want to still be friends with him but I donâ€™t want to make things awkward if he does ask me out directly.
