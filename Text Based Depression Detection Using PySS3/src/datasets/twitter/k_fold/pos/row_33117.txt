I need some advice I've already asked two other times but I need some real advice. I've had a crush on a friend for a while now and I think she might like me back, but I'm way two nervous and I'm afraid that if I confess and she doesn't feel the same way, we could lose our friendship and I really don't want that to happen. Please help me.
