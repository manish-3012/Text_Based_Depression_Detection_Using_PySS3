My issue with this girls armpits. First of all, no, I donâ€™t mind the girlsâ€™ armpits, she chooses to not shave them. She can do what she wants with her body as long as its not directly negatively effecting someone. My issue is, we do competitive dance, shes in all of my classes (14 hours a week) and she doesnâ€™t wear deodorant. 

I promise im not attacking her personally, shes really really nice and sweet but after 4 hours in one day, by the second hour the room stinks of her BO. The stench is really really strong as shes never worn deodorant I donâ€™t think, and iâ€™m sure she showers everyday so i donâ€™t think its from poor hygiene. 

Everybody complains about it, not to her face because thats rude. I donâ€™t complain bc shes my friend, but it makes me physically ill when we dance for a couple of hours at a time. Were all 13 year old girls, and we have deodorant free to use at the studio so theres literally no reason why she wouldnâ€™t wear it. 

I asked you guys because this feels like the sub that can give me good advice and i donâ€™t know if its my place to say anything or not.
