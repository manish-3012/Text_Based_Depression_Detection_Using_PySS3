A horrible week It all started with me getting into an accident which didn't wreck me or the car, but it isn't registered in my name. So the insurance company fucked me over untill my dad gets a legal paper allowing me to continue with the procedures.

Then, I got an influenza level illness for a few days, which I thought was COVID. Idk, it might have been. But I isolated myself and knew it would be fine after a few days. 

After one healthy day, I thought everything was fine. I went out to do some delivery work w/ my brother because we needed the money. You see, to make any profit on this delivery app you will have to drive from noon till midnight, without any ac (to save some gas money) to only make the equivalent of 10$-15$. But we needed the money to support our family, so we worked anyway. And guess who got a fucking heatstroke! Yep, yours truly. So my family started treating me a little bit shity since I couldn't do anything.

I talk to you today after my legs have gone numb a few times from sitting on the toilet. I have constipation and a sore pelvic floor (anus and urethra) from sitting (in the car) for too long without moving. I took a laxitive a few hours ago which didn't work, because I haven't eaten anything for two days. And when I dared eat a cheese sandwich, I fucking got heartburn.

Oh did I mention the high, nausea inducing fever? The one where you just feel cold and weak? No? Ok good. It's 4:50 am right now and I cant sleep from the pain and headaches. On a good note, my dad finally finished that legal document (the car is registered in his name and he is abroad right now), and he told me to go and deal with everything tomorrow. He suck my balls till I'm fine.

In case anyone reading this is wondering, I'm almost 19.
