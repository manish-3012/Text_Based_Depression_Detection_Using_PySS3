(OC) This is what it's like for me... (a poem I made) I have depression and ADHD I've been nothing but a failure

all day long

my soul feels defeated

like it has been stepped on

&amp;#x200B;

and the person stepping on it

hasn't gotten off

I'm stuck to the ground

where my life belongs

&amp;#x200B;

cause I'm too meaningless

to be someone important

I'm too weak

to feel a sense of worthfulness

&amp;#x200B;

I just take up space

and air and breath and food

I waste my parent's money

but this is nothing new

&amp;#x200B;

they tell me that they love me

and it doesn't mean a thing

to spend money on their daughter

but still, I amount to nothing

&amp;#x200B;

I hear the whispers across the room

I know they're talking about me

and how I'm always alone

and a so-called "wanna be"

&amp;#x200B;

make fun of my chipped nail polish

I haven't had the energy to remove from my fingers

&amp;#x200B;

have the teacher assign me to a group

when no one wants to work with me

&amp;#x200B;

am I really that bad?

I silently think

as the tears begin to form

and my soul begins to shrink

&amp;#x200B;

the next class I had was math

I feel so stupid in that class

I don't do the homework

and pray to God somehow I'll pass

&amp;#x200B;

ignore all the lessons

start to fall behind

every thought is a distraction

it's like a prison in my mind

&amp;#x200B;

I was watching a movie last night

but then I had to go to bed

woke up forgetting everything

the characters said

&amp;#x200B;

"you saw this just yesterday,

how come you forgot?"

it's a simple question for you to ask

when it's easy to keep track of your thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

sorry, today sucked... everything in the poem is true about me. i watched a movie yesterday and the next day i resume it where I left off and forgot the first half of the movie i watched... I have depression, ADHD, and a little bit of anxiety too... this was just something i put together in like 10 minutes.
