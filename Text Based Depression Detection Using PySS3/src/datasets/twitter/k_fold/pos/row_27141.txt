Whatâ€™re yâ€™allâ€™s definitions of uwu and bruh girls? Personally, I call myself a â€œbruwuâ€ girl cause I switch depending on the situation and who Iâ€™m talking to, plus some other reasons. Iâ€™m just curious about which category I would fall under for random strangers. Have a good day/night yâ€™all &lt;3
