Why tf can't these females just let me chill in peace? So, my mom and my two other sisters decided that it would be a hehe haha funny moment if they tricked me into going into a room that one of them had farted in. They wanted me to see if there was a "temp difference" between my room and my mom's. So, I get up from playing some halo, unlock my door ask what they want, and comply with them. I should have seen the bullshit coming, but I didn't. Im honestly pissed off at this point and it's a wonder I didn't strike one of them in the face. I'm tired of this goofy shit.
