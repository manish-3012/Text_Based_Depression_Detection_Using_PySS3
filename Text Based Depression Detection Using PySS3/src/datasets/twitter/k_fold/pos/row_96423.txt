1st world problems mini rant all my headphones break after like a month. 
literally every single pair, no matter how hard i take care of them. 

i even saved up for some beats and they broke after 2 months too. now i got some wireless earbuds that ive got for like a month and a half, and now theyre broken too. like a third of the money ive ever made (not that much but yk) has probably gone to headphones. 

wtf
