Yo, I think we all understand there is a lot of bad going on with the police rn. So, if you truly want to see change, if you truly want things to be more just, take things into your own hands. Go become an officer after highschool.  It's "that easy" isn't it? So, if you seek change, go make that change happen. After all, we're the next generation. We'll be running the world soon enough.
