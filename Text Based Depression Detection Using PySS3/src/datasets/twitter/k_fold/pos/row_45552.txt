Iâ€™ve wasted hours of my life for nothing Today in my school we received our grades, mine were pretty good but mediocre, having failed one. Not only am I angry that some teachers have given me worse grades than I deserved because they hate me, but it means that all the hours I have genuinely spent studying and putting effort in have been for nothing, all those afternoons for nothing, weekends lost... for nothing. But maybe youâ€™re asking yourself: hey, at least you have passed the majority of your classes, and although thatâ€™s true, my parents donâ€™t seem to understand that I worked my ass off on this trimester and that I have decent grades. My parents are like the Asian parent stereotype, but European.
