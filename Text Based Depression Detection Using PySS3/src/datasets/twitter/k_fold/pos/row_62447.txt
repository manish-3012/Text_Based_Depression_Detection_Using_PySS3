Am I overthinking this whole thing? so I've been close friends with this girl for like over 5 years, anything bad that happens to her i'm always there for her, stuck by her through thick and thin, listened to her vents and tried to help her, and today she posted a friend appreciation post with our friend group, but I was not mentioned, but every other girl that we were close with were mentioned. she tells me all the time that we are the closest to each other of the friend group, since we talk more to each other than the rest. so when she forgot to add my name I felt kind of left out? because after all that my name didn't slip her mind, after everything. i barely get any appreciation from anyone, so when my name wasn't listed I felt sad. then it got me thinking if I was really important to her, or was I just there for her convenience. lately I haven't been feeling my best either so that kind of sent me over the edge too. am I overthinking it and it's nothing to worry about ?
