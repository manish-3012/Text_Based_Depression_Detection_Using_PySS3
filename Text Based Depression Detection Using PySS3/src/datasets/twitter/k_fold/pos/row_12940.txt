I'm sorry, Mom... For not being as successful as our neighbor's kid nextdoor, who apparently makes 100k a year, has HIS college paying for HIS tuition, MULTIPLE scholarships, is a WORLD FAMOUS doctor, lawyer and actor, the CEO of a big buisness, and runs a non-profit.

Not surprisingly, he has also found the cure for cancer, has had contact with aliens and now is the future ruler of Mars and a galatic warlord.

But for some REALLY ODD reason, still lives with his parents and me and him play videogames together. 

Also... hes like 24

Please dont compare me to older and more successful people, Mom...
