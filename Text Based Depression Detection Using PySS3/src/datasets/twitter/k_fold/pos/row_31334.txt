Whatâ€™s up with people on this sub not knowing how to fight back I see all these post about how someone is bullying another and I just donâ€™t get it. Do you guys not know the phrase â€œfuck offâ€? Itâ€™s so simple and works every time, I just donâ€™t get why people canâ€™t say anything back without feeling bad. Like what? Theyâ€™re being mean to you. Itâ€™s completely justifiable to burn the shit out of them and walk away. Thanks for listening. (Iâ€™m not insulting people who canâ€™t fight back, Iâ€™m just asking a question)
