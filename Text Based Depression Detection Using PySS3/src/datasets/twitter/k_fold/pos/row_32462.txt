So my parents are absolutely mad So today is Friday, meaning I can game again, as my dad doesn't let me during the week  because he thinks I have to much work for school.


I was just minding my own business, playing Minecraft with the Bois, and I started laughing, not like screaming, just normal laughing. I then get a call from my dad, as I'm on the second floor it's easier to just call instead of going upstairs. I pick it up and he's like: "yo, stop screaming". Me who does have a heavier voice, thought that i was talking to loud or something, as I get this quite often, so I turned down the volume on my headphones and continued playing. 

3h later..

The Bois and me are still having fun, now cracking some jokes, and obviously me starts laughing again, just seconds after me laughing I get a call AGAIN, I already knew it was him as he likes to call EVERY FUCKING TIME HE HEARS SOMETHING. I tell the Bois goodbye as this happend before and I knew I wasn't gonna be online any time soon, I pick up the phone and he's like: "Yo, why u screaming, stop, or no more gaming, besides, it's late, go to sleep!" So I turned off the Xbox and went downstairs, expecting an entire damn story..

I enter the living room and of course, he yells like a fucking bear "I HEARD U AGAIN, NO MORE GAMING. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, I CAN..." I just let him talk, without actually paying any attention to what he says as he loves to do this, he then tells me that I can't game any more

So here I am, after a long exhausting week, thinking I could let off some steam by gaming, NO, because laughing is illegal and if U hear me fucking breathe I'm being "loud". This is the third time he's done this in less than a month.

Sorry for torturing u with this bombshell of a tekst, but I'm very mad and upset with the way he does this.

Thanks for reading!
