So I got a CT Scan This day was normal, I was in living room and decided to sit on the couch. I sit on the couch but I hit my head on the wall so hard becauze couch was so near to wall and I was a stupid bitch. Anyways I started crying, it hurted like hell. Ten mins later things got worse, I felt like I was gonna pass out. My ears, my head felt weird. Then we jumped to taxi and went to hospital. Doctor checked me and I was alright. But to be sure I wanted to get CT Scan, why not we have health insurance,lol free stuff. CT Scan is weird shit. You lay on something and it enters to a circular thing. Thats what she said. Anyways I went in  then got the results... I was alright but doctor said I might have metabolic illness... I had a bruh moment there. But then he said it might be normal thing so idk, also doctor was super cute lol. I can feel radiation in my bones btw, might glow in dark idk 

Lessons learned, never sit on couch.
