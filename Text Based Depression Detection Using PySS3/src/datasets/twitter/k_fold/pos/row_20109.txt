Should i tell my parents about my drug use? This question has been bothering me for a few nights while i try to sleep. I recently got caught using snus and i think that is what triggered my thoughts. I seriously think I need help not with stopping but with recovering and my suicidal thoughts.

So a bit of back story:
I started using drugs at 14. I did a lot of them for example i abused mdma(ecstasy) beyond any "reasonable" limit(11grams in a year to be exact and the max "safe" amount is 1g per year) i have been clean from ecstasy for almost a year now but i still feel shit.

I don't know how they would me telling them and i can't really take adversities well or i feel like i want to kill myself :/ so should i tell them?
