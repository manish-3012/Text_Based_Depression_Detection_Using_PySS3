what is your waifu? My waifu is the portuguese former prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, the most based man to ever live. Let me tell you a few things he did that make him very based. He wanted to privatize ðŸ”’ the Portuguese Air Transports (TAP), now the socialist âš’ government want to make it public!! He was harsh on the politics of austerity but they were needed so the country move forward, now the government gives money ðŸ’µðŸ’µ to m\*norities!!! ðŸ¤®He was the most right-wing president of the social democratic partyðŸ”¶ He would talk well in the parliament and actually won te elections in 2015, not the socialists ðŸ¤®with their geringonÃ§a. pic of him is my profile pic, sexy ikr! ðŸ˜
