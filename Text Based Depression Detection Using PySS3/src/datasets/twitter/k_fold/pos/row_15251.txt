Am I overthinking this??? 

Just today when I was playing a game online, someone who I was playing with for a while called me their friend while talking to someone else, and it made me super happy

I have this stupid mentality where I don't feel safe to call someone my friend, because they might think that I'm not a friend, just a person they talk to, and they'll distance themself from me just because I called them a friend.

but idk what to do because I now know that it feels really good to be called a friend, but then again they might think I'm not their friend

Simplified version:

What I think'll happen: 
friend lvl-3/10
 *I call them a friend* 
friend lvl-0/10

What I want to happen:
 friend lvl-3/10
 *I call them a friend* 
friend lvl-6/10

thanks any replies would be greatly appreciated :D
