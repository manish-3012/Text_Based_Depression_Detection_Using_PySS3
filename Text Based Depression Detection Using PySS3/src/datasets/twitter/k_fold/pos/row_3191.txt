My teacher's question has triggered a hilarious flashback memory I just got off my online class. My teacher asked us what would we do in order to relieve our stress? I answered that same question when I was in the 10th grade a few years ago.

Mind you I'm deaf and I had an ASL interpreter with me. My classmates replied such as hanging out with friends, playing soccer, or playing video gaming. I told my interpreter to voice "masturbation" and he was like hell no! Then I raised my hand for my teacher to pick me. I stood up and made masturbating gesture (it was same in ASL anyways). My interpreter was like -\_\_\_\_\_- \*voiced masturbation\* and then he whispered to himself saying "oh God please kill me".

My classroom blew up laughing hard, so we had a few teachers coming over to our room to tell us to shut up. LOL!
