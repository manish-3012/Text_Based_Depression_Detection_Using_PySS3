I've been thinking about asking out my crush should I do it? My crush and I have been talkin for like, a while now. Like I'd say about 2 or 3 weeks but we've gotten pretty close and I'm getting vibes that she likes me back. I've been thinking about asking her but I'm also going back to virtual school after this semester...
So like, I'm usually not very good at this type of decision making so like, should I ask her out?
Oh yeah, I'm like 14 so I can't really like drive to her house cus she lives kinda far away.
