Casual discrimination may be a good thing 
Of course all the BLM and LGBTQ movements are valid and whatnot.

Things like â€œbro are you gay or what???â€ May be beneficial. It helps build up tolerance and people who be less touchy and whatnot. It can also form some sort of a collective mindset as people are comfortable with joking about oneâ€™s race/religion/sexuality. This may lessen the impact of actual slurs. It also help drive away racist movements and whatnot since it is a harsh love sort of acceptance towards a community. Obviously there must be a mutual consent and understanding so that people who are conscious about their differences donâ€™t get hurt or take it as a personal attack. Iâ€™m thinking of this solution being somewhat similar to how people make dark jokes about suicide and depression/anxiety to help feel better or have a laugh about it. For example, my friends and I often laugh about how asians are supposed to be smart but really we are both really dumb WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENCE CUZ APPARENTLY GOD CREATED THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NOW IM GRADED ON IT. WHAT THE FUCK MAN.

Obviously slurs such as the n-words or f*got should be of the table especially in this very tense global situation(when it comes to gay rights and racial equality) and should only be used by the respective communities if they want to â€œtake backâ€ the slur or show that they are not affected by it anymore. 

I do recognise that it may just backfire or be an excuse for people to insult another community. But Iâ€™m also saying that it might work and help build resistance against prejudice/descrimination. However I am interested in what other people thoughts and opinions are.
