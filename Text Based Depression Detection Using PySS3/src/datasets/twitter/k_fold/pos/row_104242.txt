my mum is now cheating on my dad; i just wish theyâ€™d get divorced already my mum just got a new boyfriend. 
my parents donâ€™t live together. 
but still; my mum is married to my dad, who also happens to be a drug addict. but that doesnâ€™t justify her cheating on him. 
i just wish theyâ€™d get divorced. im feeling horrible mentally and this doesnâ€™t make it any better. fml
