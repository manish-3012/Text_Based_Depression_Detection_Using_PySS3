I just wanna end this crush, I need advise please Iâ€™ve got a crush on this girl, who I barely know and is new to our school so Iâ€™ve only seen her online. Iâ€™m not sure why I have a crush on her, Iâ€™ve never felt this way about anyone who I barely know. We had a couple awkward convos in zoom meetings, and i DMâ€™d her on Instagram and we had a brief awkward convo ending with her hearting my last message and the convo ending.



I donâ€™t wanna just say â€œI like youâ€ cause I donâ€™t wanna throw my chances away like that. But I hate having feelings for her and not being able to do anything about it, is there anything I can do?
