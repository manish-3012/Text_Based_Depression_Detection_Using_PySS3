Iâ€™ve never felt this rage before So thereâ€™s this kid. Complete prick to me and 
my friend. Funny thing is that we used to be friends before I didnâ€™t give him his way in the MC Realm. (long ass story. If ur interested in it Iâ€™ll PM it. Or make another post)  Anyway. We were in an esports team right before covid and he was attempting to be team captain. And Iâ€™m pretty sure if he makes it on to the team he will get that role. And Iâ€™m afraid that he is going to try to fuck me over if he does get it. Or worse fuck over my friends. God damnit I am going to punch him if he tryâ€™s to fuck her over. Because she is actually knows about his BS. And she is starting to not hang out with him anymore cause of it. Which is good for her. The thing that pisses me off the most is that he talks to all of the other esports kids about me behind my back. And he hosts 90% of events and actively tryâ€™s to not include me or my friend refraction. (wonâ€™t give real name cause duh) Heâ€™s impacted me so much to the point if I see a Link main (his main) I think of him and get super pissed off. If tries to anything to me while Iâ€™m at school I might actually punch him. 

Oh yea, dumb question is this semi normal or do I have a problem.
