Since you were so kind last time; here is another poll for ya! Giving awards to helpful answers. I would love to hear your answers to these two questions:  


1: How often do you watch YouTube

and

2: How often do you listen to podcasts?  


If you want to be super helpful I have some bonus questions:

a: Would you prefer to watch a storytime show on YouTube or listen to it as a podcast?

b: How long should a youtube storytime video be, and how many episodes should come out each week?

c: How long shoulda podcast storytime episode be and how many should come out each week?  


This would all help us so much. Thank you for your time!
