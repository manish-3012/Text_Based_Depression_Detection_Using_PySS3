I thought it was a myth but it worked!! Iâ€™ve heard a few times from the internet that pirates wore eye patches to switch between light and dark. I thought it was clickbait garbage but it actually works!

I tried it (on accident) and it was freaking me out. So what I did was I was laying on my bed looking at my phone. My head was on my pillow and my left eye was completed covered by the pillow, so I was only looking with my right eye. I was like this for 30 minutes to an hour. Then I decided to fall asleep, so I got up to plug in my phone across the room and turn off the light. 

When I got up, my left eye (the one that was covered) hurt. I closed my left eye and had normal vision. But I opened my left eye and closed my right, everything was way too bright and blurry. I just kept my left eye shut until I turned off the light. 

Everything was totally dark and I couldnâ€™t see anything. But when I opened my left eye, my vison got crazy. I closed my right eye. I could see in the dark!! When I only had my right eye open, I couldnâ€™t see anything at all. I was freaking out and was worried I had gone blind in that eye! It took over 15 minutes for my right eye to adjust to the dark. 

So thatâ€™s why pirates used eyepatches I guess (if they even did). You lose your depth perception, but having the superpower to not need candles and to just be able to see in the dark instead mightâ€™ve totally been worth it.
