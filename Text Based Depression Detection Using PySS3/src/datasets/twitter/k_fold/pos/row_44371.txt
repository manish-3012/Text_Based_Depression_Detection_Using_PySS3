How do I deal with a weird Teacher? I am a freshman at a Catholic school, I am taking honors religion and my teacher is super weird. She talks weird, uses a fake accent and just is plain out weird. I am failing class with a D+ and need to get my grade up, but she is super weird and the course itself is so confusing. Any help or tips?
