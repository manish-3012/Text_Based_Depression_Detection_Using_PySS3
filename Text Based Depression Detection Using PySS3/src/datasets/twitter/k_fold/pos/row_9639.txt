Pretty sure my college website is gonna mess my education up. I had to confirm my place at college for next year and it kept crashing... so. Whether it actually worked or not? Donâ€™t know, but if it didnâ€™t work and Iâ€™m not on any course next year Iâ€™ll be annoyed. Seriously itâ€™s stressing me out just thinking about it since they said Iâ€™d get a timetable by mid August and thatâ€™s approaching fast.
