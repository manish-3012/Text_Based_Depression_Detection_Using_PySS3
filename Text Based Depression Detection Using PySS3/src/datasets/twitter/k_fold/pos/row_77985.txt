Do you ever feel like you have a social life when youâ€™re at school, but when youâ€™re home and alone you realize how nonexistent it actually is? When Iâ€™m at school I feel like I have friends who I can talk to and itâ€™s very cool, but when I get home or itâ€™s the weekend, I realize that no one texts or calls me or just speaks to me in general.
