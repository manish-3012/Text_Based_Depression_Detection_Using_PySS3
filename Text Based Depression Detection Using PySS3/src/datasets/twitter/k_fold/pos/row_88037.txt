I am failing a class for the first time Online school sucks, it does. I have always been a high B to A student, yet have been seeing my grades slip as of recent. I have a D in math now, which this is a dual credit college class. I am scared that when I graduate I wont be able to go where I want for school. Hell, I probably wont even walk due to covid. Mentally, I have been destroyed lately and these grades arent helping. I did alot to study for this too, yet I know for a fact I fucked the test I just took. I am genuinely terrified that all my work this year will be for nothing in the end. 


Sorry for the rant. I at least needed to type it.
