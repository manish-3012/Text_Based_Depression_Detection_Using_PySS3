I just want to kill myself... so, its like 2 am, im turning off my pc after I rewrote 20 both sided A4 pages to my notebook, my hand and wrist is numb, my head is pulsating, my back is cracking every time I move, and I so fucking dehydrated I feel like spongebob in the episode where he screams ,,I need it,,. And im just thinking, I have to wake up in 4 hours, write another 5 both sided A4 pages, take my bike and go as fast as I fucking can because my professor is and asshole and he is at school till 8:30 am, give him my notes I wrote, come back and then I can have a quick breakfast before E-classes... And I do this every... fucking...day, every week, every month for the last semester. Oh, and as a 16 year old I also have to work in my dad's company as a ,,bring me (something) kid,, I want to just end myself but mom would be sad, sister too, my precious doggy too, dunno about my dad, probably too but not that much. I do not know if I have strength to continue doing like this.
