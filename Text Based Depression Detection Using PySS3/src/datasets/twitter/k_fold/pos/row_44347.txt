Guys my teacher is literally giving out 100s I'm fully online (no zoom or anything) and my one teacher  is just giving out 100s. My friend literally submitted every assignment completely blank and got a 100 in the class. I decided to try it for myself so I submitted one blank, and sure enough I got a 100. I'm super behind so should I just submit every assignment blank? Do half &amp; submit half blank? Do all the work? Lmk. Also, couldn't he get like fired for not even looking &amp; just putting in perfect scores?
