Reasons to stay behind for that friend who ties his shoelace So one time the squad and I were walking and my friend had to tie his shoelace. I stood behind to wait as the others went on. He had some trouble so by the time he was done they were ahead by half of a block. While alone we actually got into some deep conversations and he started venting to me about some really messed up stuff in his home life. I was able to give him some advice it really helped him. Afterwards a few months later he thanked me about how much it helped and bought me some chicken nuggets. 

Moral of the story, stay behind for that kid who needs to tie his shoelace you can get chicken nuggets for it
