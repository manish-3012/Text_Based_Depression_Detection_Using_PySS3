I- well hello again people of r/tenagers Well hello again, tis me. Your lovely friend ranting death god

What happened? It wasn't todat, but yesterday.

You see, I hadn't slept for about 3 days untill yesterday, and I was kinda tired, so I fell asleep. You know what, skip this shit. My mom basically beat me yesterday to wake me up from my sluber of grief. Moving on, I was supposed to clean my room, but ehehheh I fell asleep.  So when she woke me up, I said "But its clean!" And no matter, it wasnt to her. So what I am getting at is nothing I ever do is right. While I think something looks ok, it always needs work or some shit. Like, excuse me for not being able to see things in the right judgment? Its not like I was ever taught how to see things in a proper judgment? Like you cant get mad at me for not having a perfect judgement about shit I wasn't taught! Oh and also, my mom, she found out how I get rid of the hornies, and what I look at to help.. And she is super, super religous. So yeah, I may not have a dick after this. Fun.
