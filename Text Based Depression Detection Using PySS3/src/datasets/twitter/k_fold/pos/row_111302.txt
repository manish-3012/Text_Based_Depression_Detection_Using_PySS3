My hormones are broken I don't want to get into a relationship, and I haven't been romantically interested in someone (non have I find anyone physically attractive)   since like 2017. I feel weird... I don't really have an urge to masturbate anymore.  Maybe I've grown outta awkward hormonal puberty phase but Iâ€™m just 16 (turning 17 later this year).... 
I donâ€™t know ... maybe Iâ€™m just built different or I havenâ€™t meeting people who are my type...  :/  I donâ€™t know
