There are so many discord servers but here's a pitch for mine I've just started a discord server with another friend and we're looking to expand the members! Its nothing crazy, its just a place for people to look for others that share the same interest! Everyone is welcomed!! Just leave a comment if interested, I'll send you the discord invite through DM!

If you end up not liking it, you're free to leave (hopefully not)

If you have any other questions you can also just reply to this and I'll give you an answer a

I look forward to seeing hopefully at least one or two of you :)
