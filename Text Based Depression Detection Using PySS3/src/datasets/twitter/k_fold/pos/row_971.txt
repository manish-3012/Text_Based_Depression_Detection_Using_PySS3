I am a little confused about my gender I am a 16 year old guy. I have always hated things like how i looked or my name, and. I thought this was just low self esteem and normal, but my friend bullied me into getting snapchat, and i was messing around with the filters, and i found all the make up ones. And i loved how they made me look. I posted about this to a different subreddit and i got really mixed answers, i was wondering if anyone could help me out here. I really don't know if this means anything, or if its totally normal for people my age to experience and means nothing.
