I fucked up I was in re, and my teacher asked a question, something like "if I'm about to do something bad, why doesn't god stop me?" And my dumbass said "because god isn't real, fat bitch". I had no clue that I was UNMUTED. I'm in year 10 and I've never been in trouble before, my crying teacher emailed my parents but I don't think she's seen it yet. I'm such an idiot. I have nothing against religion, and I'm not a bad person, just a stupid person
