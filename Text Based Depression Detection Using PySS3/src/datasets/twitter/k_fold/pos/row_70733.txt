Goodbye y'all, gonna jump Hello everyone, I'm a sad pizza pasta 14 years old.
As always, I apologize for bad english.

Hey, i know, that's not cool, I'm not even 100% sure, but i don't wanna live anymore. I actually have an easy life, without any sort of issue. I just wanna end it. I had only one wish, and it was a girl i would give my life for, but i lost any hope. She doesn't feel even a bit of what i feel for her. I promised myself to wait until I would finally manage to have her as my sweetheart, but it's not gonna happen. I'm 14, I'm stupid, I'm perfectly concious this is a terrible decision and maybe I wont have enough balls to actually jump, but I'm tired. I feel like a void can of beans, i have nothing left but sadness because I consumed myself to reach happiness, nothing but her could fill that void. 

Sono una testa di cazzo, ma ti ho amata come potevo, anche se non ricambiavi. Ti vorrÃ² sempre un mondo di bene, Francesca, per me l'importante Ã¨ che tu sia felice.
