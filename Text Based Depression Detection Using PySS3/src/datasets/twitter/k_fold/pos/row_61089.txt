Fact: Parents care more about 1 bad grade then 10 good grades I just got my English (mini test bs about shakespeare) results back and I got 67%. My parents have gone mental. No games no nothing no fun. Fucking great. And yet, when I get 3 97% in a row you just say good work and forget about it. Fuck you. OF course I'm not gonna have any motivation to learn. Plus its obvious the school focuses on people in class and online learners. I hate myself and I hate my parents. Time to go back to my fucking English teachers English labour camp.
