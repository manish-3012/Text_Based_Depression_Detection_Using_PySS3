I guess i can't be weird on this sub reddit :/ I feel comfortable being weird on here because it makes me different and well weird but i guess some people don't like it so.... Reddit is the only place i feel comfortable saying weird stuff like sexual stuff and feminine stuff, in real life i don't really get to show my weirdness because im afraid of laughter at me and being judged. I'll like to just keep posting weird stuff just to annoy those kind of people but i feel like something bad can happen. Awww oh well
