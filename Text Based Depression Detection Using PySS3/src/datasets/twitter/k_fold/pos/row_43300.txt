How do I get my mom to stop coming in my room? I swear she comes to check on me every couple of minutes. I have no lock on my door, she knocks once, then barges right in without me saying anything. Then she will walk all the way into my room and go to my bed and snoop all over my room. I have told her to stop so many times. She does it at whatever time, 3pm, 11pm, 2am I am sick of it. I ask her what she wants and have told her to stop, because she does it that much. My bed is loud and makes noise whenever I move on it, she came into my room just now and said "you make so many noises, is it gross teenager stuff" I don't even jerk off, ever. Im sick of it somebody pls help me
