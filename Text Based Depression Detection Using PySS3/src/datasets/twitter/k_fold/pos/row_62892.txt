What do I do? I'm in love with my best friend, she's in a relationship with another guy. I've liked her for like, 4 years, and I told her about it 2 years back, but I didn't really say everything I wanted to, and I was mostly like 'Sorry I like you' (dumb shit I know). The thing is, how do I move on? I've tried everything, from distancing myself, to finding reasons to hate her, but nothing seems to work. I cannot break this friendship cuz she's a really great friend of mine. Help please?
