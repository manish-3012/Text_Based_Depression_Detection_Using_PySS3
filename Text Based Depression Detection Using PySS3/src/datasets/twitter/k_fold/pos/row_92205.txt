Sleep isn't even sleep anymore. It's a way to escape from the reality we call life. Shit, I would be so happy to just have an interesting life for just five seconds instead of having panic attacks because i see police lights or hear something hit a wall. It's so hard. Sleep is avoided so that it takes longer for morning hell to arrive. It's a lose or lose situation. You end up in a world where there's no magic or dragons either way.
