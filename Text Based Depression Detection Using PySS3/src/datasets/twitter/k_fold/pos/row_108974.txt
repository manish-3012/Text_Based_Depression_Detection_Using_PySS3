for some reason i remembered one of the many spider-man cartoons i remember that this one ended with spider-man going to different universes or timelines and he gathers a lot of different spidermans that had slightly different abilities

i remember one was a cyborg that could shoot lasers, another one used web balls, one didn't have powers, one had spider legs that came out of his back and he also turned into a giant spider

that's all i remember from it

into the spider verse was nothing new ðŸ˜¤
