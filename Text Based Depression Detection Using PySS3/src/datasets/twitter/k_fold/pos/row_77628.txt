like uhhh i havent eaten in almost 36 hours. partly coz i was too depressed to get out of bed at all yesterday (&amp; tired coz i stayed up for 24 hours which is a whole different story) n partly coz im like hehe ..... me skinny .... so i wanna put off eatin as long as i can

&amp; when i do eat "regularly" theres ~12 hrs between meals

&amp;&amp; if someone else was doin the same thing i would be like please take care of urself:(( is there anythin i can do for u ? coz i recognize that its awful. but when i do it im like hehe yeah this is great stuff good job. the cognitive dissonance is unreal

this is just sooo normal for me n has been for a rly long time now. but i think if someone without any kinda mental health issues reads this theyre gonna be like. what the fuck thats insane get help

anyway i am considerin eatin coz ive been cravin tacos but itll probably take me a couple hours to get out of bed. &amp; im kinda dizzy wonder what thats about ðŸ™„
