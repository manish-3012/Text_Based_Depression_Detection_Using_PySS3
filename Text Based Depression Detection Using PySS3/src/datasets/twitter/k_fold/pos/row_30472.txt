participation points do you guys think participation points should take a huge chunk of your grade? i personally think they should just be easy points (kinda like extra credit) cause i hate speaking up and getting cold called on in class iâ€™d rather do my work quietly, pay attention, and listen. i donâ€™t get why teachers call on students who didnâ€™t raise their hand or volunteer expect them to know the answer to the questionÂ¿? but thatâ€™s just my opinion ofc
