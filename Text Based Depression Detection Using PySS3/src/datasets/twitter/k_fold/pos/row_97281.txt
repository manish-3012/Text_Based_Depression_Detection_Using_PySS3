I donâ€™t understand this.. Why is it hard for people to â€œcome outâ€. I understand that some people donâ€™t accept it but I just donâ€™t personally understand why thereâ€™s such a large amount of pressure put on people who arenâ€™t straight or who donâ€™t identify as the gender they were born with. 

Maybe thatâ€™s cause Iâ€™m straight and a guy..

But seriously, you are all loved and what you look like, who you are attracted to, what you call yourself, and who you associate with makes me think no less of you. You be you and if people fall away from you, they arenâ€™t the type of people to chase after anyways.

 If any of my friends came out, first off Iâ€™d be proud they could share and then nothing would change. I respect who they are, call them the pronouns they are, and move on. Ur still my buddy and that wonâ€™t change :)
