Need some advice. So recently a close female friend of mine, who we will call "E". She recently broke up with a long term boyfriend of 5 months, who we will call "J". Now I know from what "E" has told me that "J" was a terrible boyfriend, (her words) and the stuff he did was really dickish. Despite this she still went out with him, despite all of her friends urging her not to. Now E had, while dating J talked to me about her having doubts and that If they ever broke up she would want to date me again (we dated for a short period of time, like 2 months, before we had to break up due to exams, we both agreed on this, but now we both know exams aren't that difficult to juggle with personal life we wouldnt have an issue). 

She has also told one of her own close female friends that I was everything J wasn't. In a good way.

Now she ended up breaking up with him like a few days ago, she has yet to tell me what was the final straw, but she said she would tell me once she wasnt as sad.

I have no experience breaking up with someone under duress, all of my previous relationships have ended either with me getting broken up with, or us ending it amicably. So I'm not sure why she is feeling this way, any people who could shed a light on why, that would be greatly appreciated. 

So my main question is "How long would you guys have a guess at before I ask her out?"
