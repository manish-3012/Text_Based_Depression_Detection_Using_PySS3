Some show There was this show that me and my sister used to watch when we were little (wanna fund it for research purposes) it had 3 girls in it and they all had some super power that they activated through some jewellery. It was in a drawing style like the winks and was on netflix. I think one of girls name was  Talia and she had dark brown hair and tanned skin her jewellery was a bracelet and her colour was blue; the other has blonde hair and her colour was pink. The third girlâ€™s colour was orange and she had a weird rabbit looking pet.
I donâ€™t know why i wanna find this show but that is everything I remember
