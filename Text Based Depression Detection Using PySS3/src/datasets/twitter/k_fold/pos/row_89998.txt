Can someone please explain this to me Disclaimer: im not karmawhoring

Anyways, am 15M, pretty high 191cm (about 6'3), skinny 77kg (169lbs, nice). Ig i am smart cuz i go to the best school in the country, really dont want to bragg. I do talk with girls but none actually seem to be interested, never been in a relationship, never kissed, never been hugged.

Im not totally asocial, i like to talk to people. Oh and theres this picture of me:

I already got a post with this picture, but when i use the link here this post gets taken down for "karma whoring"

Why is life cruel :( 

Even if you got some good characteristics, that doesnt mean everything will be great.
