what is wrong with some people on here ? i try to make a positive post on here and somehow there will always be people who have a problem with me saying â€œi hope youâ€™ve had a good day todayâ€ or me wanting people to know that â€œiâ€™m glad youâ€™re aliveâ€ like seriously ? iâ€™m just trying to let people know that theyâ€™re not alone and i want to make sure that theyâ€™re doing okay because thatâ€™s what i wouldâ€™ve appreciated when i was going through a rough time and somehow there are some people that have a problem with it? if you donâ€™t like it just scroll. iâ€™m literally not causing anyone any harm. just trying to be a decent human being, you should try it sometime.
