"hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times" I think it's safe to say that we are the "weak men" living in "good times" (excluding this last year, which tbh, compared to past history isn't that bad). What if in ~50-80 years out grand children will be the "strong men" living in the "hard times". 

That would be funny/ironic if generations just switch roles and ours get to be the one that gets called snowflakes out whole lives, from our grandparents to out grandchildren. That's like 5 the course of 5 generations.
