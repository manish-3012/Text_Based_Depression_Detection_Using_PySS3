What should I do Like idk what to do. Iâ€™m bored, I kinda want to talk to someone I know except I canâ€™t, I wanna go on Tiktok but stay on Reddit, I wanna keep commenting and making bad posts but I also want to stay, so what do I do. I also want to check Insta for a bit but Iâ€™m still on read, I want to go watch YouTube but idk what to watch, I also want to eat but donâ€™t want to stand up.

Oh, I also want to game and hear music, but I also want to do my homework. What do I do....so many choices, so little time.
