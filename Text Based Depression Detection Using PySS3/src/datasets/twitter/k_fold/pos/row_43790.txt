I have a cancer. Now that I have your attention, I would like to address a serious problem in today's society. And that is... Cancel Culture. People use this to farm clout and make themselves seem holier than thou. Twitter is the main place this problem appears. Twitter is known for this. However, Reddit is known for the hive mind, which I will talk about at a later date. I encourage you to stay away from cancel culture. Good day.


P.S. Cancer is Zodiac
