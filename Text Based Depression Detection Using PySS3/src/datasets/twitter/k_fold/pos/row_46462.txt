Would a girl make sexual jokes with someone she's not interested in? So a girl i text and i frequently joke about sexual stuff, its a part of our daily conversation; she mainly says things like "you like me alot, you wanna sleep with me, you're in love with me" etc. 


She was in the middle of a huge freak-out the other day (completely unrelated to me, family problems) and I wasn't aware of the situation because i was offline for 6 hours and i pushed the jokes too far when i came back, and she blew up at me after a point and started taking her anger out of me; i thought her anger was because of the jokes so i kept asking about it, and after i asked a few times she told me to shut up about it she wasn't sexually attracted to me. 


Her freak-out isn't the point, but I'm not sure if she meant what she said or if it was a spur of the moment thing; so would a girl make such frequent conversations with a guy she has no interest in?
