I hugged a friend today Before anyone asks, of course neither of us have COVID, we are sure. 

Anyways, after going for the past 3 months without getting to spend time with anyone, one of my friends decided to ask me to spend some time this week. We decided to look at Christmas lights around town, and it was more or less just an excuse to get to talk to each other. We talked and walked around for a little while and I finally went to drop them off at their house. And as we said goodbye I got to give my friend a hug for the first time since I saw them months before. My mental and emotional state have been tanking hard in the last few months. After all this time, quarantine is finally starting to break me down as I remain trapped in my home with nobody but m parents. But tonight has given me such a replenishment, mentally and emotionally, and just one hug has made my week. I feel so much better. Thank god for that. 

Everyone, make sure to check up on your friends during these tough times if youâ€™re unsure how they are doing. Maybe just a text to lift them up for a day, or maybe just one hug could keep them going.
