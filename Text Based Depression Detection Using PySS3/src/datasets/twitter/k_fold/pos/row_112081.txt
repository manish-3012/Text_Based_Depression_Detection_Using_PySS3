If mythology were kinds of music Aztec mythology would be metal not the Norse mythology as most would assume The warriors become humming birds when they day 

Quetzalcoatl is The sun god is a dragon (well flying snake)

Xolotl is the eyeless god of death sunsets fires lightning and dogs that tries to devour the sun and in its persecution creates the day and night cycle

Coatlicue the goddes of earth had her head cut off by her 401 children  and grew two snake heads instead  and also gives birth to the god of war

Huitzilopotchli  is born ready to fight and dismembers his sister Coyolxauqui and her head becomes the moon


Coyolxauqui and her 400 brothers the satr constantly attack huitzilopotchli  and if he is defeated  they will kill coatlicue mother earth destroying the world and the only thing that keeps him strong is the blood of sacrifices

Also the animal of the god of war is a humming bird and if a warrior dies it becomes a humming 
bird
