Apparently gas chamber is legal in 4 states Thatâ€™s not ok, gas chamber has a very high botch rate, in 1992, the execution of Donald Harding in Arizona took 11 minutes, and the warden said he would quit if required to do another 

Gas chamber is an extremely painful way too die, if we have to kill people (we donâ€™t), we should at least do it humanly, honestly shooting is probably the most human, basically someone shoots you in the back of the head and a bullet goes through your brain, unlike firing squad where apparently they shoot you in the chest, in theory the fastest way to kill someone would to basically drop a lead block on them basically turning their head into a pancake, that might sound horrible but itâ€™s probably the fastest way to die
