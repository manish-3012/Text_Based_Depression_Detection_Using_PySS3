My life is so fucked up right now I can't keep up with the amount of school work they give me. Im sitting in my room all day long. I have no friends. I'm highly unmotivated and even my stomach can't get me to eat. My parents don't care about me and always drag me where THEY want to go, also they yell at me for ridiculous reasons.
My mood is either lazy, dissatisfied or angry and there's nothing that changes it.
