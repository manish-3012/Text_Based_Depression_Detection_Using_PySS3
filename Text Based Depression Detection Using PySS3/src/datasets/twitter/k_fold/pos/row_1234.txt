So today I lost one of my best friends, my cat.... It was just a regular day (it happened yesterday).
She was gone for a pretty long time like 7 or 10 hours and we didn't find her she didn't even ate her food upstairs. We were suspicous but we didn't want to think she died. My dad came home and we asked him if she saw her he said he saw her under a pinetree with a puffed up belly and closed eyes, then I ran down and saw her little body cold as a stone and her muscles flexed as she was laying on a pile of branches. She probobly ate a poisoned mouse and slowly died. We then berried her next to my first dog in our garden we gave her her goods: her little mouse toy and her fovourite blanket.
Im an atheist and I think there is no god but if there is an afterlife I hope my grandma will take care of her and they will have a good time together.

Rest in peace Csiki
