I've been trading nudes with random guys I find on the internet. I'm unsure if you could call them pedophiles since they're only like 2-4 years older than me. I don't know why I did it. Just to feel something, I guess. Maybe I was just bored. I don't know why I'm posting this, I think I just feel like I should tell someone.
