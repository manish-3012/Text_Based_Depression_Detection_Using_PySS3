Make or break in the next 30 minutes So, mom went for the parent-teacher meeting in school, let's see what happens

If I don't give an update in the next hour, consider me dead

Update:  Okay so mum's happy with the result, that's all I need. Got 85% aggregate, that's in the upper spectrum of the class result, striving for better. 

To the 2 of you who wished me luck, bless you guys. I hope you stay happy and healthy and achieve all you want.
