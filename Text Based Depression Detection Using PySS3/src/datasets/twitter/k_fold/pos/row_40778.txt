Can you tell a girl that has 'issues' with how she looks that she is beautiful even when she has a boyfriend So I'm friends with a girl and she told me earlier today that she thought she was fat and was sometimes sad and unhappy when she looks in the mirror, I told her she wasn't fat (which she totally isn't by the way) but I feel like I should've stressed the point that I really think she's beautiful more. Is this something that would be considered okay to say to a girl who is in a relationship, even when it's out of the blue since the conversation is clearly over? Is there a chance she'd take it in the wrong way?
