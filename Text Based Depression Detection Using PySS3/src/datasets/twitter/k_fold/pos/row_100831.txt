About to have a life threatening heart surgery in 3 days People don't understand me when I say " I cannot play in competitive sports,I have a heart problem". They think I am a guy who has low stamina.my previous pe teacher hated me ,because he thought that I was a lazy bum who was faking this to get out of pe....let me tell you that's the last thing I wanna do,I have a comparatively fit and healthy sprinters body yet,I cannot run or do strenuous exercises because If I do that ,my heart may just give up and I'll be gone just like that.....when I was younger I had trouble comprehending the reason why my mom used to stop me from playing,then in 7th grade,in my rebellious age.....I ran a race. I came first at the time ,but at the finish line ,I just collapsed....my heart beating so fast.....colors coming in front of my eyes....I thought I may die....now I am about to have a surgery that will not heal me,but keep me surviving,i'll have to take blood thinner pill everyday, my diet will be strictly restrictive and I may just have a stroke any day I stop taking my pills....be kind to those who have heart problems it's not easy for us....despite of my problem I have lived a crazy life,if I survive my surgery.....I'll tell you guys some of them and let me tell you they are CRAZY.....if not.........then,goodbyeâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
