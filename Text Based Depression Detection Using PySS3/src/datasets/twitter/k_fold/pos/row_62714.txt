My mom had a car accident this morning and I'm still in shock It's already evening but I'm still thinking about it. 

After I got up from the car I said goodbye to my mom. While I was on my way to school, really close to the road, with my back at it, I heard a loud noise, which sounded like a car accident. I turned and I see that a black car got hit by another car. I was shocked. I  tried to lie to myself that the black car isn't my mom, even tho it was pretty evident. I just continued walking. I didn't know what to do. I was simply scared. 

I and my mother don't have the best relationship, but I was still worried all-day about her. I was still scared of what could've happened to her. 

I don't really know how the accident took place. I only know that my mom tried to do what I think it's called the U-turn and just happened. 

She is alright, she didn't need to go to the hospital. Only the car is a little bit damaged.

I was so lucky that it was just a small car accident, but please if any of you got a driver's license, please, drive safely.
