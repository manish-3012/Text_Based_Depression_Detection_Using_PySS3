I got this cool idea to help with my spanish Iâ€™ve started rewatching anime except itâ€™s in spanish. That way I already know the plot and can give a rough guess of whatâ€™s going on. Itâ€™s very fun. Rn Iâ€™m watching re:zero in spanish but only the first episode is available on crunchy roll for non premium. Anyone got any recommendations?
