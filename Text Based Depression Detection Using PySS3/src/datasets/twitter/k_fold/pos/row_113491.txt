Y'all out here asking that special someone to kiss you? That's why y'all don't get laid. You don't get consent to kiss someone, it's a heat of the moment risk. People acting like I'm crazy when I say you kiss people without consent.

Like you don't look deep into some girl's eyes and be like, "Can I kiss you?" Like what? I mean sometimes the sorta awkward asks work but most of the time, what the fuck are you doing?
