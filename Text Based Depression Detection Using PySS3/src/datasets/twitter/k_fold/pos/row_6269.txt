Omg I just realised something Okay so when someone tells me something I double check Iâ€™m hearing it right and then even after that I doubt what I heard is right and that I could possibly be wrong and it wasnâ€™t what they said. Now I just realised why I do this so when I tell my mum something she will say â€˜ are you sureâ€™ and another thing from when I was little and I would ask why someone did something they would say they never did it even though I remember them doing it but since they were an adult everybody believed them .

Tl;dr years of people doubting me has made it hard to believe Iâ€™m Relaying the correct message
