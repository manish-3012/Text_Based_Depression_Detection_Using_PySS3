I need advice with a girl. So there is this girl in my life, letÂ´s call her Helena. She often snaps me on how IÂ´m doing and has been listening to my problems for a few weeks now, because I have been dealing with family problems lately. 

She has said that she does not know what she wants from me and canÂ´t figure it out, and IÂ´m kinda worried that I might lose her by putting to much pressure on her. Any advice on how to handle this?
