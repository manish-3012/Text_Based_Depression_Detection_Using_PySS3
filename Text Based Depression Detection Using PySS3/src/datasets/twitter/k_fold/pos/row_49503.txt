My ramblings (this proves I'm not going to get a S/O lol, I'm joking) Do you ever just feel like you're not really alive you know, like you know you're you're there your living, breathing, feeling, emotioning. But you're not really feeling alive like it feels like there is nothing left yeah? The world goes on after you're gone so how would you know if it's going to be alright after you're gone because I want nature to take over again other than people it's quite sad see what's happening but no matter, no matter. If what people say is true that there is nothing after death what happens what would you see how would you feel what's going to happen because I can't comprehend the feeling of nothing true nothing there has to be something after it even even haunting stuff and fun stuff like that, but no apparently there's nothing! in my beliefs I think, whatever you believe in is what you get, if you believe in heaven and hell you get heaven and hell. If you believe in I don't know being a ghost you'll be a ghost it's completely dependant on who you are as a person you know? Me going to be paradise there's going to be a single cherry blossom on a floating island over a grand sea with the proper constellations and a full day and night cycle, and there's going to be people there but my people, special people. The people who are there or people who are important to me, people who've been there for me and I feel like that's that's a proper place to be I get the rest but I won't know who those people are less I go through life I know who some of them are not all of them. Life is just a step and your Guide to the universe you have to go through it to understand who you should be afterlife you get to do what you want it's really dependant on what you believe in as I stated previously, life is awesome it may not be for everyone else but keep going you know if you want to give up I believe in you, and hey if you came across this post your life is guiding you to Greatness that's where I leave off have a great day, night, noon or afternoon.
