So I TPed my friends car last night I snuck out at 1 in the morning, skated over and completely wrapped his car in toilet paper.

When I come back home its 1:59.

My mom is sitting in the living room ready to scold me for sneaking out, she says I've been gone for an hour.

Remember its daylight savings, the clocks set back an hour when it hit 2 am.

Point at the clock and say I've stepped outside for 2 minutes, it's 1:02 now.

Mfw it works I don't get punished.

Did I just find a use for daylight savings?
