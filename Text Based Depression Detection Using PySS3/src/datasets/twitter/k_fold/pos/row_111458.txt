I've been in braces purgatory for 2 years I got braces 3 years ago, but a year into treatment my parents had to move and couldn't afford to switch orthodontists. I've had to keep them on though because if I get them off, my teeth will move back and it'll be even more expensive to restart treatment. So I have to keep my mouth full of metal for an unknown amount of time, I'm starting to apply for jobs now so I can just pay for this shit myself and get it over with. Fucking sick of them
