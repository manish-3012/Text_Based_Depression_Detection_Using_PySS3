Small vent, since I kinda needed to get it out Iâ€™m starting to get the feeling that, if I do kill myself, no one, not even my closest friends are gonna care. I always put in the effort to try and make their life better, but Iâ€™m starting to see that Iâ€™m getting none of it back. Itâ€™s like all of my efforts to keep Them alive, isnâ€™t working to keep Me alive. Idk honestly, Iâ€™m probably just overwhelmed with school and itâ€™s getting to me, or my parents abuse is starting to get to my head, and itâ€™s probably because my friends forget to ask. Either way, I feel demoralized and unmotivated to keep doing my task on making my friends alive and happy
