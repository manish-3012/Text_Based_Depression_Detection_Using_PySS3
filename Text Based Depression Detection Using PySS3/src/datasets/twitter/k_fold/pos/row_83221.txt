Itâ€™s separated. Logical. Mean. Kind. Boring. Emotional. 

I hate them. I hate myself. 

I hate these people. They are me. I am a them. I donâ€™t like it. They swap constantly. Days on end of being mean. Being too emotional. Good I havenâ€™t been kind in weeks. Iâ€™m sorry. Logical and boredom are interchangeable but different. They often take over together. God I sound pretentious. â€œOh yeah I go big brainâ€ Iâ€™m a fucking disgrace. God I just want to end it all. End the suffering. Kill myself. Day after day I think if it. Inching closer to saying â€œfuck itâ€ killing myself. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry to my family. Having to deal with me. As it all got worse.

Go ahead. Being it on. â€œR/ im4andthisisdeepâ€ â€œsound like some 13 year old wrote thisâ€ â€œgrow upâ€. You can say them. It wonâ€™t be the first time.
