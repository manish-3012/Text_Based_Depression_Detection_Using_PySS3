Friends trying to "beat" my lonelyness I'm 19 yo guy if that matters. When I talk with friends about how life draining it is to be alone and never be loved, they always try to top me and it makes me so angry. Like, I have this friend (16 female) and she always cry's about not being loved, no one likes her and she will end alone when her last relationship wasn't even 4 months ago. Now she's talking to a guy, even stayed over at his house and slept in his bed and she still keeps going on crying about it and loses all hope when he doesn't text in an hour. But of course I'm supposed to shut up and man up, because we all know guys can't be more lonely am I right? They always try to be as miserable as you, but forget that they had plenty of relationships while I never even kissed a girl. Or this other friend (18 male), when I talk to him about this lonely stuff, he always says shit like "yeah, same" and "yeah no one ever liked me too" even tho he had like over 10 relationships and fucked up one of them himself cause he had the need to make out with another girl even tho I told him not to do stuff like this. They always try to top me and be more lonely/miserable/unloved when I explain them how I feel. They don't even know what it's really like being unloved, unnoticed and overlooked. It's just sad really. Honestly, life feels like Dark Souls, you become more and more hollow when you have no purpose in life.
