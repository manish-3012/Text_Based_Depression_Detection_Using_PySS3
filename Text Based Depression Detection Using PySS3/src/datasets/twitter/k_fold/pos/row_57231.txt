People make fun of me for being a r/notliketheothergirls So I dress kinda funny( you can look on my profile) but I donâ€™t care what people wear. I donâ€™t judge anyone for there clothes, makeup, etc. 

So why did a girl tell me today â€œyouâ€™re so quirkyâ€ in a mocking way. Like bitch what did I ever do to you? Iâ€™m confused and low key butthurt. 

Iâ€™ve been homeschooled my own life so is this shit normal ?idk

(Sorry I know there are more important things to think about but I just felt like bitching about something stupid)
