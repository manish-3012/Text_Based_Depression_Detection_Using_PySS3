Is it wrong to rewatch the whole Avatar series? Iâ€™ve been rewatching the whole series ever since I found it on Netflix. Avatar was my CHILDHOOD. My little sister never watched it before, and is making fun of me for watching a â€œkidâ€™s showâ€. Is avatar one of this things people can bully you for?
