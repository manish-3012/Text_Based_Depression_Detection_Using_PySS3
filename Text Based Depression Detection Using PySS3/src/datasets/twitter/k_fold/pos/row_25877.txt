Coffee is delicious and I'll explain why I drink mine black so we'll start with that you have the flavor of the beans which is delightful and a nice cozy taste then you mix in the nice bitterness which works with the other flavors to create a drink with a complex mixture of flavors all working together in harmony. You could also add cream add sugar to it if you want sweet milk with caffeine.
