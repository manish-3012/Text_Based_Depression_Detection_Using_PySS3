Isnâ€™t it weird when youâ€™re just walking in the hallway and you hear someone say your name, and when you look around to find the person who said it, you canâ€™t find them. Does anyone else do this or just me. I was just walking and I heard someone say my name very loud in an almost annoyed tone and I was just standing there looking around clueless. I think it was someone upstairs too so they probably saw me from the balcony.
