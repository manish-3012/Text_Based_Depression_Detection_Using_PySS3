i think i found why i hate myself. i was seen as gifted when i was a kid so i had to be perfect in everything in my mind. but the problem with that view everytime you fail in anything you feel disappointed and mad at yourself everytime and you feel like everytime you mess up at anything you are a disappointment to everyone. 

after a bit you feel like you can do better but one test messes up and you start being sad in yourself knowing your grade isnâ€™t perfect and thatâ€™s bad. you donâ€™t like yourself cause your body isnâ€™t perfect. you donâ€™t like yourself cause your skills arenâ€™t perfect. you donâ€™t like yourself cause your grades arenâ€™t perfect and so on. you look at other kids who can get bad grades normally and their parents donâ€™t get disappointed because they didnâ€™t have that stupid label slapped on them. 

sorry about the rant i was just mad at myself.
