i wish i had the balls to off myself iâ€™ve been hating life for a long time now. after having a short stint of happiness in 2019, life returned to its proper place down the shitter and iâ€™m worse than i ever have been. i hate living, i donâ€™t want to be here, everything is too stressful and too much and i canâ€™t put in the effort to help myself, i feel like such a failure to humankind with my warped self. i feel like shooting the image in my mirror whenever i look in it. but, for some reason, i donâ€™t have the guts to actually kill myself. i donâ€™t want to live, but i donâ€™t want to kill myself either, and i feel like iâ€™m in some sort of limbo. i just wish i could either be a normal person and help myself out the gutter or grow some balls and shove all the pills i have down my throat. how can i magically become a better person or, more easily, find the courage to end it

end of rant thanks for listening
