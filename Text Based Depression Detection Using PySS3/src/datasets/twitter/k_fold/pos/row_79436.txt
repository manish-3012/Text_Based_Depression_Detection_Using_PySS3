How do you approach girls (or people in general) without being seen as weird Title pretty much says it all. I get that I'd have to be confident and all, but I have no self esteem at all so idk. I'm just always afraid of people thinking I'm weird for trying to talk to them and that they won't want to talk to me anyways. How do I do it?
