Just got rejected. Wouldnâ€™t recommend Iâ€™ve had a crush on this girl for three years and weâ€™ve been best friends for that time. You see a lot of success stories on this subreddit, but when you actually look at how often your crush actually has feelings back itâ€™s a lot less. People like feel oof stories which is why you donâ€™t hear a lot about the rejections. Think of how many highly rated movies have a sad ending. Nobody wants to hear something that discourages them, but more often then not thatâ€™s the way it works. No one wants their own hopes crushed, because everyone wants their crush to like them back. So the tops posts are of people whoâ€™s crushes say they like them back, so people think that their crushes will do the same. Iâ€™m here to tell you it doesnâ€™t always happen that way. So yeah I wouldnâ€™t recommend getting rejected. Not fun.
