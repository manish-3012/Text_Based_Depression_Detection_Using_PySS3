You guys wanna know something? I think Iâ€™m bisexual. Iâ€™m a guy, and I think I like the same gender and the opposite, I only just realized now how happy I usually was when I was with my friend who was a guy, and now that I realize it I think of myself as such a dumbass but also a part of the LBGT+ community, which is pretty epic. I really could come out to my mom, but idk my dad, because heâ€™s really homophobic, and hates Gays and bisexuals, wait until you see the look on his face when he knows his kid is bi, lol. Well, that was fun, realizing that. (TL;DR: I have a girl crush and used to have a guy crush, so Iâ€™m bi) Thanks for reading, ur cool :)
