how do i break up with my girlfriend iâ€™m seriously unhappy in this relationship and i want out. we havenâ€™t hung out in forever and she barely texts, and when she does itâ€™s about the most dull and boring things. i feel bad for her too bc i donâ€™t think i make a great gf either. so how do i break up with her over text without seeming like a bitch
