Need help with college Hey guys Iâ€™m in my senior year and have some trouble about my future career. Iâ€™m currently studying medical but Iâ€™d like to keep my options open. Iâ€™d really like to apply for SAT. Iâ€™m not from the states so I donâ€™t really know the procedure. Iâ€™d be a great help if any of you could give me any advice on how to go through it.
