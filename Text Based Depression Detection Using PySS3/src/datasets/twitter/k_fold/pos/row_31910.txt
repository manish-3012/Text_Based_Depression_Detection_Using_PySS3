Would u rather........... 1. Have THE MOST perfect grades. You don't even try a bit and you still never ever miss any small nor big question on a test, homework, final etc. Never ever go below an A+ in any class. Have different universities begging you to choose them. But have no social life. No one knows you even exist including your own family. You study 24/7. Have no friends in real life or at school or on video games. And you can't do ANYTHING to change anything.

Or 2. The complete opposite of 1
