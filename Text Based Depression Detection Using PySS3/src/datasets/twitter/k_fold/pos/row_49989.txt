an important PSA for everyone! **tl;dr ask someone before giving their number out**

if someone asks you for your friends number (or any other contact info), you NEED to ask your friend if theyâ€™re okay with it first! it doesnâ€™t matter if the person says itâ€™s just for something like class notes; it is never your right to give out someone elseâ€™s information. 

iâ€™m a 19 y/o college girl and iâ€™ve had to deal with so many shitty/uncomfortable/upsetting â€œnice guyâ€ (r/niceguys) conversations since freshman year of high school. 

i donâ€™t want to make this post too long to ensure that people arenâ€™t turned off from reading this, but i could say a lot more about it.
