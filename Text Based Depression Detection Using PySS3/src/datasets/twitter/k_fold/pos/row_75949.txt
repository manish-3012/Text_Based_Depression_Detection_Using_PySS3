Why i hate religion with all my heart Disclaimer: I don't hate religious people, you can follow anything you want, but don't be like my parents.

So i told my parents in 2019 that i was an atheist. They were shocked, mom started to ask me what cult i was following (HOW CAN I FOLLOW A CULT WHEN I DON'T BELIVE IN ANYTHING IDIOT?) and stuff like this. Dad was chill, didn't say anything. Anyways, they stopped after a few days and told me that i'll change my mind.

Fast forward quarantine, in March, schools closed so i decided to stay with my grandparents because they were like 50 cases. Somewhere in April, mom watched some TV (i usually don't watch TV, i consider it a waste of time) and it was at a time where cases blew up in my country. My mom called me and told me to pray, and i was like "I told you that i'm an atheist. Why should i pray?" and she screamed in my phone shit like "That's why our country is shit, the new generation is corrupted by devil etc."

And the most recent thing, in August, they wanted to go to church. I told them i'd prefer staying home or going outside for a walk, while they go to church. Dad told me i can stay home, but mom blew up in anger and started calling me names that i don't prefer mentioning here.

Advice for any parents here with atheist kids: JUST FKING LISTEN TO THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTALITY YOU IDIOTIC BOOMER
