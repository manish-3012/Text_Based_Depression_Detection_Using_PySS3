I just saw my mom without a wig or scarf on her head for the first time in years She has alopecia areata, so she always has a bandana, scarf, or wig on. I think she's embarrassed by it which makes me sad. She used to have really long flowy hair and I can tell she misses it. Then she tries to live her hair dreams vicariously through me but I never want to do what she wants me to do with it. That's all
