Reddit is horrible right now I've been trying to post here talking about the huge amount of repost there are in hot, hoping to make it stop and it kept being deleted. Is just horrible, I can't sort by hot without seeing repost and I can't talk about it without getting deleted for now reason. What the hell happened to Reddit? This use to be an app with original content and free speech, now is just repost and banning who complains.


Sorry if I made a typo, I'm not English
