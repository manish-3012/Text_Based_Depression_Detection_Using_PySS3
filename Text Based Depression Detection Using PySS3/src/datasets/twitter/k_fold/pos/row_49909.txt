This girl has been looking at me since the start of school this year Since the start of junior high this year, I've noticed this girl looking at me everytime I accidentally glance over her. We've made accidental eye contact in class, in the cafeteria, outside at recess. I have no idea if it's just coincidene or what it is.
 
I've also tried to contact her trough Snap, which didn't work out what so ever. You see, she was hanging out with a guy that was bullying me the whole 7th, 8th and 9th grades (the guy is just a general asshole, I've heard his friends talk shit behind him even). Anyways cutting to the chase: I was snapping with this girl, she replies with pics of that dude sitting opposite to her, we go trough a nice conversation, untill the dude swoops her phone, starts calling me names and stuff. Right as I thought I got rid of him, he ruined everything again. After the incident I've not dared to speak with her ever again.
 
I also asked about this from my friend. She said that when a girl is sending pics of another dude to me might be a sign that she's not into me. Then again, what is the staring about?
 
Any of y'all got any ideas? Coincidence or a sign?
