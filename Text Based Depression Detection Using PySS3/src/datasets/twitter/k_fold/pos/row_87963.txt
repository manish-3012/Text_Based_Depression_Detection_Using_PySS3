lmaoo,,, long story short ; 3 years ago there was this classmate of mine (boy) who decided to ask another classmate (girl) in front of the whole class during the break... well things didnâ€™t turn out well and she rejected him and everyone laughed at him and started calling him by wrong names and he just stayed quiet and went back to his seat ... today the same girl decided to ask the guy out in front of the whole class and when he said no she started crying and everyone tried consoling her and bla bla,,,, everyone was like : â€œman how can you be so meanâ€ , â€œcan you just not care about a girl for a secondâ€ , â€œwhy did you hurt her feelings infront of the whole classâ€ , â€œyouâ€™re not even a manâ€ and what not..... i mean genders can be funny sometimes (idk how to phrase this line but hope you get it)
