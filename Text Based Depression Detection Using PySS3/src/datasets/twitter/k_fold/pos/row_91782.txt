Haha I love this kid My three year old sister comes into my room, lays down, and proceeds to pretend to sleep. I ask her why she is in here and she says " I am having a sleepover in your room because mine is messy because I never clean it." And then decides to randomly just fold my laundry. Like wtf bruh???? Man I love her.
