So last night I took a painful L Last night me and this girl were FaceTiming and we were going for a little while and she came to the point to tell me how she liked me and since I have a low self esteem I felt accomplished cause I felt like she was way out of my league.Anyways she keeps bringing it up with her friend as well then we hang up and itâ€™s around 3:00am I go to sleep happy thinking and feeling accomplished 

Fast forward to this morning she texts me that she was just joking around with me and tbh it really hurts.Anyways just wanted to say I took a very painful L.
