I know Iâ€™m a guy, but sometimes I wish I was born in the body and life of an attractive white girl life is just easier when youâ€™re an attractive white girl. You get more respect in society, youâ€™ll find love without even trying, and life is just better for you.

But instead I had to be born in an ugly ass boring male body that everyone hates. Maybe I should kill myself and hopefully rebirth as a new person
