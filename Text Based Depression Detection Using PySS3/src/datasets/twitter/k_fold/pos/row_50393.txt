I'm so fucking scared Okay don't make fun of me, This is really scary for me. so I'm a male and when I was 10 I got these odd bumps on my penis. So being I the stupid kid and I never really questioned it. Anyway they've always been there. When I was 13 I Googled something about it and it said that they were completely normal and they were harmless so I didn't really question it for a while. But recently almost three years later I started getting curious about it again and I asked a few of my close male friends and they said it sounds a lot like genital warts. Lucky me :( I don't know what could have caused it. As far as I know I was never sexually molested as a kid. I did eat a girl out when I was 13 I think but already had them then. Besides that I've never been sexually active till this year as far as I know they're mostly harmless for males but they are more harmful to females. I have had sex with my girlfriend multiple times and if I do have them and I gave them to her I could never look myself in the eye again. I'm terrified of what she will think of me. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow to see if I do have them everybody tells me it'll be okay and try to get some sleep but I've been trying to go to sleep for hours now. I can't stop crying and shaking I'm so fucked .
