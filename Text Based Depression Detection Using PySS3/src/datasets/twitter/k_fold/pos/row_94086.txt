I have some weird obsessions but is this one thatâ€™s really that weird? Iâ€™ve had a pretty big fascination for knives, not like plain kitchen knives, but rn hunks like balisongs, OTFs, fancy flick knives, Karambits, tactical knives. Some people have said itâ€™s weird but I love them. Itâ€™s not like I want to hurt anybody with them, itâ€™s just the feel, the craftsmanship, the danger of them that I love so much, and I own quite a few (U.K. laws a pretty stupid lol), is this weird?
