A dumb passage from the Texas STAAR Okay so Texas has state test called the STAAR and today I and the rest of the Texas 9th grade students took our English 1 test, and one of the passages where called â€œA Reason Not To LOLâ€ 
And itâ€™s about how this kid is realizing that the acronyms we use like brb,lol, and the shorten words like u and r have are destroying the way we speak and how we should always talk proper because if we donâ€™t weâ€™ll forget how to do so and start to write professional letters like â€œYes I would like the job cus I need the money so could u hire me?â€ I just found it so dumb.
It also said that the conversations he was having on  his phone with his friends where disrespectful and like how? How is casual conversation where you donâ€™t need to be proper disrespectful? Also as I mentioned earlier he said it blocks communication between generations, and it just doesnâ€™t from my experience because my 58 year old Spanish speaking grandmother understands â€œIDKâ€.
Also Iâ€™m convinced it was actually written by an out of touch 60 year old executive and not an actual teens passage that they put in the test.
Anyways I just wanted to say this because I thought the thing was dumb, buh bye.
