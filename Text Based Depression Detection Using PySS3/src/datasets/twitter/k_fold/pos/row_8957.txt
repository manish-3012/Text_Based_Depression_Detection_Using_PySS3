&gt;300) I shouldn't have pulled a dumb prank on thiccc but like he started it tho

&gt;301) Feb 14 is almost here and I am sad.

&gt;307) I lied to everyone on reddit and my online friends. Iâ€™m not 16, Iâ€™m 13. I donâ€™t know how to confess lol and I really want to come clean

&gt;311) When I was like 8 I went to a cave on a tour and they said don't touch the stalagmites because the oil stops them from growing. I touched one before they said that and for the next several years I was scared the police would get me when I was in the area

- damn, so youâ€™re still on the lamb huh?

&gt;312) Im in love with u/tinkerbell2678

- damnnn (Iâ€™d say â€˜;)â€™ but ðŸ‘€)

&gt;313) I have a lot of symptoms and signs of being on the spectrum but the â€œdepressed 14 year old white girl memeâ€ has made me keep this inside of me and not tell anyone. Iâ€™ve never bothered to get checked even tho Iâ€™m like 99% sure Iâ€™m right because thereâ€™s always that chance Iâ€™ll be wrong and feel like a idiot 

- I mean if you think somethingâ€™s wrong and you need help get it even if you arenâ€™t on the spectrum :/ dw about feeling like an idot if u need it get it, regardless if youâ€™re in the spectrum at all deal with the symptoms and signs? And bottling up your emotions ISNT okay either :(


&gt;315) I had to cut off almost all of my friends due to delusions and hallucinations. I managed to keep one friend though, shes genuinely the light in my life and I don't know what I'd do without her. Idk why I'm sharing this, it's anonymous though and I felt like getting it off my chest.

- well Iâ€™m glad you got it off your chest:) if youâ€™re on the path to getting better (if not I suggest you take it) then youâ€™ll make more friends when youâ€™re ready and sounds like you have a rlly nice friend

&gt;320) Some people on this sub are cute but they wouldnâ€™t date me cuz Iâ€™m 14 :(

- ah maybe try looking for people more around your age?

&gt;323);)

- ðŸ˜³

&gt;325) I know my guy best friends favorite position. Not sometime I ever wanted to know but according to him Iâ€™m now going to be treated like a guy and thatâ€™s what I get to hear about  

-lmfao thatâ€™s what happens when all your friends are guys haha  ðŸ™‹â€â™€ï¸ 

&gt;326) Iâ€™ve never had a GF and I worry that Iâ€™ll never have one in future. I donâ€™t mind never having one if I have nice friends, it just brings to attention my social inadequacies. 

- I mean if you meet the right person Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll happen some day and having nice friends beats it all (well most of it) 

&gt;327) My crush is called Marta

But there's something she needs to clear up too.

&gt;335) I have hacked my phone and was able to get free items in games. If they knew I would probably have to pay thousands of dollars in debt
