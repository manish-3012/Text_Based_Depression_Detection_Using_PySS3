Up until about half a year ago I thought poc meant "piece of crap" I heard my dad say "pos" once which means piece of shit; but i didn't know that. when i heard my dad say that for the first time i remembered hearing "poc" somewhere i forgot where though and my brain put poc, which i already heard before, and put it in the "curse word library". 
Then one time i was cleaning a shed with my dad and found a nasty hose covered with cobwebs and took it to my dad and said "what a poc" and he said "what did you say?" Then i proceeded to embarrass myself by saying "yeah, ain't it a poc? I mean its cut broken and full of bugs!" So my dad went and chewed me out and told me "it's pos geographyboi, poc means person of color". All the while i turned red
