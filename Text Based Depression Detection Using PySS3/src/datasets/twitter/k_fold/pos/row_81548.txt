Did I overreact when cutting off my bestfriend? (17F) So my bestfriend (also 17) can be kind of rude sometimes. For example today I said something she didnâ€™t agree with about some celebrity and she said â€œokay and? she obviously grew from itâ€ and like i respect her opinion but I told her that I donâ€™t like when she says stuff like â€œokay and?â€ and etc and that it feels condescending to me. Then she said â€œyouâ€™re not an angel yourself, youâ€™re just misunderstanding and thatâ€™s just how i amâ€ and i felt it was immature and i said if I do something that bothers her she should tell me and iâ€™ll work on it. but she was doing something that bothered me and i actually communicated it to her and she didnâ€™t respect how i felt. I told her that I didnâ€™t want to be her friend anymore. (Weâ€™ve been friends for 6 years) 

That may seem small but sheâ€™s done so many other things that iâ€™ve stopped talking to her for, i was dating this guy and he was a couple years older than me and i asked her if that was weird and she told me it was perfectly fine and then behind my back she told someone that it was weird. One time I was having a really bad day and I vented to her and she ghosted me for 2 months and then excused it by saying â€œi didnâ€™t know what to say.â€ She also talks bad about her other close friends to me and even asked me to tell one of her friends that he stinks for her. I told her she excuses being disrespectful as a personality trait and i donâ€™t wanna be friends with someone like that and she just said â€œOkay.â€ 6 years.

Was completely dropping her too much? Was i being over sensitive?

TL;DR- my bestfriend of 6 years can offend me sometimes and today i confronted her about it and she said iâ€™m not perfect myself and just didnâ€™t respect my feelings. Was i right in cutting her off, is there another way i should handle this?
