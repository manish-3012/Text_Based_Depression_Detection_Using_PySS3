My first ever fight So I was walking over to the royal palace with my bodyguards (obviously) but I heard some rustling in some bushed. I gently tip toes towards the bush, my heart pounding, my veins swelling and my toes crumbling to wards the ground. As I got closer the rustling got louder and more vicious. When I heard this I yelled to the bush. "Rustle one more time and your gonna smell my toes." As I said that in an instant a man jumped out and said "who dares cross I king Henry the viii. Unless u wanna battle," he drew his sword towards me while I took out my golf stick. He was the first to deliver a strike. With his golf stick sauring through the air while I managed to block it with my right thumb, I yelled "is that all you can do bitch." So I struck my golf stick at his head causing a shockwave that caused a neighbouring volcano to errupt it landed on his ribs and he was on the floor. I knew this was my chance so I grabbed a pen and I shoved it through his eye, blood oozing out whilst I retracted the pen out in slow motion. And I was about to use his own sword against him until he said. "Your a man who deserves honour, your a man of shear will and your a man who deserves recognition. That is why you deserve to have the title 'the great', if you finish me off you will never keep that title and if you don't the people of the far countries will respect you and want you, so what do you say,"  and I knew exactly what my answer was.
