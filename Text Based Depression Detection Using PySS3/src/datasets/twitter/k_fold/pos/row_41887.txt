Poem I wrote / what do you think?? I feel like Iâ€™m so much like my mom and my dad, prone to addiction and writing songs when Iâ€™m sad, All my thoughts are fiction, have another anxiety attack, down some more prescriptions, these drugs really have my back, I give my emotions an eviction, I keep fighting but Iâ€™m stuck, feeling down, mental health has me imprisoned, it seems I am out of luck, mask myself like a clown, all my emotions hidden, I keep searching all around, but all my friends are still missin, what the fuck do I do now?
