Why to girls reject me so hard I had three crushes who I all confessed to after a few months of being friends with them, but now here are the stories:

My first crush: I've known her probably two years before I confessed, but we've only been  
friends a year before that. Our friendship went good and after thinking she likes me too the foolish old self decided to confess. She laughed told other people that I had feelings for her and they laughed at me too.

The second one: She wasn't ass wild. We've been mutual friend for a year or two and yeah I was really naive.

The third crush: She is the newest one to reject me, but tbh I had feelings for here for about 3 to 4 years, but in the fist and second year I've tried more to get another girl as my girlfriend (the second one). We've spoken with each other a lot in the last year before she rejected me. Also to mention is that I had a weird reputation in school and she went in the same school as me. (I've tried to better myself, but everyone ignores that). Now after saying all this I want to tell you how I my confession went. She just said she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now and then blocked me everywhere (or she is ignoring me really good (I still have hopes, because she is still my crush and idk why anymore)).

Tldr: all three said no and never spoke with me again.
