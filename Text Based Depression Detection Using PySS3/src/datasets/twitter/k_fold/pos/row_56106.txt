Yall ever think about how easy it is to fuck everything up Like you can be talking to someone and realize how easy it is to just say something to vilify them forever or just punch them in the face and completely disintegrate my relationship with them. or like holding a knife and thinking how simple it would be to just slit my own throat and straight up die

are these intrusive thoughts normal or am I just a sociopath
