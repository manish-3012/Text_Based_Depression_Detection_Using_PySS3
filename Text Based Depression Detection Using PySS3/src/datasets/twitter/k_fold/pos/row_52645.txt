Fortnite is fun Iâ€™m probably the worst player in that game which is why I will only play team rumble with people who will never see me again but itâ€™s actually a fun game if u count out the tryhards who build fast af and the pros who take .2 seconds to come after u and kill u but yeah why do people even have such strong hate toward the game they got mystique in there now and shes hot as fuck
