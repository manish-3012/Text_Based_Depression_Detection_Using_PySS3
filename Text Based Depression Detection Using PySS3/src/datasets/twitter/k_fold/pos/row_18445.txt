Porn and masturbation ruins you. It makes me sick to see kids on this sub say that masturbation is normal. FUCK. NO. Don't listen to the "scientists" who say it's good for you; they're all lying! I've been addicted to it my entire life, as far back as I can remember. It's ruined my confidence, my ability to talk to people, my daily energy and motivation levels, I have no hobbies, little ambitions, and I can't even love women romantically anymore because I've objectified them due to this addiction that has robbed me of myself. I always feel like I have something to hide from everyone, and it's because I do! Porn addiction causes you to always feel like you have something to hide since it makes you do unspeakable things that you can't share with anyone without the utmost shame and disgust for yourself. Please, don't fall into the trap. It's not worth the 5 second dopamine rush.
