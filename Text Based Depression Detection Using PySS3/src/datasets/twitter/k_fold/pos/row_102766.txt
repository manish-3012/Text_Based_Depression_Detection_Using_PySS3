Smoking under teenagers Hey all, I've been thinking about this for a while and I didn't really get the chance to share it with anyone so i wanted to share it with you guys, see what you think.

I have been seeing to much teenagers from this age smoking, vaping drinking to much alcohol. And i don't really get it. 

Overall I don't care much about what others do with their lives but I think it's just so dumb. Like really, am i the only one who would reject a smoke if a friend would give me one?? I guess it's cool now to smoke and drink untill you get so drunk and get transported to the intensive care. And that's just a thought that blows my mind because I see many teenagers from my school doing it. These people don't seem to get that it can have so much impact on the rest of your live. 

Funny story; I liked a girl from my school a lot, but then found out that she smokes. That wasn't a fun feeling I can say, and I have heard 2 friends who had the same story. 

And I will believe that there are people who smoke because at home it isn't the best etc, and feel that that's the only thing to relieve stress. But that wasn't what i experienced at my school, and maybe some non-smokers think the same about this too. I think it's a clear story, popularity tops everything under some teenagers anno 2020.
