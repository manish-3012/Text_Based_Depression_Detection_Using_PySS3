My dad took away my brotherâ€™s phone because he wonâ€™t bury bacon grease in the backyard. I am 100% serious. Iâ€™m writing this on my account because my dad took my brotherâ€™s phone, and my brother doesnâ€™t post much on Reddit. He said I could post his story here. 

My dad has been storing bacon grease in cans for years. He cooks bacon pretty frequently and when heâ€™s done, he stores the grease in a can he keeps on the stove. When the can is full, he gets a new one. Heâ€™s piled up plenty of cans of bacon grease, and was planning to â€œmake soapâ€ but decided not to. Now he doesnâ€™t know what to do with them. 

He decided to do the most logical thing, force my brother (13yo) to bury them in the backyard. When my brother refused, my dad took his phone away. My brother also lost chair privileges for sitting on a chair with his shirt off. The thing about my dad is that he makes up the rules after people (usually my brother) break them. 

So anyway my brother wonâ€™t stop venting to me that he has to bury bacon grease in the backyard, so Iâ€™ve decided to help him. We have to dig a hole, and in the United States where I live itâ€™s a law that you have to call 811 before you dig. My mom said I shouldnâ€™t call because Iâ€™m a minor and they will think Iâ€™m pranking them, but itâ€™s illegal to dig without calling them. 

Thanks for reading my rant.
