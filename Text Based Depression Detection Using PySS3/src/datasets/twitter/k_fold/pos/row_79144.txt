Anyone ever notice that we all have THAT year like It feels like everyone has that one year that they really like personality wise start acting like a new person? like you go through something and then you basically just drop everything, and get new interests, hobbies, a new personality, and sometimes new friends. Or am I the only one who noticed/actually had this happen to me.
