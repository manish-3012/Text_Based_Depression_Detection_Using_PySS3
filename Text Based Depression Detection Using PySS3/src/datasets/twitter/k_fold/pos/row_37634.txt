Me and my girlfriend who I knew for 4 years broke up, so I wrote a poem. Enjoy A poem for my ex

Backstory:  She broke up with me yesterday and I didnâ€™t know how to handle it so I wrote this poem. Itâ€™s shit just like everything else I make. Writing this poem made me cry a fuck tonne. Known her for 4 years. The amount of good memories, the lasting ones, the perfect ones. Anyways, poem.

Dearest mik 

Iâ€™m writing your death note

The ice berg to your titanic boat

The salt to your wound

Your biggest doom

I care about you ever so

So it pains me to say 

I lost feelings



Now go on with your day


Iâ€™ll leave you on read for hours

Iâ€™ll hide and cower


What am I, invisible

To you, Iâ€™m fictional.


Those late nights before a maths test,

The nights where we would laugh and cry

Reminiscing and remembering

And now Iâ€™m surrendering 


But in the end, it couldnâ€™t have worked

For my expectations were warped


Only 3 months we would last

It sure did go fast


I lost feelings faster


My dearest mik
