Itâ€™s my fricken birthday My last year of being a teenager starts today. I got woken up at SIX AM because my mother was cleaning out the bath like ???? and I have no friends who are gonna say happy birthday. I have to work 8 hrs today, probably doing something I hate. My boyfriend is halfway across the world snd the presents he sent me havenâ€™t arrived. What a sucky birthday.
