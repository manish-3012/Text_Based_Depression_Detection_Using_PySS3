I did it I told my parents about my anxiety and how I wanted to see a therapist. They said I could see one after exams have ended, as they donâ€™t want anything to interfere with them. 

Iâ€™m so happy. It was difficult, but maybe now Iâ€™ll get diagnosed and given medication, and have someone to talk to.
