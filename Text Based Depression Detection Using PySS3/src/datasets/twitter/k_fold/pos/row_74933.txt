My dad just gave me Â£250 Context: for Christmas, we got Â£250 each (on these gift card type things) from my grandma.
But we can buy stuff before.

Now my phone recently broke, so I thought I'd buy a new one using that. Which only left me with Â£96 out of it. 

My dad just swapped our cards out so I got his full one and he only left himself with just short of Â£100.

I don't know how I feel about this, because I really don't mind, as I used the card for what it was intended for.

Of course I'm grateful, but I just feel kinda weird about it.


Also, I know someone is gonna say it. So I just will, my grandma is well off, and we are kind of spoilt by her.
