All I want is a sweatshirt That says the ceo of Chick-fil-A wants me dead. Is that too much to ask for? Maybe I can wear that shirt and kiss a girl in the parking lot. That would be awesome. 

Also reminder pls don't eat at chick fil a they are really homophobic and donate to a lot of anti lgbt+ organizations y'all can just get a deepfrier and make the stuff urself.
