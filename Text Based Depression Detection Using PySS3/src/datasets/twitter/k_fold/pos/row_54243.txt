Google is scary (short story time) So when i was leaving from dinner after going out with family and friends my family and two other mates were in the car with us on the way home, they lived up north while we lived down in Florida so we started to joke around saying that they should move over to be closer to us, while we were one of them said some place that was higher above ground and then we got curious of what was the highest place in Florida. So my dads friend looked it up and all he had to type was â€œhigheâ€ and the entire autofill came up with â€œhighest point in Floridaâ€ than the conversation moved onto how much googles and Alexa know, its spooky some times, i mean imagine what else they have.
