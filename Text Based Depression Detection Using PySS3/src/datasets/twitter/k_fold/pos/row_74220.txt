Punch line (I know many people are struggling with this concept) A **punch line** (a. k. a. **punch-line** or **punchline**) concludes a [joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke); it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the [typical joke structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke#Telling_jokes). It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.

In a broader sense, "punch line" can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.
