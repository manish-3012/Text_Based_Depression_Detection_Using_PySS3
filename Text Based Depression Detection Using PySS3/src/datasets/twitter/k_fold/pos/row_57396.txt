I was able to rick-roll my teacher and my class I was writing down the lyrics to Never gonna give you up in my notebook and the teacher took it away. Because she has a policy of reading notes to the class, she read out my 'essay'. She started strong, but soon realised what was happening.

btw it was a math class so there was no reason for my to be writing so much.
