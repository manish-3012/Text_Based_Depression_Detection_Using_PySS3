Just got rejected from my choice colleges Iâ€™ve worked my ass off for the last four years growing myself and my application to college. I just canâ€™t understand how my luck screwed me over this much. I have a higher than average gpa, im top 10% of my class, and my esaays were great. Yet i didnt get admitted into a place that has my major or is even situated in a location i want to live. It really sucks when ppl you are frienda with got into ucla and berkeley when your stats were better. 

Its like whenever I work hard at something to increase my chances its never enough. It has nothing to do with me, and everything to do with admission luck.
