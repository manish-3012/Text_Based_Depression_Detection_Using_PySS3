Bought myself a phone for Christmas Background:

A couple of weeks ago was Black Friday, and I decided that I wanted to upgrade from my old 5s during the sales. I consulted a friend and asked about what kinds of phones would be good as 'budget, but good'.

I decided to go for one of the Samsung phones, an A21 or A31, depending on the price on sale.

Black Friday comes, as we are driving to the shops, my mum said that she would *"put 200$ (aud) towards a new phone and you (me) would pay the rest."* I thought this was pretty good, as the phones I was looking at were around 300-400$

We go to the phone section and the A31 was down from 500$ to 350$ which I thought was a good price, so we bought that one. I set it up and was happy with it.

Today:

Today was/is Christmas, got some chocolates and shirts, nothing special, but that's fine, wasn't expecting anything big.

After everything was opened, my Dad said, "don't forget guys (I have two siblings), you're also getting money."

My mum then said, "but not \[me\], he already got his."

This kinda surprised me, as I didn't remember receiving any money. She went on to explain that my Christmas money was what went towards buying my phone.

...

Welp

I'm happy with the phone, but a bit of communication would have been nice.

Maybe I'm a choosing beggar, idk

Thoughts?
