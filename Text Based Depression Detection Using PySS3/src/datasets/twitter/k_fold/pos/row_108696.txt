Whoever does or says something deadly/harmful, and then says it's a joke, screw you. Whoever does that is just fucking terrible. 

Example: Say you're on discord or reddit or insta or whatever. And some guy decides to DM you. They say some racist stuff and "yOu dEsErVe tU di" and say they will come over and kill you.

Now, that shit alone is just fucking terrible. I mean who tf enjoys sending threats and shit in their spare time. 

Then say you respond by saying you will go to the police, who will get their address and arrest them for such things. 

They'll immediately do 1 of 2 things. Either make fun of you but retreat. Or say it was a fucking joke. 

The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this bitch.

You can't just fucking say death threats and shit are a fucking joke. Like it didn't sound like a joke to me. Sounded like you wanted to kill me for fun. 

Idk i just fucking hate people like that who think everything works out by just saying "Yo bro chill it was a joke."
