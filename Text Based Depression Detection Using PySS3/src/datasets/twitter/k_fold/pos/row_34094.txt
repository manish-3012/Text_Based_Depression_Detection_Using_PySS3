Went Shopping today, Had a funny Encounter So, I was in the next biggest City in my Country (Germany) and there were some douchebag far right Jehovas witnesses, and they were talking about how Jesus did for us and why we shouldn't waste that Jesus died for us and how we shouldn't waste his death, and then I shouted "HAIL SATAN!" and alot of people laughed, I too, and I then got away really quickly cuz one of the Guys was looking for us..
All of that was real, except the Last Part I Made Up in my Head and that I was too much of an introverted piece of Shit to shout that...
Yeah sounded better in my head
