Can I just say sum right quick My school is partnered with Google, Ok?

I have been well versed in Google classroom since the sixth grade, Ok?

Everyone in the school has a Google account.

We could be using hangouts for virtual classes and classroom for assignments, right?

My school system, however, decided on using the evermore shitty alternatives that are Zoom and Schoology.

Why!?

What in the double sided dildo sucking shortbus riding mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell hell is this!?!?!?

Kids have nerves too you know

And donâ€™t even get me started on how the teachers feel

I hate this nonsense with a burning passion
