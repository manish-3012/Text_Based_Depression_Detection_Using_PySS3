My 2021 is going swell so far /s In a personal aspect i feel like i have been stabbed multiple times. Was at least one of them in the back? abso-fokin-lutely it was. :))

My grades are going down, I'm about to lose a few of my good friends, my sister is leaving and i start crying for no reason at random points of the last 3 days. (If a certain frog loving art student is reading this, i sure hope you **fucking** know what wrong you did... if not contact me)

Is there more? Probably. 

Do i feel like shit?
You can bet your pretty little ass i do &lt;3

Do i wanna talk about it? Not really, no...

Hope y'all are having a better start of the year. How has it been 'till now?
