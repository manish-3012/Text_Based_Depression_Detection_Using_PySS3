i literally canâ€™t write anymore iâ€™m so sick of school
yes this is entirely my fault for procrastinating 
but i have an essay about romeo and juliet due within the next 30 hours or so
and i have an in-class 70 minute essay on the same day as that
and i also have a test on romeo and juliet
itâ€™s not like i havenâ€™t read the play or anything
like iâ€™ve paid attention in our discussions
but i canâ€™t put my thoughts into words
everything juts feels so stressful and overwhelming
iâ€™m trying to write outlines for my in-class essay and my romeo and juliet essay 
but iâ€™m honestly at such a loss
idk what to do anymore
