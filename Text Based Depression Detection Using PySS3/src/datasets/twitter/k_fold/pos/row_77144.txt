Underpaid hours Yall what do I do if I worked 12 hours but only got paid for 8 hours? I know I worked 3 shifts (4 hours each) so I basically only got paid for of those 2 days :/

Update: btw it wasnâ€™t on purpose. my managers are super chill and would never do that. it definitely was a technology problem.
