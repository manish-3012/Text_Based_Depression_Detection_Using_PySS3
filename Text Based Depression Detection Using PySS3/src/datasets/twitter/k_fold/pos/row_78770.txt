I'm a female feminist who adamantly believes in women and men's rights (so we can strive for equality) and I'm wondering what are some societal issues men face daily? As a women I know well the socetial problems directed towards women, but I cannot say what problems men face because I am not a man. I want to do my best straining for equality and that means by supporting both of our rights. 

So, what are some societal problems you, as a man, face daily?
