im giving up the horny life aight nerds, this aint it chief, this horny lifestyle isnt for me. i realized im just using it as a mask to cover up my lack of interesting qualities and valid hobbies. its actually making me uncomfortable and my conversations with other people suffer and inevitably end when they swerve into the nsfw category. so, this is it, your local hoe is quiting, i hope i actually have meaningful talks with people from now on. if ive ghosted you, im sorry, what can i say, ima bad person
