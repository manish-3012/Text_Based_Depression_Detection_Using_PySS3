More like Australian but still polish I'm form Poland and I hate it I'm so connected to Australian relatives that I stopped caring about polish grades but my English grades are awesome. All of  ppl that I talk to thay say that I sound like drunken Australian and I love it. You can make fun of my haha polish cunt but I broke the stereotypical polish man so many times. All to ppl that said that I don't belong in Poland i have one thing to say I agree with you. I HATE POLAND SO MUTCH. It's a bit off what did I just wright because I'm tried af.  G'night or G'day mates. 

Ps: I was raised in England so yeah I didn't experience that childhood in Poland but now I'm teen but and live in Poland and it's my biggest regret in my life
