OnlyJayus' apology might be the worst most plastic I've ever seen. We don't want to see your crocodile tears, we dont want you to share your platform with black creators. Admit you fucked up, dont blame it on your fucking age or anyone else but yourself, I'm all for personal growth and intellectual development when it's genuine. Ugh.
