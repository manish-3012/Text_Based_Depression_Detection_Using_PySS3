Do you want to die or do you want to stop the pain? Suicide never stops the pain, it just passes it onto someone else who doesnâ€™t deserve to feel that way as much as you didnâ€™t deserve to feel that way. Even if you think that nobody cares, there will always be people who will care about you but for the ones who donâ€™t, just cut them out of your lives because youâ€™ve gotta work towards a better future. I know depressions isnâ€™t as easy as just â€œcheering upâ€, but youâ€™ve gotta overcome it no matter what. Youâ€™ve only got one life and it shouldnâ€™t be wasted just because of the feelings of self-hatred, doubt, loneliness, etc. Itâ€™s always worse before it gets better so youâ€™ve gotta keep it pushing no matter what shit youâ€™re going through. If youâ€™re a victim of abuse and the abuser is still abusing you, then youâ€™ve gotta call the cops. Fuck the feeling of shyness if you get it. A quick conversation with the operator is an incredible investment to stop it from happening ever again from that person. Also, youâ€™ll find the right people eventually. Take care of yourselves. I know you have the strength to get through whatever youâ€™re dealing with no matter how doubtful that may be to you. I also urge to see a therapist or talk to a mental health hotline no matter how shy you may be. Just apply the same investment logic to it. There are probably more ways of dealing with this, but this helps me with similar things. Not with talking to people on the phone about my issues, but with normal everyday life, because I have Social Anxiety Disorder, so I know how much of a struggle life can be. Again, please take care of yourselves. I know itâ€™s easier said than done, but youâ€™ve gotta make an effort. Love you.
