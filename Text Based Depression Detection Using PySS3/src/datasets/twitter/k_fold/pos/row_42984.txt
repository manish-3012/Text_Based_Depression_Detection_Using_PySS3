People aged over 15 should be allowed to vote. These days, it is becoming more and more common to see teenagers become interested/involved in politics. Often times more so than their adult counterparts. Since teenagers are becoming much more knowledgeable about the world and are becoming more and more 'grown up', the age to vote should be lowered to accommodate these changes in the demography of late teens. Ultimately, a 16 year old today likely knows more and cares more about politics than a 20 year old ten or so years ago. We teenagers are becoming more intelligent and important than ever before, and to accomodate our advancements, we should have a say in this world.
