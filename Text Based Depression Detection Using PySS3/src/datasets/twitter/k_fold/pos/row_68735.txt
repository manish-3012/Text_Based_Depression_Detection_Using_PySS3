a girl kept calling me a cutie there was this girl in my summer camp who kept calling me a cutie. i always reacted weirdly to it and told her to stop because idk how to take compliments but inside that made me so so so so so happy. its been 3 weeks now the camp is over and i miss her and want her to call me that again so i can feel happy again.
