I got kicked out of my Zoom class for being sane So Iâ€™m sitting in my Writing Zoom class when my teacher says â€œCan everyone find something they value most in there room.â€ Iâ€™m like bet and I find the picture of my friend, who died a week after we took it. Some kids brought out a baseball they caught or a clay vase they made, but I just had my photo. My teacher, who Iâ€™m gonna call Mrs. Fucker, then said â€œIn the poem we just read, it talked about one day moving on and giving up what you love most. To reflect on that poem, Iâ€™d like you to destroy your items.â€ We thought Mrs. Fucker was joking until she said â€œGo onâ€. Right off the bat a girl asked why, and Mrs. Fucker said â€œTo reflect the poem. This is a assignment.â€ The other kids started destroying their shit except for me. I put the photo down and stared at the camera. â€œKritter, please work on you assignmentâ€ 

â€œNoâ€

â€œExcuse me?â€

â€œI fucking said no! You canâ€™t make me do shit to my stuffâ€

â€œThen Iâ€™ll have to kick you from this Zoom. Your parents will hear about this.â€

Idk if Mrs. Fucker was in drugs but sheâ€™s a bitch and Iâ€™m never gonna treat her the same again.
