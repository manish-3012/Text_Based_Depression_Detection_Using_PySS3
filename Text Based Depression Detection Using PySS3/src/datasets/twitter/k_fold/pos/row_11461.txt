My friend of 5 years accused me of circulating pics of his ex with people So a couple weeks back he asked me bout it saying â€œa friend told me u have been sending people xyzâ€™s pics?â€ I replied no naturally. His ex is one of my bestfriend or thats what i thought, so i save her picture mainly funny or memorable in occassion of her birthday. After randomally going through my phone one day without my consent he twisted me keeping her ex photo into thinking that i circulated the pics and i lied earlier. And the funny part is he didnt even tell me this on my face, a mutual friend told me that the friend and his ex are mad at me for apparently circulating her pics. I didnt ever see this coming, ik this guy for 5 years and he last dated this ex a year ago and he still has the audacity to accuse me of something. I was speechless and i gained an ego of my own. â€œAfter 5 years of friendship he still thinks i could do that then fuck this friendshipâ€ i say this to anyone who asks what happened. My girlfriend of 2 years tried to talk to him saying she had my account and i never sent any pics to anyone but hes just taken it as a fact that i did so i said fuck that guy and his ex/my ex bestfriend. I have not been talking to them and i feel uncomfortable talking to friends who still thinks i did that(i read expressions well so ik if they still think i did that) and i am right now sitting on the last bench in class alone rethinking life lol

Tl;Dr - my friend assumed i shared his exâ€™s pics with people and now i dont have friends
