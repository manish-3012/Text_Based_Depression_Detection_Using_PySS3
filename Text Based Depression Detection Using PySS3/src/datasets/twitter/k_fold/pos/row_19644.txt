Arguments pro-anti free will? For clarity's sake this is about whether we have it or not I personally believe that we are a product of our environment, meaning that factors such as: who raised us, where we live, what our socio-economical status is etc determine who we become and what choices we make long before we make said choices. Also i believe that people can only change if you change their environment. What are your thoughts?
