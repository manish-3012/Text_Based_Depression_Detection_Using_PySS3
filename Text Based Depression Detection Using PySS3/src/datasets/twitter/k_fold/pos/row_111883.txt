[F15] SERIOUS ADVICE NEEDED ABT INSTA DMS PLS HELP ME OK GUYS, you may have seen a previous post similar to this. is was abt advice needed for asking abt my phone back. OK quick run down, my parents took my phone in march because i used snap when i wasnt allowed, and had a 2nd insta account (i did it because i wanted privacy from them). ANYWAY fast forward to now. I STILL DONT HAVE IT. but i was going to ask again today/tmr. this will entail them searching it again.

OK so i was just double checking i cleared anything off my insta they may see as bad, when all the sudden dms from 2018 come back THAT I DELETED A YEAR AGO. but now they show as me messaging myself. (there were others that were deleted accounts, but they let me delete them easily) so idk if the other person blocked me, or deleted their account or what. but the messages wont let me clear them. everytime i try they say "something was not right, retry" or something like that. i even logged in on a friends phone and it STILL WOULDNT WORK.

my parents seriously cant see these dms, so if anyone knows how to fix this PLS HELP ME. 

im fucked if i cant delete them
