I hate having crushes bc they never like me back and of course my brain chooses to only focus on ONE person..meaning that ill have no backup crush once I find out my crush doesn't like me. sad face emoji. :( also its very hard for me to get over crushes/friends. it takes a long time. but then i do like having crushes bc i feel like they give my life some sort of purpose. and feeling. otherwise im just existing without much excitement. wow what made me so emo tonight? im not even depressed!
