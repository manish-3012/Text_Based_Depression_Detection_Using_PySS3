About mortality Even though Iâ€™m 15, and intend to live longer, I question how many years I have left. Iâ€™ve had that same question on the daily since early July last year with the Passing of Cameron Boyce. For such a young man to die so unexpectedly was a surprise. Recently, with the sudden tragedy of Chadwick Bosemanâ€™s passing, the thought just looms around my head that any day anyone can pass. It doesnâ€™t matter oneâ€™s age, tomorrow isnâ€™t promised for anyone and people should try to take full advantage of the day and the people around them. Itâ€™s a sad feeling, I know that, but itâ€™s inevitable. Itâ€™s never too early or too late to appreciate everything the world has given to you today, for it may be gone the next.
