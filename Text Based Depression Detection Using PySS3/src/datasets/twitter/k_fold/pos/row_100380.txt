My step mom is making me really pissed but I dont want to be ungrateful I recently moved in with my dad and my step mom and me get along pretty well. We don't have the same views on a lot of things but I try not to be ungrateful and rude considering she let me move in with her and my dad. Let me start by saying I have social anxiety and I'm always akward. So when I came home and told my step mom I made a friend of course she was excited. We've been friends for a while now and I'll admit that I kinda like him I haven't told my step mom cause were just not that close. But me and my friend don't really get to hang out cause my step mom doesn't like the idea of it. My dad is fine with us hanging out at my house. I can understand her not wanting me to go to his house thats reasonable. But to not let us hang out ever is stupid. Then she says she's going to take my phone cause I talk to him too much. Like I don't see a problem with talking to him. When I get home from school I still do my chores and all my homework and I eat food and I conversate with my family. Its not like I go strait to talking to him. I still have good grades and I still get everything done that I need to. She's acting like all I do is talk to him and it's really pissing me off. There's a lot of things that I really don't agree with her on but I've been keeping my mouth shut as to not cause conflicts. Some of the things are what I wear to school what I eat for lunch what I do in my spare time. Like I can under stand she dont want me going to school looking bad. But my closet isn't even mine at this point. Our styles are so different. I don't wear all black, I don't dress with my butt hanging out. She says that just cause I like horror movies and books doesn't mean I should dress like a need. I'm just getting really mad about how she pushes aside my opinion on my life. I understand she's and adult and is looking out for me but I dont hangout with drug addicts and I do what I'm supposed to. I should be able to talk to my single friend for an hour or so without her acting like I'm never there.
