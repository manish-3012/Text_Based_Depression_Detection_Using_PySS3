Does anybody else also dislikes it when humans anthropormorphize their cats or dogs? Like no, don't wash your Cat in the bathtub, it's the most clean Animal already. No, don't give your dog some clothes because it looks ,,good".  It's animal cruelty they overheat in such clothes. And no, when you Tell your dog ,,Don't do this or that again" and he does it again, don't be mad at him. He doesn't understands you god damnit it's a dog.
