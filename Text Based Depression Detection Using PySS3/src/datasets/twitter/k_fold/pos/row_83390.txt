I found a group of (probably) transphobic redditors who think a teen canâ€™t be transgender I found them in the comments to (this post)[https://www.reddit.com/r/averageredditor/comments/iadyv1/heckin_valid_and_groomed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf]. Itâ€™s a literally cesspool of piece of shit transphobes. Can yâ€™all do your thing and reign hell? This thread is horrible
