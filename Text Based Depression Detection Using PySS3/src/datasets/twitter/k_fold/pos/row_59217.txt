I am actually a teen now. Well, I wanted to make this post but I have nothing to say so I'll just list reasons this is good and why it isn't I guess.

1. My google account doesn't require supervision anymore.
2. I have my very own PC now.
3. I am old enough to get better-paying chores.
4. I got a bigger room.
5. I suddenly don't have the urge to call random strangers online gay.
6. It's way too early to be awake.
7.  Apparently, I don't have enough chores for a teenager.
8. I am expecting a "talk" soon.
9. I still feel immature.
10. I don't know what to flair this post.
