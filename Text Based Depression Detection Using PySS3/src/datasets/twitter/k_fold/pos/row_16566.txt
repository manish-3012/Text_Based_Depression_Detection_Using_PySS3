Don't wanna brag or anything... But I have the best birthday tommorow. I got a drama exam, followed by a science test, then music which I suck at, then we gonna go straight into a sponsored Cross Country run followed by our English Assessment. Did i forget to mention my sister has a football match which is in England so my Mum and Sister won't even be here for my B-day.

Won't lie but I don't think its possible to top this.
