iâ€™m finally dating my crush iâ€™ve liked this guy (iâ€™m a girl) since my first year of high school and we talked on and off for months at a time, we were friends and contact fell through 2 or 3 times, this last time i started to talk to him again i finally told him that i liked him and that i had since last year and he said it back, he said he thought heâ€™d lost me forever, and now, after more than a year, iâ€™m dating the person iâ€™ve wanted to be with since i started high school. i donâ€™t know why i posted this, iâ€™m just so happy right now and i needed to be happy somewhere. thank you for reading!!!

tl;dr: iâ€™m dating someone iâ€™ve had a crush on for over a year now, and i needed an outlet for all the happiness iâ€™m feeling right now
