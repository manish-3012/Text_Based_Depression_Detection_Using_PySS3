just my onion my onion on tiktok is that it's cringe, but it doesn't matter about my onion, it matters about whether or not you enjoy it. SO go ahead and use it, it's your life and no amount of redditors saying "bahaha tiktok bad" on cringetopia should change that for you! people always have different onions
