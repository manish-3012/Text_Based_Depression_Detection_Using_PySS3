Let's play a game: Ask me a question, I will answer it, then u edit your original question to make me look like an asshole.

2 rules:

1) no questions that require a simple yes or no response

2) no questions that require a number response

Rules because those answers are too vague and there's no creativity

Aight, do your worst
