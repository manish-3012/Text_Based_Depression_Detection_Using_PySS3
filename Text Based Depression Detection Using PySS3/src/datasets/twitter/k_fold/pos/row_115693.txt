The story of my 2020 experience. This year was... really hard for me, even excluding covid and all the other world problems, i really suffered horribly this year. I just thought that maybe instead of keeping this bottled up id share it with yall

At the beginning of the year, i was unbanned from the official smg4 discord server. It was the only server i truly ever felt like i was a part of, and i had no friends on discord or irl. And the reason for my initial ban was because i refused to give free money to a mod, so that itself was frustrating. I was able to stay there for a little while, which was fun while it lasted.

Around this time i had met and fallen in love with a guy from my school, and we dated for a little while. He physically and sexually abused me, and kept demanding that i do different sexual favors for him over and over again. Eventually one day he decided to do what i imagine he had wanted to do since the beginning. I was reluctantly naked in front of him one day, and he took that opportunity to rape me.

By then i had experienced lots of drama in the smg4 discord and was eventually banned shortly after this. I broke up with my boyfriend the next time i saw him after the rape (and kicked him in the balls) but after my ban and my rape i had never felt more alone. I did make a few friends in the smg4 server who stayed by me, including one named spring, and he added me to a group chat with his friends. I became friends with everyone else there, and for a time, i was actually happy, knowing i had someone who cared about me.

Until i became the source of a lot of drama, and i was banned. Everyone in the group chat had.. decided to forget all about me, except for one person, named dragonlinx. He stood by my side for pretty much the entirety of may when i had nobody else left, and he saved me from suicide multiple times. Eventually, he helped me reach out to spring and i was able to clear things up with everyone and they accepted me back.

Back in 2018 and 2019 i only had 2 true friends, knucky and korok. The 3 of us loved to have fun together and hang out, but honestly i was an extreme asshole to both of them, and they both blocked me eventually. Around the time spring introduced me to his friends, i was able to reconnect with knucky, but still our friendship was barely existent. 

After a while, me and spring fell in love with each other, and these short months where what caused some of the only happiness i had felt all year. Eventually i met someone named sand who i quickly became great friends with. He was suffering with a failing heart and i wanted to do all i could to make sure he was happy. My relationship with spring was slowly starting to become weaker as we got into more arguments, until he eventually broke up with me in october, and removed me from his life.

Shortly before this happened, almost everyone else also blocked me, and thus began a period of a lot of pain. My only friends anymore were sand, green, knucky, and one of springs friends named sonic. A few months before this, i had discovered a jojos bizarre adventure server called mudalads, and i made a lot of friends there, until one day i was banned for something i didnt even do, and none of my other friends from there even cared about me anymore. Just after my breakup with spring, me and sand had a falling-out and that, combined with my ban from mudalads, broke me more than anything else could have. 

So there i was, helpless, scared, not knowing what to do. I came very close to suicide multiple times. Later sand was willing to become friends again, and i was able to reach out to spring, who rejected my request to be friends again. Me and sand were good friends for a short time, and we started a relationship that wasnt exactly pleasant. A lot of arguments took place and a lot of struggling and anger and pain was existent between us. He later broke up with me, and shortly after that spring allowed me to be his friend again. But later, he went back on his decision and blocked me again, shortly followed by sand blocking me and removing me from his life without any explanation. 

It was at this point that i attempted suicide, stabbing myself in the chest. I failed, as the knife was blocked by my ribs, preventing it from going too deep. Later, a few days ago, knucky introduced me to her friends, and i introduced sonic and green to them. Thanks to them im finally able to feel a little bit of happiness after a long, painful year that was a nightmare to go through. 

Knucky, green, sonic, if ur reading this, thank u for everything u have done for me, i appreciate all of u so much and im so thankful to have u in my life.

So yeah uh, that was just a little vent that i felt like i kinda should get off my chest. I just wanted to share my story with yall, and what happened to me over the past year

If uve gotten this far, thanks for reading, and i hope u have a great day and a great 2021
