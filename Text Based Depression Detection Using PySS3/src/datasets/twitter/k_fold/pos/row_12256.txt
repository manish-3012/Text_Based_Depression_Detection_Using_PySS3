A man bought me an entire breakfast at the bakery today He was so nice. I said he could order first and then he said "Thanks, do you want something?" I was like "I'm just gonna get some bread for breakfast", He replied: "Really? Don't you want more?" And when I said I didn't bring enough money, he bought me the bread, some jam and 2 Sandwiches.

That was wholesome
