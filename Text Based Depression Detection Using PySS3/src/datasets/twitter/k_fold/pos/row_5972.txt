Random song lyrics until I get a girlfriend day #4. From the song Periscope by Papa Roach featuring Skylar Grey â€œI don't want to dive in first
You don't want to hear these words
It's only going to make it worse
You don't want to live that curse
You're telling me to keep my hope
Cause you've got a heart of gold
But maybe you should let me go
I'll love you through a periscopeâ€
