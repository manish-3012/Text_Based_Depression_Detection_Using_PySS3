The Super Trigger.444 YouTube channel Does anyone know about the Super Trigger.444 YouTube channel?

I found their video in my my recommended just now. They have one video and itâ€™s weird. Just random noises over an image which I canâ€™t totally make out but it looks kinda like the Jurassic Park logo. Normally I wouldnâ€™t post about it but itâ€™s weird because had no views and I got it in my recommended just after it was uploaded as if it were something I would normally watch. The whole thing is really eerie.
