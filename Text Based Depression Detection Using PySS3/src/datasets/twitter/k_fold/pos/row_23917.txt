When a girl violently castrates a guy to violate him as a male, isn't that at least as violating, horrible and wrong as rape? Unless she does it as revenge for rape of course.

Why do series and movies often portray this as "deserved", or as not NEARLY as fucking horrible and wrong as it is, or as "girlpower"?
