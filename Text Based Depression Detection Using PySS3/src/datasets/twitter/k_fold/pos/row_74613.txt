Anyone listening to rock music?? I never in my live met a person that is listening to similar music as i do, which a bit sad for me. But what music do you listen to. I personaly like: Beatles, Radiohead, Muse, Pixies, Coldplay, Tame Impala, Beirut. They arent really exactly rock.but theyre there somewhere. Have you got any recommendations for music??
