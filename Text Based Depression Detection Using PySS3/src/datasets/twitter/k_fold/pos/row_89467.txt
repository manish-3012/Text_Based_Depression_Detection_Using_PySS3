Stressed about leading a team. Donâ€™t know if itâ€™s valid or iâ€™m just overreacting. Yo so iâ€™m a Senior who is a part of my Schoolâ€™s NHS and i started a committee where iâ€™m the leader and to start i need to contact teachers and have a partnership sort thingy so they give the students benefits (extra marks etc.) and to collect info and opinions from students to make a live event or video to get people into our team.

So far no one responded except 2 to a simple google form and a message and from my group, man that shattered my confidence and now Iâ€™m stressing out thinking about if this will go on or succeed.

We have a National Holliday for like 5 days, maybe its because its a break and they dont want to work?

Idk what to think anymore as the questions was simple and wouldnâ€™t take much to think of it.
Man this unnecessary stress and anxiety sucks.
