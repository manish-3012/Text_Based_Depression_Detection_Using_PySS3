My mom has the most inffencent allowance system. My mother has an app where each week she gives me $5.  But the thing is it's not connected to any credit card, she still owns the money, she just "owes" me it.
But my mother is a single mother and earns shit.  I'm pretty sure I have $400 on that app, but I don't know because i deleted it because any time i would ask for something she'd say she couldn't afford it, even though I had enough money on the app.

I want to get a job so I can get a steady income, and though im 14, the chickfila 10-15 minutes away hires 14 year olds.  But my mom says that she doesn't want to drive me back and forth (which is fine excuse ti me), and that I have money on the app and from my birthday.

Mom.  You don't have the money to buy shit.  $100 can't buy shit.  Please stop saying "Oh, you don't need to get a job yet, you have money," because *you* don't.

and please stop saying that i have birthday money too.  I don't count it because you'll eventually "use" to "buy clothes" without my permission.
