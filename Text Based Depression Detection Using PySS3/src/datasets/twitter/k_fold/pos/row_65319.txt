Ending my life January 2021 at 12 am I have decided that the struggle isnâ€™t worth it and I would rather be gone. Iâ€™m going to take this time to go out more and enjoy the little things. I think Iâ€™ve picked a good date that gives me enough time to do some of the stuff I want to do before Iâ€™m gone. Been sitting here for a while thinking about other things to say but I donâ€™t know so I guess thatâ€™s it. You guys are all super great and I love you. Reddit has gotten me through a lot of tough spots and I thank you for that. Sorry this post is kinda all over the place I donâ€™t care lol. If anybody wants a Fender Stratocaster pm me and we will figure something out. Anyways Iâ€™ve talked for long enough so I guess thatâ€™s it.
