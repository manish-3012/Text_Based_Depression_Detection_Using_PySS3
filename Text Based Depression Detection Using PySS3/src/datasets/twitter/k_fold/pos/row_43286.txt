I think I'm gradually losing my privacy I used to have lots of privacy: my parents would knock, now they just barge in unless I'm in online class. my parents wouldn't check my phone, but one time they wanted to see the reddit memes for some laughs, they couldn't find reddit, so they opened almost all of my phone apps, now they eventually find reddit, click on a subreddit that I've never even skimmed before, and it had fat ladies all over it. once they were done, they told me it was a "joke". other than that, I'm in the clear for now. I'm just worried it will get worse
