My best friend is dying nad there is nothing i can do about it (sorry mobile post) Tldr: my grandfather has a disorder from the parkinson family of disorder and this ks my rant about seeing him slowly lose all control.

My best friend maybe the only person in my life i can call my true friend who was there from my birth all the way thru all ups and downs to the second i post this and hopefully after that is ever so slowly dying. 

My grandfather who i love and cherish probably more than my life has some disorder from the parkinson family of disorders. The disorder is slowly killing his muscles he is losing all his mobility and control over his body, every day he falls in the last 2 months he had 2 falls resulting in fatal head injury and he fell again yesterday and this was a gruesome one, and today i was sitting with him he started talking about his will and stuff after him and it was so hard not to breakdown into a crying mess it was like yesterday this man was giving me piggyback rides and taking me on long drives at 3am because I couldn't sleep. We would laugh together cry together, gobble up liters of ice cream and sweets, working around in his garden playing. And today he can't stand up without someone holding him he can't speak without choking on his own spit he can't eat without the food spilling all over him. 

And it hurts like hell to see him like this struggling. It is scary always living in the fear of receiving a call someday that he fell and didn't get back up. Its so hard.
