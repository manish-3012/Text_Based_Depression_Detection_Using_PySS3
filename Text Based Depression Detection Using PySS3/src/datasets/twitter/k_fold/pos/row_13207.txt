I'm giving you a crazy opportunity only available for like 10 minutes You can pick what I'm gonna eat for a pre bed meal!!! I'm thinking strawberry protein smoothie, blueberry protein smoothie, blueberry protein bar, vanilla protein shake, or just strawberries and blueberries and some scrambled eggs, or maybe popcorn. I don't really have any goals rn, I'm kinda trying to bulk, but I mean also I don't really care which is why just popcorn is an option. Or give me a choice not on the list and if I like it I'll eat it Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
