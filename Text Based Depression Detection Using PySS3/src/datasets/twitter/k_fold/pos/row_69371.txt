Today I had a lucid dream and it was AWESOME! A lucid dream means: while you're dreaming, you know it's a dream. Therefore you can change, what's happening and will happen. Pretty cool, right?

So, out of nowhere, I had one of these dreams day today! oh boy, I love it!

Firstly, I stand at the hills of switz. The view was great! Let's say, imagine a really cool looking snowy forest. Tell me how the first tree looks. I bet you only see a blury tree, right? Not in the dreams! I saw every little detail of the snow tree. I remeber thinking to myself: "damn, it looks so realistic for beeing a dream."

So, I went skiing and dream-skiing is the best. I was fast and jumped as high as I am tall. After this, I decided to use my ability to talk to people, I could never ever talked to in rl. I'm a writer, so I decided to meet some of my book characters and it worked.

BUT some parts were pretty dissapointing. For example, I coulnd't create things out of nothing. I wished to see my book charcters, but to do so, I needed to go to a forest, where they live, so my dream logic was satisfied. lmao. I'm bad at explaing this. It just was like this.

Secondly, touching is quiete dissapointing too. The vision is great, but touch a cat, naaah... I don't really feel the fur, but all in all, I hope I'll have a dream like this soon again.
