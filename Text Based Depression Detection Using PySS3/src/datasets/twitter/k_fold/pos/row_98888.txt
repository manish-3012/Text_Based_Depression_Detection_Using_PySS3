I forgot my gym shirt ðŸ˜€ I have to do gym in my shirt which is one of those shirts youâ€™d never wear unless you have nothing else to wear. Itâ€™s low cut, short sleeved and shoes my bra so Iâ€™m gonna go die now. Im wearing a hoodie over it currently but I canâ€™t wear a hoodie to gym.

Then after school, I have dance and thatâ€™s going to be even worse without a gym shirt. On Monday, my dance teacher told me to go out and buy some more gym shirts (which I didnâ€™t do and was planning on wearing an old one) because I only have one.
