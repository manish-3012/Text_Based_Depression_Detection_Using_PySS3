The only bit I remember from my dream today I was working in a phone store with some friends and a big hairy creep came and touched my face and he was like â€œwhat do you have for me today dollâ€ and everyone were scared of him but I told him â€œplease donâ€™t touch me. itâ€™s uncomfortable.â€ in a strict voice and then he got mad and violent and tried to squeeze the living fuck out of me saying Iâ€™m rude and thatâ€™s not how you should treat a customer and that I shouldâ€™ve just stayed quiet. Then I "woke up" in my living room and my dad was just stretching on the floor and he whispered something and I couldnâ€™t hear it. Then I got closer and he said the creepâ€™s name and told me I should think about the meaning of that dream and I was like â€œuh, no, I donâ€™t think so.â€ 

The end
