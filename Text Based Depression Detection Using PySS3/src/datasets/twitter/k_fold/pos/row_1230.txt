Dang it... Well, today I went for a lonely walk in the theme park nearby. And then a group of girls were approaching me, as a muslim and Egyptian I shouldn't look at or bother girls, so I didn't. But a girl from them hesitantly waved at me but looks like she got shy and stopped, I didn't even turn my face. So, yeah morally I did the right thing, but deep down I have regrets.
