My dog isnâ€™t feeling well and my dad was tearing up Iâ€™m worried because my dog is throwing up and she has diarrhea. Itâ€™s really scary because we donâ€™t know if she ate something bad. She loves my dad more than life itself and itâ€™s really sweet how worried he is. My dog literally runs to him when we say â€œwhereâ€™s your guyâ€ and I think it would break him if she died.

Anyway, I just wanted to share.
