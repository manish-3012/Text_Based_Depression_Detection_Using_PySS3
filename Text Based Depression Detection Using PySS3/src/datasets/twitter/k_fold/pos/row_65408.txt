Some useless rant about subreddits I hate it when you're new to a sub and you make your first posts there and they start policing your posts in an a-hole way. It's so awful and makes the new people feel unwelcome. If you are the type of person who says things like "How does this belong in this sub?" when the person who posted it felt like it belongs there, please stop before you make someone feel unwelcome. Instead, you can report the post if you think it breaks the rules. It's a lot better for the OP and they will improve their decision later
