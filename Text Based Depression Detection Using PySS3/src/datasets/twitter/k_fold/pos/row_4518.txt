Please help, my mom is trying to get me to find something for Christmas, but I honestly donâ€™t want anything. My mom will be shopping soon and had asked me what I want. I tell her I donâ€™t want anything, but she insists on getting me something. I donâ€™t know what to get, I need help. 

Knowing what I like will help. Iâ€™m a gamer, but thereâ€™s no games I really want right now. Iâ€™m also a musician, but instruments can get expensive. I believe Iâ€™m growing out of LEGO, but itâ€™s overpriced anyways.
