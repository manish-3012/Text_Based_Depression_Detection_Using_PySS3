my school is dumb when i was about to eat lunch at my school (we have those keep your distance floor signs) this one girl was right at my back and i asked for distance and she legit went like "but who cares?", its so stupid and maddening that i cant imagine something worse than not keeping distance in a pandemic, like people are dying bc of it
