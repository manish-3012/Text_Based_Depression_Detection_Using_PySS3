I hate myself with a PASSION. Everything that's happening to me is my fault and I'm not doing SHIT to fix it. I waste all of my mental energy hating myself and when I do that I don't have enough energy to to what I need to. Which just leads to more self-loathing I cry myself to sleep at night knowing tomorrow isn't gonna be any different. I think I have what I need to get my shit together, and then I fuck it all up the very next day. I don't ACT on any of my thoughts which could be considered a good thing in relation to some of the stuff I think about. I don't know what to do. Am I just destined to be the depressed, ugly nobody with god-awful grades who sits in the back of the class drawing on his hand because he was too lazy to fight for his future?I  just don't feel like I'm in control of my life. I feel uncomfortable in my own body. Not in a trans way but like, feel like a background character in everyone's life. Including my own. I just wanna be okay again...
