So. My depression suddenly got worse and now I'm slipping in school and everything is going to shit How do I fix this?? I've always had slight mental issues, ptsd, depression, anxiety, all that Jazz. But I always handle it, my coping mechanism IS school, when I want to escape life I do homework. That's how I've succeeded so far. Why is it that now I just want to lay and stay laying and do nothing all day. 

And I was getting LESS depressed recently. Over the years I went from angsty suicidal preteen to sorta pessimistic teen to an almost optimistic normal person. 

What happened??? How do I force myself to get work done? How do I go back to how I was? Why can't I get my brain to focus on anything anymore?

And I have so much work I need to get done, so much of it is already late, so much content I need to reteach myself since I can't remember class this past couple weeks
