What are some of your parents' techniques that backfired? Like when I was young my dad used to always tell me that my cousins always got 99% or above ( obviously a lie) and even if I got like 97% he would just say that I didn't do as well as others. Now I hate to study, can't believe in myself in whatever I do. I still try my best in things I like but I have to keep reminding myself that my parents will not appreciate me
