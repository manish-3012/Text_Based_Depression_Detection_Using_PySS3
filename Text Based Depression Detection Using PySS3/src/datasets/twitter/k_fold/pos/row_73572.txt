I just watched porn for the first time I had a browse on some porn subreddits and honestly itâ€™s just a bit gross imo. Very overrated and repetitive. I kind of wanted to see what the hype was about since people on teenage subreddits talk about porn a lot, but nah itâ€™s just not really that interesting.

I had a look at a lot of different types, and saw a lot of genitals. The only really interesting bit about my venture was seeing other womenâ€™s vaginas, because theyâ€™re all shaped differently which is kind of cool. I knew penises came in different shapes but I didnâ€™t realise how differently shaped vaginas could be.

Overall Iâ€™d give porn maybe a 1/10, putting it just a bit below those â€˜as seen on tvâ€™ adverts.
