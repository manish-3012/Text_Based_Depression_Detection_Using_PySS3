Im feeling lonely... I (15f) have been having trouble making friends at my school. The people who I thought were my friends left me behind. I was hoping you guys could be my friends. If it matters to you all I'm into cod, fallout, and minecraft. I also like to watch anime (mostly kill la kill). Dm me if you want to talk.
