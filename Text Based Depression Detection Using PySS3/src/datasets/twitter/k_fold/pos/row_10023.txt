This is a total bruh momentðŸ˜­ My grandpa uses a voice to text thing to send his messages and my mom was saying something like â€œI hate myself in picturesâ€ and his phone caught â€œsounds good andâ€, â€œAnd I hate youâ€. The text got sent to his best friend and then he sent back

â€œwhat you hate me, wtfâ€

ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­my mom had to call him to clear it upðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
