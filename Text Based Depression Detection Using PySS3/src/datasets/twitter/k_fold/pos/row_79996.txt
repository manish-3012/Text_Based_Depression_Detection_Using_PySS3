Trouble at home So at home my mum and dad still live together but they do not like each other that much me and my 3 year old brother are stuck in the middle of this my dad calls me obese which hurts me the most because in primary school I used to get bullied everyday for 3 years about not being as skinny as the other girls and my mum is constantly shouting at me for reasons I donâ€™t know my brother is pretty misbehaved and that make my mum and dad shout at him a lot I have anxiety other things like my brother getting killed or I get really scared about things like bird box or a quiet place but I can play a game like the last of us and not be scared at all
