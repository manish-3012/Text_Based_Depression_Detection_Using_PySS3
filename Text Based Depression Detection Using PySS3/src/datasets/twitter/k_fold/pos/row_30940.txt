Anyone else were scared even as a tween? I'm 17 now but up until the age of 13 I was terrified of almost everything from there being a tooth fairy to murderers that I couldn't ever sleep in my own room and had to sleep with my parents and they got tired of it so got me a therapist.

Now I'm so much more brave and used to watch so many horror movies but stopped because of how boring they are that I can fall asleep watching them however if that was at age 11 I'd be up all night even in my parents room.
