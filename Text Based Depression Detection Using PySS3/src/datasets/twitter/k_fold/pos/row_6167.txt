My acne scars kill my vibe Theyâ€™re pretty bad and treatment is kinda expensive cause you need a bunch of sessions, but I canâ€™t really do anything until I clear my skin. 3 yrs in with cystic acne and Iâ€™m still trying to figure that out

Sometimes I feel like the only person with craters on their face. I feel like nobody would wanna touch my cheeks n that it makes me less feminine. sucks. I lost most of the baby fat in my face in the past couple of months so theyâ€™re super noticeable now. Supposed to take senior pics next week ðŸ˜”
