Guys I just had the best experience playing paintball Iâ€™ve had in years Iâ€™ve been playing for about 3 or 4 years and only recently got into the tournament or competition side of the sport in my state there wasnâ€™t any games or a good field but a old pro coach decided to get his old feild and bring paintball back to my state Iâ€™m so happy he even made his own league for the feild and players it was the best time Iâ€™ve had in years especially with everything thatâ€™s been happening lately
