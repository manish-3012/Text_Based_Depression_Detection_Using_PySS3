All these songs are sung by the Japanese in English. Their English may not be fluent...(I'm Japanese, so I can't evaluate their English ability) How do you think? They are all outward-looking and want the world to hear their songs. I'm happy that you discover this music. https://open.spotify.com/user/22yxcbwyk7ldxw555qrynooma/playlist/6fVSzxkvhhSrj5xAwq35qv?si=uKZuxqRXQN6ChZEkXwhAhQ
