My (ex) kissed me without my consent So there was this girl and we were having a sleepover and me and my ex and my friend were all there and we were just joking around when she kissed me, this was my first kiss ever and I didnâ€™t want it to be from her I told her to stop and she didnâ€™t this happened a few weeks ago and we cut her out of our lives but it still makes me really upset
