This is the best day ever! I came out to my best friend as being demisexual. I was tbh super nervous. But she was super supportive, and told me that sheâ€™s bisexual! I am so glad that our friendship can continue without either of us judging each other. She is a lot more comfortable with her sexuality than me, and Iâ€™m so proud of her. Only her and Reddit know. But Iâ€™m super happy!
