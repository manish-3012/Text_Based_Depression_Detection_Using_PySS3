Did any of yâ€™all experience decreased happiness after you entered your preteen or teen years ? Iâ€™m 16 and I havenâ€™t really felt the same since when I was 10. I just feel less excited about things and less motivated but I wouldnâ€™t really say that Iâ€™m sad. I went to a psychologist to diagnose depression but she couldnâ€™t come to a conclusion if I had depression or not. My mom tells me itâ€™s a normal part of growing up to feel less excited or happy about things. Has anybody else also experienced this?
