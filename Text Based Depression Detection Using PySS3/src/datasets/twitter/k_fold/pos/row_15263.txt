Well boys and girls and everyone else, me and my gf are gonna go to the same HS Yep, you heard that right. 

How did this happen?

Well, you see, me and my gf both flunked our placement tests(not on purpose I swear), so our respective First Choice schools wont accept us, so our second-choice school did. (Which just happened to be the same school)

Yay
