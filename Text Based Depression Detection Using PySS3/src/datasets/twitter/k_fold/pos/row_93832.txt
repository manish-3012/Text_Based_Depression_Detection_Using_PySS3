Would you think it gross if you had a female friend who chooses not to shave her arm-pits? I'm sick and tired of shaving my pits. I get ingrown hairs and Knicks that kill when I put deodorant on and I honestly just am so done with it. Boys don't have to shave their armpits, so why should I have to?

Would a girl not shaving her armpits make you think she was weird or be less attracted to her?
