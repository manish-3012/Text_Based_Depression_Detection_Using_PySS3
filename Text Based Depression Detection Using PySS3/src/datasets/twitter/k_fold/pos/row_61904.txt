Stonks but not really Started investing into cryptocurrency a little bit. So far I've lost quite a few dollars but nothing that'll kill me.  If Instead of waiting a little bit to see if they would go back up, I cashed out early to avoid losing even more. But when I checked today I could have made a decent bit if I'd just waited.

Moral of the story, don't abandon things altogether if they start going down, wait a little bit and maybe it'll get back up even higher
