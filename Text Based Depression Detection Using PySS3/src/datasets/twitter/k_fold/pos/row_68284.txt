I thought that I had everybody on my side But I went and blew it, all sky high And now she won't even spare a passing glance All just because I ripped my pants When big Larry came 'round just to put him down

SpongeBob turned into a clown

And no girl ever wants to dance

With a fool who went and ripped his pants


I know I shouldn't mope around I shouldn't curse

But the pain feels so much worse

'Cause windin' up with no one is a lot less fun
Than a burn from the sun, or sand in your buns

Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget

So listen and you won't regret

Be true to yourself don't miss your chance

And you won't end up like the fool who ripped 
His pants

Do you have a nostalgia boner yet
