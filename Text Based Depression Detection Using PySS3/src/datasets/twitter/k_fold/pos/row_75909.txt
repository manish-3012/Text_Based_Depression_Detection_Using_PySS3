Can we stop men and women international day? (READ EVERYTHING) Before you downvote me to oblivion, please read everything. Right now both men and women are oppressed in their own way. Men's mental health problems are being overlooked and women still isn't equal to men. I GOT AN IDEA! We can have a international day called something like "equal rights day"! Everyone gets included, men, women, non binary, lbgtq+, everyone! It would stop the bickering about who deserves it or not.
