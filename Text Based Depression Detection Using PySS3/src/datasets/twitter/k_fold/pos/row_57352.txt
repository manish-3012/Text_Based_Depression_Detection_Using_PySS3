had my first kiss today!! iâ€™m 16F and i went on what i tgought was a friend date today. but we ended up kissing twice and i definitely embrassed myself because i just sat there in shock and didnâ€™t really do much if you know what i mean LMAO but iâ€™m here to flex and also be amazed that my first kiss was a girl!!  iâ€™m not sure if iâ€™d want to date them but they are certainly attractive lmao but iâ€™m really happy. we havenâ€™t talked about it thiught, we just moved on IWNSUWNSWJSH 
to all the lonely reddittors out there tonight, iâ€™m sending love and luck in romantic and platonic relationships. 
happy valentineâ€™s day!
