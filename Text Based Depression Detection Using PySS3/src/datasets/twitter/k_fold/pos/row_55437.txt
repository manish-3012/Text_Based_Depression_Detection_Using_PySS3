First month of Reddit is over, what's next? I survived on Reddit for 1 month, it was tough but I made it. It is such an hostile place sometime, I don't even know why I am still here, just to suffer... Anyway, everyday that passed here made me more scared of what I could find on the Internet. I might get crazy if I stay here any longer
