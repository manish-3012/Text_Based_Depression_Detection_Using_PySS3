I just don't get it My parents keep on saying i have an attitude when im literally just tired like they expect me to wake up and be at 100% everything full of energy and pride and its not like i am just swearing or even acting mad im just tierd and i tell them this but they do that parent tone and say im just to young to understand like they are just a burst of energy all the time and sometimes i am mad but they dont even care or ask they just yell and so i 1.now im in trouble 2.im even more mad 3.i cant express it because they will just yell at me. Sometimes im just not that exited i just want to relax and vibe. But noooooooo they want me to be mr.happy and polite to everyone and everything without any regard to how i feel or anything. And plus its not like they are even like how they want me to be. I notice what they tell me and how they want me to act compare it to them and i gotta say its not looking good. And i know that im not perfect and they are trying. But sometimes they just need to know that im learning and in not an adult 

Mabey its just me idk
