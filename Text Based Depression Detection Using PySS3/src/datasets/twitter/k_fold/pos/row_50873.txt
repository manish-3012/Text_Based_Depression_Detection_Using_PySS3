I am 17 and should i just TRY beer once? I have never even touched any alcoholic beverages in my till date.
But i am getting an opportunity to try out beer with some of my friends (not because of peer pressure) maybe 2-3 sips and I don't need to worry about getting addicted to it as I am too shy to buy it.
So, I am just asking if it is worth trying ?
