Is 1 and a half hours enough time for video games? I am curious because all the friends that I know from school  and I regularly play with (about 5) play about triple the time I do. I always get off WAY before them, and I feel it is really limiting my experience with them. I tried talking to my parents about this, but everytime they either ground me, make me lose games for the next day, or take it away for the week. I at least feel that during quarantine (you know when your not really supposed to do anything at all) I should get maybe 2 hours, 3 hours? My parents really care about me, but like come on. PS, I try to exercise every day, at least 30 mins and I have strait A's in all my classes. So I am in no may unhealthy or have bad grades.

TL,DR. My parents give me a very short amount of game time, and compared to my friends I feel left out, and they won't do anything about it
