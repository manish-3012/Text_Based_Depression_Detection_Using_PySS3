Im born from a line of people trying to save relationships :/ My Grandma (dads side) was originally my Grandpas side chick but he ended up marry her so she wouldny find out she was the side chick (his gf was apparently fine with him having a side chick, knew about it and everything)

Then my parents came around and had me to attempt to save their marriage. That lasted a few years but sheesh, i sure do hope my inner incel will help me avoid this fate.
