this is definitely gonna happen I bet like halfway into our normal school year, when we finally are all vaccinated, weâ€™re going to thinkâ€man I wish I was i online school so I had more free timeâ€ or something like that, but then hopefully you tell yourself that thatâ€™s a stupid thing to think because it is. Iâ€™m having a horrible time in quarantine ;-; hopefully we never have to go through a pandemic again
