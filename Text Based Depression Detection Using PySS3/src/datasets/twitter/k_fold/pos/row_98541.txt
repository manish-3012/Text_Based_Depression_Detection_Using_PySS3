Is denying someone being trans tr*nsphobic?  

a small trigger warning, i dont even know if these words can be triggering to some but i just wanted people to be safe.

The only words that are possibly triggering are

m\*sgender\*ng

tr\*nsphb\*c

h\*omoph\*bic

de\*adn\*me

my friend denied my other friend, who is trans that he wasn't a boy because of his age. He was "too young" to decide (fyi, my friend was a year younger than him so idk)

i kicked him from the server for being transphobic

He asked repeatedly for my friend's dead name even when he didn't want to.

now my friend is mad at me because he considers invalidating someone being trans not transphobic because he didn't openly admit that he hated trans people. Please help me here.

was my friend being transphobic?
