i haven't had internet in the past week i can't listen to music that i haven't already downloaded and i've gone through my entire library and my youtube and tik tok is so fucking slow but at least i still netflix and hulu, wait never mind my netflix hasn't been paid for so my account is on hold and my hulu is about to run out. so moral of the story is that being broke fucking sucks
