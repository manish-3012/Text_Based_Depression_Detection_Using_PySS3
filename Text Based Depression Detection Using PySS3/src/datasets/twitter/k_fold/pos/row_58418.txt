Hi, I decided that I would formally introduce myself to this sub My name is yungest flexer because I'm literally the yungest flexer that you know. I drive a bmw and a Rover truck at only 16 years old. Together they cost about 200 grand. I only wear all designer (gucci,Louie fendy, etc.) and am next up in the industry. If you don't have at least 7 figures in the bank we can't be friends sorry. Also keep an eye on your girlfriends because I might take them
