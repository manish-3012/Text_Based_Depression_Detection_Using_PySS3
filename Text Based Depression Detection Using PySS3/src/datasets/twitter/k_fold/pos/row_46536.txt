Tiktok is toxic I used to love this platform. I was so invested in it, I studied the algorithm to get likes on my videos. 

I recreated a the algorithm, using the key factors of likes, shares, comments, and views.

It only kinda worked. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I spend a week on this I was so invested. I was going ham on this project making sure it was perfect.

After going through intense research and wondering why my version of the algorithm never worked, I had learned something.

This algorithm throws random people out to be popular. One of their videos will be a hit, but another wonâ€™t. 

This ultimately causes people to go insane because they think they can make it, when itâ€™s actually just a scam.

Thatâ€™s why people will do literally anything to get likes..

Donâ€™t get me wrong! The content can be good! Itâ€™s just the only reason youâ€™re seeing the content is because they are striving for these likes. Itâ€™s toxic.

My version of the algorithm only proves one thing and that was how insane I was going, to get likes and views. I had invested endless hours of programming. I was toxic.
