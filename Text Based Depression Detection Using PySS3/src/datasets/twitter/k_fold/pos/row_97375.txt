Hey I just wanna know if I should do something to my hair TLDR; Too bad read it


So a while back, in like May I got bored of my hair and so I decided to bleach the back of my hair and then bleach some bits of my bangs and front bits (kinda like the hair Charli Damelio has rn ig) and I dyed it half pink half purp and it was like pastel. Well they both faded into a rusty orange peach color. It became really nasty looking so I put brown back over my hair. That faded and now my hair is like a dark dusty brown rose in all those spots. I was wondering if I should do a quick bleach and then put a dark red over it? Would that be cute? Or should I just leave it and grow it out so I can cut my hair again and have it just all be virgin?
