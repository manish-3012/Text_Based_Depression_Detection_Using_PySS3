Itâ€™s my 17th birthday today And I couldnâ€™t give less of a fuck, which is strange. Just seems like every year my birthdays are becoming more of a normal day. Plus I donâ€™t really like the messages you get from old friends etc, I just find it awkward. Dreading going into college and checking snapchat. I sound like a miserable cunt right now but this is how Iâ€™m starting to feel every year itâ€™s my birthday, birthdays ainâ€™t special anymore.
