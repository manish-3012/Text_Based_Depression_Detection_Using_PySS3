I used to run a show for my group chat It was called the nocturnal meme show. My friend designed a logo, I presented memes every-night and generally things were good. UNTIL...*dramatic pause*..... I got burned out. Now the meme show group chat is just a place that people occasionally share memes. I might reboot it one day, start season 3. Thatâ€™s all folks, go about your reddit browsing.....
