The biggest revelation I had last year. Ok so the title doesn't have much of an explanation so, I shall explain. Last year while I was doing some work experience for an electrical company. with this it was the usual jobs you get when you're new to a workplace. Grab the tools, bring the power drill, sweep the workshop, etc. while I was on a worksite I was having a conversation with my supervising tradesperson and here's how it basically went down. For the purpose of simplifying ill call the supervising tradesperson "tradie".

tradie:  so what do you normally get at school in terms of grades?

me: I normally get the flat line of C's and the occasional B.

tradie: well you're in luck because grades are not important when getting hired.

me: you're joking?

and so the tradie I was with explained how that grades are absolutely useless unless you're getting into universities for degrees and qualifications. He explained that the only things employers care about are;  

A) Any experience about the job 

B) Skills you got e.g teamwork, problem-solving. 

C) any qualifications that are in there, e.g like a forklift ticket that allows you to legally operate a forklift

D) The biggest thing stressed is being able to work in the team, without being an asshole and stirring the pot.

This blew my mind because it just debunks the constant thing of "you must get good grades to go anywhere." because you can still go places with C's rather than A's.
