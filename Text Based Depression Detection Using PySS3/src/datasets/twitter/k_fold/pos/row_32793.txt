Truth about Life People won't be their in your tough times

People you think care about you won't give a damn
when you're in trouble

Only you will be there for you

You will be Fighting Alone

You will be strangers to love

I know the rules and you should too

You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you that Rick Astley is

Never Gonna Give You Up

Never Gonna Let You Down

Never Gonna Run Around and Desert You

Never Gonna Make You Cry

Never Gonna Say Goodbye

Never Gonna Tell a Lie And Hurt You
