Having 4 girls like you isn't really a good imo This is just gonna be me explaining the what happened to me before the world was on lockdown for 6 months. 

You've probably read my username wondering how tf I got 4 girls to like me, well, idfk but here we go anyway

Girl 1. Knew her for about 2 years before this happened. We never really talk to each other but this year we were sat next to each other in 3 classes. She was talkative and there was nothing I could do about that except talk back. We became friends and then in December 2019 I found out she liked me.

Girl 2. Also knew her for 2 years. She was also really talkative so we became friends when we first met. Christmas day in 2019 I was playing on my switch and she texted me. About an hour later she comes clear about how she feels.

Girl 3. I knew her for about 4 months at this time. In November she gets discord and one night she asks me for help on how to use it. We would spend hours every night talking to each other and eventually I started liking. I was too shy to tell her but then in January she starts liking me. We had a thing for about a month and a half which was cool while it lasted.

Girl 4. This one made no sense. We were in similar classes for 2 years but N E V E R talked to each other. Then all of a sudden she tells me she likes me in March. Thought she was joking but it turned out she was serious. 

The reason having 4 girls like you isn't good is because is stressful. Maybe it's just me but having to reject someone is hard because I start thinking about how they'll feel and if they'll be ok. And on top of that, pretty much everyone one was shipping me. With each of them. I just wanted a peaceful life.

So ye

Edit: sorry for bad english
