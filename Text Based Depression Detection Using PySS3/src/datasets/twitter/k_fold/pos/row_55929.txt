This is going to be hell of embarrassing, but I'm serious. Okay, so as many other people I too feel the urge to, you know, release my sexual tension. 

That fact alone gives me anxiety, as I feel kinda dirty for that, but still it is something that I need every once in a while, so I try to not think about that. 

Fact is, I live in a house where I cannot have much privacy, cause I'd have my siblings or my mother often use my room, and so on. 

The only place I found to be safe for taking my private 10 minutes is the bathroom, but I feel like a fucking creep cause this is a shared space, cause I worry that they know what I'm doing there and so on. 

Trust me, I know it sounds hilarious but it's true, I feel bad and I cannot stop overthinking that. 

Can you guys give me any sort of advice about that? Thanks.
