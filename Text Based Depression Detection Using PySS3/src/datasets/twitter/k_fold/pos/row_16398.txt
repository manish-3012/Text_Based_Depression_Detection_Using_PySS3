Im tryin to find a video Its a video (I think it was like 10-30 minutes) about how bad music can be good. I think they used 
 captin beef hearts an example. They also used an album that was a rock or metal band singing poems over hardcore instrumental. And also used my teenage dream ended as an example. I've been looking for quite a bit but I cant find it anymore.

Any help appreciated
