Feeling kinda insecure about a writing thing. So thereâ€™s this writing Contest. And I love writing and it basically the only thing Iâ€™m good at. (I have other hobbies Iâ€™m just not good at them). So my story is very long and other people all ready have their stories/poem out but shorter, that are really good. But now Iâ€™m just sitting here wondering if Iâ€™m good enough to even win. I joined this for fun and now Iâ€™m feeling bad about myself basically.
