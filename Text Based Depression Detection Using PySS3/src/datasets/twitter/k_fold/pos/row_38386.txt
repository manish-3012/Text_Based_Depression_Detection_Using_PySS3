I love my how much of a nerd my boyfriend is because... One moment we are just chilling, the next, he says "wait, second half of the siege battle? I forgot the first half? We are so f*cked." Then I tell him its alright and he just says "No Ally, it's not alright, I don't think you understand how absolutely f*cked we are." 


I guess it sounds kind of neglectful in post form, but in real life it's funny and I know he cares more about me then the darn siege battle.
