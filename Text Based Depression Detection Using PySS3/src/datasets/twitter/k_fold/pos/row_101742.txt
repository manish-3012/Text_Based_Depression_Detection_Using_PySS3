Could you figure me out? I am me, or so I think. I know the real me, the badass me, but I struck with the shy me around people I donâ€™t know, and the funny, open me around people I do know.

Here is my real personality and can someone tell me what it is:

Loves black with rainbow

Might be bisexual

Doesnâ€™t care what people think of me

Acts like a boy, and thinks itâ€™s a boy (sort of)

Is social with everyone

Wants to breakdance

Loves rap, pop, etc (pretty much all music)

What personality do I have, and what cloud should I hang out with?
