Iâ€™m going undercover to see what a former toxic friend is saying about me. Long story short I had a friend, and she left me for a toxic person who treated both her and I very horribly. Luckily, I still have a invite to the discord group sheâ€™s in. So tomorrow very early, Iâ€™m gonna go in with a new account and say that im a friend of mine. Then search for all the mean things she said about me. In case she tried to be my friend again. Iâ€™m a little scared. Wish me luck!
