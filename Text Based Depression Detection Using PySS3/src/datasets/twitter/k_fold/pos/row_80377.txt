I wrote a bad poem about my bones Roses are red
Violets are blue
OW I HURT MY SPINE
JESUS CHRIST CALL 911
GOD DAMN IT HURTS
OH FUCK OH FUCK
oh nevermind I never broke my spine 
I just OH OH MY GOD MY ULNA IS STICKING OUT MY GOD DAMN MY ARM HOLY SHIT AAAAH
IM IN SO MUCH PAIN FUCK AAAAAAAH 

That's is the end of my poem hoped you enjoyed (not  based on a true story) ;)
