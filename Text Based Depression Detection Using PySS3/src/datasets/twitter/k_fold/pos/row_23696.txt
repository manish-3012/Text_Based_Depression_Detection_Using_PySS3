Plan #652 to visit my girlfriend So my girlfriend lives out of state. It's been a really long two years without her, and I've tried 651 ways to bridge the distance! I haven't had any success at all, but I'm never short of ideas! How does this sound?

What if I take yoga classes to become *really* flexible so I can fold myself up into a truck's exhaust pipe and catch a ride to her area? I think that'll succeed where my other plans failed! Is there any way this can go wrong?
