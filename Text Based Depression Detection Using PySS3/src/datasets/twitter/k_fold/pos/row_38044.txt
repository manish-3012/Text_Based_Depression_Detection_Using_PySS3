officers that fire on peaceful protesters are violating the constitution Violating the first amendment. THEY ARE VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION THEY SWORE TO PROTECT AND ABIDE BY. Isnt it fun to watch peaceful protesters get shot by beanbag rounds in their fucking head? isnt it fun to watch the police using tear gas and pepper spray against protesters weapons that were deemed inhumane so they were banned from use in warfare? i love watching police use weapons that were deemed too inhumane to use against actual soldiers against peaceful protesters
