My mom always acts like she doesn't like my stuff and it's really annoying My mom and I love each other a lot but we got totally different taste in a lot of things, in movies, books, series, music and so on. 

She always makes fun about my music and the series I'm watching but when I'm downstairs watching my series she always comes down and watches a little bit to just talk about how bad it is. It's really funny sometimes but often it's akso just annoying. It was really bad when I watched TWD.

Does you mom/dad also do that?
