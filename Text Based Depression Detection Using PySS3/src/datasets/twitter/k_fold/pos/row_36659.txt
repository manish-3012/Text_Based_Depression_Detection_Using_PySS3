A few months ago I confessed to my crush... Before I went for it I kept reminding myself of a few words: Expect the best, be prepared for the worst. Of course when I actually did the confession she didn't feel the same way. For some reason though, I didn't really feel sad. Now looking back on things I realize that we weren't really the best for each other anyways. She's now found a guy who's more her speed and all I can say is I'm happy for her as one of her best friends. I'm still sitting here alone but life isn't so bad. I know that I'll find someone and to everyone else who is still searching: Stay strong because there will always be your chance, you just have to wait.
