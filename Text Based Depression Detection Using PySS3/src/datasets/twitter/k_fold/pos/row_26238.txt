My life story (not rly life more relationship but not rly) Iâ€™m complaining basically So basically in ninth grade I rly liked this guy and we were all in the same friend group and some lil bitch leaked that I had a crush on this guy and he got to know and he told me he had to think about it whatever the fuck that means. Then like three days later heâ€™s like lol no. So I was flat out rejected. He went as far to insult me being like what u wanted a homecoming date, good try. Well yea I was sad. I cut ties w him even though heâ€™s still in my friend group I just try to avoid him. I spent some time working on myself cuz I was very emotional :(. Fast forward now. Iâ€™m a senior. Well this fucker decides to text me about how he misses me and he regrets rejecting me and wants to go out and bullshit which I didnâ€™t believe. But he kept persisting and being all weird. Heâ€™s still hella hot so I was having mixed feelings. I donâ€™t think I looked any better I just lost some weight. Well Iâ€™m a sad piece of fuck so I screenshotted all his bull and sent it around muhahaha. Turns out he wasnâ€™t faking and he caught the feels and I kinda feel bad but I also donâ€™t cuz this fucking crab cake only cares about looks and not my very amazing personality(maybe). And now my insides feel weird.
