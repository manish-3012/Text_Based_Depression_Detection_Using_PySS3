Push &amp; Press (77) 4 Days Left of 2020. Wow. What a year it has been, a **rollercoaster.** **YOU** made it through, We made it through. **Together, Separately.** I am feeling tired, exhausted and I know you might be too, but THIS is not the time to stop or settle down, we **NEED** to keep pushing and pressing. With what we are focusing on, letting go, embracing, **KEEP PUSHING.**

Grey days. During Canada's winters it can be tough; spiritually, mentally &amp; physically. Seasonal Affective Disorder is prominent in all of us. If you are reading this from somewhere else in the world and you are asking me, Drey what is Seasonal Affective Disorder? Well Seasonal Affective Disorder affects us with the lack of sunshine and warmth we get it during the Winter Days usually from November all the way until March sometimes, wow.........I just realized how much of a battle it really is. **WE PRESS ON.** As I want you to **PUSH &amp; PRESS,** if you are from Canada or if you aren't, we are all exhausted and tired from this year. I believe in you to finish this year, in the strongest way **OF YOUR LIFE.**

It takes time. Its day to day. We should realize that every single person on the journey, will never had it all figured out, will never say "I'm healed", its not possible. There are many things we can heal from but that only allows us to then take on the next level and layer needed to heal. We are all **one**, we are all **different**. We are all **connected**, we are all **unique**. We are all **passionate**, we all have **different passions**. We all act in **kindness**, we all show **love**, **empathy** and **compassion** to **ourselves** and others in different ways.

This is what makes me feel so grateful to be a human and to have interactions and experiences with people from many different walks of life. To experience, listen and gain a perspective that I would not have learned. We must listen to one another. We must be **present.** Present with ourselves and the ones that we are allowed to surround ourselves with in this very moment. Things change quickly, friendships come and go, relationships come and go, the only one that will **ALWAYS** stay is **YOU. BE**there for others but remember that **YOU** have to **BE** there for **YOURSELF** first.

How are you suppose to grab the marbles in the jar for yourself if they have been all used up for everyone else? We only have a certain limit everyday. Use them wisely but be kind and empathetic. Release Ego.

I love you.
