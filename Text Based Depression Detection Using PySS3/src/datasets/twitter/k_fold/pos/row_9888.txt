Im lost So lost i feel so empty like im not me or something, and my girlfriend girlfriend is going through something with her body and its making her hate herself more than she usually does and i dont really know how i can help her with that i feel completely powerless and as if we are drifting apart almost. Idk. Im never able to think of the right things to say anymore i feel like im and npc but im watching from a different angle? I just feel so confused and hazy and i just dont know what to do about anything anymore.
