update on the "left on read" meme #8 so we were talking and idk I think I got indirectly friend-zoned but I'm not sure, she said "I really do enjoy talking to you, you're really nice and you're a great friend... " so I need advice on that I don't know if that's a normal thing to be said considering what happened the other days or did I actually get friend-zoned, I really don't know how this works and I need your help, thank you all ily &lt;3
