Going to school in person for the first time in over a year. Iâ€™m happy about it, but also really anxious. Iâ€™ve never even seen the face of the majority of the students, much less spoken to them. Only one of my good friends went into this tiny program at the biggest school in my very populated county. My schedule is going to change (they havenâ€™t told me how it will), the website we use for school deleted me (and only me) for some reason so I couldnâ€™t even see my assignments, and thereâ€™s testing tomorrow too to top it all off. Thereâ€™s so much and Iâ€™m just really worried something is going to go wrong (social anxiety doesnâ€™t help either). 

I wonâ€™t stay up for much longer because I have to get up at 6:00 AM for it tomorrow, but I might look at replies in the morning if I miss them.
