I just invited a girl I met over the summer for coffee and now I am waiting for her response. And stressing. I don't even know why I am stressed. Sure I had a crush on her during the sailing camp but I've tried calming myself down by just saying I'm just asking an acquaintance if she wants to meet for a coffee but it isn't helping me. We've chatted a bit over Instagram after the camp but it hasn't gotten very far. I just feel like I'm making a mistake. What if I fuck something up? We spoke Swedish at the sailing camp and we chat in Swedish online and I am just thinking what if I fuck something up and it gets lost in translation, since Swedish isn't my mother tongue. I don't even know if I should flair this post as social, rant or relationship. I feel like a mess right now.
