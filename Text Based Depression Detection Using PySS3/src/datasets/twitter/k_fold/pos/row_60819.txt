For the first time in 15 years I have ears When I was 2 I was attacked by two dogs and lost both my ears and am legally blind in my left eye

I am 17 and durring the summer (around June) I had surgery to get implants because I do not have earlobes and yesterday I received my prosthetics 
Im so ecstatic that Ive exhausted all my emotions and literally can not express my excitement 

Today I got a haircut and this is the shortest my hair has ever been in 15 years from hiding my head holes. Normally my hair would be about shoulder length and all I can say is it feels so weird to have short hair. Like the back of my head is cold

While I was getting my hair cut my grandma (who is my care taker, my mom was also there) came over and was telling my hairstylist to stop because "It WaS tOo ShOrT" and wouldnt stop so I told her to leave multiple times. She eventually did.
Later she came back when my hairstylist was almost done, she noticed that my hair was a little uneven and asked me to sit back down. My grandma said no because she didnt want it cut anymore
I didnt notice because of where i sat but my grandma had hit the stylist and stormed out of the store.

I still am very happy but this POS "guardian" of mine ruined a small portion of this for me.
