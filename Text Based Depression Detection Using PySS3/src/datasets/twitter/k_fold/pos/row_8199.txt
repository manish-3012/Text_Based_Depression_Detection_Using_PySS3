If NASA wasn't defunded after Apollo 17 we would been living in a more intellectual world If NASA hadn't stopped pushing harder into space astronauts, scientists, and engineers would be just highly regarded as reality show stars. If that happened society wouldn't be as dumbed down as it is. We probably wouldn't have these crazy conspiracy theorists.

People would probably emulate the discipline of the astronaut and stay home to stop the spread of Covid!
