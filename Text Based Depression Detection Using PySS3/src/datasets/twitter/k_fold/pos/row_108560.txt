does anyone else just like feel really happy with their friends? i usually just donâ€™t feel much emotions in general  but then i call my friends and chat on discord and it makes me feel happy

we watched a movie last night and i felt just really secure? if that the right word idk i just felt really happy. is that like a normal response or am i weird because i just canâ€™t describe the good vibes i get
