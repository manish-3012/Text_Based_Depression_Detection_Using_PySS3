Your not talking to girls because you dont try or act weird, not because your ugly I'm tired of hearing this excuse, "yeah bro I literally dont talk to any girls because I'm ugly", you dont have to date every girl you talk to, friendships can be just as rewarding as relationships, and I guarantee you know someone who you think is ugly but still talks to girls all the time,

1st: stop being so weird, you know what I'm talking about, you know how you act during lunch, screaming and shit running around with your friends while people are enjoying themselves outside, think to yourself "what kind of attention am I getting from this, good or bad?" Most people do the most out of this world crazy weird shit for attention but dont realize it's making people think bad about you, be chill around people, dap them up, if you got a popular friend hang around him and meet his friends, boom new friend group that people see you in and think "oh, hes friends with them? He must be chill"

2nd: TALK TO GIRLS, I swear I cannot stress this enough, download snapchat and add people from your school, start off by sending them snaps of you want it doesnt matter, but literally just start snapping back and forth with a girl and then you can start to have real conversations and then you can finally start to get somewhere.

3rd: cmon man, play a sport, I'm not saying you have to do this but socially it helps alot during school, you dont have to be good, just play sports, if you've never played sports before the 3 best things to join would be 1. Football  2. Wrestling (most people start there freshmen year of hs)  3. Track, theres something for you to do in track no matter your skillset.

4th: be confident, I want you to get up everyday, look in the mirror and think "wow I'm hot as shit" then look away, if you look at the mirror to long you start to overanalyze little things and it hurts your confidence, remember people see you as more attractive then you think you are so get tf up and act like it.


Anyway I just wanted to say this, I use to act really weird in middle school and never really talked to girls, now I'm in a happy relationship and I take care of my body and play sports, best of luckðŸ‘ðŸ™ðŸ™
