By the way the U.S. government is handling covid, do you guys think they kinda want to depopulate the country? Not enough restrictions, lack of testing in the beginning, no stimulus, hazard pay, insane covid medical bills, evictions, destroying and closing small businesses, etc.

I'm convinced they're trying to depopulate the country for profit and control, what do you guys think?
