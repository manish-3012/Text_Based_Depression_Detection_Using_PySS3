Not fitting stereotypes Since the literal second of my birth, I didn't fit any stereotype. I came out of the womb with my head full of hair, I wasn't bald at all, and I was a heavy baby (4kg or 8.8lbs). Then during my childhood, I was very polite, rarely obnoxious, and very obedient. Then my pre teen years, when shit started to twist. Finding out you were gay in a homophobic country was never fun, because we were always pictured as the worst thing that could happen to a person. I didn't fit "guy stereotypes" I never liked sports, never liked hanging out with other guys, never liked gaming, and you can imagine the bullying I got for all of that. Then seeing all those "bottom stereotypes" on the internet sort of pushed me to start fitting them to feel included. But no, I was never horny, I didn't like sex, I didn't have a crush on a straight guy, or a guy at all, in fact I think sex is gross. I never liked drama, I'm not an atheist, k actually really love my religion and know it in itself is a really good thing, but people following it just translated it in the way they wanted, to fit their livings and convinced people that's the truth, where it isn't. I'm not liberal, in fact I think liberals and Republicans, although have a few good members in them, are dominated by extremely toxic people, so I decided to be neutral. Even my zodiac sign, libra, I don't fit 99% of the descriptions they say about me. And now as a teen,no I don't want to date, no I don't want sex, no I don't want to buy expensive shit to prove my worth, I'm just, me. Have you guys experience being an outcast? Or is it just me?
(By the way, I'm not answering any questions concerning my religion or political opinion, I tried to mention them as little as possible in this paragraph just to put you in the frame of my life, because I know those conversations always end up becoming personal attacks, thanks for understanding!)
