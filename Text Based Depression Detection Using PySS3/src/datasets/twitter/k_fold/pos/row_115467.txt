Do any other leftists sit alone at the cafeteria during lunch time at school? I'm a proud leftist and have voiced my hatred for donald trump and the republican party during multiple classes. I feel like my classmates just aren't ready for views like mine. Is anyone else having the same experiences I am? I wish I could live in a state like California or Texas where I could be around more leftists like myself!
