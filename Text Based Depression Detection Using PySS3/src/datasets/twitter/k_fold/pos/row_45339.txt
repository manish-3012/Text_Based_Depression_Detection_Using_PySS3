Beginning of COVID me was am idiot To start out yes when Covid-19 originally came out I didnâ€™t really take it seriously neither did anyone I knew.Like most others at the time I thought it was something not to be worried about and that it was only a threat to people with health problems.I went on and on about how masks were stupid in fact I thought the whole lockdown was stupid from school to your everyday local business.It was embarrassing how long this denial went on for I mean like there was a few months where it didnâ€™t occur to me this is a big issue.Then out of curiosity I research more deeply into the problems people were facing due to covid such as losing family members and facing poverty.From then on my mentality towards covid starting getting more acceptable.Finally my breaking point was set when a good friend of my moms died due to covid.I was shaken to my core I he was in perfect health and had no explanation to why he couldnâ€™t have gotten through it.I learned that day covid is something we as a people should all give more attention to rather then ignoring it or hell even fighting against the rules established to help stop the spread.In summery I feel like an asshole for not knowing how bad it really was and I hope we can all take some time to really learn what we are fighting against.
