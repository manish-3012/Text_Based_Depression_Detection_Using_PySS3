I can't do this shit. I got my lesson schedule for this year.

Everyday I got between 7-9h of school+~2h of homework+guitar lessons that I have to practise hour or two,sometimes I got additional songs to play.

Yesterday I got 6h of sleep and 12h of shit to do.

I i finaly got chemistry and physics classes that'll mean more exams and tests.
