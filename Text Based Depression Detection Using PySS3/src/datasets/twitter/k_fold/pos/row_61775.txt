What do you do when you seem to constantly be sick AND not sleeping well? I just... what the fuck?  Why do I consistently seem to have some sort of cold?  I also can't seem to sleep well, I try to get in the bed 8 hours before I'm meant to sleep but I toss and turn or I'm itchy and then I just wake up feeling like shit.  I was sick already and my mom decided to wake me up EARLY, I feel like absolute shit and would much rather be DEAD than deal with this.  I've been sleeping terribly since summer due to depression and stress, I don't need to be sick on top of it
