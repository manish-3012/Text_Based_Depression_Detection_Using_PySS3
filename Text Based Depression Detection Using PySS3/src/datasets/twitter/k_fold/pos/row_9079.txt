So my friend cheated on his girlfriend I really donâ€™t know what to do, heâ€™s probably my closest friend but he told me cheated on her, he also told her and they broke up. Sheâ€™s become a pretty good part of our friend group and Iâ€™m really not sure what to do in this situation. Do I stay friends with him, do I need to give him some forgiveness? Heâ€™s said he feels like a piece of shit and Iâ€™ve made sure to tell him (as his friend) that he really is for doing that and that he shouldnâ€™t again, but is that not enough or too much? Iâ€™m really just confused I guess but any advice is welcome
