Damn man what is it about me and making horrible choices with women? So I'm at college met this girl who I was really into we were probly spending 5 nights out of the week together for 3 months. But then she decided to ghost me for a 25 yr asshole who does coke on the weekend. This was after a month of were I'd make plans and she'd cancle on me to get drunk with him.

2 months go by and surprise suprise he cheated on her and she comes back to me saying how much she misses me. This lasts 3 weeks now she's ghosting me again for some frat boy. I should of known this would happened but here I am all sad over a girl who dosnt care about me.

Sorry if this makes me sound like an incel or whatever I just wanted to type this out and blow off steam. Becuase it really hurts and pisses me off
