My friend just posted 5 things on his story saying that Israel bombed Lebanon My friend is apparently very confident that Israel bombed Lebonon in the buirut explosion. One of the things he posted was a video saying that Israel bombed which a massive red circle with an arrow pointing at nothing. And besides if a country wanted to bomb someone else the would use a bomb not something that causes a shockwave.
