People have no respect. The amount of kids I heard who will shit on their parents, THEIR OWN BIRTH PARENTS. How much respect have you lost for your fellow human that you can hate your own parents? Sure they get annoying, but to the point of kids hating their parents... come on. They raised you, they birthed you... be grateful you pretentious little googley eyed bastard.
