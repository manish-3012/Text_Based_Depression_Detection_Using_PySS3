Making a Diary like thing on Reddit Day 217 So, i was in Copenhagen for most of the Day today. You see, Me and my parents went out to buy me some vinyls (with my own Money, of course). I hot 4 gorillaz albums, along with a Rick Astley album, because i could. It has that one really sad never gonna give you up version on it.

Other than that, i am done with the whole batcave Challenge today. I did the whole month and it was hard, but it was Worth it. though i dont look that much more physically stronger, i am stronger. And i know that. I am sure of it.

Anyways, i am not sure if i can say i did much more. So i Will stop now.

See ya tomorrow.
