It's been a while since this happened, yet it still haunts me. A few years ago, I started secondary school, and while I wasn't hyped I was looking forward to new beginnings. On my first day, I realised the next year's would be hell. I was punched in my stomach. I threw up moments after and I still remember his words "Don't be such a pussy, if I were going hard, you'd be dead." I didn't even do anything. I'm a pacifist in a family that's tried to raise me to fight.

This does however come at a cost. When I snap, I fight, or well try too. And everytime I've snapped they just run so I'm forced to just "deal with it" and by that, I bottle it up and store it away in my mind. Which then makes me "spill over" and I have a breakdown. And it's really not fun.

Anyway on with it, throughout the time there, the same people bully the shit out of me. They wind me up, they kick me about, they punch and hit me, in the PE changing rooms, I'd get pantsed constantly. Hell one time they actually pulled my underwear down. One of them during football, tackled me and nearly broke my leg. 

But the worst out of all of them was this guy who was "nice to me" when I first started and I started to notice that he was the one who made all the other ones do that shite to me. One time, he stole my phone and went into my Instagram, he looked at my sister and kept commenting on her, calling her hot etc. Then he ran off with my phone, I didn't get it back until lunch was over and I didn't even get to eat because I wanted my phone back.

Other things that I can recall is lying to my friends and getting them to be mad at me. And the teaches too. I really hate him. Because of him I deleted Snapchat and Instagram for the past 3 years, I only recently downloaded them again for my current friends who I so trust as they kicked the shit out of this guy who lied to me telling me I wasn't apart of the friends group anymore through one of their phones. 

But he has scarred me. I can't even take the slightest touch from any person at my school because of what he did. The all time worst thing he's done, is sexually assault me. Grabbing my ass, trying to kiss me, trying to get my shirt off, and he labeled it as "a joke". The school was notified and didn't want to get the police involved, I wish they fucking did because all he got was a slap on the wrist essentially. Our teacher just asked him if he was gay, he said no and they told him off for what he did. No suspensions, no detention, nothing. 

I hope you "enjoyed" reading that. I can't prove any of this happened other than my mental state and randomly occuring suicidal thoughts. 

First post on the sub so, yeah, I'm glad I got that off my chest.
