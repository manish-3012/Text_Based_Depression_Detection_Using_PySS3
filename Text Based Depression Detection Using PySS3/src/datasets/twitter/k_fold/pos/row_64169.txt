There's probably something wrong with me, but I don't care For my entire life I've wanted to live alone completely. Away family, and any close social relationships besides working with or going to school with somebody. I've never genuinely felt lonely and I feel happier knowing that I will deal with any problems on my own. I'll be friendly to people I meet, but I'd like to remain a stranger
