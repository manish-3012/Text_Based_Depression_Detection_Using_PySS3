Opinions on politics? Like the title says. I was just wondering what other people think of politics and the current state of the US. I personally abhor politics and believe it to be one of the most illogical things plaguing the world. The two party system is stupid, and leads to the leader of the country being the richest or most charismatic. It really is a popularity contest. Both parties have their detractors, and their own agendas to push. Both candidates especially are insanely under qualified and are quite possibly the worst choices for presidency ever. Trump is an egotistical man-child and Biden is a geriatric dementia patient who will most likely be a puppet for Kamala. Theyâ€™re both bad, and itâ€™s due to the fact that two parties means the most qualified candidate does not get a chance to shine.
