Hello my name is Andrew and I am recovering from an eating disorder Iâ€™m 13 and developed an eating disorder around April and May. I lost a lot of weight since then and I thought I was â€œbettering myselfâ€. My mom and family first noticed my weight lost in June and I thought they were kidding. I saw no difference in my body. In July I started to notice. 

I drank towards the end of July (first time drinking) and my mom took me to the hospital. My mom figured out I was self harming and was getting me help a few days earlier so that is what saved me from her getting more mad. Why am I telling you this? Well when drunk I told her about my eating habits. 

So I took a helicopter to Childrenâ€™s Hospital because my heart rate was slowing. All I remember is telling my mom all my secrets in the car ride to the hospital and then waking up in the helicopter already landed. I pissed myself... twice. I was hospitalized for 5 and half days. Now I got out of the hospital and Iâ€™m recovering and I have been almost been doing perfect.

Except a few mental breakdowns and a lot of crying. I am supposed to be stopping self harming but that isnâ€™t happening so well. I feel on edge all day everyday. I feel trapped I donâ€™t want to eat but I do. I feel so obese, but logically that canâ€™t be true now that I am at a healthy weight. And thoughts about starving myself by throwing out food secretly and lying to my mom are becoming stronger and stronger. 

I wanna break from my diet plan by my dietitian and not eat. Thatâ€™s why I need some help. If anyone relates to having an eating disorder or self harming or hating yourself or depression or anxiety please share your story if you feel comfortable. And if your dealing with any just know youâ€™re not alone and you can get through this.
