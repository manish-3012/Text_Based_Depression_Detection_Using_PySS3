My dad told me that zippers are on different sides for males and females. This morning my dad looked at his jacket and goes "Is this a woman's jacket?" and then I sat in awe as he told me that the zippers are on different sides of the jacket for females and males. I had always known it to be on the right, but apparently females jackets are on the left. I don't know if that is true or not but it sounding cool enough to share. Have a good day.
