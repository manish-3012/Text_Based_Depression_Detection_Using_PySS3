Sometimes I wish that when a cat (or dog, I don't judge) bonked into you, bonk would be an actual onomatopoeia of the sound you heard instead of the infinitely less satisfying shft sound of them rubbing against your leg or clothes. Not when they nuzzle you tho, or the same bonk as go to horny jail, just a friendly sounding bonk :)
