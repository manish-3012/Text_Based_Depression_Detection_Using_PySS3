Finally, after almost a year, I think I'm back to football So last year, on my bday, I tore my acl at the beginning of the season. Lost my entire senior year basically the 2nd day of school, and spent my entire bday at the hospital. So recently my friend had a surprise for me recently, he talked to the college coach, since my friend got recruited by the team with a scholarship and everything. So he talked to the coach, put in a good for me, and for my first year, I'm gonna be on the practice squad, which is fine since I cant do much contact yet, but it gives me a guarenteed spot next year. So I was super fucken excited. I've been doing conditioning/speed trading for the past few weeks, I'm very slow compared to last  year and I'm not fit at all anymore. Like to do a gasser, which is a sprint from sideline to sideline 2 times takes me 45 sec, in regular clothes, when I could do it in full gear under 40 sec, which is a good speed for a linemen. But yeah, working my way towards it. But anyways, back to the point, we started doing hands work and medium speed 1v1s, which is like not much contact and I ended up spraining my thumb. Which is a really good side, cause every year prior, my first and only injury was only ever a sprained thumb, until I tore my acl, which was my first and only injury from senior year. I'm taking this as the best sign possible rn, meaning a lot of good is ahead, I mean my thumb does hurt like a bitch and it is swollen and a little purple, but I'm still doing conditioning and everything, just taping it up before practice really tightly, just like I used to. But yeah, this is possibly the best thing to happen rn and I'm hyped. After thinking football for me was done and out of my life, I get a second chance. I'm not gonna follow it as a career of course, I have different plans for that, but still. So yeah, if you read that, thanks, sorry for any spelling mistakes, too long for me to read it
