Is hatred unavoidable? The search for opposition may just lead from material and mental challenges to human ones, as far as I know. And so is hatred essential? Is it nonessential yet too easily obtainable? Is it good for the soul and social skill, or does it open the door to combat within all circles?

I don't know if I should rid myself of hate, for I may just end up transferring it again, like the hatred to my father being greedily directed by me back at myself? Could I shift this hate onto another? And could I do it effectively?
