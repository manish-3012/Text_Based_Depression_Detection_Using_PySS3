Bruh, you ever have those moments where like a Teacher has some huge misconception on something she's talking about, and it's super cringe Because you know they'll get awkwardly corrected and ur just sitting there lol, like "I don't blame the teacher for getting this wrong" but like damn that's cringe. Idk why it's a special flavor of cringe
