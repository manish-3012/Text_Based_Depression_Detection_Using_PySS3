My girlfriend is being abused by her mother 


Firstly, I am 17 and sheâ€™s 16, letâ€™s call her Kate. Not from the US, our justice system is more shit btw. Weâ€™ve been together for almost 7 months, and currently in a long distance relationship. 

At first, it was mostly us enjoying ourselves and showing each other our good fun sides only. Then our relationship became deeper and we started sharing everything to each other, even our most personal problems, though it is mostly her sharing and I comfort her as I was never used to the idea of someone caring about my problems. This is about her though. The last 2 weeks have been hell for us, and mostly for her. First of all, her family is genuinely insane. Theyâ€™re a family of 6, mom and dad, her 14 year old brother, her younger sister, and her 7 year old brother. The oldest brother hates her. Her father hates her on and off, he has a mental condition that I donâ€™t exactly know the name of, but one time he hates her guts and one time he likes her. Her mother, though, used to care about her a lot until the last few weeks, apparently sheâ€™s also got a loose screw and is very stressed. Theyâ€™d say that Kate is a sl*t and basically verbally abused her for the past year. The last 2 weeks, have been hell like I said. Sheâ€™d get hit by her mom every single day for the most dumb stuff. She does all her motherâ€™s chores and cleans and cooks and everything. 

She gets physically abused for it, but she still tells me she loves her. Kate would make her food, then sheâ€™d throw shit at her because of little salt. Sheâ€™d light the wood on fire, and her mom randomly burns her using it. Yesterday, her own mother told her to kill herself at night when everyone was sleeping so no one disturbs her. She brought her damn knifes and told her to choose. She came to me crying and I stayed with her that whole night, luckily nothing happened. Just today, her mother used a knife and wounded her leg. SHE FRICKING TOLD HER NOT TO BANDAGE IT SO SHE CAN SUFFER. AND KATE WAS FINE WITH IT. 

I am literally crying as Iâ€™m writing this. I told her, can you please bandage it, she refuses saying her mother would hit her more. She tells me her mother uses her as a venting tool to vent her stress away, and that she feels comfort by hurting her. And sheâ€™s okay with it, because her mom would abuse her siblings if she said anything or retaliated. Iâ€™m so sickened. This is not even everything that happened to her, she does way more shit everyday and Kate would come to me crying everytime. Iâ€™m so sick of this, my brain canâ€™t handle it but I love her. Before you ask, I already told her to take legal action. She said she did once. Her family threatened  her and forced her to drop the case. She literally would not go to a hospital no matter how many times I asked. She only went once because of her severe anemia, her reasoning being she doesnâ€™t want them to investigate her wounds leading to the discovery of her abuse. What hurts me, is that she loves them even though they treat her like this. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. She completely gave up on changing this reality and is basically ok with it. It hurts me and drains me too much. What am I supposed to do. She wonâ€™t listen or do what I think she should do.  
Iâ€™m so useless. 

TLDR: Girlfriend is being abused severely by her mom and sheâ€™s ok with it, and I canâ€™t do anything.
