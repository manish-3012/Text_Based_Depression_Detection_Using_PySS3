Anyone else with "weird" last names only get called that? Not everyone does this, but it's only people I rarely talk to and a few school friend who do this. When I had close friends they would just call me by my first name. But, it was mostly the jocks and a few teachers who called me "Fickle" (lmao XD rhymes with pickle haha I want to d\*e). I don't mind if teachers called me that, it's whatever. I just wish people would call me by my first name unless I allow them otherwise.
