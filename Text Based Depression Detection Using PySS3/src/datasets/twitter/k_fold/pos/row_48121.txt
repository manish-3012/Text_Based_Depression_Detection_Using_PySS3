found out why adults/non-virgins get frustrated if they are horny and canâ€™t have sex i am not at all a horny teen. itâ€™s pretty rare for me to naturally get horny 

however i am not a virgin as of about a month and a half ago and iâ€™ve done it a few times (in the sense that it was consensual and i enjoyed it)

well iâ€™ve enjoyed masturbation on occasion before this. i mean yeah it feels nice and why not if iâ€™m bored and have nothing else to do. but since iâ€™m not naturally horny i just do it cause like i said â€œwhy notâ€

well i just havenâ€™t really felt like it. whenever i start ya know iâ€™ll go for a few seconds before being like â€œeh this doesnâ€™t really feel niceâ€/â€œnot really worth the hassleâ€

so i just stop and do something else. BUT i imagine if someone was naturally very horny they might be frustrated not being able to do anything about that 

(it might also have something to do with me being afab iâ€™m not really sure)
