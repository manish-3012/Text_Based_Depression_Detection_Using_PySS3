3D printers I have been thinking of buying a 3D printer for a while now and I have finally gotten to it. After some research, I have narrowed my options to 2 printers. The Original Prusa i3 MK3s+  or the Creality Endor 3  so for anyone who has either of the two, or tons of experience in 3D printing, what would be the best option for my first 3D printer. Thanks a lot reddit   :)
