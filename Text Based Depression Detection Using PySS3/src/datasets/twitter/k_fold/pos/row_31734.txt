Where to sell a (SLIGHTLY) used Cards Against Humanity game Iâ€™m looking to sell my Cards Against Humanity game, it has minor bloodstains on it, but you can barely see them. Ok, theyâ€™re on half the deck, but itâ€™s not important. I also want cash, and no returns or questions. I need to sell fast before the FBI realize what Iâ€™ve done.
