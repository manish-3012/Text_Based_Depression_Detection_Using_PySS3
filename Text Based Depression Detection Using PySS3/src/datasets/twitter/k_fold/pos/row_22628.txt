Am I in the wrong I have made posts before about choir.

I worked so hard to get into the advanced choir, and got rejected every single year while all my friends got in. It really hurts your self esteem.

The choir teacher emailed me saying he wanted me to be a soprano 1, thatâ€™s not usually my range but I figure because I was normally a soprano 2 it wouldnâ€™t be too hard to practice higher pitched notes. So I took it.

My parents are pissed at me, my friends are upset at me because they donâ€™t Think I can handle it, and I just feel terrible. Iâ€™ve wanted this so bad since middle school.
