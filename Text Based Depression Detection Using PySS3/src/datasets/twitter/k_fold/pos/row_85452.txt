Why I recommend circumcision Just like any other day, today I went to shower. Everything was normal until I got â€œdown thereâ€ . Like usual I peeled my foreskin back and started scrubbing. But then, when I pulled it forward, the outcome was, different to say the least. (More of my penis was still exposed than normal.) i just brushed it off and continued showering. When I came out of the shower my brain had the idea to make sure my penis still works by pumping some blood into it. Holy hell it hurt. My foreskin was strangling the head of my penis. Itâ€™s been about 30 minutes since it happened and Iâ€™m trying my best to avoid another erection 

TL;DR: I pulled my foreskin awkwardly after pulling it down to wash it, and now when I get hard, I have immense pain.
