Feeling sad right now for no reason Anyone have any tips on how to feel a bit better? None of my friends are replying to my texts and itâ€™s late at night so I canâ€™t do much stuff outside. Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you gave a bit of advice if you have any. If any of you need any help with anything Iâ€™ll be here for ya :)
