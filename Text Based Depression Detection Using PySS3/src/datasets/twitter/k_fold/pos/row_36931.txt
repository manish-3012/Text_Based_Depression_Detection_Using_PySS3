Advise for people going to Sixth Form Do research on what you want to pick, I picked game design without blinking and its basically a free scam, I thought we would be looking at the design in games, but it is literally imedia.

You can change your subjects within the first couple of weeks so dont worry. 

Everyone is in this together, I thought I would be all confused because I didnt know anything in year 11 about sixth form but it turns out noone know anything, they explain it all.
