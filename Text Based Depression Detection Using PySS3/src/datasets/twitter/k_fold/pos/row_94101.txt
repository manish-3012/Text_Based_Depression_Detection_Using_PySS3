My school is letting the parents decide how school will continue Basically my school said that they would let the parents decide if we so virtual school or not based on the precetege of pepole who are infected. Since the infections my contry are rapidly rising again. So basically there is lots of uncertainty as to how school will continue after the autumn break. How is  online school? Is it that bad?
