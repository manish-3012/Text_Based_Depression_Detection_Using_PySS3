Mental Health Just wanted to share that someone from my grade committed suicide today.

Nobody expected it.

I wasn't close to him before that's why I'm not too shaken up to post, but multiple students from my homeroom bursted out crying after the counselors informed us of the news.

Guys. Mental health is fucking important. It's not a joke. It's not something unrelated to you. I promise someone you know is depressed. And if you're the one who is depressed, I don't want to just say "go seek help" because I know its not that fucking easy but, please, just keep going, no matter how painful and pointless it is, never, ever, just end your life.

Depression is not easy to spot. Anyone can be depressed and suicidal, even the class clown, even the bright kid, even the bullies. Never neglect others, and if you sense something, even just a little bit, please try to reach out and cheer them out, however small it might mean to them. Something is always better than nothing.

Anyways since the community I live in is very sensitive with these kinds of topics, in addition to being an introvert, I don't feel comfortable sharing my thoughts in real life. Just wanted to dump my frustrations online about the lack of awareness schools have on mental health.

Sorry if the structure is very messy and convoluted since this is sort of a rant but
Be kind and. Never. Neglect. Others.
