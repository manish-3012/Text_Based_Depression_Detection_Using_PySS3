My dad is going to be one lonely guy in his nursing home so every day, my dad and I fight at dinner. And it is always for the stupidest shit imaginable. Ether "stop eating your food so quickly" or "no elbows on the table" or "sit up", just things that he doesn't need to fight about. This time, we are having spaghetti, and since it is quarantine, my hair is kind of long, so in order to eat it without it getting in the pasta, I put my elbow on the table and hold my hair up. He starts an entire stupid argument over fucking nothing. Getting furious over me keeping my hair out of my food, and earlier today, he came in my room saying "if you keep up this shit we are selling the goddamn playstation, you little shit", you know, the one that has hundreds of dollars worth of games and hundreds of hours in them. He sat on my bed and argued with me saying how I was starting a fight over nothing, and I need to learn proper manners, and the whole time I am thinking "What. The. Fuck. I keep my hair out of my food and because of it I might lose the playstation, and he is getting this angry over it". I try to explain that what he is saying is stupid, but he relentlessly tries to say that it is his house, his rules. So I never understood why adults nowadays never speak to their parents, but you know what, I kind of understand now
