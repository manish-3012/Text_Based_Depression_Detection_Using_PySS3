How do I ask someone out I can't start conversations There's this girl I really like and I want to ask her out, but I don't know how. We know each other, we're both in a friend group and we'll all play jackbox and stuff sometimes, but I don't talk to her except when the group is together and we're all chatting cause I'm really shy and am only good at joining in on conversations. And she's not in any of my classes.

I've been reading a bunch of advice and it all says just strike up conversation with her, but I can't do that. I don't know how to start conversations. Like I can't even strike up conversation with this guy who me and my friend chat with every day. There are literally only 3 people at my school who I've every really started a conversation with. So no way will I be able to just start talking to her. So how do I ask her out?
