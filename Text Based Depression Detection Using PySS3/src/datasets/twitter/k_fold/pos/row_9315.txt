Sad boi hours After a great night of playing Smash Ultimate with all my friends, the girl Ive had a crush on for a while kissed my best friend. Every time we all hang out she always sits next to me and we have always have an intimate night I feel like. But then she apparently likes him and not me. Not sure what to do or if I do anything really, Iâ€™m just really sad right now. Iâ€™m going off to college soon and I wonâ€™t get to see her much at all. Everything sucks.
