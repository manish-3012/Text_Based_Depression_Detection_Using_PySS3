Fuck my father He decides to get drunk as all hell drinking a gallon and a half just so he can weep and pass out, while not giving a shit about his kids. He went to a place to get better after getting released they raised his medications and he decides to not even care! It's been 3 days and he hasn't taken any of them. All of my pets are with him and that scares the shit out of me. I don't know what he's doing because I was forced to go live in another home while he gets his shit straight. I've been here for 2 weeks now the place is nice but I worry for him I haven't slept for 2 days now... I just don't know what to do I want to help him but he doesn't decide to accept help. He said that "last night is the last time I will get drunk" his reasoning for getting drunk is that he saw an empty vodka bottle... That's it. he saw an empty bottle and then went at 9 PM and got drunk AGAIN. He wasn't even sober for a month.
