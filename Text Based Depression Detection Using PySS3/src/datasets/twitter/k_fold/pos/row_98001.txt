I got a massage yesterday. Yesterday I was at my friend's house. We listened to music and other stuff and I checked my messenger. It was quite surprising: a girl in my school texted "we should fuck".  I have never did something like this. I thought that this is just a joke or smthng, but she says she's serious. Guys, what would you do?
