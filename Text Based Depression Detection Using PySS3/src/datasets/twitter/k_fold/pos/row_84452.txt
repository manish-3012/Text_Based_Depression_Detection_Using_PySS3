Ridiculous, but still, but I'll miss this sub. I know that these kind of post is ridiculous, and that this is a strange subreddit, but it has helped me understanding a lot of how people think, it doesn't come naturally for me. Even if it's a lot of memes and a fair amount of weird stuff will I still miss it. As I turn 20 tomorrow, I'll leave the sub tonight. I'll keep the sub in a custom feed so I easily can take a look on it without getting my main feed filled of memes. I'll miss you, you've been an important part of my social development even if I haven't posted or commented very much.

I've wondered about how often r/teenagers violate copyright laws by posting memes, and I once tried to make a post about it after the viral gi r l  w i th a c A r -meme about that but the magic eye bot removed it. : P And this isn't anything original or new so this could very well be removed once again, but still.

I was once on my way to ask about advice about a crush I had, I later realized that r/teenagers probably is a really bad place to ask for advice on, but I never did anything, and she has moved far away and was never interested in me anyway : P But I still have the draft from 8 months ago..

You've almost felt like that friend I never had. Farwell! I'm almost crying now. Good bye! I'll miss you. The teenage years seems to be the best time in life, it doesn't seem to ever get better.
