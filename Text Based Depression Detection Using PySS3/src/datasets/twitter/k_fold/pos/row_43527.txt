What do you guys consider a dry person So I've been going around various chatting apps, and a lot of them have people who are just incrediable untalkative but they have things like don't be dry in their bio but all they say is stuff like yeah or ye or okay, or cool or, nice. Litterally one word and I try to get to know them ask them about themselves try to joke with them or just try to talk more about their hobbies to see if I can get anywhere with that and nothing, it makes me thing maybe I'm the dry one or smt.
