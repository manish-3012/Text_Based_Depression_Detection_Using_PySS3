the dream i had today.... ok so it started off with me and some girl i have never seen before,we were talking about food and she told me about her fav snack saying that it was the best thing ever and stuff and then we went to store so i can get her the snack,when we got there she held it then her face changed,she put it back and grabbed some organic snack and i got super counfused,then i realised its because i have diabetes so i cant have sugar,and she wanted to get something we can eat togther......of course i woke up and realised how lonely i am........pain.
