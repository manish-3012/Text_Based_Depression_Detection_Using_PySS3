Is it okay to watch â€˜Naughty animeâ€™ at the lower end of the targeted age of this subreddit? First of all: I have no idea if this is the exact subreddit where I need to be. I tried to read and follow the rules as good as possible, but I mightâ€™ve missed something.

Now, to the point. Iâ€™m on the lower end of 13-18 (no exact age, privacy reasons) and I regularly watch anime. Normal, plain old stuff. Then, I set foot in ecchi, which turned into the naughty side. Iâ€™m not sure if I should restrain, or just be careful or something like that. I read on some other things you just gotta know the difference between real and animated, which I feel like I got fairly well under control.
Even though I feel like I know enough for it to not be anything major, I would like all of your opinions on it.
