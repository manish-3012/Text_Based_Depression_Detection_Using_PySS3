Aaaaa i need style advice and help Ok so idk how to properly explain but I'll try my best, I love like grunge, darkwear and techwear but like I don't know any shops which aren't too expensive, like, ik some but for my mom they're all too expensive and I need some good grunge/darkwear/techwear shops which aren't rlly expensive

Basically i want to change my style from basic brand clothing to darkwear/techwear or grunge or smthn like that and idk where to get clothes which fit that style if that makes sense :(
