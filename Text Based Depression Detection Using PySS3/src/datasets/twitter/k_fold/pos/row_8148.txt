Lmao how do you recover from a porn addiction From like 9-13 I watched a lot of porn and because of that Iâ€™ve struggle with the idea of having romantic sex with a guy I actually like, I donâ€™t watch it anymore and it grosses me out. I feel like it would be awkward because my brain thinks sex is lust and only lust. Itâ€™s almost like â€œsomething to doâ€ instead of something intimate, Iâ€™d feel grossed out with the idea of cuddling after sex but thatâ€™s supposed to be the best part isnâ€™t it

Iâ€™m bi and i only have this problem with guys, it feels unfair to guys iâ€™ve been interested in because every relationship gets sexual at some point, and i couldnâ€™t even romantically make out with any of them because it made me think about sex, and sex with a guy makes me feel gross about myself. They probably thought I wasnâ€™t into them but I just couldnâ€™t connect the two if you know what i mean. Am i crazy or something or do yâ€™all have the same problem
