wtf is even happening with the kids I mean when I was 10 i allways though about how be a teenager would be cool and have many friends and gf, things like that, but today kids with 10,11,12 yrs are trying to "be adults" i mean wtf, some girls even post photos in insta or twitter trying to  sexualize a womem 12yr body, that's not even possible, boys with 10yrs posting photos like showing the abs, they don't even have abs, they are just skinny and it just appears there, i know that bcs I was like that. I kinda felt that last year, I was 14 and I had a friend and he was like "no I don't eat candys bcs I have 14 and that's for childs" like wtf man. sry if the english isn't the best is 6:47AM rn and am pretty sleepy.
