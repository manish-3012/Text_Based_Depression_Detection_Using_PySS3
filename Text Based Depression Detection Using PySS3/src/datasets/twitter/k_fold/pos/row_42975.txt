Best Way to Make Your Voice Sound Better? (RECORDING) I ask here as there are a lot of you. You lot respond super fast.

I find whenever I record my voice, I just sound depressed. I am very quiet - and I sound like I do not care. That is just how I talk. I want to change that as I have been recording YouTube videos. It is not that my voice is annoying, at least I do not think. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recorded three different videos with my friends. I could not bring myself to edit/post those videos because of this reason.

I have a few ideas. I am going to talk louder. I did not know how quiet I was - especially compared to my friends. I will take out the elastics when I talk - I have braces. I will talk closer to the mic.

What else can/should I do?
