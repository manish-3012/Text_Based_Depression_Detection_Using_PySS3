Think I broke or sprained both my knee-caps Lol So I was playing two hand touch football (American football for all you British "people") andI was 'bout get a dude out, and then, I lost my balance whilst running and slammed into the ground, caps first. Now it very hurts a lot. But hurts only a bit when I'm just sitting and laying. 0/10 would not recommend getting hurt.ðŸ‘Ž
