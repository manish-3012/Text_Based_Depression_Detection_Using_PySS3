"There's a time and place for everything," That's it, I'm through.

Why can't people take jokes. I said I am the Chris Brown of paper in school and started punching it, and my parents got a message, saying that I might go to discipline. My parents took the teacher's side and said that abuse isn't funny. Listen, if you can't take a joke, then how do you expect yourself to have thick skin?

And yet my parents wonder why I can't get along with friends. The only reason I have friends is because of the things I say. What if one day, I just talked about equality, they wouldn't care.
