Returning to school made me realise that staying home really does suck. I actually got to see people I like. Staying at home I felt like I had no worth or value, but at school I have people that care for me and laugh with me.

I realises I don't appreciate my friends and teachers enough (even if they're dicks sometimes). 

Now I'm just waiting for the weekend to be over. I hate staying at home due to a few circumstances and I can't see anyone other than the classroom.

Oh yeah before I forget I got my new timetable. Got all the kind teachers let's go!
