Food workers, put your mask over your nose! I know that I don't sound nice saying this. I don't think I am obligated to be nice about this. If you are making my food that I paid for, wear a mask! And don't just put it over your mouth, put it over your mouth and nose please. I work a crappy job too, but I still manage to wear a mask over my nose for 8 hours! I don't see why you can't. And if you are so stubborn and incapable of wearing it over your nose, at least wear it while preparing my food.
