This school session is just hell This school is shit as hell , I think this is probably the first time  I'm feeling depressed , I got 98% in school last year , everything I try to learn at home this year just disappears into Oblivion , my parents still expect me to get good grades and as schools are reopening school is also expecting that I would have learned everything they taught online , I don't even have much time to do anything about it now , last year my study time would peak around 6 hours . This year I can't take in shit even if I sit to study for 12 hours , even if I study I can't gather enough confidence to write exam without cheating , I know there are people out there who would prefer online class but TBH it sucked for me
