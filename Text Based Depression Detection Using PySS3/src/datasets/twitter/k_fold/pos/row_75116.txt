This has turned into a difficult situation I need some advice on what to do.

My crush is best friends with my sister. Last weekend we went to lunch together, and itâ€™s unclear if it was a date or not. Today my sister (let slip?) that she doesnâ€™t like me. Iâ€™m not sure what to say/do, because my crush hangs out with me for a bit every single day, and we get along really well. However I donâ€™t want to ruin our friendship by me confessing to her or anything like that, and if she does actually like me in that way, I donâ€™t want things to be awkward. Itâ€™s also likely Iâ€™ve already put myself into a position where I lose either way, and thatâ€™s why I want some advice from yâ€™all. I hope the 3.4 people that read this can give me some advice. Thanks guys and girls!
