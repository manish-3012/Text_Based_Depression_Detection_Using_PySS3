What do I do after having my crush cancel our date? I was planning and asked to go on a date a few weeks ago, then when it was close to the day of the date she said she didnâ€™t want to go so Iâ€™m kind of stuck at the moment. She also told me that when she doesnâ€™t want to do something, she just either avoids it or pushes it off, so Iâ€™ve got no idea if she really meant anything when she said that sheâ€™ll see if sheâ€™s free that day. Do I go ask her why she didnâ€™t want to go or do I ask if she even likes me? Do I ask her on a another one but ask her to go somewhere else or do I just keep talking to her, acting like nothing happened? Iâ€™ve never been in any relationship before in my life so I have literally zero experience. Any advice would be appreciated.
