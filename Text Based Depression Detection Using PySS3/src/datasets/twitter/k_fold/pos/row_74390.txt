This is day five of letting you guys write whatever you want on a Google doc until I go back to in person school [Day 5 Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Y3V6rn2eBiDS60aw3HXL9dTarqQKx-IVnJG7tgBv5k/edit)

I canâ€™t show you guys day 4â€™s results, just click on the other post to view it, as the content on that post isnâ€™t really fit for this subreddit. Anyways, have fun!
