How to get over ur crush help For context: my crush said "ok" when i told her and i found out she has a bf the week after. Im trying to move on but its hard, anny tips? I think about her all day and dreamed a few times too. Im pretty uncomfterble around her and idk if she thinks im over her, or if she knows im still not, or if im ignoring what happened.

Btw: u know those guy who are vegan/depressed/gay/whatever and make it there entire personalety? Yea im turning into that, but being rejected and kinda hearthbroken.
