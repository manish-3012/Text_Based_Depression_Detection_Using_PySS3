Everyone. Stop hating. Please. We are all humans and we are not supposed to hate each other. We are supposed to LOVE each other. We all should be kind to everyone no matter their appearance, gender, sexual orientation, etc. 

Being unkind to someone is easy. We have all been hurt by someone our life, and because of that, we can end up hurting others and it is an endless cycle. It takes strength to end the cycle. 

Thank you for reading my post, I hope you have a great day, I love you. Bye.
