Oops. Help maybe. So a few years ago I wrote hate comments on tiktok cause yea I was insecure and all that. When I checked it today, I saw that someone had commented â€œbye for you ðŸ˜â€ on one, which I didnâ€™t really expect. I deleted it of course, because I donâ€™t agree with what I said back then (2017). I really hope I donâ€™t know that person, am I gonna get cancelled or something? I wrote so many things, bad things, which I really regret. What do I do?
