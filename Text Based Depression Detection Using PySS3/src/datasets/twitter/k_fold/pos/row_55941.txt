Gonna be honest I didnâ€™t remember reading books was so good Today I was in virtual class and I was so fucking bored I grabbed a book (Civil War history book printed in the 1870â€™s) and just started reading and oh my geeses Chrysler reading printed text was such an upgrade from reading off a computer screen. When I read off a computer my eyes strain and I often read at about 40 words per minute, I was able to read like Eminem raps reading from the book and I finished a chapter (9 pages) in less than 10 minutes and even retained most of what I read. In short books are fucking superior for reading from compared to computers and Iâ€™m so fucking done with this virtual school I wanna ddos the school servers into 2077.
