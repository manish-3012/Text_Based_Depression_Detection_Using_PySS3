This sucks Plumbers came today to fix our 3 burst pipes but theyâ€™re all behind like cement walls or something and theyâ€™re from a company that had an ongoing lawsuit for their pipes bursting easily that just ended so we canâ€™t join the lawsuit and get money but also itâ€™s really hard to replace the pipes and we would need to get every single pipe replaced in our house, and the plumbers needed up not even fixing the pipes and wonâ€™t until at least tomorrow so thatâ€™s another day without water! Life is fun in texas but hey at least the snow is finally melting
