A message to a girl who will never see it but maybe it'll help you GURL

STOP CHASING HIM! YOU USED TO BE TOGETHER AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH U MISS HIM IT ENDED FOR A REASON

YOU TOLD HER WHAT YOUR DREAM RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THAT WITH HIM

SHE CARES ABOUT BOTH OF YOU AND SHE DOES NOT WANT YOU TO BE HURT

BUT EVEN SHE LET'S HIM GO FOR YOU HE WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT YOU

SHE KNOWS IT HURTS, AND YOUR SADNESS HURTS HER TOO

BUT THE LONGER YOU CHASE AFTER HIM THE MORE IT'LL HURT YOU

SO PLEASE... LET GO OF HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
