Is he a friend or not? So I finally have friends at school for the first time ever. Then this year this guy sort of joined the friend group and he doesn't rlly like me. It feels like all he does is make ppl hate me more and more. For example: when I try to fit in he and his friends do everything to get me away. Ever since he was in this friend group he has been switching between being friendly to me and telling me I'm useless and that I treat my friends wrong(most of the time about my female friend where he's the closest with). I have always struggled socially and most ppl know that but apparently he just doesn't care or keeps forgetting. I've tried to get my friends who I do trust their attention about it but they seem to just ignore me when i wanna talk about it. 

For clarity I have always been lonely at school and always had problems socially. Besides that I'm really really insecure about myself.

So he keeps saying:"you'll get a relationship" and "who would want to be friends with you" and I know that he means it more like jokes and since i joke about it too but this does hurt me. He also keeps saying that I'm annoying and I get it and wanna change it but he (and his friends) say it everytime I join a conversation with him in it.

If you've read all of this I just wanna thank you for 'listening' to my story.
Advice would be really appreciated but not needed.

And to the annoying "who cares" haters: go hate on smb else pls I have enough problems rn
