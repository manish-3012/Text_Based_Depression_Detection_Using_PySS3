Help me out, pls Tomorrow I will go out with my crush to go for a walk. Itâ€™s like my first date with her and I donâ€™t want to screw it up. And (As you can imagine because Iâ€™m posting this to Reddit) I donâ€™t have that much experience dating girls. So if you have suggestions or any sort of advice pleas tell me.
