How to Help My Parents Quit Smoking ðŸš¬ 
This is not the best place to ask, I understand that. I am out of options. I thought that one of you lot might have gone through a similar situation.

My parents are heavy smokers. They have smoked longer than I have been alive. They were not as addicted a few years ago as they are now. Their addiction has gotten worse over the years. 

They used to hold themselves to certain morals/rules. They would never smoke in-doors/in-vehicles. That has changed. They now have an ashtray in all three of our vehicles. They never smoked around us, their children. At this point, they do not care about that. 

I am adding this in at the very end. Their addiction has got so bad that they are selling random things around the house (like old collectables) just to be able to afford more packs. 

My father has attempted to quit twice before. My mother has prevented him from achieving that goal. Whenever my dad wants to pick up a new habit, my mom puts him down. I know, she is not that good of a wife - at least in this regard. 

They end up going through a few packs (each) a week. A few years ago, one pack would of got both of them through an entire month. It is easy to see how much of a impact smoking has had on their life, and not in a good way. 

I care about their health. I have attempted time-and-time again over the years to get them to quit. Nothing has worked. I worry as I grow older that they are not going to be around, and miss out on future events, like meeting my children - or witnessing me getting married. One could make the argument that I should not concern myself over this due to them being able to die any second. Compared to that, I/they have control over the situation. 

I started throwing out packs here-and-there. What could I do to help them quit? 

Note: Avoid making jokes/leaving comments that do not help me at all. You are not funny.
