I finally figured out who I have a crush on. (Not that anyone cares) Okay this may sound strange but for the longest time I wasn't sure who I liked or if I even did like someone, but yesterday I made up my mind.

Step 1: Complete!
~Step 2: Say hi.~
Step 2: Accept that I'll always be single and forget I ever liked her.

Oh well, it's nice to dream.
