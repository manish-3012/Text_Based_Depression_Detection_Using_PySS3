I am finally finally happy I broke up with my girlfriend. I quit weed and nicotine. Now that I don't spend money on drugs, I can get more clothing, shoes, or whatever I want. I actually focus well in school. I got few hook up buddies when ever I feel lonely or horny. I am able to FINALLY BE HAPPY. I FEEL SO LIBERATED. My grades are as high as ever and I am not as terribly insecure anymore. I stopped caring about what others think and I am able to stop taking myself so seriously.
