Do you think your school will ban anything this upcoming school year? If so, then what? For me, and this is the only one I'm almost certain will happen, I'd imagine they aren't gonna allow earbuds in school for the year. (At least I can see why they'd do it, unlike after the Parkland shooting where I felt like even though it said it's so we can hear the teachers in case of an emergency I suspected it was also so we'd only do our work. As long as they'd still let us listen to music (I was thinking with the school's own headphones), even though I'll still be kinda pissed, then I'd be fine with that, especially since not only are we not going back in person for at least September (although I go to a separate technical school last year in the afternoon and since I'm gonna be a senior in a few weeks in the morning and that school is having us come in person during that for two days a week), but we won't be going in person full time at all so that's helpful. If they don't let us listen to music at all then I'm going to be really pissed, even though I could see that happening as well.
