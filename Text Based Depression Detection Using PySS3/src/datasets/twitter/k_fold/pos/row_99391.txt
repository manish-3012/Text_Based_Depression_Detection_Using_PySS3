2 WEEKS! Of no nut..i started fapping when am 15(am still 15) 
But for some reason i just started "no fap" for the boys there do you think its worth it? Because people just stop when they knew they're doing it for long time..i haven't even been on 1 year but i have seen alot of videos of benefits for "for no fap" and i was encouraged..do u think its worth TO STOPP?!
