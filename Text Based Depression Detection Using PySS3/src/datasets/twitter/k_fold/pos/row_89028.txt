Online school is the biggest bs ever To be honest, this form of school is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.
Smart people who try and work for themselves get bad grades because they didn't understood what the teacher taught, while the stupid af people who at school wouldn't even be able to get a positive mark copy every single thing from the smartest student in the class and get good grades. To add to the stupidity, teachers act like nothing has changed, don't adapt their teaching methods and leave the few students who are actually trying to learn to literally f*ck themselves. 

And now, the biggest bs about all this, I live in a island which has 300k people and about 100 cases a day, everyone up to 7th grade still goes to school, but the people who actually need to learn and that have exams go to online schooling. Ffs
