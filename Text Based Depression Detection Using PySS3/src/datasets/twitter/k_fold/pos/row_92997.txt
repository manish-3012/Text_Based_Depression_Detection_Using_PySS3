I got my first compliment from a boy the other day and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. 
A little while ago I woke up at like 10am, I was wearing a hoodie and PJ pants (looking like a dumpster fire, basically)

The living room door was open and I go outside, thereâ€™s some random boy my age and his parents who were talking to my parents. 

My Dad tells me that him and the other Dad there were best friends in High School, and that Ethan and I were friends when we were little. neither of us remember tho.

Apparently we are gonna go down to the local pub where I work and have lunch together, cool. 
I get dressed and we go out to lunch .

We ordered drinks and Ethan and I went to pick them up.
â€œyour eyes are really pretty :)â€
I basically just blushed and said no u but he was smiling like crazy ahhhhh

I cannot explain how happy i am right now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
