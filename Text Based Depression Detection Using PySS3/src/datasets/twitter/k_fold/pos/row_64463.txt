those lyrics always hit me hard, maybe because im suicidal and all or idk "From both sides, all I feel is forgotten memories
An eternal gaze to infinity's immensity
Distance that tear us apart... from an endless world
One last breath, one last whisper
My universe shuts up facing the bridge"

i luv Thy Light, btw any DSBM listener here?
