Does anybody else think about the future and start to worry? Like I have to think about grades and university courses and money/finances and a career path I would like and a job that pays well to keep me out of debt and then like personal life and having a family and it gets so overwhelming and it is pretty scary considering how messed up some things are and how they are so important to life it just seems imposible to even try to fit it all into my head at once that it just becomes stressful.
