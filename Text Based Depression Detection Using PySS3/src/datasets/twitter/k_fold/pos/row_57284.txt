This place is horribly transphobic. As said in the title, this sub is horribly transphobic. I've seen it first hand and it happen to other people. Thankfully the mods are quite good at removing it but it still doesn't change the fact that lots of people here are just horrible. I'm not going to argue about gender in the comments, I'm tired of explaining how I exist and being told "Redlad this article on why you dont!".
