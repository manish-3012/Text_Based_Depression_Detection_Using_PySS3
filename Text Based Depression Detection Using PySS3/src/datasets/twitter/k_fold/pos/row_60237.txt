Is Anyone here also fucking tired of playable adds that go to the app store I know this is cliche but for fuck's sake I have seen more and more and I'm ready to break my phone. Do these big business executives think by annoying customers people will download their apps. What the Hell its getting to such an extent where I and I believe other people are done with this bullshit. This will probably get lost in new but for the people who do see this I hope you have a nice day :)
