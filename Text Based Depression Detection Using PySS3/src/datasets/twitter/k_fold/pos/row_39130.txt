Should I date a girl that is three years younger than I am? I (17M) am a high school Junior and know that a freshman girl (14F) likes me. I think she's cute and would like to try it out and see what happens but am nervous about the significant age difference. I'm am international student (which is the reason why I'm a Junior and not a Senior at 17) and have never dated anyone, so I don't know what to do. Is this too much of a problem or not really? What do you think I should do?
