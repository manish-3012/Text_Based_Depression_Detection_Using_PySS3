moving out at 16 i'm 16, turning 17 in 2 months.
my parents got divorced 8 years ago and i used to live with my mum who used to be my best friend. we started to drift apart after she started dating someone's husband and it doesn't sit right with me since my dad cheated on her. 
i want to see her happy but i'd always stand by what i believe or think what's right. 
she'd use my name to ask him to get us stuff we don't need like luxury gifts &amp; a new phone every time a new one comes out. i grew up with a father who buys me nothing and this should feel like a dream and i should be grateful but i'm sure this isn't right.

she has also started to get physical with me last october (around the time i found out that i was sick) , so my grandma started to visit often and sent me off to one of my relatives' house for 2 months. 

fast forward to march, we were stuck in the house together and it was a living hell. when we could finally go out from the house in june, my grandma decided to move me out of my own house to live at an all girl's house nearby; i finally got to a few weeks ago. she pays my rent every month. i'd come home every week to visit my cats &amp; do the house chores. 

i go to school with my mum everyday though, she picks me up and send me back home. it doesn't feel weird or awkward at all.

i'm enjoying living alone and i feel like my mum's happier without me being at home on weekdays. i get sad &amp; lonely without my cats sometimes but we have a cat monitor at home so i could access them through my phone anytime.
