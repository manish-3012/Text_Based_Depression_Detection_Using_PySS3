I just had the most amazing conversation I go to a big international school, so we get a ton of new students every year. I usually never approach the new students at the begging of the year, this year I regretted that.

Theres this new girl that joined our class that I never talked to (halfway into the schoolyear btw) and about a week ago we had a beach cleanup. We were walking back to the school and I decided to chat with her. Turns out she's a hardcore gamer and loves fps games and batman. We deadass had a 15 minute long conversation about the overused use of the batmobile in Arkahm Knight. Anyway were friends now and frequently talk

Moral of the story: Make an effort to talk to people
