My dad is watching TikTok and idk what to do The reason Iâ€™m worried is because when I search up the trend for the song itâ€™s always a bunch of girls dancing, Iâ€™m scared to call him out bc he hates admitting when he makes a mistake and gets angry when I try to confront him about stuff, PLS HELP.
