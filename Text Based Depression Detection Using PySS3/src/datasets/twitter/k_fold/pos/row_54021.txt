I created a subreddit from something on this subreddit This sub was created here so I figured Iâ€™d post about it here 

R/yougotgot is a subreddit for people to post about people that have in fact gotten got 

Itâ€™s a new subreddit that I made and Iâ€™d really like to see it kick off while youâ€™re there just post someone getting got 

This isnâ€™t a serious subreddit or anything itâ€™s just funny to see people who have gotten got (if you havenâ€™t noticed getting got is a thing we say a lot) thanks for your time
