How to SWALLOW A PILL My Dear and Fellow teenagers.   
I am a 14-year-old girl and I have a problem with swallowing any medicine (pills, tablets), I tried the method with tictac and water, when you put tictac on your tongue, fill your mouth with liquid and tilt your head. Well, honestly, that did not work. What else should I try? P.S. I have a strong gag reflex. And I really want to learn how to do it.
