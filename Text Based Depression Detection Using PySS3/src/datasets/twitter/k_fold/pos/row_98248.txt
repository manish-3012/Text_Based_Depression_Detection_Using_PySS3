My parents saw me leaving the school grounds and now I'm sort of freaking out about it. Me and my friend left for a morning walk and we just went around the school and back in before school. 

My mum called me when I was back in school asking why I left the school, who I was with and such. She yelled at me and I'm definitely overreacting about it and it sucks butt.

To make it worse, I lied about having to meet my friend at the other entry. I told my mum that she arrived around 8 and we went the long way. She hasn't replied so it's ok. 

She asked me to send her a picture of where I was at so I sent one of the school bag racks because that's where I was at the time. Mostly I'm just worried she'll tell my dad who will ground me for sure.

I'm so fucking worried about it lol
