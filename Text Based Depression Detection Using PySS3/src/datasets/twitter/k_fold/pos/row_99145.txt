I hate school I hate it here. I've tried reaching out to people and no one cares, no one even acknowledges how I feel. School is fucking with me so hard and I can't do it anymore, i cant. The stress of having this constant burden on you. I've tried to believe I could make it, I dont believe in anything anymore. Theres only one answer. I hate school, I hate it so much I fuckin hate school
