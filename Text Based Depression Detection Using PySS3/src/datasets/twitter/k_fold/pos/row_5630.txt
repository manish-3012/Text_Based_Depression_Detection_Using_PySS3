I failed my college exam I just got done doing my college math exam. I left half the pages blank. I just freeze up and donâ€™t know what to do. I hate math so much and the only reason Iâ€™m going to college is to make my parents happy. I feel miserable and disgusted with life. Am I really just going to throw a $800 class down the drain. What am I even doing with myself? Fuck me.
