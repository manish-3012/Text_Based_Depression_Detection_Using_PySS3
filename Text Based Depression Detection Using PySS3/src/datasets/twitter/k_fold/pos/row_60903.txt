Ok everyone I have a question for you. When I experience emotional pain, like anger or sadness. I usually do it in bursts. If I feel sad, Iâ€™ll quickly cry and feel better, if Iâ€™m angry, Iâ€™ll start attacking something like a pillow. Does anyone else do this, or would you try doing it, because I live stress free and have no pent up emotions.
