Currently 1am and I am very sad Every night I miss the old times (as in a year ago), when I would hang out with this girl. We were best friends. We were always compared to a couple, we were not. She's not as social anymore and we never hang out anymore. We used to go outside, or stay at her place, watch a movie or something. I can't stop thinking about those moments and watching old videos. I don't like this. Life is much worse now. And she's always sad which makes me sad.

Idk why I'm posting this I just wanna tell someone.
