I got called out as rotten. Am I really an asshole? I had seen a meme in this sub reddit, and commented something since it was relatable to my situation, yet was immediately downvoted and called rotten to the core. 

It was in 6th grade when I asked out a girl who I though was cute. Of course she said no, which was cool with me. What I wasn't cool with though was what events followed.
She was popular, like REALLY popular, so when she began to start calling me out on how ugly and nerdy I was, many people followed on barrading me with negative comments about myself. This continued for 2 years, and as high school was right around the corner I bettered myself mentally and physically. I gained around 30 pounds of muscle and had found new confidence. Later this year, she had started to direct message me in Instagram, which got me a little angry. I didn't reply of course. 

tldr: I asked out a girl, she said no, got her friends to taunt me for 2 years, I got stronger over the last year. 

I explained it on Reddit with a comment, but was called rotten. This isn't a sob story, but just my side of the story. Can anyone with a similar experience or a girl who was on the other side tell me what I possibly have done wrong?
