Most white males would support white male privilege if it weren't for empathy This is from a completely objective standpoint. **I'm not supporting these ideologies.** I'm saying that white male privilege would put me at a natural advantage whether I like it or not. A black woman would want other races to be enslaved to black people, and for women to dominate all social aspects of society. This is because it would put her at an advantage.

The real dilemma for the racists, for the sexists, for the homophobes, etc. is that they would be freely giving away power. They would freely give away their unfair right to be "better" than the other people. *You* want to be better than others, too, but your heart likely wants it to win a fair challenge with no bias and no outside factors.

What we need to do is teach these people how to understand others' points of view and how to show empathy and be charitable. We need to refine our society's moral compass to give everyone a fair chance; to deal everyone a good hand.

If you're confused or angry, just let me know and I will try to help you understand. To clarify, **I do not support these things.** I just want to help others understand why people are the way that they are. Let me know if you need further clarification.
