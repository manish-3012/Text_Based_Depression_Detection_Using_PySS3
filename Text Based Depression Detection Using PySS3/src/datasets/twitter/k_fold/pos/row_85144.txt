Second anxiety attack in two days rn Yeet. Fuck. Well shit iâ€™m like starting to have another anxiety attack right now and itâ€™s the 2nd one in 2 days. 
Shiiit. 

Well it is evening in England and this is usually when they happen but i donâ€™t like them at all. 

Fuck. Well. Do you guys have any ways to calm down?  Shit. Well iâ€™m shaking, crying and breathing heavy so idk. I usually just cry and wait until itâ€™s over because i go weak after and struggle to stand for like 20 mins after so like i might just chill in the bathroom until i calm down because i kinda feel sick.
