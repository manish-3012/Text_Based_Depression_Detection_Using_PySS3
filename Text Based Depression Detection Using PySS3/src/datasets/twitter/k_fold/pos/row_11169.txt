Who's failing online classes due to a lack of motivation because I am. Online school is the worst thing for people like me. I'm a freshman in high school and I am failing almost all of my classes due to my laziness but also my school's bullshit. I've never had a C in my grades since 3rd grade but the first quarter of this school year was when I got my first C in Spanish. I'm in I.B. (International Baccalaureate) which is a program in my school that gives the hardest classes in the school. I am also a major procrastinator. But despite being a procrastinator I've always done good in school because when I was face to face I couldn't skip class so I had to do my work. But in online school you let people like me tune out teachers, tab out of assignments and ignore them, and even cheat on tests. When we learn online and do all of our tests online anyone can take their phone or just open a tab on their computer and look up all the answers for the tests. So what's the point of attending class if everything I learn there is practically useless. But these are unsympathetic reasons as to why its not my fault that I'm failing but it's not all my fault because I was unable to do work for a whole week. That's because I needed a new computer and so I had to wait for a new one to ship in. But I had trouble with that so I missed one week of online school because of things I couldn't control. But the school didn't give a rat's ass about that so I had to make up everything I missed that week. So not only do I have to do any new assignments and tests that pop up but I also have to make up a week's worth of assignments. And I.B. from what I've heard takes up all of your time with homework usually when you are face to face. Add in a week's worth of assignments and my laziness online I am basically fucked.
