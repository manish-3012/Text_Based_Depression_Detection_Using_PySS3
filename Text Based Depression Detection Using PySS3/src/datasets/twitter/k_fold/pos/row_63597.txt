idc if you downvote but: i dont care why youâ€™re depressed like seriously iâ€™ve encountered a lot of people saying after weâ€™ve talked how they like that i have an â€œactualâ€ reason for being depressed, or seeing others telling someone how they donâ€™t have a valid reason and/or are faking.

like cmon stop judging people based on their â€œvalidityâ€ of onesâ€™ depression.
