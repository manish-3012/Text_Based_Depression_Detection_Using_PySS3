Adding onto the menâ€™s Soap post i just made: why are the smell names so vague? I went to see what menâ€™s soaps we had and i found two. The scents were called â€energisingâ€ and â€sportâ€. Bish what?? What does a sport smell like??? The two soaps smelled really similar too, it Was like they just took the same Soap and said â€put some more â€™man Soap smellâ€™ in that one and thats it. Thats the Only notable difference between the two.
