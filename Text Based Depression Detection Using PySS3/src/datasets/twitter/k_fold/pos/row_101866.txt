ðŸš¨ PSA! ðŸš¨ So today I realized that we are 25 days from the start of the school year. :( And I know that some schools are requiring students to go to school. Soooooooo... I know most of us have a better respiratory system then a Karen and we can last more then 20 minutes with a mask, but we should practice wearing a mask for a few hours at a time. I started practicing with a mask today at home and itâ€™s hard fam. But I will be fine eventually. You donâ€™t wanna risk the chance of you pulling down your mask while someone with Covid is around you.

Also to those elder statesmen of this sub make sure yâ€™all practice taking the SAT with a mask on for the same reasons.

Thanks for reading this people in new!
