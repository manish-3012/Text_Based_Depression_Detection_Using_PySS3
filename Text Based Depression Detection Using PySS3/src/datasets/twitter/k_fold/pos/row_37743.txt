Most guys and gals on this sub seem to be so nice and wholesome I'm really not doing this for karma, I just felt a sudden rush of emotions and wanted to express that. This sub feels safe and it gives a homely warm vibe. Y'all don't seem to be the fuckboy or fuckgirl type, not the bullying type, give advice as good as you can, make us laugh, help us cope, and are just so nice and wholesome. We all are pretty cringey stupid teenagers but this sub is just &lt;3. Most of this sub. I love y'all, take care of yourselves, you're awesome and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise xx
