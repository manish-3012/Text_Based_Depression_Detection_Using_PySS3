I and my girlfriend played minecraft together and it was so amazing We went to the nether for the first time in this world together, and I protected her, and saved her from two endermen, a piglin and a ghast. We actually died together when those little magma cubes killed us, but I then took my revenge, and managed to take both of our stuff home safely. After that, I wanted to build a fountain. I started with the base, but then I had to go. I had so much fun with her, she is the most incredible person ever ðŸ¥º
