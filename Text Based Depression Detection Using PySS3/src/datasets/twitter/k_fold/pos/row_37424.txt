i want to cry ive been with this girl for like a month after weve been talking for like half a hear and ive never had these feelings for anyone before, like i love her to bits. 

but anyways shes been acting really strange for like a week and i had a really bad feeling that like she had lost feelings for me so i asked her and pretty much she said that she wasnt sure but she thought sl

like i dont really know how to react cause like she told me about how she wanted a nice relationship with like meeting eachothers families and like doing shit together and it sounded magical honestly so i dont fucking know how to react now

i want to fucking cry my eyes out but i havent eaten anything today so i dont have the energy to do so
