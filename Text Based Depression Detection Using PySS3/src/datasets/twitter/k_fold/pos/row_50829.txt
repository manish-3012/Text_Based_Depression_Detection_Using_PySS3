We dodged a bullet this year As many of you guys know, Halloween wasnâ€™t the same last year. Especially for the Starburst lovers. They were all pink, despite not being marked all pink. 

I have bought a jumbo size bag of assorted fruity candy. If came with Starbursts. I opened them all up, and they were not all pink. 

Crisis averted.
