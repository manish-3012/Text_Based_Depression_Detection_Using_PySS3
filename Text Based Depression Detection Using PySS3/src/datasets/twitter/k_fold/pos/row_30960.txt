when I look in the mirror I don't like the face that looks back I  have made some unhealthy choices in my life and I hate myself for it. I guess I have a sugar addiction and I have gained quite a bit of weight. I tell myself every day that it would make my life so much better if I tried to eat better but I always eat the old garbage. I really wish I had friends that gave a shit about me but this virus has made it harder to talk to them. I really wish there was someone besides my parents who genuinely loved me but I don't see that as happening anytime soon.
