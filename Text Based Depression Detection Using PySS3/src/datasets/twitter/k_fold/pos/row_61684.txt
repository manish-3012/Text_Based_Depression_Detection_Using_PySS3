After my teacher stopped using protection and had an accident, he started using protection again. However, the damage has been done I just feel that if he used protection like I did, he wouldnâ€™t be in this situation.   
Some people say that using protection is embarrassing, but I say that itâ€™s just to be safe. Plus, itâ€™s relatively inexpensive, so I donâ€™t see why you wouldnâ€™t want to use protection.
  
His iPhone XS was pristine up until 2 weeks ago where he took off the case and screen protector, confident that he wouldnâ€™t drop it, but he did.    
The back of his phone now has a cracked corner and since then, he started using a case again, but that wonâ€™t change the fact that his phone has been damaged.   
  
Iâ€™ve always been a fan of protection. Every phone in my collection from my iPhone 5, which is the oldest phone I own, to my pride and joy iPhone XS Max has a drop rated case and a tempered glass screen protector because Iâ€™d rather deal with a damaged case/screen protector than a damaged phone
