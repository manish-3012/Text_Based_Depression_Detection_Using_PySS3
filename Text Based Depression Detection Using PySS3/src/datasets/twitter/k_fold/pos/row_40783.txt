Will you go out on a date with me? We'll go to the mall, have dinner at any place you like in the food court. It could be asian food, sushi, mcdonald's, KFC, pizza hut, or anything else. We'll then go to H&amp;M, and try so many clothes and oversized hoodies, and we could also watch the dancing fountain together. We'll have such a great time, what do you say? :)
