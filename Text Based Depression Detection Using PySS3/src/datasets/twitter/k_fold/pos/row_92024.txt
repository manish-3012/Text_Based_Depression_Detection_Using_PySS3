My big brother just got COVID My 16 year old paraplegic brother is in the hospital because of COVID, this virus is not a joke and a lot more people need to realize this. He recently went to the hospital for a MRSA infection (staph infection but itâ€™s antibiotic resistant) and got it at the hospital and has to stay there because of it, seeing as he already has a compromised immune system he may not make it.
