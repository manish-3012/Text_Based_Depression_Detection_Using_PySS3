Pulling two all nighters in a row, mostly my fault. I dont think people are supposed to be conscious this long, apparently going this long without a reset can have some weird effects, one of them likely being my writing, as I don't notice either but it may seem like near nonsense to some of you.

I guess this is what I get for sitting on my ass all week and not doing my work, evidently Skyrim is more important.
