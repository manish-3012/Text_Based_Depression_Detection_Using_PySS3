My dad is pressuring me into getting a girlfriend. My dad says that since Iâ€™m Iâ€™m a Junior in high school that I need a girl friend. He keeps trying to get me to hook up with this girl from another school. It makes me feel super awkward. Her and I are friends and that makes it even worse. On top of that he says that if I donâ€™t ask her out then he will for me. WTH, not only does that embarrass me but, it will also embarrass her. Iâ€™m so confused on why he would do this. If anyone has an answer to this problem, please tell me.
