I'm kinda scared It's 7:38 in the morning. My whole family seems to be asleep. Just a few minutes ago someone knocked on the door and rang the doorbell quickly, as if they were in distress. No one opened. Before I could even grab my phone it was gone again. Maybe it was just a normal doorbell ringing enhanced by me probably being half asleep. But what if it wasn't? What if someone needed help? Or what if the person was dangerous?
