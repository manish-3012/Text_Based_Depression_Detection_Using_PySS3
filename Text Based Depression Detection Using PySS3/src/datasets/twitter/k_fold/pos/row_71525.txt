Thereâ€™s something i dont like So i know my best friend(idk if she sees me as too) for like 4 years and i kinda like her and some months ago we were still in the same class and saw eachother literally everyday and later she switched classes because her grades couldnt keep up and now we only see eachother a few times.

Since she is in a new class she made new friends and she only talks to them and it feels like she has a new life that i dont fit in. Today i saw her and she was sitting with some friends and i decided to come sit with her and talk. When i was talking a friend of her kept staring at me and asked me what i was doing here, i said shut up so nothing important. After that i went away and she asked me why i went away.

I said that i just dont feel comfortable being with them, its not her fault but shes always with her friends and i dont like them. She said she understood tho. 

All i want is to go back in time so she fixed her grades and we stayed together, i really miss her and i want to be with her without her stupid friends.
