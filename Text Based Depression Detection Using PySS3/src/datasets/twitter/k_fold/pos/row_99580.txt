An advice on boys, from a boy 1. do not push us in the river. we can drown.

2. when a guy gives you a back hug, bites your shoulder gently or touches your ding dong chest balls DO NOT call the police or scream "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?!!" or "HOW DID YOU GET IN????", just appreciate what he's doing and let him do it, you can play touch his ding dong stick too.

that's it I hope it helps
