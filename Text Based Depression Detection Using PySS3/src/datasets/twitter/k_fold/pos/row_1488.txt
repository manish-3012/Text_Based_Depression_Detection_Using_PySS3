The best gamer child parenting tip I'm going to get my child the 1.6 of minecraft on his 6th birthday and tell him its a super new game. And every year I will get him a newer version of the game. (so at 7 years old 1.7 and at 8 years 1.8 etc.)
That way, my child will be able to experience what we did back then. Of course the child is going to find out dome day when Minecraft was released, but just for the moment, they may experience a good game.
And he won't be allowed to turn off the music.
