Dont sleep on your arm So a few days ago i randomly woke up because smt was disturbing me. Anyway so i try to stand up to see whats going on that i realize I literally have slept on my arm for the whole night and my arm vacuumed my ear. I waited a while for it to pass because i was sleepy and didnâ€™t take it serious and a few minutes later I realized i cant hear anythig from that ear. Its been a week now and my ear is better now but i cant tell if thats what am I actually suppose to hear or its what i hear when my one ear is kinda blocked i know this sentence just didnâ€™t make sense but anyway idk
