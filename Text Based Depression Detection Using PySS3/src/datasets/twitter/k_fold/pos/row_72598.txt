What do we Think of the Term â€œMansplainingâ€? Heard it being used by someone the other day, and again on this subreddit a few minutes ago. 

And I realised that I really do not like that word, haha. 

I understand that we live in a world that pigeon-holes girls as â€œinherently less intelligentâ€ which leads to some men feeling the need to talk down to them - leading to a condescending explanation of something to a woman that they already knew. 

I know this exists. But the word. It just rubs me the wrong way â€” what do the people in New think of the word and itâ€™s definition?
