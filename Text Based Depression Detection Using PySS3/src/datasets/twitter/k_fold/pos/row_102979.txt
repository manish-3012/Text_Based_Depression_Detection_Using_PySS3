I apparently suck at choosing friends hey guys, gals, and non binary pals

sooo I've been pretty unlucky throughout life when it came to friends. I am not kidding when I say every single friend I've had has ended up ghosting me or we drift apart. I currently only have one close friend, and I've known them since 7th grade. so my hopes are pretty high for this friendship, but at the same time I don't want to get too attached in case it doesn't end up working out. I'm just scared of getting hurt again.

I used to think that not all people are bad, and I still kind of do, but my dad used to always tell me not to trust anyone because people aren't trustworthy and they always end up leaving. and I even believe it a bit now. I mean, no friend has ever stayed with me. they've always moved on or ghosted me. I know this is a pretty negative viewpoint on life, but can you honestly blame me? nobody has ever given me a reason to think otherwise. I remember being in a sad spot where I wondered if something was wrong with me. something had to be wrong for friends to always just leave me and never stay. I got out of that funk though and I'm now in a good place mentally and emotionally, considering the COVID circumstances and I'm more comfortable and happy with my situation. of course I'm still sad about losing friends, but I'm slowly accepting that this is how people are?

I'm a good friend. I try to stay in contact with them, texting and asking how they're doing, even if it's just for some help w/ homework. but I also noticed that I'm always the one to either reach out first or the only one really making an effort to keep in contact. that's why I don't talk to two of my old best friends anymore. I always texted first and we'd come up with dates to talk again and they'd never come through. so I just stopped messaging or doing anything involving them early last year and there has been nothing from them. so it's safe to say these friendships died out. it's just sad to think about. I'm a very social and confident person so I have no problem making new friends with people. I actually have maybe 20+ friends or people I know and am friendly with, but only 1 close friend and that's just because I've known them for so long. but I still find myself worrying that they'll leave me too and it hurts tbh. I don't to get attached in case they end up leaving, but I also want to let myself just accept that maybe this friendship will work out. but if I keep my distance and they do end up being a real friend, I'll feel bad for not just accepting them, but on the other hand, if I let myself get close and comfortable and then they leave, it'll hurt more. I never know anymore. it sucks that I have this mentality that people suck and aren't trustworthy but nobody has ever given me a reason to think otherwise.

I know this is probably because I'm still in high school so people aren't the most mature. are people nicer in college? or are they worse? either way, I apparently suck at choosing friends and who I get close with because they end up leaving. do I just have bad luck? idek. this was just a vent tbh and to see if anyone has gone through something similar. I'm gotten over most of the friendships because I'm stronger now than I was back then and know that no matter what, I still have myself and my family there for me. a part of me thinks that it's just pure bad luck and there are genuinely good people out there. I mean, there are billions of people on this planet. some are bound to be good people so I'm letting myself be a bit hopeful. for now though, I'll just keep on keepin on and see where things end up

k that is all, bye :)
