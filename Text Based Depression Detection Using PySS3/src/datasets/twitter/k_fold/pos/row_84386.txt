Bruh sometimes I hate old ppl I went into an antique store with my friend to get a small gift, my friend had gotten a tie for someone and when we went to check out this old man was like â€œwhat do girls wear ties now tooâ€ in that stupid lil condescending voice that they do. Like bruh jus donâ€™t talk, plz. It would make the world a better place if u did not speak.
