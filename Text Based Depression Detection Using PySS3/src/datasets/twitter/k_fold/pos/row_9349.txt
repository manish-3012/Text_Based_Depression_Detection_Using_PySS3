Who wants to hear about my second day of school Great your still reading which means your probably arenâ€™t busy and want to hear me rant. So basically I developed a crush at 8 in the morning and haha I hate it so much, and then I developed a second one at 9 am so now I feel like a crush whore. But then the entire county was on their iPads so nothing was working so I was getting assigned hella homework and had no clue what was going on. Oh and Iâ€™m officially flunking band because I couldnâ€™t get in the class because like I said nothing was working, and my ela teacher assigned a essay in tv for the second day of school. TV.... FREAKING TV! What am I supposed to do with that, and I got in trouble for texting during class even though I was working from my phone and iPad, and they tried to dress code me because it looked like I was wearing pjs. I FREAKING love school. Thank you for hearing me rant reddit, thereâ€™s no real issue, I just needed to vent
