This kinda sucks I just felt like putting this here read it if you want.

So this is sorta a follow up from my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ir63vr/should_i_ask_her_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) read it if you want. So I did ask her out but she said she couldnâ€™t date anyone then. I figured it was for a personal reason and moved on from it. Fast forward 2 months, and weâ€™ve gotten a lot closer, we spend every break together, talk for hours on snap everyday and sometimes hang out outside of school. And when we hang out weâ€™re always right beside each other, like presses up against each other. So because of all that, I asked her out again. She said again she couldnâ€™t date right now. So I was thinking about that and put some dots together.

So I know her mom can be a bit weird and controlling. And she would never tell me why she broke up with her last boyfriend, then my mom told me (through mutual friends) that her mom made her break up with her old boyfriend 

Now Iâ€™m stuck in a situation where I could finally get what Iâ€™ve been striving for for the past 10 months and I canâ€™t because of her mom
