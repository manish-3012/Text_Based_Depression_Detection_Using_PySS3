Does anyone think that school is giving us too much work? Or is it just me Everyone in my middle school is saying we have too much work and the teachers are doing nothing about it. I got some votes and I got over 87% are saying we have too much work. Tell me if this is happening to everyone. Also, Iâ€™m showing my data to my teachers so they believe us.
