Really need some advice Hi so with school starting up again I would like to hear what you people think. No girl a my school would speak to me. And there is a good reason. In the start of last year I was really broke had no money to my name so I started selling weed. Surprisingly I was one of the first and I made a lot of money and never got caught because I only sold off school property. It was all good till the word spread too much. Surprisingly most a of my guy friends gave no shits but everyone else became scared of me or they were buying from me. After that I started selling a lot more. And it became to much. So I stopped when the school year was over. I don't regret selling because now I own a motorcycle and pay insurance for it. And I really don't want to go back to it because now I have a really good job in sales where I make enough. I really would like to fix my reputation so people won't be scared of me. Any advice thanks.
