GUYS I MADE A BET WITH SOMEONE I told them that i'd raise my Karma by a thousand every week and the bet is going to end in three days...i was supposed to reach 9 thousand...also i'm pretty sure my 15 year old body would give out if i tried to do 1000 push ups (continuously)...so just help me out here..i tried my best..am i a Karma whore?...absolutely..feel free to make fun of me in the comments...my entire rep will go to shit if this does not work out.
