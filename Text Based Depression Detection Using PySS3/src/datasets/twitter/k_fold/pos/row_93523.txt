Gay Teens how much does it mean when someone says "I know we're both bottoms but I'm willing to set aside my sexual preferrences if it means working out a relationship with you" I don't know whether to awe our laugh. I've put his message on unseen for almost a week already. I never even replied to it and just started having a different conversation with him. 

We met in 11th grade and became really close friends at group works. Now I'm in college and we're both coincidentally classmates and in the same course, been friends and talking really close because our subjects are the same. 

He's a funny guy and very open, so I was shocked to hear because in my head I thought he was joking. Or idk honestly anymore.
