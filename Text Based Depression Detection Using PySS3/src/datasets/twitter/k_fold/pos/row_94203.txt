I got rejected for the first time... Like, what in Zuesâ€™s sparky little fingers! Why is a Capacitor Wand considered a weapon??? I was just going to do some cool magic tricks with it but NO, apparently it poses a risk to â€œmedical equipmentâ€ and that there will be â€œserious consequencesâ€ if said equipment fails! Fine then, Iâ€™m going to make tissues float around in my room then, no magic for the patients.
