Black lives matter. Now I know all you people on the subreddit going to start screaming alm in the comments but how come you only say all lives matter when black people were trying to fight for equality? None of yall weren't saying shit before George floyd and every other black brother and sisters death to hate crime, but when we start demanding for justice and equality and no systemic racism bullshit you people wanna say all lives matter. Question how come the high majority of people who say all lives matter is white american/European but it's only black people, Hispanics and all other minor ethnic groups who understand the true meaning of black lives matter. Smh yall only saying all lives matter out of ignorance and if that's really the case do; paedophiles lives matter, do the ku klux clan lives matter, did Hitlers life matter or even bin laden's life matter? Ok then my point is the high majority of people who say alm=white lives matter.
