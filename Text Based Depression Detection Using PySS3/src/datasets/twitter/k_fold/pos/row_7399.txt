At the end of it all What is "the end"? No, not the earth or you. The thing far more important than anything ever, space. Rather, what's the end of the universe? 

- To find out, we start at our sun. The gigantic ball of fire will eventually die believe it or not. Skipping a lot of sciency stuff, the sun will expand into a massive red giant, swallowing Mercury, Venus and the earth. However, rather than exploding, the sun will die in a spectacular planetary nebula, leaving only its core behind. About 97% of stars will end up this way

- The core of the sun is now a white dwarf. A star with the size of the earth but with half the mass of the sun. They are so dense, they become amongst one of the hottest things in the universe. Ranking 44th or smthn. 

- They burn out only through cosmic radiation, which is incredibly inefficient. Meaning that they will shine for hundreds of trillions of years. After the last supergiants explode into spectacular supernovas, after the last space dust is used up and the last galaxy created, the death of the universe will begin. 

- Slowly, stars will start dying off. First the bigger stars, then sun like stars. After trillions of years after the last red dwarf quietly turns into a brown dwarf, only the white dwarfs will remain. The last light in the entire universe. They would power civilizations for a time so long that calling it 'forever' isn't wrong. 

- But the end will come eventually. After trillions upon trillions of years white dwarfs will start converting into black dwarfs. Corpses. Left with no energetic output. 

- It will be complete darkness, with black dwarfs and black holes scattered throughout the dying universe, each trillions of kilometers away from eachother. 

â€” After that, who knows. If the atom has a set lifetime, black holes and black dwarfs would slowly evaporate away. If it doesn't, the black dwarfs would very slowly turn into balls of iron. 

- This sounds depressing, but it's so far away from us, that you shouldn't worry about it. The sky is full of stars, all of them waiting for us.
