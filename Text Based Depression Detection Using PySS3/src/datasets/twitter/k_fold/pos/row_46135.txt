I just discovered the fluffy community and the content is really fucking with me. Don't get me wrong, it's not the actual people who like that stuff that I'm uncomfortable with. They aren't hurting anyone, and it's much healthier than not expressing their thoughts and possibly getting into actually bad shit. 

But the content just really messed with me. It's all I can think about at the moment when I'm not actively taking my mind off of it. I'm not going to explain what it is, you can look it up for yourself. There is a subreddit, which is how I discovered it. And please don't be a dick if you do check it out and it makes you uncomfortable. That doesn't help, it just makes us both look like loser.

I mostly made this post to get it off my chest, so this is a pretty useless post.
