**Armadillos** meaning "little armoured ones" in Spanish are [New World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World) [placental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placental) [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) in the [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)) [Cingulata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cingulata). The [Chlamyphoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamyphoridae) and [Dasypodidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasypodidae) are the only surviving [families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) in the order, which is part of the superorder [Xenarthra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenarthra), along with the [anteaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anteater) and [sloths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth). Nine [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_taxon) [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) and 21 extant [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour. All species are native to the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas), where they inhabit a variety of different environments.

Armadillos are characterized by a leathery [armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour_(anatomy)) shell and long sharp claws for digging. They have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about 75Â cm (30Â in), including tail. The [giant armadillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_armadillo) grows up to 150Â cm (59Â in) and weighs up to 54Â kg (119Â lb), while the [pink fairy armadillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_fairy_armadillo) has a length of only 13â€“15Â cm (5â€“6Â in). When threatened by a predator, *Tolypeutes* species frequently roll up into a ball (these being the only species of Armadillo capable of such).
