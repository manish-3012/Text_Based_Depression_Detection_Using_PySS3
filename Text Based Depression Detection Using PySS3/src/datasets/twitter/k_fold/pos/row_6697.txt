How To Speed Run Pooping 

Let me paint you a picture, it's the middle of English class, and I need to shit. I run to the bathroom, ass clenched and tears welling up. I take off my pants and underwear and shit as hard as I can. I am an avid spicy mayo enjoyer, so I'm used to spicy shits, but slim Jims are a real, and quite literal pain in the ass. My asshole was practically bursting at the seams. But I prevailed. I held my nose down, to stop air from leaving, or entering my nose and it pushed my flaming hot cocoa log out like a well oiled nerf gun. It reduced smell, and increased efficiency. But one thing it could not do was heal my poor ass. But I found a solution.

Lotion. I assure you it stung, but holy Jesus it's a life saver. I now sit here today, still in English class, ass empty and as comfy as an ass can get.

I want to come to this community with my findings. I wish for my knowledge to be spread near and far.

â€¢hold nose for less smell and faster shit

â€¢use lotion for torn and spicy asshole

I must go, but I will come back on my lunch break. Shit wisely, my friends.
