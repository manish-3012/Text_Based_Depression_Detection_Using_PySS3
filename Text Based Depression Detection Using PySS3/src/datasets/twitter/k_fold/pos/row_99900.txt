How do I get over someone? I like a guy, quite a bit, but he doesn't like me in that way. It's fine, a little sad for me, but it's whatever. I still like him, but given the above statements, he's grown a bit distant. I often check to see if he's replied to my messages (left on read). I think the best thing to do is just leave it and not double text, but I kinda just miss talking to him.
