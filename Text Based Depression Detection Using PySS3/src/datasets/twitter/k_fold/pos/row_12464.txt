my teacher is fucking dumb ok so im doing my work in class and my teacher, who hates my friend since he always plays games, becomes kinda sus about me since im talking to him too much. She comes over and has a peek at my computer screen, and sees my friend searching up computers (not what hes supposed to be doing and me doing my work. The teacher makes my friend sit next to her, but then a minute later she becomes suspicious about me. She comes over again and sees me still doing my work. She demands to see the amount of work i've done, which is not much cuz im not the fastest worker, and just assumes i was playing games and tells me to show her my taskbar. Unfortunately for me, i had minecraft in my background from when i was playing with friends the night before, and she tells me to close it, threatening to give me detention, so i close it and the teacher goes back to her desk and starts flaming my friend. About 15 minutes later, i had made a lot of progress and i had to click on this link,, but my webpage kinda freezes so i start clicking frantically on the link. Teacher gets triggered and comes over to me, claiming she 'saw me playing games' and demanded to see my taskbar again. However, there were no games on my taskbar, so she tells me to do tHe RIghT THInG and walks away, with that 'fuck you' look on her face. I missed the detention my a millimetre lol. So how are your teachers?
