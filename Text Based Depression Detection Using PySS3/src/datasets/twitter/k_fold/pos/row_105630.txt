You ever see a tiktok then start bawling? For context, I lost my father four years ago. I've never really had a relationship with him. Tonight, I saw this video of a man taking his camera through a store and talking to it like it was his child. And I'm crying right now because I just wish I was treated like that. I'm crying hard over what I wish my relationship with my dad was. I feel like I'm about to break and I just wish I could be held rn
