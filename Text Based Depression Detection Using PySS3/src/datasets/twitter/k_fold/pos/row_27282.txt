I'm in need of relationship helllppppppppp So I am a 15 white male and a 15 white woman has declared she may want to go further then friendship with me a few months back. We have known each other since 2nd grade but we only developed a friendship since 7th or 8th grade. We were assumed to be boyfriend&amp;girlfriend by our peers already so we made a "pact" saying we won't be, we would just be friends. Well ever since she broke that pact I have been having reciprocating feelings for her (I think) and tonight we said that if we're going to make it official we should both give our brains some thinking time first (about a week). So I think I want to go and be the perfect one she can ever have. The main problem is.... how do I boyfriend. Like are there set things you do? I know being a gentleman and not being a jerk in general would be a major benefit but how does a relationship like this work? Plz ask any questions if you don't understand something or want a bit more context (there's a certain amount im willing to go) so ye
