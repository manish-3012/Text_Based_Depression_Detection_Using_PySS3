My (m) friend (f) and I are really close and I need some advice Iâ€™m currently 15 and Iâ€™ve been friends with this girl for about a year. We dated for a couple of months in 8th grade, had a lot of fun, and then broke up for some reason that I still donâ€™t understand entirely. We started texting last March during the first quarantine in the US. Weâ€™ve been getting closer since then and sheâ€™s really helped me get through a lot of mental health stuff that Iâ€™ve had to deal with in the last 8 months or so. 

Iâ€™ve realized over the past few months or so that I really enjoy spending time with her. I donâ€™t know why, but she and I just have a really deep connection and I really enjoy it. She makes my day better when we talk and something about her makes sense in my mind; something that hasnâ€™t happened with anyone else. 

We started face timing since I got an iphone a few days ago and I used to have these basically horror dreams where I was essentially tortured and killed. Itâ€™s been 3 days now and I havenâ€™t had one since. Itâ€™s amazing.

I love her with every part of me and Iâ€™m not sure how to even deal with it. Iâ€™m stuck between telling her that I love her as more than a friend but I really donâ€™t want to make things awkward. Itâ€™s really obvious that she looks at me as a very close friend, but nothing more. I donâ€™t know how to either move past this or confront it. I donâ€™t even know if all of this is just hormones even.

I really think that she could be someone that I marry 8 or 9 years in the future. I know life changes and people are different, but Iâ€™m not even exaggerating when I say that I have 5 or 10 people asking me a month if weâ€™ll ever be a couple or if we are one. It hurts a little bit when people ask that.

tl;dr I really think that I love my best friend but Iâ€™m not sure what to do about it
