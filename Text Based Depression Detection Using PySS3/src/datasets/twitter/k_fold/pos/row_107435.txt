I got a plan guys So my lack of sleep thing? Not a problem anymore! Iâ€™ve decided that instead of playing games and enjoying my limited free time on the weekends Iâ€™m going to sleep. Iâ€™m going back to my hobby of lucid dreaming and I plan to sleep all day. That when on days like these when I literally donâ€™t sleep in between school days, I donâ€™t pass out! iâ€™m tired and i want to die omg. dreading next year
