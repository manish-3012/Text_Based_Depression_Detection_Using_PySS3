Dont you love When every Friday your parents have to "go somewhere" and aren't back for like an hour and then say they went to the store even though they brought nothing back and then they sit in the garage all night getting high and don't do anything other then come in to tell you to go to sleep and then complain about not having miney or being broke even though there the ones who smoke everyday, atleast my mom.. and when they come back inside they don't even speak to you. Pretty awesome how that happens every Friday am i right? Pretty cool when your moms addicted but you don't say anything because you don't wanna act weird for a long time. Sorry for rant I've been feeling like shit lately
