Whrn I was young I was always told and understood that I didn't act normal, but then the problem was I didn't know what notmal even was, and it just annoyed me Like ever since kindergarten when I would go into meltdowns regularly and subsequently end up having those meltdowns for years, I was often told and knew that I wasn't normal. Like I wasn't explicitly told that but I remember clearly being told that the other kids in class weren't acting that way. And it is just annoying when you know you aren't a normal person but don't know what normal is because you've been this way your entire life and so have no idea how a normal person would feel or react. It just annoys me sometimes.
