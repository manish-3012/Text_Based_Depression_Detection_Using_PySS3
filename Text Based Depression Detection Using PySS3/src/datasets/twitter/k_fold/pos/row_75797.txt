So sad So, my friend was in my van with my mom, and I was showing him some memes. Just to clarify I have well over a thousand memes saved on my phone from through the years, and he told my mom that is was time to check my phone. I knew she wouldnâ€™t approve of some of the memes on there so I ended up deleting every. Single. Meme. So now Iâ€™m starting over with my meme collection.
