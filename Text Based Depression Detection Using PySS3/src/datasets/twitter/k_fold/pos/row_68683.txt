It is now less then a day until my actual birthday I'm both excited and nervous, excited because of Turning 16 and being able to do more but nervous because of stuff like getting a driver's license and a job and all that yada yada yada, it feels both good and bad to turn 16 especially because it means I'm one year closer to being an adult and on my own in the world. So yeah I'm reasonably nervous but mostly excited
