I'm hitting a hard restart on my life. For a long while now i've been an aspiring content creator and i've always tried making my online presence known. But recently i've given my actions so far some though and i've realised that i've been faking being happy with what i've done. Sure I believe my life so far has been pretty good but i've made many mistakes that I just want to undo but i know cant be done with the push of a button. I'm gonna be making a new Google account, new Instagram, new Reddit, new YouTube and a new me. I'm sick of never having fun and enjoying myself. I'm sick of having to listen to others and how I should go about making my dreams come true. If i want something done I'm gonna do it myself, one way or another. And that includes making sure my education does not get in the way of my dreams nor does it hinder my ability to progress in my education in the stuff i love.  


(Note: I'm not gonna quit school or anything, i'm just gonna do subjects that i actually enjoy)
