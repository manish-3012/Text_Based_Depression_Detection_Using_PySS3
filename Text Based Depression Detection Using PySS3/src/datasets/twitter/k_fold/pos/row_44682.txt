If you honestly have no idea what you want to major in before going to college/worried your chosen major wonâ€™t get you a good paying job, please consider going into a trade. If you become an electrician, a plumber, or any other trade, you would be making around $20.00 an hour right out of high school. You would be in a union protected job with full benefits and a nice pension to retire on. Most jobs donâ€™t have pensions anymore and you rely on what you save in your 401k to live on after you retire. You would have regular pay raises and would be making around $30 an hour by the time youâ€™re 28 and you wouldnâ€™t have any crippling student loan debt. Plus trade jobs are always in demand and you could apply to a position and get hired the same week. 

Before signing your life away on loans, really consider doing a trade instead, especially if youâ€™re not even sure what you would even do with a college degree. 

Sincerely, 
A jaded 25year old who was forced to go to law school because her two BAs in English and Psychology are essentially useless and is in over $100,000 in debt.
