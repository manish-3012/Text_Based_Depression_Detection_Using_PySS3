A mini post panic attack rant/ramble I hate spiders. The only spider that I don't hate is a daddy long legs. I was about to go to bed when I saw the biggest spider in my house. Easily over an inch squared. Now I've got it in my head that it was a brown recluse. I had a panic attack after screaming and smacking it with my broom (which broke) and then smushing it with my boot. It took about 40 minutes of crying and hyperventilating and repeating "it's dead and there are no more" to work up the courage to bolt upstairs to my bedroom. Now I'm paranoid and scared. 

What can be fired at a distance that can kill any spider including a black or brown widow and a brown recluse? Where can I purchase such a thing? Is it toxic to cats? 

I'm currently curled in the fetal position on my bed flinching every time I feel a slight anything. Idk where else to post this...
