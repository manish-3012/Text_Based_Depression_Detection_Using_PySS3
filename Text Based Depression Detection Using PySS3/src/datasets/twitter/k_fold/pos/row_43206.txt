This society cares too much about peoples feelings 
Your company doesnâ€™t have that many fat models, letâ€™s normalize it because peoples feelings are more important than setting basic health standards because of self esteem. If you are obese there will be less models, because obese people arenâ€™t as attractive and most people arenâ€™t obese.This is one of the many many examples of what I mean, if a college didnâ€™t accept me I would be sad with low self esteem, but with logic like this, itâ€™s basically allowing everyone to get into college, not the best comparison but you get the point. if I lose the olympics any my feelings are hurt instead of working hard were just gonna give everyone a gold medal? Every group of people Is just getting offended over everything, if you make people feel negative in any sort of way in 2020 itâ€™s gonna offended someone.people now are so spoiled, i feel like people just want life to be an easy cake walk since people are complaining about the weirdest â€œstrugglesâ€ they go through and most of them donâ€™t have a direct impact it just hurts some peoples feelings. People need to learn they canâ€™t make everyone they ever interact with nice to them, 

either they build thick skin or make everyone they ever come across care about their feelings, 

which sounds more realistic, okay then build thick skin and stop getting butthurt over the smallest things, because itâ€™s impossible to make everyone nice to you and itâ€™s unrealistic
