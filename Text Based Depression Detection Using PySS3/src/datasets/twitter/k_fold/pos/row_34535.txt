This sub got me feeling jealous Everytime I go onto this sub, I'll see people(mostly 15-16) talk about things like relationships or asking their crush out. Dont get me wrong, I'm proud of you guys, but this makes me feel jealous about myself. I'm 17(almost 18) and I can't help but feel like my life is uneventful and that I haven't accomplished anything meaningful yet. I feel pressured to do things like find a girlfriend and to make memorable events. I've struggled with social anxiety throughout most of high-school, but I wanted to try and change that this year. I was looking forward to my senior year but it got canceled because of covid-19 and now I just feel awful.
