Hey all You guys may or may not remember me from this

https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/l50vnh/welp_this_is_probably_my_last_night_on_earth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Well, I guess itâ€™ll no longer be my last night since Iâ€™ve decided to keep on trucking through and seeing where stuff goes. 

I could go in depth as to the specifics but I donâ€™t wanna make this a big block of text, so if you wanna talk or anything then just DM me or leave a comment or somethin.

And to everyone who replied to the original post: thank you, so very much. People like you are the reason the world hasnâ€™t fallen apart yet
