Does this girl like me I know these posts are DTD but I just wanna make sure. Also bad format cuz Iâ€™m on mobile. I met this girl last year through a mutual and we hit it of pretty well. We exchanged numbers and talked frequently. She eventually invited me to a group chat with other girls from my grade. After around 2 months Conversation slowly died out because of quarantine and stuff. During summer I went to a cabin for a week my brother and his friends decided to text her when I accidentally left my phone out and on they texted her pretending to be a girl telling her to back off because I was hers or smnth she replied with wtf who was that. Later in September she texted me and we talked about the normal things games TV anime etc we talked up a storm over the next couple of days. Then she invited to a discord server with her and her friends and I became good friends with them. As time went on I picked up in the little thing like how would could tease each other, she laughed at my unfunny jokes and she remembered some obscure things. But 2 weeks ago her father went through her phone and saw the discord. Someone said â€œuwu ballsâ€ in chat and her father assumed it was me, so she was banned from talking to me. She was allowed to talk to the rest of the discord chat (dc) but she kept trying to be able to talk to me. Earlier this week her and her friend went up to her cabin and they we able to get her back in the dc and she seemed a bit shyer than usual when we talked. Quickly before I go closing notes. 1. After the prank she forgave me immediately and we talked about stuff for a bit. 2 Iâ€™m ugly 3. In a discord call she said she respected me but when her close friend asked she didnâ€™t. That is all sorry for bad formatting again, If you all think itâ€™s a yes Iâ€™m gonna wait because the whole â€œnot allowed to talk to meâ€ situation and stuff. So please I am eager what is it
