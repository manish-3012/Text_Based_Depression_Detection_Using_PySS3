Is it just me or is it that almost everyone who vapes happens to be really stupid Everyone that I know capes in my school is really stupid. I never think of vaping as a personality trait but it definitely indicates others. It just feels like they can't really think that much about anything more complicated than algebra I. I guess it's just cause I go to a small country school so people raised redneck style prolly shouldn't be expected to do any kind of rational thinking.
