Fuck the rule of no Headwear/hood is so fucking stupid and the people who actively try to enforce this. Fuck you tl;dr.    I have major anxiety problems and having to take of my hood worsens it a fuck ton

There are a lot of people with anxiety/self esteem/... issues who would rather never been seen in public at all (you guessed it that's me) and feel super fucking uncomfortable if they can't wear a hood to cover up their face. Idk if i speak for all but it literally worsens my  anxiety a hundred fold when i have to take it off. I get so anxious it's insane. I can't see a reason behind this rule except just because they can.
