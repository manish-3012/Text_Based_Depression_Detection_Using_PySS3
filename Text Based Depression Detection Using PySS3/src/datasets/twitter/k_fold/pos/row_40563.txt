If you think someone that uses any kind of drugs is hot, youâ€™re wrong, you like the effects on the drug in the person, mainly getting skinnier 
Think about all actors that used drugs, letâ€™s take chandler from friends, he used (I hope) to smoke, in the first seasons he wasnâ€™t considered attractive, but then he used more drugs and got really skinny, and people started simping on him

There definitely more drugs effect on your physical form, but if you think this is not youâ€™re case, stop being stupid 

And peeps, do not use drugs

(And by drugs I donâ€™t mean pharmacy drugs, no one thinks someone holding a Claritin or a vic vaporrub is hot, I mean drugs like tabaco, alcohol the ones that are considered morally wrong)
