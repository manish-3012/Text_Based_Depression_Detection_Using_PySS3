Help. My parents are destroying my brain. How do you guys deal with control freak parents? I'm literally under my covers rn with my thick ass laptop trying to not get seen through the window. We moved in last week and my parents fit in a window so that they could see into my room. They turned my table around(Its a large table) so that they could see what I was doing at all times through the window.  My mom checks almost every 10 minutes. Even when i use my phone in the living room, she wants me to turn around so she can see what im doing. Once i dont do what she wants, she starts screaming her head off and my dad comes in to back her. Im getting tired of this shit so bad. Im beginning to question myself. Why me?
