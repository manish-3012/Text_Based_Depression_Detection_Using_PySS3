Im so done with this sh*t Trigger warning:

I dont want this anymore. I take drugs and i feel better, but when the effect wears off, i feel numb again.

I just want to try to kill myself a 2nd time. I shouldn't have survived the first time. Im so fucking dumb. I had a chance to die. Why didnt i fucking use it?

Ive relaped on self harm after my longest clean streak earlier this day. 

I dont want to continue
