My grandpa just died tonight My grandpa died tonight. A couple days ago me and my mom went to visit him and he was super sick. Dry heaving, nausea, dizziness, headaches. We tried getting him to leave his cabin and come stay with us for a while so heâ€™s somewhere near a hospital in case things hit the fan harder. Unfortunately heâ€™s super stubborn and refused to come with us. My mom went back today to check on him and he got way worse so she called an ambulance and his heart stopped while they were transporting him. I never knew him very well, but I know that a lot of people loved him very much despite his many flaws. I just wish I could get to know him better
