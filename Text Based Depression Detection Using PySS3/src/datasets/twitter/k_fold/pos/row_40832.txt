Fucking hell, apologies for the rant incoming I don't know if I need someone to hug me and tell me that everything will be okay, or if I need to be left alone for like a full month or two.





I'm trying my best to stay positive, getting myself out of the house when I can, socializing with family, but I just feel like I'm slipping again. My hallucinations are getting worse, my delusions are coming back, and so is my paranoia. I've pulled a couple muscles now because of my tourettes and my tics have been getting worse. I just feel like I can't mentally do enough to keep myself afloat, like, I'm gonna sink eventually.
