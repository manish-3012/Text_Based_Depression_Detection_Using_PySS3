Please show this message to any or all trans/nonbinary people you know Hey, you! You're incredible. Sure, I may not know you, but I still know that everyone is incredible in their own way, and you're no different.

So what if your gender doesn't align with someone else's opinion? Who are they to enforce what you know about yourself? Regardless of genitals or biological sex, you are happy with the gender you identify with, and you should be proud of that.

You are your own person. Don't let anyone else bring you down. Wear the clothes you want! Date the people you want! Use the pronouns you want!

At the end of the day, regardless of what anyone else says, you are you, and that is incredible. Just because someone else doesn't understand that is no reason to feel bad.

And hey- if you do ever feel sad, depressed, or suicidal, remember that there is at least one person in the world who knows that you are beautiful and amazing. Think about that! I don't even know you. I could be anyone in the world. And yet I still care about you, regardless of how other people see you. If you ever need to talk, feel free to DM me! I'm not a therapist, but I promise I'll listen to you as a friend and support you no matter what.

Feel free to crosspost/repost this to as many subreddits as possible! Everyone should see this.

Edit: To the people in the comments. Of course not all trans people are good people. That doesn't mean you shouldn't support them anyway. Trans and nonbinary people have to go through a lot of hate in their lifetimes, and I'm sure many of them would appreciate being respected. It goes without saying that you shouldn't give this message to someone who doesn't deserve it.
