Friend is cutting herself So my friend has been cutting herself and she's totally open about it with me. I don't know what to do or say because I've never been in this kind of situation before. She's also not the type to respond well to sympathy and care (She hates it when people ask "are you okay" or say "if you ever need anything you can talk to me"). If you have any advice please help me out.
