How did someone disappoint you today? My dad put apricot jam on a red velvet cake with cream cheese icing, covered it with whip cream and then ate it for 5 minutes while I sipped my water and judged him out loud.

I am disappointed in him. His love for tiramisu I can understand, but this? This???

No.
