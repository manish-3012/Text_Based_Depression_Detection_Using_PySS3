No clue on what to do I've had a crush on this girl for 6 whole years, which is a good chunk of my life. I was pretty confident she liked me too until one day she told me how much she liked this other guy. I told her what I felt, already knowing it wasn't mutual, but I felt it was only fair to let her know. Now, I feel so empty, like I'm without a purpose. She occupied my thoughts so much and now that I know this, I don't know what to do with myself.  


TLDR: I completed a 6 year long friendzone.
