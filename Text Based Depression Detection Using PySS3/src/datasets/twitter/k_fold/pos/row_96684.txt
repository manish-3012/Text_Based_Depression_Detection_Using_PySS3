Almost passed out during pe but the lesson was okay I had boxing during pe and as warmup we needed to jump a rope for 10 minutes straight. Eventually my vision got blurry and i has chest pain. I didnt tell anyone but I realized i needed to watch out. 

Also squared up with an annoying kid and i prob hurted him a lot. With me there are like only 4 guys and the rest was girls so for us boys it was more a show off for them to see whos the best
