What should I do about my crush? 
(Both 13 and in highschool in Scotland)
Weâ€™ve been good friends for a while and weâ€™re very close, Iâ€™ve liked her for about 3 months, (since she went out with her bf) they broke up a few days ago and I told her how I feel a while back. 
Sheâ€™s joked about it in front of others, and people ask if we go out etc even her bf thought she liked me lol.
She said things could happen in the future when I said I liked her (when she was with her bf) 
They didnâ€™t have the best relationship.
I like her, like a lot. Ik someone canâ€™t be perfect but to me sheâ€™s perfect including her flaws.
How long should I wait to ask her out. ?
