iâ€™m sorry but if you cheat/are okay with cheating then i donâ€™t want anything to do with you call me dramatic but it just disgusts me honestly, even though i luckily have never been in the situation myself. i hate it when guys do it, i hate homewreckers, or when people know that itâ€™s happening but say nothing. 

i genuinely donâ€™t understand how some people do it and can just live with themselves... like wtf ðŸ˜€
