I am confused So about a month ago, I told my crush how I felt. She said it was sweet and that we should talk at school. But, I had to quarantine for 2 weeks so I told her I wouldn't be back for a while. When I finally got back to school, she didn't say anything. Since then, we have had a few conversations about how our days went. I guess she never rejected me but I dont really know what this means. I want to talk to her more but idk what to say. Plz help
