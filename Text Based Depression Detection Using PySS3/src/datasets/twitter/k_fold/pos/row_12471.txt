Uno reverse on the wannabe bully (wannabe tough guy) (TL;DR in the end) I was telling this to a friend when I decided... frick it, I'm posting it on reddit.

So basically the wannabe tough guy in my class is trying so hard to keep his grip that he thinks he ever had on the class... and has tried multiple times to make me feel inferior (but I ain't taking no bullshit)

First time idek what he was saying but basically trying to call me gay, so my response was "I'm sorry for disappointing you but I prefer women, I didn't know you liked men tho"

And another day I still don't remember what he was saying but he had been quite in the class and suddenly decided to start making fun of me so my natural response was "you finally woke up!" You know bcs he went from hiding in his desk while using his phone to suddenly come up with his crap

The next day his "friend" (which I'm 100% sure he only stays with him so he doesn't get bullied by him) was kinda struggling with basic things in class, and a girl said he forgot to take his meds, I said he accidentally took his grandmother's meds instead of his and the whole class started laughing. He (probably anxious asf) said "are we supposed to laugh now?" And I replied with "we already are laughing" 

Now before you may think that I bully people on a daily basis... I don't... I usually let people be and although I may be loud and laughing all the time with my friends I don't bother others

Funny thing is they're never gonna know this post exists

TL;DR I practically bullied the idiots that wanted to bully me
