Everyone i know is insane So it all started with one of the streamers i watch. The chat is more of a friend group than the average twitch chat, so she(the streamer) was comfortable sharing that she likes pickles and peanut butter together. A few people also tried it and so did i. It was weirdly good, and i hate to admit that. Then tonight things escalated... her sister(idk if theyâ€™re actually related, theyâ€™re role-players) tweeted a vid of trying coke milk. And someone else tried it and said she was insane, so naturally she retaliated by eating vanilla ice cream and ketchup. Like a psycho. FUCKING VANILLA ICE CREAM AND KETCHUP. I hate the internet so god damn much. I dont know if anyone cares but the streamer is Kou Mariya and her sis is Sugar_VT. And theyre insane. And i love and hate it.
