Iâ€™m bi, but I donâ€™t consider myself as part of the lgbtq community. Hereâ€™s why: Iâ€™m bi and Iâ€™ve dated, kissed, and done other things with both guys and girls. After realizing I was bi, obviously I started to look into the lgbt community. However, I find absolutely no comfort there.

It is so incredibly toxic to say the least. People refer to straight people as â€œbreeders,â€ or they ask the question â€œare straights ok,â€ or say that they â€œlooked heteroâ€ which was bad. They will even go as far as to say heterophobia isnâ€™t a thing.

Sure, gay people and people of lgbt have definitely been more oppressed and are more oppressed than straight people. However, that does not in any way give them the right to go ahead and hate on people, for the fact that their straight and confident in their sexuality.

This is why I donâ€™t consider myself a part of the lgbt community. Thank you for coming to my tik tok.
