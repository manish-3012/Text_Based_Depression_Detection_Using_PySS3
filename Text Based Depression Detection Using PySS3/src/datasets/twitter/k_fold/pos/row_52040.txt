Any good advice? Sooo... not long ago I noticed a girl that works out at my schools gym (I love working out btw), and she hit me as taking the gym and her training very serious, which I am very attracted to. I didnâ€™t think much about it at first, but then one day, I get to the gym, and sheâ€™s just blasting this super heavy metal (I also love heavy metal and rock). I think thatâ€™s when I sort of fell for her? I guess? I havenâ€™t had any real feelings for anyone for approximately 6-7 years now. I am 16M and sheâ€™s 17F (Also, what do you think about the stigma there is, when the girl is the older one in the relationship?). I asked some of my friends that go to class with her, about her. Theyâ€™ve told me sheâ€™s ver down to earth and chill. I would like to shoot my shot with her, but how do I start. As of now I havenâ€™t had any conversations with her.
