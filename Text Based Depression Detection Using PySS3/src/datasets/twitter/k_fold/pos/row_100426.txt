So i was playing this big open world game And their was a collectible that you could get once at a certain  times =. In was about to get and a friend called me with urgent and i pick up. He goes ' **Hey  You ever have collectors anxiety in big open world games**' and i missed the collectible and had to do 3 hours of progress again.
