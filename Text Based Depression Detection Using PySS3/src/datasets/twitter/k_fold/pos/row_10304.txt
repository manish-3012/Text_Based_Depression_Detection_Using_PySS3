what are the chances in my life 
my crush I havenâ€™t seen for months ended up in the other part of the hybrid schedule. then on Monday we went back five days I had one class with him. he is all online for soccer and probably will be after soccer. so I ask his friends for his socials and he has none. what the fuck I just wanna see him through a screen or not. last year we flirted back and forth but his mom was the teacher of our free period so i didnâ€™t wanna make a bigger move and embarrass him but he liked me and I liked him. but yeah so I donâ€™t get to see him for a while again. but maybe one of you have advice you could give on my situation?
