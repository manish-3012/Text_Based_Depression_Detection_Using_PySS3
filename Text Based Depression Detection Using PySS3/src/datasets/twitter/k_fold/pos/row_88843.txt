Need some help. Hello all, I have a question. 

So basically, I woke up, I believe Tuesday morning with some pain in my right testicle. I just assumed I slept on it weirdly somehow. However, since that day, iâ€™ve had very mild pain in both balls, more so the right one. Iâ€™m concerned, iâ€™ve told my parents, but I just want to know is this normal at all or whatever. Iâ€™m not sexually active either ðŸ˜Ž

Cheers
