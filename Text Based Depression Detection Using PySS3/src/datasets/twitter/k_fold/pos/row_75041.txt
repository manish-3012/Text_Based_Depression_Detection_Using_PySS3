I need to vent for a minute so please try not to laugh at me. 1. everyone thinks it's weird that I like anime(not a weeb tho) and metal. It's mostly power metal.
2. I have a serious addiction to porn, it f\*\*king sux and I have no outlet to help stop it.
3. sometimes I'm alone and realize I'm feminine as hell(sometimes, not always), I also have plans to switch my gender in the future. (Might have accidentally told the wrong person that and now I can't show my face in public ever again) People just can't accept the simplest s\*\*t!
4. highschool, when I go in the building I always feel anxious and annoyed. leaving I felt sad and angry.  also adding in my guitar practice didn't help, they always get tangled up together and I'm always forgetting something.
5. I really want to talk to someone a lot like me sometimes.
6. I am fairly good at making people feel happy, welcome, or if I tried hard enough, I could possibly stop someone from doing something drastic that could get themselves or others hurt.
