Need help for a Houseparty Hey guys, so Iâ€™ve been thinking about hosting a Houseparty with about 20-30 people, volume and police (usually a huge problem in Spain) wonâ€™t be a problem as my closest neighbour is quite far but I do have a big problem.

And thatâ€™s a huge new tv in my living room that is hanging from the wall and will be just waiting for a drunkard to smash it to pieces by falling over on it or doing general drunk things

So, does anyone here have a creative way to protect it so I donâ€™t blow my life saving replacing it?

Thank you very much
