She said we kould talk later When I texted her earlier, she was at work, so I asked if we kould talk later, and she said yes. 

2 hours ago (later) I texted her, and I've been left on delivered. Shes been on several times sinse. 

I'm not worried, she might not have seen my message she isnt like that with me (at least not up to this point), but it's kinda annoying bekause now I'm heading to sleep and wont get to talk to her until tomorrow (maybe).
