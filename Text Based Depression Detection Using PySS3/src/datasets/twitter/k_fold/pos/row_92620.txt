A guy asked me to be his valentine and I completely missed it. he sent me this message, it was like lyrics to a song, and it was so obvious (is what my friend said) and I didn't realize this and typed in 'nice' 

Two hours later, he responds to one of my tweets and says "I asked you." and I lose my shit. My friend was next to me the entire time, where I was just apologizing and texting him. Then he said it was all right and said 'What if I was secretly in love with you. What then? You just hurt my feelings." 

So, I thought it was a JOKE. And typed in "I'd love to be your valentine, love you." and he kept asking if I was serious. And I said yes (still thinking it was a joke" eventually I asked. "Wait are you serious?"

Then he just sighs and goes "Ask your friend." and I show the texts to my friend and she just goes "You fucking idiot!"

Turns out he was asking me out. In conclusion: I'm a fucking idiot, and guys are also confusing. 

One of my friends said "You're the reason guys have anxiety."  IM SO SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
