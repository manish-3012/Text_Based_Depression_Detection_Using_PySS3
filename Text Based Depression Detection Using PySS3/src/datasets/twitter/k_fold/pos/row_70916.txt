My â€œbest friendâ€ is sleeping with an 18 year old Sheâ€™s desperate for love so i get why she would want to â€œengageâ€ with him but i just really think sheâ€™s going about it with the wrong person. Weâ€™re both 15. I just donâ€™t know what to say to her that could possibly make her understand how i feel. I donâ€™t think i could say anything to get her to stop seeing him. Has anyone experienced this or would know what to say?
