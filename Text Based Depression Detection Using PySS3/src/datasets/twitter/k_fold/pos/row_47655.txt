My friend found my choker... We were sitting in my room playing CoD Ghosts and he notices a dollar I left on the floor, and then asked what was lying next to it. When I realized what it was I was embarrassed and he didn't know what it was so I tried to just put it back in my drawer but he insisted on learning what it was so I showed him and his reaction was "I will punch you in the nuts". I'm a six-foot tall dude and this was a pink and sky blue choker with a heart-piece. Note to self: Be more careful with what you leave lying around the room.
