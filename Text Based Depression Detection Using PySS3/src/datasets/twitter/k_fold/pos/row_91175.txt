this happens everytime im like the only one in our non musical school who still knows how to do music from middle school (cello)

and like my father is also a music major

so, my English teacher who needs to write our Alma Mater for our school wants me to do it

I'm not like mad about it or anything but I'm just really excited to actually do it
