So...I just learned something interesting Apparently there was this Star Wars kid who played Anakin Skywalker in some kind of prequel wich I heard is pretty hated, and he got bullied both online and at his school because of that 1 Role in that 1 movie. Why the hell do people send death threats to a fucking 10 year old because they didnâ€™t like a movie??!?!?!?!?
