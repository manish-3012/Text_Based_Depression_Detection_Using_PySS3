Now I'm kinda glad Some time ago they told us that we'll have online lessons for 2 next weeks. I wasn't very happy about it. 

Now tho, it's kinda nice, tho I got sick (I feel like absolute shit, hate this) so I won't miss school anyway. 


Also if someone would like to know, I don't have covid and it's probably just a flu (still, it's horrible)
