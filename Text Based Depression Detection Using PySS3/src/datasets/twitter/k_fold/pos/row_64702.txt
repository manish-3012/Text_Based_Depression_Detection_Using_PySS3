2 hours into my birthday and I feel unsafe right now So, I feel a little paranoid writing this but maybe I'll be gone. 

I walked down to the second floor and it was dark, I was waiting for the day t start when at this ungodly hour on the steps, I hear rummaging in the kitchen and everyone is not awake. The house was dark and so was the kitchen but this sound of movement gave me the chills and has be come back upstairs 

I texted my sister right now, and she responded and after a convo, I texted her back, and she's not responding... 

I think I'm being robbed. 

Bye for now.
