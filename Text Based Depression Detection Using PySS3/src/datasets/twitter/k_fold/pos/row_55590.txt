Do you use Quizlet? Do your friends? You need Quizlet Coalition! I am working on an app called [quizletcoalition.cc](https://quizletcoalition.cc):

Quizlet Coalition is a web app designed to help find and share Quizlets from and with your classmates or previous students.

If you have a Quizlet to share, simply go to [quizletcoalition.cc](https://quizletcoalition.cc) and follow the prompts to add your Quizlet to our index. It will be made available to your classmates, sorted by the Quizlet's name, link, class name, and teacher name.

As an incentive to help build our indexes, when you add your Quizlet, there is a chance you will be given an Amazon gift card code! That means the more Quizlets you upload, the higher chance you have of winning a card! 

If you need a Quizlet, all you have to do is go to [quizletcoalition.cc/browse.php](https://quizletcoalition.cc/browse.php) and search by the title of the Quizlet, by your teacher, or school!

Please let me know what you think!
