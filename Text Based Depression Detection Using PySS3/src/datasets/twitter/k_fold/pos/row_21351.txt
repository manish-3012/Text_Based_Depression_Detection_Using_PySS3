Which incident truly made you feel like people around you just don't give a fuck about you at all? I'll start


When I was 13, I was probably the most hated and weirdest guy in the class. I used to do weird things, used to suck balls at every subject and was awful at sports, was very bad at socialising and was bullied.


Yet I still had a few people from my class following me on instagram.


Back then everyone used to post questions on their stories and I thought it was cool, so I followed suit. 


I did the same thing as them, put on a "ask me anything" sticker on my story and: &gt;!no response from anyone!&lt; 


I swear I was so tensed when I saw that. People had seen my story and there were no responses, and if I didn't post any questions I'd get more embarassed further. 


Thankfully I had an alt account, so I just sent some generic questions as responses and stretched it up to a reasonable amount of slides.


But that made me realise what my worth was to them :(
