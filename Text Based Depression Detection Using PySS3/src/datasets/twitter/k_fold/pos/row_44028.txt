About to watch interstellar for the 8th time I love this movie so much it intrigues me so much 
I also love space so much and Im fascinated by every thing to do with it, I really want to become an astronaut when Iâ€™m older or experience the universe and get out of this stupid world and experience something bigger
Iâ€™m a 14yo in Australia and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna achieve my dream
I know I will no matter what tho
