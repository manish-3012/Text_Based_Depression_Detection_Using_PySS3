Man, when I see girls who act like bitches I really want to say something about their appearance. For example, if I see a girl with a small butt I will tell her that mine is better, if she has big boobs I just tell her that the only good thing about her is her personality. Is it bad? I mean, when people insult me I don't think I should just take it.
