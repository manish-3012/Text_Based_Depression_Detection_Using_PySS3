When a girl kicks a guy in the balls so hard one or both burst and have to be removed, isn't that similarly violating, horrible and wrong as rape?  

Unless it's necessary in genuine self defense, or she does it as revenge for rape or something.

But other than that?

If you don't view it as similarly horrible - why not?

Why do some series/movies make light of that, or portray it as funny, no big deal or deserved when girls kick guys there for all kinds of bullshit?

(Also, I know it's not THE SAME THING. Obviously not. I'm just saying it's equally violating and horrible.)
