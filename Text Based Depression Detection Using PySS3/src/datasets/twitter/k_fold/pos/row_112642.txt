Have you checked up on yourself? Hi! How are you? No, really. How are *you*? I don't want that same old answer- "I'm fine" unless you really mean it. Have you checked up on yourself? Have you taken care of yourself? Have you given yourself the love you deserve? You're precious. Don't ever, EVER forget thatâœ¨
