Just a rant because this guy assumes everything. So I was just looking through peopleâ€™s snapchat stories and noticed someone posted something with a bunch of popular girls from school with their @s. I went to add them because Iâ€™ve talked to them a few times but donâ€™t have their snap. Either way one of the girls snaps me and turns out itâ€™s her boyfriend saying â€œsorry bud sheâ€™s got a mans.â€ Iâ€™m like what? Just because a guy adds a girl doesnâ€™t mean they wants to talk to them or even likes them. I did like this girl in freshman year but that was 2 years ago. Iâ€™ve moved on and havenâ€™t talked to her in atleast a year. This guy goes and digs up dms from years ago. Either way I donâ€™t think they will be together very long, she will find out the type of person he is soon enough.
