Is it weird if I peel a banana from the tip? I've always questioned the normality of how I eat it ever since my friend did it the opposite way. I've pretty much been doing it this way forever ( I always remove the brown tip when it's peeled) and this has been on my mind recently. If it's normal then is there universally any right way to peel a banana?
