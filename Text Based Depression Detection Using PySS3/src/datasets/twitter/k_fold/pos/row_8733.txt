To both the younger and older users of this subreddit- some of us grew up with a family CD player and a Nintendo DS while others had the older iPods and iPhones growing up. Do you like how you grew up or do you wish you had the other generation of devices? Why? I personally wouldnâ€™t have had it any other way. I grew up upgrading my game boy to a DS to a 3DS (mostly because we didnâ€™t have the money to buy phones for every kid) and the old white Xbox 360. So not the oldest generation of things, but much older than today. I liked how I grew up because the devices didnâ€™t hook me like my phone does today, so Iâ€™d always have a reason to go outside and play with my siblings. 

Note- I do know that the age gap between the 13 year olds and 19+ year olds isnâ€™t a huge difference but many things happen in a year. I know itâ€™s not like comparing a typewriter to a MacBook, but Iâ€™m still curious due to there being a definite difference. Just not a huge one :))
