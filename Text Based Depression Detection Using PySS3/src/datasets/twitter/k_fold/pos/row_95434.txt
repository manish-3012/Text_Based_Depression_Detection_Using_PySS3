My nephew is in boarding school, can you help suggest ideas for things he could use as gifts? My nephew is 15, and in boarding school for the first time. I want to send him things that will help him to enjoy his time, and potentially draw others together to help him build friendships.

The ideas I have so far are a bluetooth music player, a glow-in-the-dark frisbee, food, and posters for his room. I don't have a huge budget, but I would like to get him some meaningful gifts. Your helpful suggestions are much appreciated!
