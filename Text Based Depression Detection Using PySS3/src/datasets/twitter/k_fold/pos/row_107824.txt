To those of you in this sub who are in the US military, preferably airborne, I have some questions. First of all, thank you for your service.

1.Can you enlist to go do airborne cadet training, or do you already have to be in the army.

2.Is there a better chance of getting in if you have completed JROTC/ROTC?

These are my questions.
