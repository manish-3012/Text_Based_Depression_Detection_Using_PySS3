My complicated relationship So to start off everything, I have or had an online relationship with an amazing girl, well, bc of her very strict parents we could barely talk and they had no idea about us either. Well allitle bit ago she told me that her mom found and read her journal which talked about me and she flipped out, I hadn't heard from her in awhile and one night her mother contacted me telling me to leave her daughter alone, she later then in the conversation tried to convince me that it was her daughter and typed that she had to move on, I told her I knew it wasnt my gf and she tried it again, or at least I think she did idk for sure, but it's coming up to our what would of been or might still be our 2 month, I wish I could get in contact and be able to find out what we are, I miss her so much. She'll be 18 soon so hopefully that will make it easier to reach out. Her plan was to move away from her crazy parents and move to my state and I wonder if she will still do that.
