I might have saved a life today My friend(F) has a crippling depression (really bad)
We both live in Portugal so the restrictions due to covid are really harsh.
She called me today at midnight because she had a panic attack so I rode my bike there and she had terrible automutilation wounds so I did some first aid I was super calm and even made her laugh while I was cleaning the blood we watched Family guy and I put her to sleep warned her mother to get more first aid materials and with that horrible event I think I know what I wana be when I grow up I wana be those nurses who help people struggling with mental health.

For anyone reading this please learn some basics about first aid I hope you never have to use that knowledge but u never know
And yes I broke a lot of laws going there but I prefer to die of Covid than having my bestfriend dying of depression
