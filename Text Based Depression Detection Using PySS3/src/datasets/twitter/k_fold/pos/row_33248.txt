Back to school tomorrow and Iâ€™m dreading it. My school is switching from virtual to in-person school tomorrow and Iâ€™m stressed beyond my mind. Havenâ€™t coped well with virtual, been more depressed, and have a lot of missing assignments. 

How has it been for you guys this school year and what experiences have you had?
