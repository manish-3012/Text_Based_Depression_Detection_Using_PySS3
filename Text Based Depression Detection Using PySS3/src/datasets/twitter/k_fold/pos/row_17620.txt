I have a question So there is a guy I don't talk to that much, but we do text when we have the same class together. He seems cool and I kinda want to talk to him more. I just built a snowman, and was thinking I could send him a photo of it as a conversation starter and make a joke about it ? Or is that weird? He seems like a sweet guy so I think he'd like it but idk
