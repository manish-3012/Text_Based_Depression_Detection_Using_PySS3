My depression decided I should upgrade my PC that is only a month old lmao I got a RTX 3080 which was expensive asf

And then I got a new 850 W power supply for that

And I got a new CPU cooler cause I want the one with the LCD screen on it

And also new case fans because the ones I got are ugly, I only got them cause they matched the fans with the AIO cooler but I didn't realize I could just use different fans on it. 

Now I can build like half of a PC with the parts I have lmao
