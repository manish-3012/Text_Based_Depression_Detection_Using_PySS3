Should I give up? Iâ€™m an 18 year old male and life is hard for me right now. A few weeks ago a girl said she liked me then within a few days said she wanted to take things slower, then yesterday she said she asked someone out for Valentineâ€™s Day which shows that not only was she done with me but that in just a few weeks she had completely gotten over anything we had and moved on. She also told me that Iâ€™m depressing to be around which hurts since I try my hardest to make everyone happy. This isnâ€™t the first time something like this has happened either. Pretty much the exact same thing happened a few months back. Iâ€™m sick of being everyoneâ€™s second choice. Even being the last choice would be better because at least then i'd know to give up hope instead of getting my hopes crushed. On top of that my car suffered some damage the other day and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll be able to reregister it. I accidentally ran over a cat the other night. All my friendships are crumbling down and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll be able to afford to live for the next few months because of how expensive it is in my area. Iâ€™m genuinely feeling worthless right now and not sure if I should just give up or not. It doesnâ€™t seem like thereâ€™s much else I can do.
