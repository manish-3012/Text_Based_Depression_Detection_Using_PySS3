Enough Is Enough. I'm sick and tired of this. Everyday science strives to be better and better. But they're has to be a stopping point. There has already been so many disasters as result from science, and this is no exception. Science has been so focused on whether they could have done something, that they never stopped to ask whether or not they should. -*Man's response on digiorno's croissant crust.*
