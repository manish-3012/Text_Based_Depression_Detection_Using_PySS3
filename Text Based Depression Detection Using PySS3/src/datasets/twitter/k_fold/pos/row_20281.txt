Happy Friday the 13th Not many people notice,  it many people care. The day itself occurs once or twice a year, so maybe that's what makes it special? Or maybe it's the superstition surrounding the day involving bad omens. Actually it's probably the cult slasher horror film series that gives this meaning. Either way, happy Friday the 13th to anyone who cares.
