So basically itâ€™s my birthday but my self bought makes me hate this day because I believe that I donâ€™t deserve to be special Like I understand Iâ€™m supposed to be happy now that Iâ€™m 18 (time to change my flair) and I get a lot more freedom. My GF sent me a text and it said I was the the best boyfriend she could ask for so that made me happy but at the end of school this one jerk just said that I should just stop talking when I was talking to someone in class.  He has said this many times before and it has always hurt me but recently my self bought makes everything a lot worse. Like I donâ€™t even know why this guy hates me so much. Yes we are both interested in the same areas of things but on completely different sides of it which is always a problem but there is no reason for him to be such a jerk. Anyways rant over.
