Today just did a 180 I came home from school with my sister, and found out my mom tested positive for covid. Iâ€™m only doing this because Iâ€™m still trying to process how quickly Iâ€™m gonna have to change my lifestyle for the next 10-14 days. I havenâ€™t gotten tested yet, Iâ€™ll be doing that tomorrow morning because the one testing place in my town closes in 10 minutes from when Iâ€™m typing this.

Iâ€™m just thinking about how many children my mom has accidentally exposed (she works in an elementary school as a special ed teacher), and how many people my sister and I have exposed because we went to school today, and I worked the past two days. Part of me is hoping itâ€™s a false positive, because you gotta have some hope.

Iâ€™m not doing this for karma or awards, I literally just wanted somewhere to talk about this. If anything, words of encouragement would be preferred if you still want to show a form of understanding. 

Thanks for reading if you did
