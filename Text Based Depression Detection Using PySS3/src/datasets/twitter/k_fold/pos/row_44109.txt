School is awful and everyone deserves to know I do 10-14 hours of work everyday. I understand everything but there's just so much work. I'm failing every class. I try so hard only to be told that I'm not good enough. I'm told I have to try harder, but how much harder can I try? 3 days ago I snapped, and I spent 2 hours just rocking back and forward. Why is it so difficult to get everything done, is it even worth it? Every once in a rare while I'll have a nice chat with my dad, or play a game with my sister. But it only makes me happy for a little bit. I do so much work every day, I put what's left of my heart and frail soul into my work, only to be told it's bad. Apparently next year is going to be twice as hard. I cant do this anymore, I just want to end it, but i know i cant because my parents care about me and that's the only thing keeping me going. I dont know how much longer I can sit in this chair, and stare at that bland screen. I'm going insane. I dont feel happy playing my favorite games anymore. I don't do anything. Whenever I just put my work down and leave to go do something, anything, I just stand there idly, blankly. I dont know what I even do anymore. I've lost all will to do anything. The education system is completely fucked. Everything about it is messed up. 

I didn't think hell was real. 

I was wrong.
