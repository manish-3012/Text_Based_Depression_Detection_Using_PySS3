I just found out the worst news of my life Iâ€™ll start off by saying Iâ€™m a 13 year old female.

So I had this friend for years, almost going on 4 years. Theyâ€™ve been one of my bestest friends ever. They were so kind, caring, they really were great. Today I got a text earlier from them saying that they are gonna kill themselves, Iâ€™ve always been the one to help them, they made me want to become a psychologist so I tried my usual, then I tried even harder, and harder, by then Iâ€™ve tried everything to convince them that there is a way out, but they didnâ€™t listen. Now they blocked me, and Iâ€™m assuming they died by now of overdose. Just saying that doesnâ€™t feel real, none of this feels real, I feel like Iâ€™m in a horrible dream but no matter what I canâ€™t wake up, I just canâ€™t!! 

They inspired me to do so much, they meant so much to me, truly they did.
But now theyâ€™re dead, they died hating my guts, they died thinking there wasnâ€™t a way out, they died thinking no one would care, but I care and I care so much Iâ€™ve just decided to quit doing the things they inspired me to do.
Iâ€™m just gonna quit art for god knows how long, Iâ€™m never gonna become a psychologist (Iâ€™ve helped so many people and this was the first person who just ended it, ended it all) 

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m gonna do with my life, I thought last weekend life was gonna go uphill from here, but it just plummeted. 

I just want to die honestly, I canâ€™t stand death and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m gonna do from here. I wonâ€™t kill myself because I donâ€™t want to put my girlfriend through the things my friend has put me through, honestly sheâ€™s probably worried sick because I havenâ€™t messaged her since before I just balled my eyes out, I cried, and cried, and Iâ€™m crying while writing this. 

If youâ€™re wondering, I canâ€™t do anything to help, we were only online friends so I never found out their address, I tried to search for their school but no luck. I just hope they are okay and not dead but they probably are dead.

I just needed a place to type my feelings out in.

This is also a wake up call to anyone, please donâ€™t kill yourselves, people will care and it will damage their lives for ever. You mean a lot to someone, please donâ€™t forget that
