I kinda feel like i wasted my teenage years so far I mean theres still like one and a half years to do stuff but ive never been to any parties, never had any gfs, never done any drugs, drank alcohol only like once. Idk, i dont have any interesting stories to tell because i havent done anything really. I wanna atleast go party this year or something which was something i couldnt do this year. Agh idk maybe some of you feel the same.
