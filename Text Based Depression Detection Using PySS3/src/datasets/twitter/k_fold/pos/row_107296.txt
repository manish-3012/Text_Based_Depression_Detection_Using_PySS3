Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve had one girl in my life that was a real friend I donâ€™t wanna come off as incely or something because I donâ€™t hate women or anything, itâ€™s just that everyone of them that I have had some sort of relationship with (platonic) tends to fuck me over sooner or later. I was friends with this one girl since freshman year and weâ€™d hang out all the time I even got back into skating so I could teach her how to skate, we even had prom plans but those got fucked by Covid. All in all a good time. Fast-forward to now shes in college and she canâ€™t even take a few seconds out of the day to text me back. Like I understand people drift apart over time and all but I just donâ€™t understand we hung out all summer and literally the first week of college you canâ€™t even talk to me anymore? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m asking for much just a â€œhey howâ€™re doingâ€ would have been fine. Even now the whole thing that prompted me to write this shit a girl that literally lives up the street whoâ€™s my supposed â€œbest friendâ€ wouldnâ€™t let me stay the night at her house, even though my power was knocked out by the storm and Iâ€™m in my house freezing my fucking ass off. She just says â€œuhhh noâ€ like what kind of fucking best friend are you even supposed to be? You canâ€™t even give me a bit of help? You literally bring random dudes over all the time, and Iâ€™m not trying to judge her or anything thats her business but cmon give me a fucking bone here. So I tell her to go fuck herself and sheâ€™s got the nerve to be upset with me. In hindsight I donâ€™t even know why me and her are friends we donâ€™t do anything friendly and no conversation we have ever has a bit of substance, I donâ€™t even think she genuinely gives a fuck how Iâ€™m doing I donâ€™t even know if sheâ€™s ever even asked. The storyâ€™s donâ€™t end there Iâ€™ve got plenty of others of being left out to dry. I know this probably seems weird Iâ€™m damn near 20 talking about how shit my female friendships are Itâ€™s just that itâ€™s the only thing on my mind since I just woke up and saw her texts. had to get this out somehow. Guess Iâ€™ll end this by saying Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s plenty of girls out there that are good people or whatever they are just fucking impossibly hard to find, or maybe I just have horrible luck, maybe its my fault, I might just deserve the shit I donâ€™t fucking know man.
