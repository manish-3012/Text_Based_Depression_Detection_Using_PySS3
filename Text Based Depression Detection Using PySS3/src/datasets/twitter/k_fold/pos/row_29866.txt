Am i doing this workout thing right? Apparently girls love abs. So when i asked my gf about it well i just mentioned it, she was like woowwwwwww you're gonna get absss wowwwwwww. Me : *awkward smile*

And now I'm trying to get abs. Day before yesterday i downloaded a yt video saying abs workout for beginners. It had couple million views so i thought that'll be good. So today's my third day and my stomach hurts like hell ðŸ˜© i can't sneeze i can't get up from bed at once it's annoying. I thought maybe I'm getting abs. When i started working out today i found out that I can't do some moves(or whatever they are called) it's physically impossible. There's this thing where you sit and lift your straightened legs. When i try that my stomach hurts so bad i can't continue.

My question is, is this okay? Is that how it normally works? Or am i doing something wrong and hurting myself?

Stuff about me: I'm 18, 5'10" and skinny
