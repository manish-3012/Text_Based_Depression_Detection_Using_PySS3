LGBT+ People should not call themselves oppressed. First: I know that the title can be read as homophobic, but please hear me out. Don't downvote without explaining why I'm wrong. Also, what I'm saying mainly applies to the USA and other western countries, not a country like Saudi Arabia.

I've heard people who identify as LGBT+ call themselves oppressed, and it really bothers me. It's not like they're being carted off to labor camps, prisons, or executions for something they had no idea about and could not control. They're not being killed in the streets for something they can never hope to change. When they go to a grocery store, the shelves are full and they are able to purchase what they need.

Compare this to an actual oppressed people, for example, the USSR. People starved, were carted off to prisons or labor camps for being suspected of being against the state, there was almost no way to leave, and freedom of speech didn't exist. By calling themselves "oppressed", LGBT people equate their suffering to those who lived in the USSR, and by doing so, invalidate their experience. It's dismissive and hurtful to the people who suffered or are currently suffering under oppressive regimes.

You are free to complain about intolerance. But do not use the word "oppressed", it's insensitive.
