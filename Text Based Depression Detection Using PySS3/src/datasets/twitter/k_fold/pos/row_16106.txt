Parents always yell at eachother I'm not "traumatized" or anything because of my parents, in fact I don't have anything to do with them at all, but it's getting pretty fucking annoying to hear them yell insults at each other like toddlers. All my 14 years on this planet, I don't think I actually heard them being genuinely nice towards each other. 

Like, I seriously don't get it. Why the fuck did they bother with marriage? How can two people so different in character and personality get married? Are people this fucking stupid? Sorry about this just wanna rant. I'm just sick of being around two people who absolutely hate one another's guts in the same household. If I could move out I'd do it in an instant
