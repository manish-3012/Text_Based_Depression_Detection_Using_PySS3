I need help with a girl (The usual.) So there's this girl that I go to school with and we had a really strong relationship before school went online. We don't really talk that much anymore but we catch up with eachother every once in a while. Well anyway to get to the point, I had a dream about her a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about her. I want to talk to her and be upfront about it, but its not fair to put that on her all at once. I can't really build up the courage to say something, any advice?
