100 or 0 tests; are they normal? Title says it all. My science teacher recently gave a major test on polytonic ions and there were 10 questions. You could get all of them correct (100), or get a 0. I got 9/10 questions correct. my previous test grades were 93, 97, 94 and 89 (average of about 93). Now it's an average of 75. I was trying to apply to my school's science tutoring program for the elementary school attached to the high school, as anyone with a grade of A or higher can apply. So now thats out of the window.

My actual question: are these normal? are 100/0 tests making up a huge part of one's grade a big part of middle or high school? Thanks!
