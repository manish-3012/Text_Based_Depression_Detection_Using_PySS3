Iâ€™m most likely going to end myself on the Monday after the next one Well, honestly Iâ€™m giving up. Thereâ€™s nothing left. My boyfriend is most likely gone, my only emotional support. My other friend is gone, which was my other emotional support. Iâ€™m so stressed and unhappy in life, i was already suicidal but this just pushes me far past the returning point. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m a attention whore for posting this here, i just came here to vent, i donâ€™t care about stupid orange stuff
