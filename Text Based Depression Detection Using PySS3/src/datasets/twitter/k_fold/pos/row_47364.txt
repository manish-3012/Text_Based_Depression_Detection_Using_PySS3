Scholarship help I'm applying to a Create A Greeting Card scholarship and need ideas tbh. I was thinking of doing a Christmas themed card


Problem is, I don't really draw things outside of anime, and was thinking of a dragon ball z styled card. Idk how the judging will be but i do know that it'll be made into a real card if it wins. 


With that in mind, should i go ahead and do a dbz styled card or try to do something more normal like a santa or something????
