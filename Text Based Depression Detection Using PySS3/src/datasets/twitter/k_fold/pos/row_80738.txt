I have some serious learnings disabilities which people mistake for poor character or ability I spend an enormous amount of effort proving to people that Iâ€™m not dumb. 

Working at McDonaldâ€™s, my trainer told the floor manager that I was a dumbass after i loosened my grip in the wrong hand and dropped the grill scrubber into a mop bucket. I felt horrible, and thatâ€™s what it feels like in my classes. my motor skills are so poor that my homework looks like Egyptian hieroglyphics. 


I get emails from my professors telling me that work is not gradable. I think my professors believe that Iâ€™m lazy, when very often the work I submitted was a 2nd or 3rd draft. I donâ€™t know how I will survive grad school next year if I canâ€™t produce legible work.
