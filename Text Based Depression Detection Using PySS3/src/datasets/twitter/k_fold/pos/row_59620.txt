I need some help with working out Hi I am a 15 (m). So basically I used to play sports for teams (football and soccer) and do martial arts. I have a YouTube channel that I never really focused on. I  moved ( one week before quarantine) and I had to stop playing sports and doing martial arts bc COVID. I focused on my channel and now that channel grow a little but and I made a second one. I upload twice a day and combining that with school I am very busy. During quarantine I loss 4 lbs but my mom wants me to be more active again. She wants me to workout. I told her I am very busy but she wonâ€™t talk no for an answer. Now I am very physically underwhelming I am 5â€™2â€ and weight 116. I am very athletic tho. I am asking if anyone has any good workouts that can help me grow and lose weight?
