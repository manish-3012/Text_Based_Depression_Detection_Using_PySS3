all i really want right now is a true friend i got literally nobody lmfao. nobody to trust, nobody thatll always have my back 24/7, nobody that wont switch up on me for no fucking reason whatsoever, nobody who even likes me for who i am. i just wish there was someone other than my family who cares and would actually stick with me throughout a lot of my life.
