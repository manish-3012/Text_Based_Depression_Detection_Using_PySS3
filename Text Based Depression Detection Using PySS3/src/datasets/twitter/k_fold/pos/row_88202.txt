Iâ€™m very sad. Iâ€™m very sad.

I live in Argentina, where weâ€™ve been on government mandated quarantine for over 210 days (since March). I have been taking virtual classes for over 210 days. I havenâ€™t seen a single friend for over 210 days. I set myself a goal of having a girlfriend before turning 19, and Iâ€™m turning 19 in 4 days without achieving the goal. I miss seeing other people. 

Iâ€™m not bored at home. I have two dogs and a big house. Iâ€™m just sad. Itâ€™s like I was in a Sims game and my social meter was empty.
