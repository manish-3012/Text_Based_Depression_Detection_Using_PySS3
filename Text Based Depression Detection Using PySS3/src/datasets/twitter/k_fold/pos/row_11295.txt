I got calls hot today So I donâ€™t really have anyone to tell this to, but Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for hours and it just makes me happy. Iâ€™m sorry in advance if it seems like bragging. 

I (16M) adopted a bunch of goth freshmen at my school. And somehow theyâ€™ve all adopted me without me noticing. I have the main group I sit with and hang around with at lunch and I have a bunch of others that come to my table just to get a hug. Truth be told I didnâ€™t think they even knew my name. I just thought they were all touch starved and I was someone to ease that. 
Well apparently they all think Iâ€™m hot. Someone who I didnâ€™t recognize told her friend that â€œIâ€™m really hot and I could hit her with a truck and she would thank meâ€ and her friend came and told me. A lot of them then enthusiastically agreed. The original girl and her friend then followed me to class really happily. 

Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues with self esteem and bullying in the past, so to have people adore me so much and view me so highly itâ€™s a little overwhelming. But it makes me really happy.
Thanks for listening to my little ramble ðŸ’œ
