Do relations change after confessing to crush? Hi and thanks for reading this. I'm a heterosexual guy.

'Confess to your crush. Worst case scenario, she kindly rejects you.' That's what, I guess, we have all heard and it's fairly agreed upon... right? But what if, after learning the truth, she begins feeling akward around me? I'm okay with being 'just friends', but what if she feels too awkward to even talk to me anymore? That's what has always kept me from just asking a girl out.

Please, tell me from experience, yours or someone else's who you know: did this happen after rejection?
