What is this show called? There was a mafia TV show on Netflix, and it was about organised crime in the 1920s, America. It was set in a specific city but idk where. Also it was about how the Italians and the blacks were fighting each other. Idk if anyone knows what Iâ€™m talking about, but I hope so, and if you do then please lmk what itâ€™s called.
