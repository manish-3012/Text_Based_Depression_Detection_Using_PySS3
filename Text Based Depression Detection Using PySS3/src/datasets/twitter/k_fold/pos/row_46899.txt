Update on pride flag Probably nobody knows what Iâ€™m talking about but like 3 people wanted an update on me having a pride flag on my wall behind me during online class. Sadly we had most of our large zoom calls Wednesday when I was at my momâ€™s place, without the pride flag behind me, but I did have 4 zoom calls Thursday and Friday. Nobody said anything but the throughly christian, probably homophobic athlete in my grade was one of the first people to see it behind me. But to be fair, I canâ€™t know if rumors are spreading or not.
