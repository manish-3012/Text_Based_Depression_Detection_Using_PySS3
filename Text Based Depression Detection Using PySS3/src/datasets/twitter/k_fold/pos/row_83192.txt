Dumb dummy dilemma So like I'm 13 ina house with 8 people and a lit of the time money is tight. So sometimes my personal luxuries arent quite o  the same level as other peoples. Actually I cba to on a tangent. I have a wii u in my room and it's one of my favourite things but the charger for the gamepad is fucked. I have to loop the cable round like twice to get it to charge. And I dont know if it's a problem with the charger or the port in the gamepad. I've looked at both and I dont know what he original are like.

Tl:Dr. Where can I acquire information about old disliked. Forgotten things. Specifically how to fix my wii u
