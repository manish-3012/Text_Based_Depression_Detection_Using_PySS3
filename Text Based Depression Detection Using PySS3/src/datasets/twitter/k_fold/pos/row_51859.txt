Need to confess Well I've had a crush on this girl for like two years now  (she's my first and only crush till date lmao), and we were good friends. But for the most part I stopped talking to her out of self respect and suppressed my feelings as she would only contact me when she needed something and it didn't bother me that much, because I was determined. Now that school is back running and I see her everyday I've been bothered for a few days. I guess I need to confess, maybe that'll take the burden off my shoulders. I was thinking of calling her up, and maybe meeting her in person. I don't know how that would affect her, for the most part I don't care about being friends or not but her mental health is very fragile afaik. Her home life is shit and she used to self harm so what's a way in which it turns out good for everyone involved?
