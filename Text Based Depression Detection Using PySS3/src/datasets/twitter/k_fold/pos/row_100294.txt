I had my first ever operation yesterday It was for testicular fucking torsion, and holy shit it was the worst pain I have ever felt. Guys, if one or both of your testicles has pain, tell somebody or go to the doctors/hospital as soon as you can (you might lose your testicle otherwise). Anyway, if you have any questions about my experience or torsion, you are welcome to ask.
