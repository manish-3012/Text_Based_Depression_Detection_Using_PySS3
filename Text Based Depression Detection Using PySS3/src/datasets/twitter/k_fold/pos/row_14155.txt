I need help I need help. Serious help and advice.


So recently I started a new school and there's this girl she's really cute and she likes some stuff I also like, but there's 1 problem. I think there's a competition.... I think there's one dude that probably also likes her. I really need serious advice because I've been lonely and depressed for most of my life and seeing a glimmer of hope made me excited that I won't be a lonely virgin most of my life and I don't want that light of hope to dissapear. 

Please.. I need help. At this point.. I'll do anything most likely..

(2 of my classmates follow me on this account holy shit I hope they don't see this. I tried using an alt but I don't have karma on there.)
