Is it weird that I really like how my hands look? So I (16f) play a lot of games on my phone and I was looking at my hands and then I realized I really like the way they look and Iâ€™ve been putting a lot of care into making my hands look nice (because I record myself playing the games on my phone sometimes). 

My hands probably wouldnâ€™t be super pretty to other people but I really like the way they look. Is that like super weird lol?
