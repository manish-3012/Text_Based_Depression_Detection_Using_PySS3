Day 12 of eating and excersizing properly so I can stop being a fat fuck etc Today went about as well as it could, apart from the cake I ate for breakfast. It's a mother's Day tradition in my house, me and my brother make our mother a cake and she pretends to not know what we're doing.  I completed everything as per usual.  

My brother also made us go into town today so he could buy chocolate milk. I was just there for the ride. 

I feel a bit shit today, but that's fine. I'm just worried for school tomorrow and whether I'll be able to get out for my walk/run tomorrow. Also, I outed myself in my English and Spanish work (The Spanish is actually a funny story, if anyone wants I'll tell you about it) so I'm a bit wary of what'll happen when I hand in my English book. My English teacher gives off transphobe vibes, just because she's old and Christian, but that's unfair so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.

Anyway, I think that's all for today!

Stay safe out there!
