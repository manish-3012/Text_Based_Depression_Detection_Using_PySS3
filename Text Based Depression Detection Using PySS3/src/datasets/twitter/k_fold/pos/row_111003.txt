Advice for Boys and Girls Hey! So im a 19 year old girl (yes, i know my last year in the â€œteensâ€ club) thats in a relationship with a 19 year old boy, also a lurker in the sub. Over the last 2 days I saw quite a few â€œadvice about girls from a girlâ€ and â€œadvice about boys from a boyâ€ posts, and I noticed that most things mentioned actually go vice versa for both genders. So after a discussion with my boyfriend to make sure I donâ€™t make any assumptions, here is our ultimate guide to both girls and boys and relationships. I really hope this can help someone out as well as clear up any miss understandings about gender specific behavior.

1)**HINTS ARE CONFUSING**
This is not anything specific for any gender, both boys and girls give hints and in most cases it confuses the other person. If you feel like your crush is giving you hints, best way to find out is for you to take that additional step from a â€œhintâ€ to a â€œsignalâ€ and express your feelings for them in a more obvious way. This will most likely Encourage them to do the same, and give you more clarity overall about their feelings.


2) **IT IS SCARY TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP**
Yes, both boys and girls EQUALY are afraid to take the first serious step no matter what it is - expressing feelings, inviting on a date, holding hands and kissing, and both boys and girls EQUALY want the other one to take this step. As you can see this causes a problem. Both sides are just waiting for this first step from the other one, and both are too scared to do so. I was actually brainstorming with my BF for a while deciding what advice I can give on this, and after talking to some of my fellow girl friends and fellow boy friends we concluded that in most cases girls wonâ€™t take this step. Girls usually feel like they have to be â€œchosenâ€ by a boy, and often think itâ€™s quite desperate to be the ones to take this first step. This of course should not be the case but can help some boys understand why girls are so rare to take the first steps. My best advice is just no matter the gender if you really want the other person to be your significant other, and not lose them, just take that step, as scary as it might be, very very rarely will it end badly. Even if you get rejected at least now you know and you are not waisting your time. 


3.**EVERYONE IS SHY AND AFRAID DURING THE FIRST DATE**
Dates are scary. You are meeting this person that you probably donâ€™t know that well, and itâ€™s awkward and you wonâ€™t know what to say. Best advice I can give is be ready to carry the conversation - I know that can be very hard, but trust me, if you commit to this, it will give both you and your date a better experience. If the person you are with is also willing to carry the conversation - even better, now you both are fully committed to having a good convo. Worst thing you can do is just assume that the other person will talk all the time. Even if that is the case, it probably wonâ€™t give either of you too good of an impression of each other. If they ask you something, try to give long answers, share little stories from your life that are relevant to the convo. 


4.**NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO KISS THE FIRST KISS** 
If you where like me, you were terrified to have your first kiss. Watching all the kissing tutorials on yt as well as practicing on your hand. However I have a little secret to share. Kissing is like swinging on a swing. Your first time might be a bit confusing, but your body will carry the action for you. We already know how to kiss, at least somewhat, so even with no practice, your first kiss will go fine as long as you donâ€™t try and overdo it. If the whole idea of a full blown kiss is a bit much to grasp, a little peck on the lips for the first kiss will also definitely be romantic enough, so take it slow. 


5.**THERE IS NO RUSH, YOU ARE NOT LATE**
This has less to do with the whole advice thing and more so just me trying to re-assure you - there is nothing wrong with being well into your teens or even 20â€™ies without having a gf/bf, having a kiss or sleeping with someone. First relationship, first kiss and all your firsts are magical and special, and you should feel fully comfortable when going trough them. Dont rush just because you see others around you doing so. I had my first kiss at 16, first boyfriend at 17 and i regret both of those. I did both cuz i felt like i had to rush into something, and now i will never get that back. Im Okay now, and i dont dwell on past mistakes, but i just thought i should mention that.


Okay, this is already much longer than i wanted it to be, so i will stop here, but any other questions/opinions are welcome in the comments.

Also, i mostly used a hetero relationships as an example in this post, but thats just because i was basing it in my experiences. I hope you can still find this useful no matter if your are gay/bi etc.

Also I apologize for grammar (not a native speaker) and the formatting (Iâ€™m on mobile).
