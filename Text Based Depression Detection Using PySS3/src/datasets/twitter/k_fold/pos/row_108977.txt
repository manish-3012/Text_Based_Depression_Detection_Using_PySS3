I CANT BELIEVE SHE SAID YES!!! ok so this just happened and I am super excited.

I've been really nervous about asking her for along time but I decided I couldn't wait any longer. I'll tell you the story. So I get a text from her asking how my day has been out of nowhere, we talk for a little bit on the phone and she can tell theirs something I want to ask her, I'm going to just ask but I want to do it in person, so latter we meet up and I'm really nervous, so I just blurt it out

"mom, I think I deserve more screen time"

she just looks at me, so I continue, "mom I've been working really hard at school and I think I deserve at least two and a half hours"

mom is silent for a moment but then agrees, and says yes that we can try it out for a bit and see how it goes. I'm  very excited right now I just cant believe it two and half hours is more screen time than I've ever gotten I'm literally shaking.

TL:DR: I asked my mom for more screen time and she said yes, very exciting!
