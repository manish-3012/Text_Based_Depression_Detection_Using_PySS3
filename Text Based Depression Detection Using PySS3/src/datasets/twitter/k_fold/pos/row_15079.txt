It's Already Morning:

The way the sun rises at four a.m.
The pink and the blue and the purple.
And the white of the clouds.
But most of all, the silence.

My breath that comes and goes slowly.
The dirt on my back cause i was on the ground looking at the stars for the whole night.
My calm and softy song.
The moon that still apears cause it's too soon.

My mouth, dried of water and very hurted.
My skin, pale and faded.
The red of my blood on my fingers.
My silent sadness, that envolve me with the beauty of that sunrise.

The way i'm huming the melody.
Again, the silence of the world.
And then, the song of the birds.
And the way it fits perfecly with my melody.

The goddamn cold.
My short and thin clothes.
The dirt on my feet, cause i walked in the garden while seeing the stars.
The tree outside the wall looking tired and sleepy.

The other music that starts on my cellphone.
That melancholichy symphony.
The smell of coffe of my neighbours, cause it's already morning.
It's already morning.
