Why am I crying over a song Iâ€™ve always shed a tear or two over Jiyuu no Tsubasa and I never knew why. It was always at the choir part (ryoute ni wa Gloria...). But then right now as Iâ€™m typing Iâ€™m crying over every songs Iâ€™m listening to (most of them being anime openings). Why am I doing that? Iâ€™m not sad nor angry i donâ€™t know.
