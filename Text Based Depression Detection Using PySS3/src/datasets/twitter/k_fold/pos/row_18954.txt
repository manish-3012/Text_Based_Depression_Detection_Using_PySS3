jojo part 5 golden wind vento aureo spoilers every time giorno closes his eyes, he wakes up feeling so horny

death 13 is stronger than GER because GER can't exist in the dream world unless if it was "summoned" before giorno went to sleep and i'm pretty sure giogio's going to have a pretty peaceful night after defeating diavolo and cuddlefucking with mista while polnareff the turtle watches in disgust. imagine if diavolo somehow recruited mannish boy as a "last resort." probably wouldn't happen considering he's so confident in his invincibility.
