My dad says he doesnâ€™t care anymore I was at my friends house for a birthday party and we were talking about how my parents wanted me to finish out the football season for 8th grade. And my dad doesnâ€™t like the fact that I donâ€™t like football, so when I got into the car he says that he doesnâ€™t care what I do anymore in life or in football and told me to figure it out on my own now. 

Iâ€™m literally in 8th grade and Iâ€™m getting told to figure it out on my own. 

Idk how it went from football to my dad saying that he doesnâ€™t care about giving me the tools to succeed anymore. 

I just needed to get this off of my chest cause Iâ€™m really upset rn.
