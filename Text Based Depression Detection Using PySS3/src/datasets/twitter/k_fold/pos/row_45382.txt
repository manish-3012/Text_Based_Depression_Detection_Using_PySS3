Hey reddit to the few that see this i need help. So my best friend since 4th grade (we are both 16 almost 17 now) has officially come out as trans so he is now a she. Which is amazing im proud and happy to have a basically a brother-to-sister that i have known for so long. So for some reason they love dumplings, like the food dumplings, and just to like basically say im proud i was wondering if there is anyone thats good at art out there that could draw one that has the colors Pink Blue and White as if its a transgender dumpling. I would do it myself but i have never been good with art so i decided to come to the best place for help. all you amazing teenagers. if there is anyone that can help please do message me or something. jackfrost1080\_\_#2792 thats my discord if it works better for anyone.
