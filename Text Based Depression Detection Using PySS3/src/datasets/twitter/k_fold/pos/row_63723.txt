I am now convinced that George Floyd died because of drugs. The arrest video of him was leaked by the dailymail and you can see me hear that he already said "I canâ€™t breathe" before he was kneeled on due to resisting arrest. 

He died of heart failure which can also mean that he overdosed on drugs and that he died of stress. He was high at the time of the arrest. And also he was a a convict and Not an angel. He was known to the police. Also how stupid are you all to believe the cops acted out of racism? There was a black cop present on scene. ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ 

youâ€™ve all been lied to by CNN
