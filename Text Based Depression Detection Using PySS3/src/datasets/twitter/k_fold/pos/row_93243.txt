something very weird, apparently a grown man attended a 6th grade class pretending to be a kid when that kid was absent. The man wasn't affiliated with the family. (true) I remembered from earlier today this happened and I just wanted to share. So kids were not turning on their cameras in phys ed class so the teacher told us it was basic safety. She told us this thing, which creeped me out. So in a 6th grade class, btw 6th grade is the lowest grade in my school and thankfully I finished 6th grade quite some time ago, so she told everyone to turn on their cameras. And 6th graders must have some decency, because all of them actually turned on the camera. And she saw, one of the kids cam's, was a grown man. The family was notified and they said they did not know this man, the kid was supposed to be absent for that day, and they upped their security I think. But, what the heck? A grown man? Who is it? Like, how does that happen? I am seriously worried for that kid, Im hoping the account was just hacked, because I don't know all the details, and if that man was attending from the home of the kid, on their computer, then I am VERY worried. I will try to get an update if it is possible. I am only thinking *how* and *why*...?
