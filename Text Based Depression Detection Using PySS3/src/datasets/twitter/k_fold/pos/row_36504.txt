Rise and Shine Mister Freeman Not that I wish... to imply that you have beenÂ sleeping on... the job. No one is more deserving of a rest, and all the effortÂ in the world would have gone to waste until... well... let's just say your hour has...Â come again.Â The right man in the wrong place can makeÂ all the difference inÂ the world. So, wake up, Mister Freeman... wake up and...Â smell the ashes.
