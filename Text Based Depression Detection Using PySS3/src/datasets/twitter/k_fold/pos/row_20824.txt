Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 74 "We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth, to touch the face of God."

Today is the 35th anniversary of STS-51-L, also known as the Challenger disaster. On January 28th, 1986, 73 seconds after liftoff, an o-ring seal inside one of the solid rocket boosters on the side of Space Shuttle Challenger broke. This caused hot gases from the booster's exhaust to reach the orange fuel tank of the Shuttle, disintegrating it within seconds. All seven brave crew members were killed.

Yesterday was the 54th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire. On January 27th, 1967, while running through a "plugs-out" test on the launch pad inside the Apollo crew capsule, a fire - most likely caused by an electrical malfunction - broke out. The Apollo capsule was a pure oxygen environment, and because of this, the three brave crew members inside it had almost no chance of making it out before the capsule exploded. All three of them were killed.

February 1st will be the 18th anniversary of STS-107, also known as the Columbia disaster. During ascent a few weeks earlier, a piece of foam from Space Shuttle Columbia's orange fuel tank struck the bottom of her wing. It was originally thought that this did minimal damage, but when Columbia began to re-enter the atmosphere at the end of the mission on February 1st, 2003, the heat shield had been damaged so much that the Shuttle broke up into multiple pieces, killing all seven brave crew members.

January 26th - February 2nd is often referred to as the worst week in spaceflight history. And I am inclined to agree with people that say that. These three disasters are all reminders that space is hard. The risk that comes with each crewed space mission is a risk all astronauts accept. Sometimes, things like this happen. It is horrible, and the ultimate goal is to make sure it never happens, but no journey worthwhile has come without sacrifice. These pioneers - as well as all the other pioneers in spaceflight history - will be remembered, and honored. We will learn from our past mistakes, and we will continue the exploration of the universe, no matter the cost. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and we will continue to honor the fallen by doing exactly what they'd want us to do every day. Rest In Prosperity, Challenger, Columbia, and Apollo 1. Ad Astra Per Aspera.

(Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to get everything I wanted to say in there. Also, apologies if this whole thing sounded super depressing, I didn't mean for it to come out like that!)
