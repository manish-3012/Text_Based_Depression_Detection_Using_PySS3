Why does this always happen with me? I thought that this time I can bring good grades in maths. It was an online test
Turns out it's not in my fate.

It was dang difficult ðŸ˜” only 40 mins and 20 questions which are of 1 mark....*BUT* in reality they take longer time and are probably of 2-3 marks...I am telling you man , the hypocrisy in our school. 
They just had to give less time and high difficulty at the same time!!!! 
Cheating was like defeating Thanos.. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
I searched these questions in google and half of them can't be even found... . ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜­
