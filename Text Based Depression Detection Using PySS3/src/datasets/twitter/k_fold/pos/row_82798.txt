I have an idea. we can change our world. we all have a common problem, I believe. that problem being school, but we can change that. my fellow Americans, I have an idea. and Idea to change the future. we all know that life and school sucks, but we can change that. we can change the future, get out of the hole that is the American public education system. on March 12th, do whatever you can, get in contact with your school boards any way you can, physically, through an email, any way possible. drill this message to them. We have had it being pressed. we want to change our sad lives for the better, by taking us out of the system that treats us as numbers, like a cow on a modern-day farm. let us be heard by the higher-ups. let us be heard by them. let them hear that we don't want to be their bragging right. let them hear the fact that we don't want to be their paychecks. let them hear that we don't want to be pressed, shoved into rooms that we don't want to be in. being forced into things we don't want to be. forced to do things. we don't want to do. were told not to do things, not to disobey the higher-ups. if we do, were ridiculed and punished. this may sound ridiculous, but this is what happens at schools. we put up with this. it's time to change that. March 12th. go to your school board and demand change. let us be heard by the higher-ups. let them hear that we don't want to be their bragging rights. let them hear the fact that we don't want to be their paychecks. let them hear that we don't want to be pressed, shoved into rooms that we don't want to be in.
