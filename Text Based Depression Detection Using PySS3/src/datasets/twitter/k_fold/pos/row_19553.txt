I fcking hate living in small village I live in very small village in Poland (100 people). There are 3 people â€žmy age" and all my real friends lives 15 km away.

 I'm forced to go to church every Sunday because old fucks will propage idiom.

Most interesting places in there (only places) is church, two shops and lake.

Internet here is shitty af, i Cant even talk with somebody through 
Discord.

There arent any chance going to town not by car cuz busses don't drive through this these woods.

Every time I go on walk i have to get pepper spray or big stick if somebody wanted to clean me out or some wild dogs wanted bite me

So fuck small villages
