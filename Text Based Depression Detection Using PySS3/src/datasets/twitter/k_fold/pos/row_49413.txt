Yâ€™all Iâ€™m gonna be famous someday I know this is out there but Iâ€™ve recently been feeling the overwhelming need to do something with my life to make me known, and idk I just feel like if I work hard enough I can achieve it. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll be famous for, but hopefully for acting, because Iâ€™ve always wanted to do it and I love to watch movies and tv shows. If I say it confidently, maybe itâ€™ll happen
