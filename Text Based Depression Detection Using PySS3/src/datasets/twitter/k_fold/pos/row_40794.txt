I want to make the most out of my 20s. Yes, I know this subreddit is meant for 13-19 year olds, but I can't help but feel a necessity to get started really quickly on life once everything becomes normal in a year or so. Maybe it's because of how much hell my parents gave me throughout my life, maybe it an internal want to finally settle down after I've never been able to settle down in one place for more than four years because of, once again, my parents. Call me self-righteous, but I've always found myself being able to think outside of the commonly accepted perspective of where I happen to live. Whether it be Indianapolis (IN), Plainsboro (NJ), Warrington (PA), Fishers (IN), or Johns Creek (GA). While I haven't had the luxury of only knowing one world, I also am able to understand different worlds after years of forced adaptation. I want to settle down, maybe find a life partner, within my 20s. I know that this goal is probably harder than it sounds, but it's just my thoughts. Maybe my outlook might change. But right now, I feel like I've had enough time in my life devoted to understanding myself and having myself as the only constant companion in my life to believe that it's time to settle. Go to college, and move from there.
