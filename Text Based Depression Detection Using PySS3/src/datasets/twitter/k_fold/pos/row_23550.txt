Hereâ€™s my take on Star Wars Watch the theatrical original trilogy (not the special edition) on blu ray. That was unmarred by the sequels

Revenge of the. Sith works as second tier canon in that case

Not attack of the clones because jango fetus voice is different than the original boba fetus voice so itâ€™ll be inconsistent

Our parents childhoods with our childhoods. Seems like a pretty good deal
