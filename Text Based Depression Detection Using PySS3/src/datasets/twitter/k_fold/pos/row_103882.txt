So tomorrow I will be older than teenagers ever can be So yea I am going to be 20 tomorrow and this post is only semi-serious obviously. 
Itâ€™s still insane for me that people (like me) born in the 2000s start being in their 20s slowly. Feeling old ;-;. 

Will I be banished from the subreddit? Forced to leave it like 18 year olds in Codename: KND? :p 

What do you think what should I do on my b-day? 

In case i get deleted out of existence by the r/teenagers mods for being a non teen: Goobye :3
