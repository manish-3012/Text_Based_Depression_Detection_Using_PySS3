Itâ€™s 4 AM and well I wrote something because I was bored cigarette smell stains the room, 
Blood treakling into his fucking eye,
Gold teeth, sparkle while she stare at the moon
heâ€™s only got himself to blame, oh my!
Feeling like he want to be out of sight, 
cos he might lose his mind, lose himself,
sparks his blunt, so he can see the light 
He only cares about his pockets, fuck his health
