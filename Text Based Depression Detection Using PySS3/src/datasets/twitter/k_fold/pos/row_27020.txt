StfÃ¼ about repost No all of us get their content from Reddit. Some of us, get our content from other social media. Wow. Crazy idea! And some of us arenâ€™t claiming that we created that content. We just wanted to share it that subreddit because it matches it and we think itâ€™s neat. Not all of use are foaming at the mouth looking at ever single post that was made to that subreddit. But I do however acknowledge that there is some people who repost purposely for the intent on karma whoring. But donâ€™t assume that all people do that.
