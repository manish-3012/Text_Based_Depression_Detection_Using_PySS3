I have nothing to live for Why the fuck am I living I just feel like I wanna kill myself, I don't have anything to live for anyway.I can't even motivate myself to do anything ffs fuck my life. I have shit grade and I'm shit at anything I do I can't fucking motivate myself to learn anything even though I'm interested in it I try and I fucking fail everything I do so why live. Just dying is more efficient and if I'm living it's just a waste of resources the only thing that's keeping me from killing myself is that I don't have the courage to do it.and I'll be glad if someone could help me do it.but who the fuck would do that.just like I failed at everything I can't even manage to kms. why don't people just fucking except that us as human beings are living on a rock floating in space and that rock eventually will be hit by another floating rock and we will go extinct so why live now it will happen eventually dying out now is no difference or its just my way of thinking about life 
Hope I die while I sleep that way would be better nobody will be guilty and I can die peacefully and without pain.
