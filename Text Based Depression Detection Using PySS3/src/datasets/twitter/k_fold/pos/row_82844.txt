I made a video and I want your advice Link to the video: https://youtu.be/GszxBEF8T-E

So I made a short video on global warming and I want to see you guys to provide me with ideas to improve my future videos.

Notes:

1) Iâ€™m not a native speaker, thus my accent may be a bit off (and I also have a cheap microphone)

2) This was done on a 4GB laptop, and it was made by collaging different panels to form animations

3) I donâ€™t have much time (say this took 12 hours to animate and record, spread over 4 days)
