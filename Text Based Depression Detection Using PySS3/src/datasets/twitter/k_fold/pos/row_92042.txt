Youtube prankster? ðŸ˜® Hi all, happy father of four here, you caught me :) Thought I'd ask advice from people my son's age
Recently my eldest has been getting into making YouTube videos. He's bought himself a camera and microphone and the whole lineup, and it's great to see him pursuing what he is passionate of.

My worry is that while his clips are fun and productive, he is focusing around practical jokes on our neighbors and such, like prank calls, and the ol' ding dong ditching. With everything happening, I don't know if now is the best time, even if it is harmless. And prank calling employees that threaten to bring the police? How should I approach him with this topic?
