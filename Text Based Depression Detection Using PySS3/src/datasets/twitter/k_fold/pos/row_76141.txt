At this point Reddit will have an award that costs 1000$+ in the next few months. Whatâ€™s the point to all this? Wasnâ€™t the classic system of just silver, gold and platinum not good enough? I liked it when there were just three different awards, now itâ€™s just really confusing. I could understand, if they had just added a handful of new awards. But **this** is just too much? Wholesome Award? Argentinium? All Powerful? Stonks? Itâ€™s confusing! Just have five or ten awards, but not this many!
