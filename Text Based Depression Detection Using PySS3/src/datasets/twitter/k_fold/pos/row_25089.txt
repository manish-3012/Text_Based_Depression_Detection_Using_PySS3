im going to stop using the internet for a bit. i use the internet wayyyyy to much, before all of this was created the internet was solely used as a tool. the internet we all know today is just a way to satisfy boredom, and we are all doing it. its wrong in my opinion and i know some other people agree with me. I'm dedicating my life to the internet and everything within it for a few hours of pleasure.

so on this day (December 6th 2020) I will start using the internet only as a tool and nothing more.

maybe ill read a book or write a book, or maybe learn to play the piano like I've always wanted to. so i guess i'll see you guys at r/teenagers in a bit, hopefully as a changed guy. see ya later alligator

I got the idea from the youtuber Exurbia btw, he is really cool and i like his channel a lot.
