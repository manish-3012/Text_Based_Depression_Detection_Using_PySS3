I'm scared of driving Today I drove a car different than the one I was preparing with for my driving licence test and I'm still feeling not so good. It was so scary driving something two times bigger with three times the power and torque of what I've been driving previously. Parking this thing was a nightmare. I still don't feel the clutch and I can't take out the car in order to practice on the country roads whenever I want because it all depends on my dad's mood (today he wasn't feeling like getting up from the bed so he let me drive by myself). I don't want to be driving with him because I want to figure it out myself without unnecessary "you released the clutch too fast" because I know that I did it and I don't need to hear it again because it's only distracting me.
