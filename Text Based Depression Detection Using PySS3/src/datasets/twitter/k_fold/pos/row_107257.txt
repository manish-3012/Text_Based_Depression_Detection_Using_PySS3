Fuck...what do I do Me and my gf were FaceTiming for a couple hours but then we started getting on the the topic of our rooms and I told her Iâ€™ve never seen hers before and e started play fighting that she had shown me before but she hadnâ€™t but anyways I guess Since going back and forth so much made her overwhelmed she hung up as a joke but when I called her back she didnâ€™t pick up so o called again and she would only Andre for a second then hang up but I managed to get her to stay and I started apologizing as a joke but I soon realized she wasnâ€™t joking but anyways an hours goes by and the only thing I get is one word replyâ€™s or mumbles and this is the first â€œrealâ€ argument weâ€™ve had(BB
