My dadâ€™s going to Dubai Heâ€™s been mobilised with the army and he might be there for as long as 6 months. He isnâ€™t going to be in any situations where he might die so at least thatâ€™s a positive, but idk how Iâ€™m going to manage so long without seeing him.

Heâ€™s leaving in a few months time, and if corona allows things to open up a bit more I might get to fly over and see him with my mum once in a while, but I still donâ€™t know. Rock climbing is a big thing in my life and normally he does it with me but he wonâ€™t be able to anymore meaning I wonâ€™t be able to because my mum isnâ€™t interested in that stuff. 

It also scares me because I donâ€™t get along with my mum very well.

I really donâ€™t want him to go but he has to, I find it hard enough when he goes away on courses for two weeks but for a few months? Idk. Iâ€™m sad now.
