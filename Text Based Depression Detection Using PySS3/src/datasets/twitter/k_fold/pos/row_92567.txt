Today I'm celebrating my first birthday after 8 years of not having any 8 Years of loneliness 8 years of not having friends I finally did it  but the fear still stays "what if they don't come"  "what if they make fun of you" it's exciting yet terrifying 

actually I did have birthdays but it was mostly me my mom and her friends
