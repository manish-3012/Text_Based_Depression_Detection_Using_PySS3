Itâ€™s all gotten worse again and idk what to do Everything was getting better and better. Iâ€™d gotten over loosing my friends, Iâ€™d (mostly) gotten over my crush getting a bf, I hadnâ€™t cut myself in months, and I hadnâ€™t cried in weeks, and I started to trust people again. And then now itâ€™s all just flipped around and returned back. I havenâ€™t cut yet but Iâ€™ve looked at my open window in a way I hadnâ€™t in months, and Iâ€™ve cried for the first time in a couple of weeks. People keep saying itâ€™ll get better it hasnâ€™t for 7 years it has only gotten worse. Idek what Iâ€™m supposed to do anymore
