I have no friends This is sad. I live in care and Iâ€™m trapped in a failing special needs school with barely any students and I donâ€™t learn a thing. My internet access is supervised/restricted and social media is completely banned full stop. I have to br chaperoned everywhere I go. I have pretty much no hobbies. Thereâ€™s no one in the home I like and I hate everyone in my family. How can I make friends in real life?
