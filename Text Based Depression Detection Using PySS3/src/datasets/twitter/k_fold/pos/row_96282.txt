So idk if i was too horny when i said this and its been bothering me My friend sent a booty pic as a friend like we're just really close

I basically said she has a nice body

And she said like "omg stop"

And then i was like you're "one of the hottest girl i know" and i think i said that because im horny and now im regretting it lol

And sometimes she just leaves people on delivered, like alot for long times and she said its because she doesn't check her phone alot so basically im on delivered and if i unsend she'll know i unsended something so idk what to do 

Also im not being super friend zoned i don't want to date her.
