Astronauts are way cooler than superheroes! Before watching Apple TV's "For All Mankind" I didn't think space travel was worth it unless warp drives were invented. This show showed me how cool real space exploration could really be.

After finishing the first season I checked out movies like "Apollo 13", "First Man", "Hidden Figures", and "The Right Stuff". I also watched sci fi movies like "Interstellar" and "The Martian".

I am still learning new things about the space program. I didn't know how important scientific research in low Earth orbit was. They are experimenting with the COVID vaccine on the ISS now. If climate change is going to make viruses like COVID more frequent then keeping a human presence in low Earth orbit would be prudent.

I am also inspired to push myself mentally and physically because of astronauts. Some people are inspired by athletes. Some by musicians but for me it is the astronauts.

Now I think astronauts are way cooler than superheroes.
