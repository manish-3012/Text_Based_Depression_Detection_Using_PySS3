Thank your teachers!! Not only do they deserve the thanks, but itâ€™ll make them happy af. Trust me, everyone in my class turned on our cameras during biology to thank our teacher, and it made his day. Even if itâ€™s a teacher you donâ€™t really like, theyâ€™re trying their best in this virtual environment, and everyone should be grateful for that.
