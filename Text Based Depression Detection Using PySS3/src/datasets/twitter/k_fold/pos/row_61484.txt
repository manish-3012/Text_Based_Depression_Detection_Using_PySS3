Since r/techsupport doesn't allow password issues, I'll ask a bunch teens, what could go wrong? So basically, my phone got stuck on the boot screen, I help power and down, like I always do when that happens (And yes, that happens quite often). But this time, when I tried to log in, my password was incorrect, and again, and again. So at some point I decided to really carefully check, and I was sure it was correct, but it said it is incorrect. It has changed somehow  


How tf do I fix this?  


(Im running android 10 btw (galaxy a7-2018, if it's important))  


Yah I'd consider myself quite a techie but idk what to do here ;-;
