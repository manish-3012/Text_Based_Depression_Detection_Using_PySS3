Would you rather look like a Chad but smell like fart every day for the rest of your life or look extremely ugly but smell good every day for the rest of your life? If you take the first one, you can't ever stop smelling like fart- the more you try to wear cologne the more you smell like farts bc the chemicals in ur skin will counteract it
