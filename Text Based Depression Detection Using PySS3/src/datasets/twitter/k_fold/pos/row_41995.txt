A guide to deadly wildlife in California, but not really This is basically going to be how to deal with California wildlife if your ever in a situation where you have to, Iâ€™m not an expert and you should do your own research to substantiate these claims yourself 

Coyotes are basically everywhere but if your healthy or overweight you will probably win, use anything you have, a knife would be ideal but you could beat the shit out of it with a maglight, but basically just donâ€™t bother them and they wonâ€™t bother you 

Bobcats, same kinda thing except there faster and more agile

Deer: I donâ€™t want to talk about it, it will give me flashbacks, and I donâ€™t want to go through that

Mountain lions: donâ€™t bend over, make yourself look as big as possible,and donâ€™t bend over, donâ€™t bend over throw things at it without bending over, are you noticing a theme here

Wolves: idk ur fucked

Bears: Bear spray, play dead, if itâ€™s a grizzly ur fucked

Spiders and scorpions: so if you get bit by a spider or stung by a scorpion go to the hospital immediately, recluse spider bites can be fatal to healthy adults 

Rattlesnakes: if you hear a Rattle run, thatâ€™s a warning so it doesnâ€™t want to but it will if you donâ€™t get the fuck out, if you do get bit by a rattlesnake go to the hospital immediately, if your a healthy adult you probably wonâ€™t die but even if you get bit by a non venomous snake you should still go the emergency room because that bite will likely get infected, but that applies to anything, you should do that if youâ€™re cat accidentally bit you while it was eating a treat out of your hand, not like I have any experience with that 

Mosquitoes: itâ€™s probably fine but if you get symptoms of the West Nile virus you should go to the doctor 

Republicans: ur lost in central California 

Lizards: avoid large lizards and if you get bit by one go to the hospital but you should do that if you get bit by anything and donâ€™t eat newts, seriously that will likely kill you, donâ€™t touch them either, that probably wonâ€™t kill you but it wonâ€™t be fun either 

Mark Zuckerbergs: these will steal all of your personal information and deny there doing it, if you see one of these run it will steal all of your personal data 

Bees: yeah thereâ€™s really nothing you can do about killer bees

Hornets: good luck, if thereâ€™s just a nest get some hornet spray, itâ€™s one of those targeted ones that dissolves there exoskeleton, itâ€™s also great for spiders or any other relatively small thing with an exoskeleton, I donâ€™t think you should use it on a tarantula or a crab or anything but itâ€™s a good way to kill small insects, spiders, or scorpions, wasp spray will also work, 

Wasps: kill the nest with wasp or hornet spray 

Sharks: donâ€™t go in the water? Idk you donâ€™t really have to worry about this one too much but they do happen in California so I just thought I would mention it

Seals: stay away

Dolphins: stay away

Whales: stay away

Molluscs: stay away
