My part of the world never had lockdown We've had 43 cases so far and 0 deaths we did kinda lockdown for 2 weeks but only thing that happend was movie theaters closed and pubs were take away only. To this day there is barley any social distancing, no one wears face masks and life is basically like 2019. 

Any questions?
