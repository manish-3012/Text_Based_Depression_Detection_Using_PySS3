My mom saw me using r/teenagers, told me to scroll through and she didn't like what she saw. So this is my goodbye ðŸ¥º My mom didn't like all the cussing and sex jokes and all, but I have decided it may be time to leave myself as well.  I may fit the age group, but I think I've matured past this subforum a bit and it's time to say goodbye. I've cherished a lot of memories here over the past two years and this goodbye is in hopes of a better future for all of you (and myself of course). I'll come back every now and then just to see what's up, but I really think it's time for me to move on.  

And guys, **talking to girls is NOT as hard as you guys make it seem!** Just walk up to a girl, say hi, and a lot of the time she'll actually steer the conversation. Trust me, she is just as happy as you are about talking to someone of the opposite sex who seems at least a tiny bit interested lol.
