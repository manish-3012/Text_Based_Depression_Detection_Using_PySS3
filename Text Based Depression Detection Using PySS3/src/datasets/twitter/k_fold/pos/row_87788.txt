How do I stop being stupid? I'm not like stupid as in bot good at things like, math, science, etc. I'm just stupid in an embarrassing and awkward way.

For example, this was a thing that just happened:

So I was walking down my towns main street, taking pictures of various parts of the town (gotta do it for a thing that isn't important right now) when I ran into my dads neighbour that he is mates with. We talked for a bit and at the end he asked if my dad could feed Charlie for him. (His pet cat)

Now at the time, I had completely forgotten his cats name was Charlie, so as I was walking away I came to realize I had no idea what he just said. We were outside a restaurant (where he works) and he does dishes so while thinking about it, it somehow morphed into (can you help Charlie do the dishes) cause I was thinking too many things at the same time and somehow that happened.

So then I called my dad, hoping he would know who Charlie is and why our neighbour wanted me or my dad to help him with dishes.

Que like 10 minutes of confused talking with my dad with both of us trying to work out what was happening. When he said the only Charlie he knew was his cat I had realized I fucked up lol. What could have been a simple 5 word text ended up with me wasting 10 mins of my dads time and an angry/annoyed/pissed off dad wandering how I'm such a huge idiot. I'd rather just not go home at the moment knowing what is probably waiting for me right now.

And many other things like this have happened where I'm just an inexplicable idiot for no reason, how do I stop being like this?
