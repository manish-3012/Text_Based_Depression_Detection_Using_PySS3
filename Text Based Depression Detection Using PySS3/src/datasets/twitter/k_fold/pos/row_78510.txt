A guy called me cute while I was walking. This happened a month ago, but I still think about it. 

I (15F) do this thing where I listen to music and dance as I walk when I get happy. At this time my friend had bought me a milkshake so I was dancing and singing "I feel good! I knew that I would!" and doing a little dance each step while she laughed at me. 

Then this guy just walks up to me and smiles and goes "Hey, you're really cute. I just wanted to tell you," and then WALKED AWAY. My friend fangirled for an hour about that, and I was so goddamn happy I did a happy dance. 

It still makes me smile so hard.
