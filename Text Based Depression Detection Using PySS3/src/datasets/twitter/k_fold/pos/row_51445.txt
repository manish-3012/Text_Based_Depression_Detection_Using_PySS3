The fucking discord server has descended into chaos and it is very hard to get a good understanding of the clans that have been fomed Im probably just really tired and my judgement is probably clouded but it is verry hard to find a spot to fit in, like I am hearing things about alliances between azakastonia and new Zealand like wtf? I am very tired and I will look back on the comments tomorrow, goodnight.
