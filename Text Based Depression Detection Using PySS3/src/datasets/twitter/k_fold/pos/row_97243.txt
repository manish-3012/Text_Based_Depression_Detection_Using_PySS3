Is it bad to ask someone out if you arenâ€™t friends with them first? I used to have the opinion that you have to be great friends or madly in love with someone to ask them out. However, with covid, I have no chance to meet new people in person. Iâ€™m feeling kinda lonely, so I feel like just asking somebody who I am somewhat attracted to and who doesnâ€™t repulse me and asking them to go out on social media. Would this be a bad move?
