My school is handling Covid terribly So I switched from at home learning to in school learning because I really couldnâ€™t learn online. At first things went well, however things went south fast. Teachers started caring less about mask rules and would let kids just go about without masks on or wear them improperly. The school also said they wouldnâ€™t have lots of kids in the hallways the was over incredibly fast. Now the school is discontinuing online learning which means that the kids who were there are coming back to class, meaning classes will go from 15-20 students to 25+ students. I want to tell my parents I want to go back to home school but I not sure how to tell them and explain how bad the situation is for me.
