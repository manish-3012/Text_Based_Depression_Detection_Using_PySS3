I have trust issues, anyone know how to fix them? so not to get into anything long but all my life Iâ€™ve been lied to about family stuff, friends leave me because they just donâ€™t like me, every relationship Iâ€™ve been in i was cheated on. making new friends and potential partners was difficult before as I am kinda ugly n fat but with just trust issues I just donâ€™t trust people. someone could say they love me and I think theyâ€™re lying to me. any suggestions?
