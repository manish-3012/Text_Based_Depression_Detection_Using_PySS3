I have to get something that happened 2 years ago off my chest Ok so 2 years ago I had a girlfriend and it was going pretty well until one day she just broke up with me and 1 month later she texted me and said that she was going  to kill herself but I didnâ€™t see it until one day later and recently Iâ€™ve been feeling like if she did actually go through with it then itâ€™s all my fault. I feel freaking horrible because of it
