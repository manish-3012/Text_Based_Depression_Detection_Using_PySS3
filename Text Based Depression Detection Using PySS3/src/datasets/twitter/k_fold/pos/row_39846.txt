Coming out advice I've been gay for a while, and most of my friends know (since I got outed at school) but I haven't had the courage to tell my parents. I'm pretty sure my dad knows, but my mum thinks I have a crush on one of my best friends who has been the one supporting me for the last few months. 
           I feel like I need to tell them because after school started again about a month ago now, and ever since my mental health had been degrading rapidly. Now the threat of Covid is back in the UK, I don't think I'm going to be able to see my supportive friends in person for at least a month. I really, really want to come out, because it's a gateway to discussing my other issues with them, but I just don't have the balls. I know this will probably get lost in New but if, by any chance, you happen to see this, please comment some advice.
