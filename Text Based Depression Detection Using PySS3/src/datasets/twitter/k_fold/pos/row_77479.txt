I hate my teacher I got a message from my english teacher out of no where and she said that she has selected me for the spelling bee competition (a competition where you are asked to spell words), and when I said that I don't want to participate, and that she should have asked me first before putting my name in, she said, "Im not asking you, I am telling you"

Like wtf, Now I have to memorize 200 fucking words. Im not even interested in this bs. The competition is a few days later :(
