I JUST DROVE A CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME So Iâ€™m 13 and turning 14 in a few months and my dad took me out today to an empty parking lot at my districts highschool and asked if I wanted to get behind the wheel. I wasnâ€™t sure because Iâ€™ve always been scared of driving and the fact that maybe Iâ€™ll be a very bad driver by the time in 16. We switched spots and he repeated some very commonly known steps on how to start the engine and start driving. We spent about 15 minutes just turning, using the break pedal and drive pedal (is that what itâ€™s called?), and using the turn signals. We stopped at a couple stop signs, drove in circles around different objects, moved very slowly, and I didnâ€™t spin out of the snow or hit a curb at all! I still have a rush of adrenaline and driving a 2,000+ pound machine just made me feel so powerful.
