My best night ever ( Shrek involved ) So little back story, I was at the scout camp. Ok good now that you know that I was in a middle of the woods for 2 weeks we can get started.

So as I said before I was in a woods but the scout master (the guy that runs the camp) had one outlet so he can charge his laptop. But one day he decided that we will have a move night so he call me up to help him (he knew that I was the best and oldest at the camp that can help him) so we set everything up and now for ppl, he called every one up and it was ready. We choose Shrek as the movie for a night, all of the younger grups had to leave expect my team cos we where 14 and I aske the scout master to stay.  The midnight was in like 3 mins and the girl that had a crash on me ask if she could be close to me because she was cold I said yes, she sat next to me and I hug her I thought the jobs done, I have a cute girl next to me we are watching Shrek in a middle of the woods what can be better (boy was I wrong) it was something like 16 mins past midnight and her friend come up to me and did the same thing. So long story short I had 2 cute girls huging me in a middle of the woods when we are watching Shrek.
It's been some time science then.
