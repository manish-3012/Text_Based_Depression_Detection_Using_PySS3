So me and my girlfriend broke up and I need some moral support or something The whole relationships was kinda toxic and she said she doesn't want anymore this relation and that she thinks is was better when we were just friends.

I tried to remain with her in a relationship and I tried to be the best and I asked her what she doesn't like in the relationships but she kept saying that she doesn't know even when she complained about the fact that the relationship was shit.

From the beggining she said she is not sure if she wants the relationship but after she said that she wants.She used to say that she loves me but only in messages and she just didn't show her love.She kinda avoided physical contact and when I asked her if she doesn't want any she said that a relationship without physical contact is just a friendship.we kissed and hugged only a little and when we kissed she wasn't sure if she really wants it.In the first 2 weeks of relationships she said that it's weird because she sees me only as a friend and not as a boyfriend .Also she used to say that she doesn't think that the relationships will last a long time and it is shitty to hear this.

In the relationship she used to make me feel uncomfortable.She used to kiss her female best friend and to text her ex even if I said that I don't really like that,she start texting him a week ago or something like this,but I don't really believe she likes him,but it was uncomfortable because her ex didn't know that she was know in a relationships so he might think that he has a chance or something, idk.None of her friends knew that she was in a relationship and it was kinda shitty because maybe every guy that she talked to might have thought that they can get her or something.I was not really that possessive because I let her talk to anyone as long as she didn't want anything with them.

We used to talk in the night and she used to have fast replies but lately she texted me from 3 to 3 minutes and it sucked because I knew that she was texting some other guy instead of me.As I said,I don't have a problem with her texting other guys but it would have been nicer if she chose to talk to her boyfriend than with a friend.

Anyways,I am not sure if the broke up was right and it came from her.I am not feeling that bad because I thought that this might come but it also feels shitty.
