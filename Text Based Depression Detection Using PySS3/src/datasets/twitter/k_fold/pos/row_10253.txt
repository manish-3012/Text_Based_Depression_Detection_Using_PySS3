Being lgbtq isnt a personality And not all lgbtq people are good people


But at the same time not all lgbtq people are bad



So no one has the right to judge you differently if you are lgbtq because it's like having green eyes; some green eyed people are bad, some are not

LGBTQ people are humans just like you who can kill, cry, and help people
