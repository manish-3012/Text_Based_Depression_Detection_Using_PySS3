Many states allow early voting, so me and my friends made a party out of it Sounds a bit strange but most states have some form of early voting, up to 45 days before the election in some cases. Anyway, during the primary I got some friends together and we all went and voted. Easy way to get some votes in and get em off your mind. 

If you're having a hard time getting your friends to go, buy them pizza. Food really speaks volumes. I know right now it's a bit complicated because of covid but just keep your distance, wear a face mask and face shield if you have it, sanitize and you should be fine. Going early usually means there's no lines so it can save a bit of time. 

Anyway just wanted to share some advice. Gotta fight for our future ya know? Here's a list if you want to check and see when your state votes.
