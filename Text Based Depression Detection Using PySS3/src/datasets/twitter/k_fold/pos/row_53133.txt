Watch Bottom Tier Tomozaki Kun  I got up at 3 pm today after a heavy night of gaming and decided to check out some of the new seasonal shows. One caught my attention, Bottom Tier Tomozaki Kun. It would be insufficient to say that the show changed my life. Being a gamer myself, I too looked at life like it was a horrid thing and that the only saving grace of living was gaming. But watching the first episode of this show really ignited the gamer in me. Thinking of life like an easy to learn, difficult to master game really opened my eyes to going outside. I haven't left the house for around 5 weeks now, but I think today I might step out into the world as a level one player and Ill keep going till I get Grandmaster rank. I m- This show is truly inspiring and my only 10/10 show. Go watch it Gamers!
