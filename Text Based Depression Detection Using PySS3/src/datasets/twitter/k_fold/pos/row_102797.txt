I fucking hate learning my ancestry. I found out that one of my fifth great grandfathers is also one of my fourth great grandfathers. Yes his grand daughter married his great grandson. That is just one of TWO moments of incest on my dadâ€™s side. Not only that but one of my other fifth great grandfathers was 36 when he married my then 16 year old fifth great grandmother. Add on to that that there were some confederate soldiers and maybe even potentially a slave owner and you get the perfect (not) ancestry.
