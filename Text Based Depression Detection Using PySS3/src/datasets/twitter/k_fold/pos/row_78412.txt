I am super proud of myself for not selfharming for 17 day but their isn't a lot of people I can express this to. I want to tell my friend but I don't know how. I wanted to tell one of my friends but I never mentioned my relapse. I don't want them to be upset with me. I just really want to tell him how proud I am of myself. 

What would be a good way to tell them without them being disappointed in me? How would I phrase a message?
