2021 has already become worse than 2020 So for starters I'm the loneliest I've ever been but that comes from before 2021, I've become so lonely that sometimes I just cant function properly. Now Im not a loner and everything I actually have a lot of friends and im generally good with social interactions, but I feel like they might be faking being my friend or just hang out with me because they have to, but im VERY lonely as well because I need someone to share my days and feeling with, I want a girlfriend but I cant manage to get one, girls dont really think of me in that way i guess, Im 15 and have never kissed a girl. I actually got to the point that I had a dream about just putting my arm around a girl, hugging her and holding hands with her made me so happy, the happiest Ive ever been but then woke up and for the past 10 hours Ive felt even shittier than i do normally. I just needed to vent I guess thank you for reading.
