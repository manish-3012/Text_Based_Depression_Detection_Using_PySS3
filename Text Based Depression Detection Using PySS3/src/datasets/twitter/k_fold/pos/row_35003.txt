My bestie has a crush on me? Hey, so yâ€™all are really against friendzoning cuz its mean. But iâ€™m friendzoning someone and i feel like a bad person now. Lemme explain whats happening: my bestie is pansexual, and i really dont know what i identify as. About 3 years ago, when i had known her for half a year, she said she was in love with me. I loved her but not in that way, so i told her. I thought we were fine after that, and weve still been as close as before after that. And now, about 2 days ago she said she still has a crush on me? I feel like a fucking bad person now, cuz like, is it my fault or sth? I still want to be friends with her, like, i need her, a lot. But i am technically friendzoning her and its kinda selfish of me.
