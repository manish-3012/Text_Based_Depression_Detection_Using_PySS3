I just want a new set of parents My dad always had mood swings and my mum always retaliates and itâ€™s just a huge mess of shouting and screaming while Iâ€™m in the middle of it all, I just want to live in a family thatâ€™s happy and caring and doesnâ€™t fight every few days and then act like nothing happens. Its gotten to the point where Iâ€™m scared my dad will get violent since he throws stuff or slams doors when heâ€™s mad. Sorry if this is venty but I honestly have no one I can tell this stuff to and I heard this place is somewhat nice.
