My mom thinks she knows how the law works She says that "its illegal for teens to be introverted". Like, do you even know how anxiety and introvertedness works? 

Worst part is that she thinks she's the smartest in the house so what ever you say to her about your insecurities she'll say it to her friends and say back to you. Its cause of social media, stop talking like a child. 

How do i stop her from being annoying as fuck?
