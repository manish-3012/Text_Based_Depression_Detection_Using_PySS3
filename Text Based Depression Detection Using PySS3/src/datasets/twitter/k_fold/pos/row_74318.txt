Why do we need dozens of different genders? Like I under homosexual, I understand bisexual, I easily understand heterosexual. Then there is non-binary and the rest of the however other many there are, which I cannot wrap my head around why you couldnt settle with one the first three. I'm not trying to attack anyone, I want this to be a extremely neutral question
