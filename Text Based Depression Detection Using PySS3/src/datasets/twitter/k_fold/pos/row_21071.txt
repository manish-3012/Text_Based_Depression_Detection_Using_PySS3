Anyone able to help with gender identity Feeling kinda confused rn
My dysohoria dissapeared but i want it back for some reason 
Ive considered that I could be genderfluid but im not sure
My brain wants to reject any possibility that I could be anything but a trans girl and sometimes i wanna be a girl but theres no emotions to back up those thoughts 

I cant see a therapist btw
