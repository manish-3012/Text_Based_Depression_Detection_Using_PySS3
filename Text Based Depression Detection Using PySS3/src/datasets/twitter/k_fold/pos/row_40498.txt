A bit upset over something [discussion] So, im homeschooled atm
Would go to church once sometimes twice a week, had sports once a week(maybe twice) as well. And that was most of the social interaction that I got in person aside from at home from parents(I did chat online a lot) 

So now I go church(well, would before Covid) once or twice a week, have an in person co op once a week, and a couple online classes still barely leaving my house


I feel like on missed out on so much tbh, never got to be independent, ect. Like...you hear things about kids going things making cool experiments but I was just sitting at my computer cause I had nowhere else to go unless I went to a store or something...feeling slightly bitter about it...yeah I talk a lot online lol

Thereâ€™s only like 1 kid my age at church now
Used to be like 5...and like 10 kids my age group at the in person co op. I used to go to a bigger one tho that was twice a week, so I would be socializing like 4 times a week I guess(in person)
