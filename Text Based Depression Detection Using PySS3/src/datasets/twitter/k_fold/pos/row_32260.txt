Growing up is hard A few weeks I turned 18 and I had to remember that Im legally an adult now and Im in college studying engineering. Long are the days when I would play minecraft and tf2 all day long, long are the highschool days when me and my friends would do silly things around the school and then you realize that your childhood just went away in a blink of an eye without you realizing it and now what awaits you is 5 years filled with physics and mathematics ahead and a messy bedroom filled with sheets of paper and a terrible smell. long were the days when I could spend all night browsing this shitty ass subreddit, meeting new people from all around the globe that I met in new, that was 3 years ago. Life passes in a blink of an eye and you do not want to miss the best time of your life.
