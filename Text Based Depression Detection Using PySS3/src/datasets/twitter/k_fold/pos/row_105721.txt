How the fuck is WAP the top song this year Genuenly, it is mediocre and kinda bad

And hold up, why were people not okay with Mulan, because the main actress supported police brutality, but people seem to forget that Cardi B drugged men, and robbed them and is considered a rapist. Something doesn't add up

(And I dont really care about the person behind the content, I don't care if they are a rapist or support police brutality, but that's weird to me)

But yeah the song is bad
