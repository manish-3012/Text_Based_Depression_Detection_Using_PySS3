Zoom issues Today was my first day of 8th grade, and we had an absolute shit show on zoom today. First zoom was down internationally, then some kids dog was bleeding, next the teacher accidentally showed pornhub germany, and finally another kids mic quality was all like fkhfefoekfeojv. Anyway, thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t like zoom.
