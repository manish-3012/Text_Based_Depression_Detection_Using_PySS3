Drunk mistake ( sorry for my english in advance) So i was at a party with friends and we drank a lot. One friend of mine (female) was drunk and didnâ€™t knew what she was doing or saying. This other friend (male) had less alcohol so he wasnâ€™t on the same drunk level as her. She having a relationship behind her just wanted to have someone near her and thats when the male friend plays a role. They cuddle a bit around on the floor, at one point go to the couch and sit there. I saw from the far how they started kissing and i was really disappointed from him. In my eyes he was using her. The morning after she doesnâ€™t remembers but he was still as if nothing happened. I told her the hole story and now weâ€™re both taking distance from him. He apologized multiple times and sayd he was drunk too, what i can hardly believe. I want to help her with this and go the way she wants. If she forgives him then i would too, cus its nothing personal but more that i donâ€™t tolerate that specially with friends of mine. To my question:

Should she forgive him? And should i too?
