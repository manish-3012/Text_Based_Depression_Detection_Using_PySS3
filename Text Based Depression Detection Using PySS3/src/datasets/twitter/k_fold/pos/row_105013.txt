Who here likes older anime or animation in general more than the modern stuff? Recently I have been watching a lot of Lupin the Third and City Hunter. They are probably my favorite animes I have scene when it comes to pretty musch all the categories. Characters, music, art style, and writing. While I do like some modern anime, a lot of them feel a little bit cookie cutterish. They mostly have some sort of character that's a teenager or someone weak that looks like one, look similar, music sounds kinda meh, and story is usually, "kid wasn't perfect and now he's perfect and fights big bad with new found ability and/or friends." I do only like one anime that was like this and that was Konosuba, and I think that's just because of how funny and well done the dub is.
