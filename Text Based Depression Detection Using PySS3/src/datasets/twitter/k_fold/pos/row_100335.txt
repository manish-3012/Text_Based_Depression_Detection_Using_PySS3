alright so in the shower I thought of a hypothetical question and decided to share it here assume youre in a room, you know that someone else is in the room next to you, but you have no way to communicate with him. 

a moderator walks into the room, he explains that you and the guy next to you have both won Â£20 million between you, and it is up to you to decide how to split the money

the moderator gives you 5 options on how to split the money (the person in the next room will have no clue how you decided to split the money. he will just receive the money he receives and be none the wiser. he will probay assume you split it evenly and there is no way to communicate with him afterwards) 

A) Â£0 to you and Â£20 million to him
B) Â£5 million to you and Â£15 million  to him
C) Â£10 mil to you and Â£10 mil to him
D) Â£15 mil to you and Â£5 mil to him
E) Â£20 mil to you and Â£0 to him


which option are you picking?

there's no right or wrong answer, I just want to hear your lots' input and see how it differs from mine and my mates'.
