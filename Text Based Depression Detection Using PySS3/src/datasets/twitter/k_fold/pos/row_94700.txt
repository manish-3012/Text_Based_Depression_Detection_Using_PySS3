Do you know whatâ€™s a real work of art? You, youâ€™re incredibly complex and teeming with life, a biological machine which can adapt to nearly any circumstance, your brain rewires itself with all that you do, and indeed you are filled with microorganisms too. You are your own country, your own ego, you have your own will and personality generated from your genes, experiences, and unique temperament, you act alone and with your own authority, quite fascinating to observe and see. And you are superlative, superfluous with motion and superficial in view, your own microbiome and ecosystem too. All of your bodyâ€™s organs work in harmony, in effervescent conjunction to produce the symphony that you perceive as life and consciousness. 

You are made entirely of dead things, composed of unfeeling and unthinking atoms and elements, but when combined together it creates something much more than itself, humming with ATP, our life giving energy. What does this all truly do? It enables you to read this page that is in front of you, be grateful for your miniature cells all working in conjunction, to produce what you know of as you.
