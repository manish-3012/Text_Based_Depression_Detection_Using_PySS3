Whats wrong with staying home My corona positive mom just asked if i want to go to the next town over for dinner and i said no. I dont like leaving the house if i dont have to, and even if i have to i still dont like it. She said "you need to quit that shit" so was it normal for me to want to tell her to fuck off?
