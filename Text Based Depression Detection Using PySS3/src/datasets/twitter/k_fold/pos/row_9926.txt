Ok so this subreddit is now full of cringe 13yr olds All the posts here are just 'hey I got a girlfriend', 'FUCK SCHOOL', 'im turning 18 so im leaving this subreddit, 'i had a dream about my crush' and some more 'I hate school, fuck school' then proceeds to finish his school assignments. Like grow up kids, this isn't r/attentionforsale . Stop making up imaginary conversations with an imaginary girl and stop with the *fuck school* shit when you know you have to go to it again the next day.
