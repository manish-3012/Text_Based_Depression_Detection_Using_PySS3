My life peaked yesterday So me and my friends were at homecoming and we decided we should all at least try to dance with a girl. I already knew who I wanted to dance with because I liked her a lot and I thought it would be fun. The problem was they just took so long to play a slow dance song and I was getting stressed to ask. So I went to the bathroom and wouldnâ€™t you know it when I walk out a slow dance song starts. I keep walking in and the girl literally grabs me by the hand and starts dancing with me. We talk for a little and she said she had a crush on me for a like a while. That was the most magical experience I have ever had it was incredible
