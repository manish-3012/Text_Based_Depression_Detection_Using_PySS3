What kind of teacher thinks it is a good idea to assign a group project during a pandemic? My history teacher wants us to write a newspaper in groups of 3 people each. It has to be a newspaper about the Romans. And in my country there are restrictions at school which means our class is divided in 3 and go to school at different days/times. And my history teacher doens't think it is a smart idea to make groups with people that go to school at the same time. So the only way to communicate is by calling/texting. I HATE GROUP PROJECTS! I find it so annoying that other people are responsible for your grade. I am also an introvert so that doesn't make it a whole lot easier.

Thank you for reading my rant.
