I just survived a suicide attempt I'm not going to say much. I am okay. I think I'm going to be able to actually move on now from my past. I've been through a lot, and I know a lot of you have too. But if I had died today I wouldn't have the closure that I got, mere minutes after my attempt. I am shocked to think that so many people will never know the closure they deserved. So for all those out there, I want you to know that you're going to make it. Keep going, trust me on this. I know it hurts and you're tired. But you never know what tomorrow might have in store for you...
