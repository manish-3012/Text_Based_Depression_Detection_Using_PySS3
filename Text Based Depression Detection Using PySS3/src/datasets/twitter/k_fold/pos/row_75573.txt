Today I cried for the first time in months It felt good, to finally be able to let everything out. Iâ€™ve been holding it in since online school started mid March. I really suggest not doing this if you can help it if not for mental health reasons, than because when youâ€™ve gone this long without properly wetting your eyes it fucking burns when you finally do.
