I have feelings for someone. Okay so recently Iâ€™ve been talking to lots of girls in my fourth block current events class and Iâ€™ve recently developed feelings for one of them. Iâ€™ve never had feelings for a girl before and it felt strange but also very contempt and comforting. I asked her if we could be friends and she said YES! Not only that sheâ€™s also the sister of this one friend of my brother who lives near us so I can always see her and hand out. Whatâ€™s some advice you have for me because I would want to potentially start a friendship and later a relationship with her as an autistic person.
