I told my crush/friend I still like her So Iâ€™ve been friends with her for about a year now and I had liked her for a while I told her she said that she didnâ€™t like me back well then a bunch of shit happened and a couple of months ago she told me to get over her and I did by completely cutting her out of my life but we started hanging out hell I basically went on a date with her last week so I told her thinking this was going to be the end of our friendships but she didnâ€™t get mad was actually kind of caring about told me she doesnâ€™t like me like that I told her I know and she said we can still be friends I just have to keep working on getting over her
