fellow teen who needs to vent. I donâ€™t know where else to add this but Iâ€™m really having a hard time right now so I need to get it off my chest.

In 2008 ( I was 8) my grandmother had a massive stroke that left her right side of her brain and body paralyzed and it changed her life forever. She was never the same. It was like I lost my grandmother when I was eight but she was still there but her mind and soul were gone. It was truly traumatizing and still makes me sick everyday. 

My family has had problems in the past with her spending her money (a lot of money) on things she shouldnâ€™t and has been scammed across the board but she doesnâ€™t know any better. 

Today I was on google and just happened to search her name up and came across the FEC (federal election commission) and her name popped up as of contributitors and I found over 700 donations in her name to â€œwinredâ€ and â€œtrump MAGAâ€ and several others  I havenâ€™t been able to total it all so far but we are up to over $12,000 in donations to donald trump and a little over $11,000 to Mitch mconnell. My grandmother doesnâ€™t have much money as it is. I am truly sick to my stomach. Thereâ€™s nothing that can be done now but sheâ€™s spent thousands and thousand of dollars and she just doesnâ€™t know any better and it sucks. At this point itâ€™s beside the fact itâ€™s to Donald trump (which is bad enough in itself) but itâ€™s the fact that a woman who doesnâ€™t know any better has now spent all of her money on political candidates that she gets no gain out of. This story is more in depth but this is the basis of it and I canâ€™t write anymore because Iâ€™m truly sick to my stomach. Thanks for listening.

Please donâ€™t tell me we need to â€œcut her offâ€ or â€œtake control of her moneyâ€ weâ€™re working on it.
