I think I need a therapist Last night was the worse anxiety attack Iâ€™ve ever had. I couldnâ€™t stand without legs shaking, my hands obviously shaking, sweating but extremely cold and for the first evert time: felt like I was going to puke

I decided then to take a break from Snapchat and Instagram because it was making it worse 

Everything bad to happen in my life happens over social media and Iâ€™ve realised itâ€™s a shit thing

So although Iâ€™m taking a break from stuff to help me, I canâ€™t live like this. I canâ€™t live having 1 in 5 days being so fucking paranoid and worried that I canâ€™t stand, itâ€™s practically self harm if I dont try to fix this 

So I guess Iâ€™m gonna try and convince my mum to let me speak to a therapist. Iâ€™m in the U.K. so Iâ€™m with CAMHS already but theyâ€™re so slow that I feel like by the next time Iâ€™ll see them Iâ€™ll be a shell of my former self 

I just wanted to rant here ig
