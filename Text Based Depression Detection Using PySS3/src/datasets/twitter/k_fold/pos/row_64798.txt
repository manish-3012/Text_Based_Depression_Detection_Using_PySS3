My family are fun of me asking for a counselor/ therapist. I went to the doctor and told them how I was feeling in front of my mother. After we finished my and we got my sister my mother said why did I tell the ask the doctor for a counselor and that only crazy people needed them. After my sister heard that my mother and sister just started to laugh at me. A couple days later they were still making fun of me asking for a therapist. Iâ€™m pretty sure this will be the last time I open up in front of them because this has happened before too.
