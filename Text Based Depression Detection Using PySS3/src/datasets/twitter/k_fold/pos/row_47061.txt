Welp, this is probably my last night on earth. Hi all! You mightâ€™ve seen me comment on your posts every now and then; or perhaps even one of my posts. 

Well, I guess I should get straight to the point and say Iâ€™m probably gonna try to OD tonight. Why am I telling Reddit? I have not a single damn clue why if Iâ€™m going to be honest. 

Even if I survive, Iâ€™m probably going to try again anyway so I see death by my own hand being an eventuality. Just the thought of growing old feels like cringe because of how much I donâ€™t want it. 

I wish I could say I had a positive impact on this world in any way but I canâ€™t even see that as having happened. My dad basically thinks Iâ€™m a burden and my friends probably stopped caring about me months ago. 

Guess thisâ€™ll be goodbye . I hope the world treats you better than it did me.
