Idk if my friend will survive blood cancer My friend had blood cancer since 2 year's and he was fine  until yesterday  he got a fever and his condition got worse. Due to covid 19 he couldn't get the medicines at time for like past 6 months. And he's in the hospital right now and the doctors already said that he'll not survive. Currently he's in the hospital waiting for his death.
