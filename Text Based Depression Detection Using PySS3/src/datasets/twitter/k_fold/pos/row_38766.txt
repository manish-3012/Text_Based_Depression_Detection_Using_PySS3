Why does this happen to me ;-; I wake up, and my pillow is red from blood, idk wtf happened but my nose probably had been bleeding. This happens quite awhile. Idk what it is, or what to do about it, but im sick of waking up changing my bedsheets every single day cuz my nose had been bleeding trough the night. 
Can anyone tell me whats wrong or what to do about it?
