Porn is destroying you This is important, especially for the young men out there who I know are likely addicted to it. Masturbating is a problem. It lowers your natural dopamine levels, and your normal masculine drive. It also has been shown to damage your brains frontal lobe which impairs rational thinking and decision making. Is that temporary pleasure really worth it? Is it worth an imbalance of hormones and increased rate of depression? Is it worth damaging your self confidence? Is it worth the impaired decision making? Is it worth that feeling of disgust you get afterwards? If you answered yes, then I'm afraid you can't be helped. It's no coincidence that your ancestors achieved great things when porn wasn't a thing. Do you really think that the men who charged Normandy would have done so if they had constant access to pornography? We need you to be that strong man that your forefathers were. Do it so further down the line, you can look back on yourself and thank yourself. Do it for your future children or grandchildren. Be a strong person. Conquer your urges.
