Ok guys, I need your help So my friend invited me to a Halloween party, and idk what costume to go in. Since I'm pretty poor and not creative at all, I got no ideas for this thing. I need y'all to come up with a costume idea that a true Redditor would go as. 

i.e. I once saw this meme where a guy was dressed in normal clothes, and was holding a sign that said "anti-nudist protestor". I found that extremely funny ngl.
