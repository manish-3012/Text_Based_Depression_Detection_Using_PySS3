Ending my problem with porn/masturbation #6 (previous updates [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scout_On_Drugs/comments/ko8e51/ending_my_problem_with_porn_and_masturbation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))

Maybe Iâ€™m going crazy, but I think my body is craving less dopamine.

I used to jack off once a day, now itâ€™s once every 2-3 days. Itâ€™s still not my goal (90 days), but Iâ€™m getting better.

One simple trick to stopping is discipline. Make your bed everyday and when you feel like youâ€™re going to relapse, shower for a short period of time with cold water. There are more thing to stopping tho.

Iâ€™m tired rn. Iâ€™m going to sleep. Hope you have a good day/night.
