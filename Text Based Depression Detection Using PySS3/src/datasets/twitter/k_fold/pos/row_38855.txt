What is it with 6th/7th/8th grade boys and video games? So I work at this place, a hangout if you will for teenagers. 

As long as Iâ€™ve worked (or before that been an attendee) here thereâ€™s been some strange obsession with video games for middle school boys. 

They fight over thereâ€™s things. 
My go to is Rock Paper Scissors shoot and when that doesnâ€™t work no one gets it. 

But like, why are they near throwing punches for games that shorten your attention span? 

I really donâ€™t get it. 

Someone please explain?
