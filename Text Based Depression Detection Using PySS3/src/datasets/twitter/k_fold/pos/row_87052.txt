I think I figured out the answer to the problem I've been having. so basically ive been posting alot about my breakup to reddit and how I missed my ex and shit, I thought about it and I realized that I dont miss her, I miss what we had together. so I think most of my issues stem from not having any closure to our relationship. she blocked me, I have no idea why, I wouldnt think that this was obscure but because of some other things it makes me wonder what I did to her. and I never got to say goodbye. I was thinking that i should text her and ask her why and it might help me feel a little bit better.
