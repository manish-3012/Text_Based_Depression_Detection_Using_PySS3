So my friend was in a plane crash. One of my friends was in a plane crash while coming back from Indiana after visiting her brother at Purdue university, her mother and father were with her, her father being a the pilot in a Piper PA-46-310P Malibu, a single reciprocating cylinder propeller engine, one of the cylinders failed leading her father to request an emergency landing at the Farmington regional airport when the entire engine died, the plane slid along instead of putting down the landing gear as the landing gear was rated only for pavement and putting it down would have forced the already damaged nose into the ground. no one was injured, but the prop was shredded, thankfully the wings were undamaged as the wings contained the fuel, so nothing caught fire, I wish I could include a picture but reddit is being a piece of shit and not letting me upload images so I'm going to add a link to a small news article about it.  
In reality I just can't focus right now and want to post something on reddit, and this was interesting
