School is starting soon, and I'm just dreading it... It's around a week until school and I'm just depressed. It's 2:37am. I tried sleeping but couldn't. I just can't stop worrying about school. My parents say if I prepare myself it'll be fine, but it never is. And it really hasn't been since around 5th grade. For about 5 years my social life has just been crumbling and I've slipped further and further into introversion and depressive thoughts as social anxiety grew. I know I shouldn't, but I hate myself for it. I hate myself for being so awkward around people. I hate being at school as it reminds me of how much I am pathetic at social interactions. Three more years of high school is daunting. What's after that... is terrifying. I swear, the only thing keeping me from completely losing my shit is music and reddit. I feel like I just want to give up on everything, but I know I shouldn't. How does one give themselves drive to keep going, have hope where hope is scarce?

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk
