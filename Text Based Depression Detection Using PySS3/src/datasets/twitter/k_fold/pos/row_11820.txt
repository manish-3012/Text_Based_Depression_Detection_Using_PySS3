My genuine fear I mean, what the fuck do I do after high school, I like doing art but I'm dog shit, I know basic woodworking skills but I'm fearing that's not enough to get me out of a shitty dead-end job right out of high school, I'm an average student, and I have no idea what colleges I'm interested in, and I'm Genuinely scared of being stuck in my home town while my cousins and friends move out around me, and I'm stuck living at home working at 711 three blocks away. sorry, you read this. headed into the sophomore year and dreading the future.
