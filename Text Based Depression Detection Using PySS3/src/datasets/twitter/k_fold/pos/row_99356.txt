Ok, who's birthday is also today (oct 14th) and noticed that a lot of people near them have the same birthday?? So i may be overreacting (and if i am, sorry) but i think it's weird. I already knew a friend of mine who's birthday was also today, but today i learned that two of my taekwondo partners also had their birthdays today. Then, an admin at a discord server i'm in said it was his birthday two. Then i saw that an artist i follow also was born today! And then it just got suspicious when the neighbours next door started singing the happy birthday.

Is it weird or am i exagerating?

(Also, sorry if there are spelling mistakes, i'm not an english speaker)
