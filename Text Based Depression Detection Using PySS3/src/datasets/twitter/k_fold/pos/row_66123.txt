Not very funny or important, but I figured out my religion! I have struggled with the thought of other religions for a long time, like a year and a half, and after looking into many different religions I realized I am a atheistic satanist 

Info about the religion: atheistic satanism does not worship satan, we view satan more as a way of being, and we do not believe in religious entityâ€™s, we believe that we are our own gods.

It is against the beliefs of a satanist to hurt animals without good reason. 

The religion was created by Anton Szandor LaVey in the 60s

Donâ€™t call me a sinner or anything please!
