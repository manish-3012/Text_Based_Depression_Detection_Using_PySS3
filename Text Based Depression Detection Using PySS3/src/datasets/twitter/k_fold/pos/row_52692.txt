Does anyone find it annoying when adults donâ€™t take us seriously? I mean they act as if the time we grew up in is terrible with no redeeming qualities yet refuse to know that there was lots of bad things in the 80s and 90s such as the (Cold War, us foreign conflicts in the Middle East, the war on drugs, trickle down economics, etc) and act as if things like cancel culture and people being â€œoverly sensitiveâ€ is somehow unique to these current decades. When people literally tried to cancel things like Rock music and D&amp;D in the 80s and 90s because they were offended by it and saw it as â€œevilâ€ as the â€œsatanic panicâ€ was occurring at this time due to extreme conservatism and the evangelical movement. Do you think this is annoying also?
