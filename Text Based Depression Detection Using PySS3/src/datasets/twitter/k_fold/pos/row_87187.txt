After finally building up the guts to go against my Anti-Vax parents, I am now done with my all immunization shots! https://imgur.com/a/ub676A9

Some of you might have seen me on another post about one of my friends getting his flu shot, but I finally am done (for now) with all of my vaccines!

My parents are pretty strict Catholics who are strongly Anti-Vax. Although it was against my "good Christian morals" as my parents would say, back in about January I built up the guts to go and get my flu shot. This was just the start. I wanted to do what was right for my body, so I got all the immunization shots necessary to keep me confident and healthy. When I was younger I would get the flu just about every year, some years worse than the other. I've even gone to the hospital twice due to the flu! I was so sick and tired(no pun intended) of being fragile and having a weak immune system. After finally turning of age, I did what was best for me.

Today marks a very important day in my life for me. My parents may not be the happiest with me, but I know I did the right thing. And I advise any of you that are worried or hesitant on getting vaccinated to go and do it. Do what will help you become stronger and healthier!
