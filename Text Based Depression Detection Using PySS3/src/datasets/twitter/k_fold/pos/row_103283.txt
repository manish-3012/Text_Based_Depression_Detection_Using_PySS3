so theres something eerily wrong with people here it feels like im the only normal teenager here sometimes because everyone here is either a psychopath, sociopath or depressed. and the psychopaths' are really showing sometimes. there might be a post about pedophiles or murder, or abuse. And without any context some people just wish death, torture, burning, starvation, drowning and other creepy shit I can think of. Hell I even saw a post here saying "I wish that even if he does find the light, it should disappear just before he reaches it" pretty sure it was about a pedophile. things get really crude here
