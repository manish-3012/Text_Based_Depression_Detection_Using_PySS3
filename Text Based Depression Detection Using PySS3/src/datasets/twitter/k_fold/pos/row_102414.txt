This makes me very angry Today, just before my mom and dad went to bed, they told me, each night at 9:30, I have to turn off my phone. Apparently it's "all I do and want to do". What I find stupid, is that that is the point of a *hobby*. And we go to school only every second day, so even if I don't have school, I still have to do it. And they keep saying "just talk to us", when I have no idea what to talk about, because our interests differ so much, we have a different sense of humor and they find my stories boring, and most of the time I'm on my phone is watching YouTube, browsing Reddit, or *intereacting with my friends*, which they seem to be very against. I still try to keep healthy, I go jogging and I don't eat fast food, I make proper meals, I don't know why they're doing this, and of course, If I would tell them all this, it would be labeled as disrespect and make the situation worse. So I'm just really angry and I would like to know, am I in the wrong?
