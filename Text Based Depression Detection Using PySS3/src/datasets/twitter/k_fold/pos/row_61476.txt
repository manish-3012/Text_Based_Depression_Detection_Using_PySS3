Ahaha i might suffocate ahahaha For the last six months i had costicted throat and hard to breathe moments, which are asthma symptoms as i read. But i'm afraid to tell my parents, cuz the doctor will set  coronavirus restrictions on me. I'm really careful with corona anyways, but when the government controls you its real bad. That system in our counrty is really badly done, you have so send pics to police that are taken at home every 30 minutes.. And i'm not a patient so instead of 2 weeks i'll have to do this for the while corona that is who knows when will end. So i choose not to tell and ahaha and i cant get my meds any other way ahahaha help
