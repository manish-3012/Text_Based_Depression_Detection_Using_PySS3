why do people obsess over people so much? iâ€™m not saying this persons obsessed or anything but i dropped them and we were previously close and this was like 2-3 weeks ago and they still seem fixated on it, idk why, i definitely am lonely but i have other people to talk to but they keep talking to people ab how much they miss me and posting on their story about it, i kinda feel bad because i never miss people when i stop talking to them, and i donâ€™t miss this person. this could mean i never cared but im not sure, i could just be better at accepting realities.
