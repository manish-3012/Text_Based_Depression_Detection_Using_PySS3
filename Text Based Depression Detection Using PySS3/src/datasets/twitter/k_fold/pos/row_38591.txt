My online friend has been silent for weeks and I don't know what to do So a while ago (I think it may be almost a year at this point) I started talking with a guy I met on this sub, and we got along pretty well. (I'm a guy too btw so no sexual stuff or anything if you were worried about that) However, now it's been silent since three weeks.

On one hand I feel I should ask if he still want to remain contact, on the other hand there are also people on the internet that deliberately screw with people by pretending to be their friend and such, and get joy out of that or something, and I do not want to walk right into that trap if that's the case (and my brain thinks there is a big chance that's the case because I sorta have trust issues)

So yeah I'm kinda conflicted on what I should do
