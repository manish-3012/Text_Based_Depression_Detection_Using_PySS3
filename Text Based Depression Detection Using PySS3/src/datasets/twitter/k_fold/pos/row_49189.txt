My parents limited my electronic use during break My parents had some meeting/conferance to discuss my behavoir at school, and the school counselor said I shouldnt be playing games so much. When my parent got home they told me that I would be only allowed 3 hours of gaming a day, and would have my time on electronics limited. They also didnt want me to watch YouTube or Reddit. when I heard this I FREAKED. I was so excited for Winter braek and to have it stripped away from me sucked. I screamed at the top of my lungs at her and ran around breaking or hitting everythin I saw. Later I calmed down and decided to play games as much as I want and use Reddit anyways, and my mom found out and told me I was grounded so I replied "im not grounded." However it didntt work. So I got really angry and would just hit pillows and scream a lot. Then I tried begging to my mom to let me game more but she said no. Then I became really sad and cried a lot. BUT NOW IM BACk and I will post on Reddit and play games now :) However break will end in a few days which is bad.. but at least I can game and use Reddit and YouTube!
