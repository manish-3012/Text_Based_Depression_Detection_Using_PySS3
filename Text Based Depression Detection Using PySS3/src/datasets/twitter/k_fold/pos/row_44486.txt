I got a detention for something that's not my fault The dean emailed me saying I got a detention for not competing my service hours, but I submitted them all by the deadline. The person thats supposed to receive and verify them took too long to verify them so now its counted at incomplete. I emailed back saying I submitted them all before the deadline and sent a screenshot of them all submitted. He replied with an email that only says if my hours aren't on time, they're incomplete. 

I guess I'm getting my first ever detention

Update: apparently I have to email the service hour person, but she always takes a few days to respond and the detention is scheduled for tomorrow right after school. So idk what's gonna happen
