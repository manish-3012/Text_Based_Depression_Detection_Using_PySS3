my heart was beating so fast hsgshdydhddhidk so, long story short... my friend and i were just chileing in online class, but then he needed to go to the toilet :'')
And guess what! he changed his name to "i am on toilet" hahahahah and then the teacher asked who is "i am on toilet"? then my friend returned... and then he said his real name xD the whole class laughed andddd then he asked me on chat to change our names in funny things then change it back..Ok i said, bc i couldnt refuse him ðŸ˜Œ and then we started... it was the history hour and we laughed at our names on chat, and then the host ended the meeting, while my name was "your mom".... i forgot to change it before he ended the meeting, cos my name remains saved... i entered the geography hour..  WITH THAT NAME! then the geography asked "who the hecc is your mom" then i realized my name was saved from the history hour... SHOOOOK!ðŸ˜¨ then i changed my name back and the whole class laughed bc they figured out its me... then my friend and i talked on the zoom chat, and then we laughed abt it so everithing turned out fine, eventually, ðŸ˜…
