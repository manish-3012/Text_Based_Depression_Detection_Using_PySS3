My uncle just died My mom just got called a few minutes ago about him dying in the hospital and she just broke down. Iâ€™ve never seen her like that and it just hurt me seeing her like that. I was never close to my uncle since he lived in a different country. Iâ€™m in my room right now and Iâ€™m just crying and just want someone to talk to
