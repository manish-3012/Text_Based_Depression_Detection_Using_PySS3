Sad part of r/teenagers The sad thing about this sub is that it's not a permanent one you can be part of and share stuff, a little while later you leave the sub or don't take part in it because you've outgrown your teenage years and it feels kinda wrong or creepy even to still stay here.

I don't think anyone's looking forward to that time.
It's like a bittersweet ending.
