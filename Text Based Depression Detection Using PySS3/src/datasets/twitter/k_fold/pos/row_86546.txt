I screwed up.... like big time So my first table read/rehearsal for the fall play was yesterday and I missed it.... I was a dumbass and decided to go help my stepmom get stuff for the cat not realizing it was like 3 and my rehearsal was at 4. Well with everything happening I ended up getting home at like 7 and I freaked out and emailed my teacher. Itâ€™s the next morning Iâ€™m freaking out, what if I lose my spot? What if I had a big role in the play and the fact that I wasnâ€™t there she gave it to someone else?? I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna happen and she hasnâ€™t emailed me back yet ðŸ˜”
