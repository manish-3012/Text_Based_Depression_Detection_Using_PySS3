Just got off call with my gf! I love her so much and she is the best person i know. i love everything about her, the way she speaks, the way she laughs, the way she looks, her humour. Itâ€™s all perfect. After we see eachother irl again, life will never get better than this. Knowing the person you love loves you back is an amazing feeling and one that you should cherish.

To all of the people still searching, i wish you luck. know that there is someone out there who will love you for who you are, all you have to do is keep looking. You will find them, you will love, you will be happy.

I wish you all a good day/ night!
