Do yâ€™all have a song with a really deep meaning to you? For me, itâ€™s Nightshift by The Commodores.  
  
That day was the day my driving instructor shouted at me for not having a valid PDL, but he made an exception and let me continue driving anyway. The radio in my car was tuned to my favourite local station (Gold 90.5, in case you were wondering) and song was playing in the car I was using.  
  
But as the lesson went on, I commented about some songs that were played, given that they were all older songs and I liked them too. And my driving instructor grew to see I wasnâ€™t as â€˜unlicensedâ€™ as he initially thought, since I could drive with confidence, though turning on tight bends and stop and go situations need work.
