I just cannot believe guys actually have the AUDACITY to call a girl gross for not shaving like its fucking body hair and it's natural, also whys it only gross on girls? musty shit stains on yo underpants crusty cum stains on yo bed microscopic dick, boners in the bra section of Tescos looking ass id rather fuck Jeffery Epstein's corpse than you, why don't you go take a shower for once rather than call a girl gross for a normal body feature. 

I've hurt so many dudes masculinity just by not shaving my arms, lmao little pussies.
