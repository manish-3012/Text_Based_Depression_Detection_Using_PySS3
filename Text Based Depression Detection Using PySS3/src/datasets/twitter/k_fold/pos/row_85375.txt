Using this sub as a diary part 7 Howdy there parndner! Why don't you take a rest and listen to my cozy beditime story?  


Once upon a time, . . . well actually today, there was a guy. This guy had his first day of school, but what he didn't know . . .  
he was not prepared!  


Neither was everyone else, it was a fucking catastrophe! The servers were constantly down, teachers were way confused, etc.  
So I tried to be productive today, but I wasn't. As simple as that.  


See you tomorrow lads, hope I don't waste another day like this
