If you have to say "I don't have anything against X group but..." then you should absolutely rethink your position. It's equivalent to saying "no offense" to your friend and then telling them they look like absolute trash (in a serious way.)

You're trying to deflect things off of you. You don't want people to realize your take isn't accepting, so you basically say "well you can't be offended because I said no offense."

And usually these thoughts are things that aren't even based on facts. To clear things up:

The LGBT+ community does not want to convert your kids.

The transgender community does not get overly offended when you mess up their pronouns BY ACCIDENT.

Femme- and partially femme-aligned people don't hate all men unless pushed by some sort of trauma.

BLM isn't an organization. Nor is antifa.

I can't think of what else I can comment on, as I would need to be part of that group of people to know. But rest assured, there's more.

You'll find people who are outliers to the statements above. But they aren't representative of their communities, and acting like they are is trying to reduce credibility of other groups.

So if you have to say anything like "I don't hate gay people but they shouldn't make it their lifestyle..." 

...then you need to look at yourself and ask why you need to say "I don't hate this group."

Bye.
