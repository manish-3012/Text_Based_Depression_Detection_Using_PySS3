The junior high and high school are right next to each other So I walk from the junior high (Iâ€™m in 8th grade) to the high school to take a class and no one knew I was from the junior high cause Iâ€™m tall 


They have found out 3 days into school and Iâ€™m scared they will treat me differently 

This is French 2 so itâ€™s not just freshman
