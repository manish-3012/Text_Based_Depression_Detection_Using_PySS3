Please help me I don't know what to do, I'm just here to vent out my anger. I'm sorry if my English is bad. But can you guys please give me advice on what to do with fucking depression. My family is too poor to buy anti depressants or shit. I only have a single hobby that keeps me alive and that's just playing games on my pc but just now i got fuckin scolded by my mom to do a fuckin project that's due for next fucking month. I am just a normal student, our school is shit, we have 5 classes per week, and i only get to play games once every friday night, ONCE EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT! I fuckin hate my parents, i just wish i'd die, the abyss is much more greater than this shithole i live in. I'm not American, i don't have freedom to do anything. I am just a fuckin dude that acts like a fuckin robot so please give me some sort of advice fellow peeps.
