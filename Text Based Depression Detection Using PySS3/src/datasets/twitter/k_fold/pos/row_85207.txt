My unfortunate genetic deformity. .  
.   
.  
my pee pee too small, it sucks and idk what to do about it. Not even that, i just feel insecure, like i know no one could give a shit about me or how i look but i still feel like their are eyes on me. I wanna wear the clothes i want but feel people would judge my style and say its very â€œfeminineâ€ or i donâ€™t look â€œmanlyâ€. Why does this shit happen, my friends donâ€™t experience this. I dont have a six pack, im not ripped, i look pretty good but i feel my body drives girls away, i just want to be loved. my pee pee is pretty small too.
