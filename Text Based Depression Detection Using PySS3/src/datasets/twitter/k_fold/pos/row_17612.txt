Sometimes I am confused I donâ€™t know what emotion Iâ€™m supposed to feel
Am I supposed to be happy? Sad? Anxious?
Or are these feelings all fabricated, just made up?
Iâ€™m not really sure what to say
Maybe my life is great, especially when I see others who are suffering from poverty, and that just makes me feel.. idk
There are times when I think my life is horrible, but other times I feel like thatâ€™s made up as well
Who knows, maybe I am just young and ignorant, Iâ€™m only almost 14 so these emotions shouldnâ€™t be real until I get older?
Again idk
I donâ€™t know
I donâ€™t know
I donâ€™t know
I donâ€™t know.
