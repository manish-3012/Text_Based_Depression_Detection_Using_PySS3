Just made my mum cry and Iâ€™m not sure how or why? Iâ€™ll give a rundown

Pretty much my mum and dad are divorced and weâ€™re starting up school again (sixth form specifically) and therefore me and my brother have different times at school because of different lessons

At my dads house he can drop me off and pick me up pretty much any time and if he canâ€™t, he knows people who can and even if they canâ€™t, I can just bike to school as it isnâ€™t far away

Then at my mums itâ€™s a 30 minute car drive (compared to 10m at my dads), she can only take me 3 days of the week and so Iâ€™d have to get a taxi which is Â£20 (which will add up a lot over time), she has nobody else who can pick me up or drop me off and she has work early so when she can do so, we arrive 2 hours before lessons start and have to wait an hour at the end of the day

I said itâ€™s far easier and more convenient to be at my dads on weekdays and sure, she would only be able to see me on weekends but itâ€™s far less stress for everybody

Then she started crying 

I mean.... did I do something wrong? I canâ€™t fathom why my mum refuses to accept itâ€™s far more convenient to stay at my dads on weekdays

Plus before school I only went to my dads on weekends and he put up with it but now tables could turn and itâ€™s awful? Iâ€™m not sure
