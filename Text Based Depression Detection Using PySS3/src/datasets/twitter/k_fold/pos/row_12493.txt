Got rejected for the last time 
I give up, i like a girl and tried to makea move but she rejected me today. Im 18 sheâ€™s 16. I give up Iâ€™m throwing in the towel calling it quits itâ€™s a wrap for me, itâ€™s done. My destiny has been predetermined and after 7 rejections you have to be real with yourself and face the truth. Itâ€™s done i give up, if you werenâ€™t born a ladies man itâ€™s never gonna happen. Just cope or jump off a bridge thereâ€™s nothing u can do
