I wrote a poem about daydreaming Tagged it as art cause why not. Hope you like it :)



The worst thing about dreaming
Is knowing that these images 
Will never become real. 
Iâ€™ll never go to these destinations 
That I create in my mind. 
Iâ€™ll never meet the people
Who spring up from my brain. 
I can never touch, talk, see, hear
Them in this world. 
In these places of fiction
I am who I want to be
I do what I want to do. 
There are no restrictions
Within the mighty fortress
That is inside my head. 
It is amazing to be able 
To go anywhere I want.
I could fly or breathe underwater
I could swim through land
Or walk on the clouds. 
But not being able
To do any of these things 
Outside my mind
Had to truly be
The worst thing about dreaming.
