Very upset because some guys decided to cheat Now my whole class has to suffer. I did well on that essay, and now Iâ€™m probably suspected of plagiarism because of my stuff looking like the grading sheet he found people copying online. I donâ€™t cheat, I have enough confidence and self-respect to admit when I donâ€™t know something. 

The worst part is now the entire class has to write an essay on why cheating is wrong. Or defend ourselves. I feel no matter what I say it just seems more like I cheated. Then we have to copy the whole grading sheet by hand twice over. That Iâ€™m okay with as I understand the cheaters have to, but I feel itâ€™s unfair for me and the other students who didnâ€™t cheat
