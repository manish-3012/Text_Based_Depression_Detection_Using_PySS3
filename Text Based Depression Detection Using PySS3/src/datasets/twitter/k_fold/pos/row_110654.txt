Girl sends me this snap, how do I respond with humor / in a way to keep the convo going? This girl Iâ€™ve been talking to snapped me a video of her hugging her dog with the caption â€œhe growls whenever I try to hug himâ€. I have no idea how to respond. How can I respond funnily or in a way that keeps the conversation going on her side as well (wants to make her keep talking)?
