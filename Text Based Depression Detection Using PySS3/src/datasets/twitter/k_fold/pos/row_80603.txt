Guess the â€œsongâ€ by the lyrics and even if you donâ€™t know it just guess, itâ€™s not really a song but more cry for help the guy made and published it as a song I dream so much
And I just can't seem to find an answer
To what I'm living for, in general
I can't keep living like this
It's breaking my heart, day by day
I mean, who's to say...
Who's to say you find an answer when there isn't?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a dream?
What if we live for no reason?
What if you just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplations
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please, save me
