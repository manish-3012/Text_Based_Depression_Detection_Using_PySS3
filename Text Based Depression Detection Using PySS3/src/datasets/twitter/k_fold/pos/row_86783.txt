Iâ€™m just now realizing how easy it is to take advantage of teenagers, especially males. Because teens are so easily influenced and have a need to be better or stay with trends, they will listen to people and what they say, even if it goes against some of their beliefs. With guys, they can be taken advantage of from girls who pretend to be interested in the guys. They make the guys buy them things and treat them with good times and nice things, and when they get what they want they â€œdumpâ€ them and say â€œhaha it was a joke lol.â€ Girls who do that are actual bad people. They take advantage of guys to get what they want. I know someone like that, and she always tries to make herself the victim. She gets away with it every time.
