Learning about basketball My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months now, we're doing great and we love to share our special interests and things we're passionate about, and he really really likes basketball, he likes to play, he likes to watch games on TV and he loves to talk about it. Thing is: I don't even know the rules or anything about it except a few players' names and famous teams, and I'll like to learn more about it. I just don't know where to start and how I should approach it, I'd love to talk about it with him and understand when he's telling me about amazing moves and other things I just don't get right now. 

Do y'all have any ideas of how and where I should start?
