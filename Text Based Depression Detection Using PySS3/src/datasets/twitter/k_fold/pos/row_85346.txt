It honestly doesn't matter if I k.ill myself today I'm just fucking bored and confused with everything so it doesn't really matter. 

The only fucking place I can vent all the stuff going on in my head is this sub and nobody doesn't give a shit unless I post some dumb post about suicide then I'll make it to the front page.

Then people will drop random comments like "Don't kill yourself. We care" and then there will be the guy who drops suicide hotline numbers that doesn't fucking help. 

I feel like I'm slowly going mentally insane and I'm slowly becoming more and more detached from reality and I know nobody fucking gives a damn until I make a post about killing myself.

No I won't kill myself. At least today. I just wish someone will actually listen to me talk because everyone in my family doesn't want to hear me talk, and apparently I have no friends because I can't make them and I tried. For one whole year and everyone is from the same middle school and grouped up together and nobody wants to talk to a boring creepy kid who won't shut up about Star Trek and science fiction
