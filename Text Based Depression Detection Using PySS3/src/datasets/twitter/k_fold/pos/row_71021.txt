what my friend left behind I need help, my friend Moon committed suicide. Honestly if anything destroyed me it's that. She had so much going for her, she was amazing. She had a boyfriend who loved her more than anything in the world. That's where this all starts.

Moon left her boyfriend behind, but her boyfriend I want to help him. I don't know how, I feel awful for him. Her boyfriend, Zach is trans (FTM). A few weeks ago she came to me panicking because Zach told her that he had been raped by an ex. He had said there was a chance he was pregnant. 

Moon doesn't know, she never got the chance to know. Zach really is pregnant. He's already dealing with major dysphoria &amp; terrified because he's 16 and his parents already aren't accepting of his gender identity. He doesn't think his mom will let him get an abortion &amp; that they'll hold it against him. Zach told me that if he was going to ever have kids he would want to raise them with Moon. 

But she's gone, now we're lost. I don't know what to do or how to help him. I want to help Zach but I don't want to make things worse for him. We're both grieving and things are even more difficult than ever for him. 

What do I do? How do I help him? He may not be my friend but they meant a lot to each other. I already failed being there for Moon, I need to be there for Zach too. Help.
