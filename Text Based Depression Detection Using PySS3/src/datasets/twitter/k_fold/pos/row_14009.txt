If Jurrasic Park was real most Dino's would not hunt humans There are 3 things sugestiong this:

Humans did not exist when the Dino's were alive, so there  is no way they would be part of their diet and so they would not see us as food.

We are not a good food source for big animals, we have too much bone and too low fat. Overall we aren't worthwhile for most predator nowadays, so even if a Dino ate a Dino it is unlikely that it would like is as prey

The Dinos are genetically altered, beeing way more lizard like than dinosaurian, so if they went this far to modify them, why would they make all of them docile? This is something that genetical engenders do this all day to make food more productive, so I don't know why wouldn't they do it for the dinos
