I really need help So my gf has been mentally abusing me for a solid 6 days now and I both want to end the relationship and donâ€™t at the same time. All of my friends are trying to help me end it but she wonâ€™t talk to me at all so Iâ€™m not sure if I should end it over text or not, can Reddit help?
