What do you do when hanging out with friends? Hey dudes and dudettes,

Quick Question: What do you guys do when you're hanging out with friends?

All we ever do is watch Netflix and do stuff on our phones and I'm fucking sick of it. The weather is shit so going out isn't really an option either and everything is closed down due to Corona. I feel like there's nothing more to do with friends so what do you guys do when hanging out with a friend?
