I just fought a 2 hour battle against the fattest shit So me and my bois went out shooting and I forgot to go before we left. As we get there a sudden diarrhea hits me and I quickly realized that I was in for a battle. No gas station for 45 minutes and nothing to wipe my ass with us. We shot for about an hour. The whole time Iâ€™m fighting this monster shit, thinking this is the moment I die. This is my end. After an hour of fighting to hold in diarrhea we left and hauled ass to a gas station. It was there I sprinted inside to the bathroom. Undoing my zipper and button to my shorts while running up the gas station. Running through the door and into the bathroom with my shorts already half way down. The instance my ass touched the seat it became an afgan warzone. I thought it would never. Like and aerial bombing of the toilet. After 15 minutes it stopped. I waited another 5 to see if there would be a round 2. But alas it was over. My triumph in the battle of the toughest shit was legendary.
