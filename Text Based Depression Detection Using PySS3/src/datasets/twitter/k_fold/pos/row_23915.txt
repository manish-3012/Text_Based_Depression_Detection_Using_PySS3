Quarantine is hitting way too hard and I just want it to end I have lost all concept of time. I sleep when I am tired, there is no schedule. I don't do anything I used to enjoy anymore, I just sit there. I eat a lot of food, not because I'm hungry, not because it tastes good, but just because it passes the time. I see the rest of my life as an obstacle I must just get through until I reach the end. I'm still in school but I'm not doing any of it. The meds aren't helping, every new one I try is slightly better but nowhere near enough. I'm convinced it might just all be placebo and none of it works for me. I used to do so much, I used to play tuba, I would code programs, I would play games I would make songs I would solve math equations and I would research history. Now all I do is sit there watching YouTube and Porn. I have no life anymore. Most of the thinking I do is fantasizing about girls that don't actually exist. I have so many bad habits I want to break but I just can't fight them. It's too much. It feels like I'm stuck just tied up in a ton of metal chains while everyone I know is just expecting me to break out. I wish I wasn't so good at pretending to be happy so I would slip up and get help from a close friend. I'm not strong enough to actually reach out for help. I'm lost in this whole thing and nothing makes me happy anymore. I want things to go back to the way they were.
