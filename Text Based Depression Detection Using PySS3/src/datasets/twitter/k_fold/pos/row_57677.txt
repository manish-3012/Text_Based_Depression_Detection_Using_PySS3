itâ€™s almost been a year, what should i do itâ€™s almost been a year since me and my gf broke up, it was on mutual terms and we decided to make ourselves better bc we both were at a rocky state mentally. we havenâ€™t spoke a word to each other over text or at school, i was thinking about rekindling our relationship bc this has been one of the hardest years of my life and rlly need someone or something to you know, feel a bit better. itâ€™s obvious i miss her a lot but i donâ€™t know if she feels the same way, sheâ€™s the only girl iâ€™ve ever given my everything for and i donâ€™t know as if iâ€™m ready to move on with my life without her. any advice is great, thank you
