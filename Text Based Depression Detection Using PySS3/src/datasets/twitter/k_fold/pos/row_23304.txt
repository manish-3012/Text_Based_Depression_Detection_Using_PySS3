I have a question for my fellow teenagers Ok so, my teacher in online class was asking us to talk but she couldnâ€™t here us, so some people start making weird noises and laughing cause she canâ€™t hear us. I play that sad flute meme song thatâ€™s like played really bad as a joke you know, but then everyone screams virgin alert. Iâ€™m confused, what does that mean? I know what virgin means that just confused why they said that.
