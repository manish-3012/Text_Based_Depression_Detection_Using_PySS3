Just found out school is stopping me to dream. I sleep everyday at 10:30pm and i have to wake up at 5:45am to get to the bus 40mins later. So basically, when i wake up i did not dream.

But in France, it's "winter Break" now for 2 weeks for me, and yesterday i slept at 11pm, woke up at 9am, and i dreamed ! This did not happen since Christmas!

Even if my dreams are really freaking weird tho.
