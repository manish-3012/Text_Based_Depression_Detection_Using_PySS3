I just got asked out. We're dating. Guy has a friend that thirsts over him, but my partner wont' do anything about it. What do i do? Hello people of reddit, I'm a 14 year old trans female and I got asked out yesterday. We started dating, but he has a best friend that completely thirsts over him, but my boyfriend won't do anything about it, and he definitely didn't set any boundaries. I don't want to break up with him, but I'm not comfortable with the fact that he is okay with his best friend having an open crush on him. What do i do in this situation?
