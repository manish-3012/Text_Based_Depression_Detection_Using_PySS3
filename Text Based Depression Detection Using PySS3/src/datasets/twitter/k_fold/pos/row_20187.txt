I made a post to PewDiePies subreddits, it has 13k and lots of awards. But in the post Iâ€™m self promoting and open share that I wasted $300 making a tambourine tower. Should I give up a second of internet fame and delete my post? Option 1: be on LWIAY (a PewDiePie video)    

Option 2: delete cringe post, keep my dignity, sell tambourines to charity   I havenâ€™t told anyone, Iâ€™m really unsure of what to do  

I could just keep making my tambourine tower taller but I donâ€™t know if I wanna be the guy who wasted $300   Any suggestions would be helpful :D
