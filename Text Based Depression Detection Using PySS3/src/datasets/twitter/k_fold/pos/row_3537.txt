I want to drop school I feel to tired, depressed and guilty for going to school. I have always been the one who had good marks, but now I can't concentrate on anything and I feel useless. 

I just want to stay at bad all the day, cry, and stay on therapy until when I get better.

I don't have words to express my pain, why won't anyone listen to me, I can't stand any of this anymore it's just too much
