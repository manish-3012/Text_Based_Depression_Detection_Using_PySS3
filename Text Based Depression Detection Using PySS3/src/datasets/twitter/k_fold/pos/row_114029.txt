What are simple things to follow or to do to improve my fashion sense and what I wear. For as long as I can remember I just always wear t-shirt and blain blue jeans with the same pair of shoes until I grow out of the shoes which then get replaced.
This has gotten boring to me but I have no clue how to change what I wear and look a bit more decent then I do.
So anyone got any tips or advice to help me out?
TIA
