Presentation topic I have been thinking for months and I can't come up with a topic for my presentation in English class. Does anyone have an idea?

It must be about something in the English-speaking world, so for example UK, US, Australia or New Zealand. I have to talk for 10 minutes. I figured some people with more knowledge of things happening in those countries might know something interesting to talk about.

Things classmates talked about for reference:

-NASA

-Disappearance of Madeleine McCann 

-Civil War

-American elections

-Manchester United

-Some serial killer in the 80ies
