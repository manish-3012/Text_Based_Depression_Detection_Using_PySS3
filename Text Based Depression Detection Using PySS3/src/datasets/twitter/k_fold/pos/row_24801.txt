I Want To Kill Myself So Badly But I Can't... If you wanna know why I want to kill myself, check my previous posts. I can't live with myself, I will never be able to forgive myself. All I want is to stop existing. I honestly don't think I can come back from this. I fucking ruined my own goddamn life, I will never be happy again. I just want it to stop. I feel like such a piece of shit. Please just fucking make it stop. Can someone please just shoot me in the fucking skull. I can't do it myself. There are so many people that love me and care about me and knowing that hurts so much. I can't kill myself because of them, so I'm just doomed to suffer.
