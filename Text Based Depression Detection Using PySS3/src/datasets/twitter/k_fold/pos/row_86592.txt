I'm 28M and teach physics at a university. Today I had an 18 year old woman hit on me really hard, continuously, for a 3 hour class (I am the lab supervisor). Teenage women of reddit, how can I politely shut you down? If I raise it as an issue formally I'll likely be transferred to supervise a different lab session, and I don't want to lose this teaching timeslot.

I know how to shut a woman my age down, not one 10 years younger who I am in a position of authority over (I mark her exams etc).

[Also AMA a random 28 year old dude I guess.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/98k05_bM2e4/maxresdefault.jpg)
