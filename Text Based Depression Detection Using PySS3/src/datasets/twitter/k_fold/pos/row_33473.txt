Today was a weird day. Gave me strange vibes i saw a feral mom and her curious kitten. I last saw her a while ago. I had brought some food for another kitten but she wasnt there so I gave it to the feral cats. Today was bascially a recap of a very old previous time...ðŸ˜¨ Even the same kitten went missing and later found near sunset like before!! sorry idk how to describe these weird vibes...I could predict almost everything happening outside..
