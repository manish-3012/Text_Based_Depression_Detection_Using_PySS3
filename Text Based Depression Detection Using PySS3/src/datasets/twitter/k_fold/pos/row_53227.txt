Fashion advice Hey everyone 
Iâ€™m 16 and i wear sportswear and a single coat constantly and iâ€™m kinda bored of it. I wanna change stuff up but iâ€™ve no idea. 6â€3 very lean so idk where to go. Iâ€™m looking to start with small stuff and work my way up. Already have a few graphic tees etc. Thanks to anyone whoâ€™s read all of this and helps :-)
