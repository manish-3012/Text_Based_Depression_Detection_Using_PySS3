Am I a bad freind? I am in Highschool, and since 1st grade, Me and a friend, who I will refer to as F, have been two peas in a pod. We had such different personalities but we fit together really well. We were together so often that people started mistaking us for siblings.

But sometimes he gets hurt while we play. In 6th grade he came to my house and we played fake boxing in my backyard, and he dodged one of my punches and spun around and hit himself on a tree face first. I feel like it was my fault and I should have warned him about it. He gets hurt a lot whenever we play games together, but the weird thing is that I never hurt myself whenever we play games. I Apologize every time I hurt him, but I overreact sometimes when he hurts me. Like when he accidentally shot me in my eye with a nerf gun. I started yelling at him. I feel like Iâ€™ve been a bad friend, but he says Iâ€™m a great friend. Who do I trust? Him or myself? Am I a bad friend?
