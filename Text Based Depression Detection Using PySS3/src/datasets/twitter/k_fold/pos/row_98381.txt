I fucking masturbated to the final fantasy XIII coverart Umm I was bored recently and all my friends were busy so I decided to tidy up my room and throw away/donate my old childhood things. I used to own a ps3 back in the day with many awesome games like lego star wars, uncharted 3 and final fantasy XIII. I felt the nostalgia when I looked at the various coverarts and then I came across my old final fantasy XIII game. The coverart is basically the main character named lightning holding her swoard and just standing in front of a white background. Nothing special about that. But she was my first crush and idk... I wanted to replay the game so badly but my ps3 got broken a long time ago. I was just sitting there, holding the game in my hand and got incredibly horny. So I just took it with me in the shower and wanked my yeehaw to the coverart and using parts of my imagination (Iâ€˜m not good at rubbing my love stick with my imagination) and fucking busted nono sauce all over the place. Anyway I feel bad that it just took a single coverart of a game to trigger that in me. Have a good day
