Why so many people not ironing their shirts Like I iron my shirt every day before school, And I notice so many people have wrinkly ass shirts. Itâ€™s became something I always notice and probably my favorite insult, it doesnâ€™t matter what you just said to me I just pointed out yo wrinkly shirt like how are you coming to school with your shirt looking like that.
