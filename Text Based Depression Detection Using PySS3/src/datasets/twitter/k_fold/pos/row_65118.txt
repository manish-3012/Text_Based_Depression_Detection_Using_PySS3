is bus driver the perfect job? - all you do is sit on your ass all day long and drive automatic (easy job)

- you meet new people every day, you might get lucky and female sits next to you and start talking to you and you get a gf/fwb

- good payment

- don't need education

- big window and nice view

- feels relaxing driving when it's dark

- feel like a boss (you are in charge of big vehicle with passengers)

- if you feel there is no hope and you want to end it, it's easy to commit kamikaze / 9/11 / suicide-murder by driving off a mountain and killing yourself + all your passengers

gonna try and become a bus driver tbh. seems like a nice job

#IN FACT, IT SEEMS LIKE THE PERFECT JOB
