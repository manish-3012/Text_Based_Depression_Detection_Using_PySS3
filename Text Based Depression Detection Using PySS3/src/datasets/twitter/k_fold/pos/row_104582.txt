Anyone else getting into the early days of hip hop?  I bring this up because a lot of people seem to just bring up 90's or 00's when they talk about hip-hop, but I have a big soft spot for 80's hip hop. Especially for the late 70's and early 80's period.

It feels really primitive compared to the other periods of hip hop, but something about the energy a lot of these songs (or live performances, they're arguably even better) brings out a different vibe than a lot of later hip-hop. It feels really communal, kind of having the vibe of just goofing off with your friends and having a good time rather than the cold tone I usually hear in hip hop.

The amount of experimentation that happens in this time is also really fascinating to hear, whether they're a live band recreating a sample, making something completely original, or using synths and drum machines.

Groups like the Treacherous Three, Cold Crush 4, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and others have a lot of really underrated tracks in my opinion.

However, like I said, something interesting I realized about this era is the difference from regular songs from these artists, to their live shows. While there is a lot of great early hip-hop tracks (ex. Beat Street Breakdown, The Message of course, feel the heartbeat, spoonin rap), a lot of them are also really dated and don't hold up well. They often feel stilted and awkward, which sometimes carries over even with the best rappers in this time.

For example, does something like Punk Rock Rap ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfG4pzLK6rw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfG4pzLK6rw)) really compare to the energy that Cold Crush 4 gives out less than a year earlier ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTjA9zapLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTjA9zapLc) )? or the rappin and rocking the house song compared to this performance of it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw10bdA-HTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw10bdA-HTQ)

I think part of this could be that most of early hip-hop is less "songs" as much as they are party jams. People into traditional song structures rather than a series of brag raps, they're not really for you. But once you get past that, you'll have a good time.

The connected evolution of hip-hop with electro is also pretty nice to hear. Artists like Africa Bambaataa, The art of noise, and Mantronik were combining elements of hip hop with electronic music. Go check out their work also.

All in all, I think it's a really fascinating phase of hip-hop not talked about as much as it should be. If there's any other great artists I could know about from the early days, I would really appreciate it.
