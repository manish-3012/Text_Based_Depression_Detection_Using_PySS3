You know how itâ€™s common practice to brush your teeth before going to the dentist? How is there so many people that donâ€™t wash their hair before getting it cut? Iâ€™m posting this here because it definitely applies to teenagers most. Think teens having bad hygiene is just a myth? Just take look at their hair. ;-;

And we (me as a part-time student employee especially), in contrast to dentists definitely do not get paid enough to put up with that gross shit.

Also, your haircut will turn out a lot better if you take care of your hair in general or at least wash it beforehand. What do you expect us to do with an actual tumbleweed on your head? Hairdressers spend a lot of time in training and mostly take their jobs extremely seriously, so if your haircut turns out absolute ass, youâ€™re either really unlucky or need to take care of it more. 

In conclusion, please wash your hair before going to get it cut and make sure itâ€™s not too gross. Otherwise youâ€™ll hate the result as much as we do the process, also, if youâ€™re one of the people that take basic care of their hair, I literally love you to death. Thank you.
