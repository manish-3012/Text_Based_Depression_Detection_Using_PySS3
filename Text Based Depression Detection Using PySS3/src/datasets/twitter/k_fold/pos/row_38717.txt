Why tf are my parents so fucking business minded/money minded/greedy I recently got followed by James Bruton on Instagram and it felt so good. He's my idol. If you dont know who he is he used to make those ironman cosplays and a robotic alien costume in the early days of YouTube, been a fan of him since i was around 9. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/user/jamesbruton) . He saw one of my robotics projects i do for fun and liked and followed. 

So i told my mum and she said, "keep posting what he likes, he might pay you one day to help him". Oh i see how it is its about money, not the fact i got followed by one of my childhood inspirations and idols.

Some months ago I was talking about how I'm learning more about robotics and how fun it is while on the way home in a car and my mom said, " you could sell lessons you know" i barely know shit and only started last year June. So I replied "I feel like if I get a child one day you'll find a way to earn money from it" and she replied in full seriousness "you could rent your child out to people who have recently lost a child or people who want to practice babysitting"

Then in November last year I learned how to make balloon animals cus someone called me a clown on Instagram and I just wanted to be an ass. When i made the balloons I brought them out of my room to throw them away cus I'm done with that post then my mom asked when I learned to make them and i said i learned recently for a dare in class or something obscure like that. Then she said I could work for birthday parties and make balloons for kids. I began to make balloons at my cousins birthday parties and I'm known as the "balloon abang" (abang is older brother in malay).  


Then a long ass time ago I used to make lil Lego animations but nothing really came out of it. My channel kinda blew up during November and December last year out of nowhere but that's besides the point. My mom asked me to make an animation for a holiday(hari raya) for advertising for her business so I did and I got paid $50 cus the animations were kinda good but that was back in 2019. Then she said I could be an online artist to make animations but I have not time for that, there's a reason I stopped and it was school.

 So in 2020 she wanted me to make another animation(she asked about a week in advance) and I said I couldn't cus it was my exam week but she persisted. Every day until the due date she asked me to make it, now she keeps taunting me saying that I don't care about her and her business.   


Im good at claw machines ( [December wins](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/km8y2u/my_claw_machine_winsagain_i_forgot_to_add_one_toy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [November wins](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/k87nz9/my_claw_machine_wins_from_novembersorry_i_didnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3))  and win a bunch of toys at a time and give them to my friends cus my room gets full of them and I just play for fun. My mom said "you could sell those online" and I fucken had it I said "why does everything I do for fun have to make money to you? Cant I just have fun without making it monetized?" and she deadass said "If you're good at it make money from it, don't have that attitude with me"
