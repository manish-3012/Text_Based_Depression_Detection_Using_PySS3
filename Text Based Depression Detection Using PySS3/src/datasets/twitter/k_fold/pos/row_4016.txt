Honestly, you guys make me proud. Listen, Iâ€™m not a teenager, Iâ€™m an avocado toast loving piece of shit millennial. 33, Iâ€™m a mom, my kiddo is 10. Donâ€™t know how I ended up looking at memes and stuff in here. But alas here I am. Your generation is so much more accepting, and wholesome than the ones before you. Iâ€™m SUPER proud of you all. I know itâ€™s hard sometimes...I remember. But you humans, Youâ€™re alright. Keep it up.
