Top tier list of people .. I miss talking to like ever:

* My former best internet friend, who stopped talking to me for unknown reasons.
* My ex, who stopped talking to me because of her insecure bf.
* The children in my basement. May they rest in pieces.

.. I don't know but had an amazing encounter with:

* That one wholesome person who I met on the train when I first went to visit my ex.
* Someone who had to look over me at a hospital who gave me a memorable piece of life advice.
* A very friendly person I met on a train station, with whom I talked about something important to both of us and hugged goodbye.

.. I look up to:

* Abigail Thorn (Philosophy Tube)
* Niall Comas (Pyrocynical)

.. I appreciate:

* The friend I meet up with irregularly, who I can be open with, without being judged and who is on the same wavelength in many ways.
* My brother, who shares a similar absurdist humor, helped me become more critical of what certain people said and with whom I have the most interesting talks with.
* My friend who does the same education who makes me feel less alone in the struggles we have in our education, who listened to my problems when I needed it the most and who generally is nice and fun to talk with.
* My former best internet friend before the one I mentioned who I met irl once, who was there for me, interesting, on the same wavelength and an amazing person. We kinda fell out of touch though but that's alright.

Can recommend making such a list when you feel empty af.
