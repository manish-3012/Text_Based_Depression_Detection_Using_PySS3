Study shows that too much hw is harmful. Spread the word. A Stanford researcher found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance and even alienation from society. More than two hours of homework a night may be counterproductive, according to the study.


Pope and her colleagues found that too much homework can diminish its effectiveness and even be counterproductive. They cite prior research indicating that homework benefits plateau at about two hours per night, and that 90 minutes to two and a half hours is optimal for high school.


Their study found that too much homework is associated with:


â€¢ Greater stress: 56 percent of the students considered homework a primary source of stress, according to the survey data. Forty-three percent viewed tests as a primary stressor, while 33 percent put the pressure to get good grades in that category. Less than 1 percent of the students said homework was not a stressor.


â€¢ Reductions in health: In their open-ended answers, many students said their homework load led to sleep deprivation and other health problems. The researchers asked students whether they experienced health issues such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss and stomach problems.


â€¢ Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits: Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were â€œnot meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,â€ according to the researchers. Students were more likely to drop activities, not see friends or family, and not pursue hobbies they enjoy.




The results offer empirical evidence that many students struggle to find balance between homework, extracurricular activities and social time, the researchers said. Many students felt forced or obligated to choose homework over developing other talents or skills.


Also, there was no relationship between the time spent on homework and how much the student enjoyed it. The research quoted students as saying they often do homework they see as â€œpointlessâ€ or â€œmindlessâ€ in order to keep their grades up.


â€œThis kind of busy work, by its very nature, discourages learning and instead promotes doing homework simply to get points,â€ Pope said.



She said the research calls into question the value of assigning large amounts of homework in high-performing schools. Homework should not be simply assigned as a routine practice, she said.


â€œRather, any homework assigned should have a purpose and benefit, and it should be designed to cultivate learning and development,â€ wrote Pope.



TL;DR : study shows that over 2 hours of hw can negatively effect student. Hw should only be assigned to benefit the students and  should not be assigned as a regular practice. Too much hw can lead students to become sleep deprived, isolated, and stressed.
