subtle ways to rebel? Hey teens.  Just found out my parents are going to a trump rally tonight.  They know I'm bi (well, they ignore it, but they know, and I'm not showy about it) and I've always been pretty... docile.  I'm looking for little ways to be rebellious.  Nothing that would get me kicked out or get my phone taken away, but just some things that would piss them off.  anyone have any ideas? peace, love, and FDT &lt;3
