I ordered something off of eBay and it got delayed, nothing too out of the ordinary right? Well its in Oak Creek, which apparently is the worst usps facility or something. 2.2 stars and they haven't been able to get anyone there packages in decent time. People who payed for premium 2 day shipping have said it's taken over 11 days to get their packages. So uh, woo ðŸ˜”
