Sigh I hate peoples who pretend to have every mental disorder known Some girl and her friend along with 3 boys where walking on the track and pretty much play fighting both verbally and light playful fighting. I kinda know her but I asked what was happening because it was a shit show where they where walking. She said she was trying to tell the boys (she barley knows them) that she has ADD, ADHD, OCD, and Anxiety. Know I donâ€™t know how her Brain works, but I know itâ€™s isnâ€™t possible to have both ADD and ADHD, and know itâ€™s only known as ADHD and then what Type of it you have, itâ€™s possible to have that and OCD, and anxiety, but I called her out that they where basically the same thing and she was like oh really and all surprised then she started fishing for the oh Iâ€™m so dumb I donâ€™t know I didnâ€™t know that. I asked her if she really did and she was quick to say yeah but I donâ€™t think she does. Itâ€™s a pretty long list tbh, and most people I know with actual disorders donâ€™t constantly, actively mention it since we usually arenâ€™t looking for attention. I just really dislike when people do this because they ruin the social environment for people who actually do.
