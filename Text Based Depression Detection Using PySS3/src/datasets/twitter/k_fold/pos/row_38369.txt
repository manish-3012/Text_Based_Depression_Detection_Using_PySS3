Ladies and gentlemen, thank me. We're using Discord for school!!! Right. I know not one person cares but man oh man is it a big thing for my classmates.

In case you didn't know, there's an ittle bittle thing called Corona virus going around. Since we need to do online learning, the teachers are looking for an alternative to Zoom (y'all probably know what that is) becausein my school no one is gonna spend a dime on school unless its food. So me and another 2 friends, after many battles with various teachers, managed to convince one to at least try Discord.

Guess what we'll be using now?

Also what are you using for school?
