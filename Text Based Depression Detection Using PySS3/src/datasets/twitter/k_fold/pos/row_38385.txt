Will you have bags under your eyes if you sleep badly? I woke up and my entire body was just in so much pain... I swear that I must have slept funny. I've been making an effort to stay hydrated and haven't cried in a few days, but I still feel terrible and have bags under my eyes. Will they go away if I get good sleep tonight?
