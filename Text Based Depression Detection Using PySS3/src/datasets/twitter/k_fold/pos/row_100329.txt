People fucking suck I, a 15 year old human male, am known around my school for being a school shooter. Funny thing is: *that never happened.* I don't even own a firearm. I have never THREATENED to shoot up my school. The thought of doing that has never crossed my mind. It started ariund 7th grade, and I'm currently in 10th. The closest thing to a shooting threat is threatening to boil someone's teeth.
Rant over.
