I've just dumped someone out of the pure fear of bonding..... Hey y'all
I have a problem wich would be, that this one girl told me today that she loves me and out of the pure fear of bonding to someone i just dumped her... I dont even know why i did it, especially because i liked her alot too, but i kinda just did. I tried to tell her gently but y'all probably know how that turns out most of the time.

Now i kinda feel like an a-hole... Does anyone have some advice on how i could handle this situation?
