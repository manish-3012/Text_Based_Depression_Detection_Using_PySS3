i need help lol. i made a post like this a week ago but i got very mixed opinions so i want some fresh ones so iâ€™m doing it again. 
so basically i have a crush on my friend (he follows my reddit and r/teenagers said my throwaway didnâ€™t have enough karma so iâ€™m deleting this soon &gt;:(   ) and weâ€™re like really good freinds and back in february i told him i liked him and he was like â€œokâ€ idk if he liked me back. anyway i still like him and want to tell him except if i tell him i dont want to make it weird or ruin our friendship cause itâ€™s really special. BUT on the other hand it could actually go really well. what do you think?
