I'm autistic and hate that it's such a joke? Among other things 'Haha I'm so autistic'
'I have crippling depression'
'That's gay!'

ALL of these things piss me off, honestly.

Depression is a mental disorder, my sister has it and it's NO joke

Calling someone gay as an insult is the most stupid thing. Genuinely can't understand the thought process behind it

But the main thing I'm talking about is autism. I remember this kid in my art class who used to yell out shit like 'i'm not artistic i'm autistic' thinking he was so clever.

That wouldn't be an issue except he was NUEROTYPICAL! It's a blatant lie! Yeah, I'm taking it literally, it's only a joke, etc

But keep in mind that if you joke about this stuff, these real things, even if you meant nothing from it, it's still a cheap laugh that really isn't even funny and someone could be hurt by it

Hate to be "that guy," but9 really, don't say this kind of shit, it's downright ignorant.

Thanks for reading, hope someone who actually says these things read it and you realize? How annoying it is?
