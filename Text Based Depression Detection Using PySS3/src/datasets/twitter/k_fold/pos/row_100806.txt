I saw the weirdest dream ever.. I'm not gonna tell the whole story because it would be way too long so here is short version of it.

My cousin hits me and I lose my tooth then I go back inside this haunted house we were staying and I find out my brothers are possessed then I run outside and see a car meet on the other side of the field but the field is on fire anyway I run through it to the car meet and now suddenly I have two friends with me, we are trying to steal a car and suddenly there are zombies every where, then suddenly I teleport in the future where me and the bois are wearing military gear and we are shooting those zombies and are trying to get to this one house and this flying frog with superpowers is helping us and he says that if we get to this one house we can stop this outbreak so then after shooting lot of zombies me and the bois run there while holding our hands together, then when we are at this house the flying frog turns out to be my old friend and then he gives me infinity gauntlet and I snap my fingers and zombies are gone, then we start heading back to the car meet area and then suddenly my cousin who hit me teleports to me and we leave the group to find my two brothers if they are still alive.

I left a lot out from my dream because otherwise it would been ten times longer than this text. Like at one point there was this hillbilly that did animal noises...
