Went to Little Caesars and a guy opened a bag of cheese with his mouth and then the lady at the counter lied about it. No idea where else to put this so here you go:
We went to Little Caesars and there was a guy in the back without a mask and he opened a bag of cheese with his mouth. We told the lady at the desk and she starts lying and saying she doesn't know who he is and the manager was her mother so she couldn't give the number of the manager.

I honestly love the place and unfortunately have no picture proof but I just needed to rant about how stupid it was.
