What do I do if I'm a social outcast? I get picked in by many people at school and I don't know why. I'm always stepped on and treated like garbage. When me and my friends entered a bike shed today, someone said "The R***arded gang are here. I'm prone to name calling and people walking up to me saying "they want to be my friend" when I can hear the irony in their voices. After all that... Any tips, reddit?
