Math question: I was watching Rick and Morty and as you know in rick and morty there is an infinite number of universes and infinite number of possibilities and i got thinking... is half of infinity still infinity? If so then why in the end of rick potion number 9 rick says they can't switch realities much?
Because if there IS an infinite number of realities then there should be infinite number of realities where rick fixed everything. So what is the limit? 





I love science.... but I'm way too much of a moron. Smh
