to the deaf people on this sub i have this new classmate whoâ€™s death and iâ€™m learning ASL to better communicate with her, is there anything i should avoid talking about or do to help her better understand me? we have to wear masks so she canâ€™t read my lips, so is there anything else i can do to make that up? sorry if this is a stupid question but genuinely i want to be able to befriend her. ty :-)
