Rant about school and how I was treated When I started primary school in reception my mum says I would hide under tables and refuse to come out / socialise with people. So I got put into a special club (two hours a week). To play games / socialise with people / your special and need help. So I was in this club until I finished primary school. ( To be fair it was fun but I missed out on essential learning (maths English etc) I would come back and be confused on what was happening. This special club also did other things meaning I missed out on ruffly a day of learning a week. Not too bad but it adds up. I found it hard to make freind's since I kept leaving the classroom and being payed special attention. I was treated with a light touch. Then in year 5-6 I was out into counseling. Another one hour a week just drawing and talking to an adult for no reason at all except to make sure I'm fine. 

Then I went to secondary school, on the first day I was took to an office and they checked that I was fine. I was in learning support for English during year 7. But in year 8 I moved out of it then in year 9 I was in top set. I finished school with a 7 in English GCSE, that k was proud of.I didn't need any extra help or support when I was secondary school, they treated me like I was just normal and it was great. But I was always am confused why I was given so much help and support in primary school when it just made me feel alienated and seperated from everyone in my class, just because I was shy as little kid (4). 

Now I'm 16. Still a little shy but so annoyed at how I was treated in primary school and all the education I ended up missing out on, to play with puppets or make a clay pot.
