Reading in 6th grade. A couple of years ago when I was in 6th grade I had a teacher, well this teacher wanted to get our reading scores up (half the class was below 4th grade reading level) so to get us to read if we wanted to get to have the 30 min of extra recess to do stuff we would have to read 2 books and take a test on them, well I was ok because I thought I would be exempt because my reading score was at college and I obviously knew how to read well, wrong, she thought that me reading manga and not reading and taking tests on â€˜normalâ€™ books was bad enough to be punished. Well every last day of the month I would not just lose my extra 30 minutes I would leave both snack break and lunch. I am overreacting or was thar petty of her?
