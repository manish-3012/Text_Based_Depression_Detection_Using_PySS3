For you all considering self-harm out there. Listen to me, I know this is just a few pixels on a screen for you all but listen here. For those thinking about self-harm, whether being a razor blade or full out ending it all, Do not do it. You have so much to look forward to in the future, just think about your family and friends, they all want to see you succeed in your career path. Those people who love you and want to see you do better can't do that without you there. If you are currently doing self harm, like i said before, do all in your power to stop. I know it can be addicting like a stress reliever or to cool down. I know you can do better. I believe in all you you out there. Its not about how the group is doing as a whole, its about how you are feeling as the individual.
