I have made a fatal flaw in my Halloween costume idea Before quarantine, I had bought a navy blue suit cus there was this dance thing and covid came so I had no use for it. Jump to here and I'm gonna dress up as my Minecraft skin. One problem my mc skin has black tux and not navy blue I'm feeling too lazy to change it to blue for just Halloween but I have a feeling I have to do it at some point before the day
