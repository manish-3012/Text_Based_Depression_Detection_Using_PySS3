i ran my best time for the 100m today for our first meet and iâ€™m so proud of myself!! i was so surprised that i did so good considering it was our first meet, our old coaches (loved them to DEATH) quit and our new ones are shit, and i missed a whole season last year cuz of covid and did basically no off season workouts. it was a whole second less than the 100 time trials we did two weeks ago during practice!! i truly donâ€™t understand how it was so good but i was so happy about it. i also did the 4x1 and i did super good on that too &amp; a few people said i looked really good &amp; fast so it boosted my ego a lil bit and made me feel good!! lol 

weâ€™re not gonna talk abt how bad my 4x4 and 400 was tho ðŸ˜³ it was embarrassingly bad and slow compared to my old times &amp; how it was my best event. BUT the 400 is one of the hardest events and i havenâ€™t done one since our last full season. the 100s made up for the terrible 400s though! 

iâ€™m not gonna mention the 400 times bc theyâ€™re so bad but my 100 was 14.7! to some that might not be that good but i never even made it into the 14s before, and this year on the first meet, after only a month of practice after not practicing for a YEAR, i got it. super cool ðŸ˜†

for people who donâ€™t run track: 100m is the straightway and the 400m is a lap
