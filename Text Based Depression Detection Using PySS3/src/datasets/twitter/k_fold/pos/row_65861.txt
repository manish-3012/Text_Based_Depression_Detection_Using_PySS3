Enjoy my story and share some blue cheese with me So after 8 years in a school, in a city with around 3000 people, im moving to a city with 200k people tomorrow (actually today bc its 2:45 am rn) bc of the high-school i wanna go to.  Im gonna be living in a student home or whatever tf u call it and i dont know anybody there or anybody thats in my class or in my school. Im comming home every weekend but its a 3 hour drive so its a bit annoying. Anyway i hope that i will be doing good and wish me luck.
