Had a revelation about parenting priorities. I get caught playing video games on a school day and I get grounded for...well, I don't even know how long, since my parents are those who don't tell their kids how long their grounded for, but I know past Christmas.

My 8-year-old cousin tries to get my 200-pound dog to maul me and my sister for not letting him eat all the fries we were sharing, and all he gets is an ass-beating.

...What?
