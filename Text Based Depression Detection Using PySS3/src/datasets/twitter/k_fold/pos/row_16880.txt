Today in science class.. I took zoology because Iâ€™m a senior and I want to take easy classes. The zoology teacher has always seemed under qualified and the class is a joke. Today he tried to tell the class penguins can fly, but underwater. His logic was bird flap their wings and thereâ€™s water vapor in the air and penguins flap their wings but underwater and water is just condensed water vapor. Iâ€™m not kidding or exaggerating when I say the entire class died laughing. He got so angry he called the principal in to talk to us. When we told the principal what happened he laughed and walked out of the room. We sat in silence for the rest of the day..
