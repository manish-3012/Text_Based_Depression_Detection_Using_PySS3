I've just lost all hope. After 2 years of love and happiness me and my girlfriend broke up. I can't stop thinking about her and cry non stop... I feel like my whole life just ended, I've lost all hope for being happy ever again. I really want to just die right now but I'm too scared... I'm sorry everyone for bothering...
