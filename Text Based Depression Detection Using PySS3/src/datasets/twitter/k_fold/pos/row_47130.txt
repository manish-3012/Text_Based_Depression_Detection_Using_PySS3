I know many disagree but I'm proud to be a nonbinary teen I've never felt like other people, something was always wrong with fitting in even when I tried. I eventually realized that the world is just too obsessed with gender roles and assigning people what you can and can't do/wear/play with etc. I eventually realized I was nonbinary and I'm happy to say that I am free to be who I want to be without having to worry about others. Shout out to all of my follow siblings, whether straight, gay, ace, trans, nonbinary, or others. I'm happy to stand with you all.
