I donâ€™t feel OK, I am starting to collapse So, it started when I started highschool. I was unfortunately in a class full of assholes, and you guessed it, It was like hell. I was raised by my parents to be a kind,respectful and helpful person (sorry for the swearing). I got bullied so fucking hard in the first year of highschool, I started to hate myself. My parents got divorced when I was 7 and I stay with my mother. We were happy together but school was really making me uncomfortable and she knew that.

Then, she married a man a year ago. I met him six months before marriage and he was kind and respectful to me until the marriage. After they married, he started to humiliate me almost every fucking day. He doesnâ€™t harm me in any physical way, but Iâ€™m just an emotional man and I take whatâ€™s said so seriously and he knows it. I have talked to my mother several times and she doesnâ€™t seem to care at all. This fucking man has a son that is two years younger than me, he is so dirty, unrespectful, rude,any negative adjectives you can think of. And guess what, we dislike each other to the hell. This fucker humiliates me as well, but when I try to say something, my mother interrupts so that I wouldnâ€™t say anything. I used to talk these to my elder brother, but he lives in another city and he canâ€™t come very often. 

In school, nothing really changed. I am now in a different class with relatively normal people, but I feel like I am not loved or wanted all the time. I feel like people take advantage of me. I feel like people I see as friends are disgusted of me. I have been lonely for my entire life. And a few days ago, I heard from a friend that some people donâ€™t really like me or even my presence in the class. No one has ever said anything that would make me happy. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t feel OK...
