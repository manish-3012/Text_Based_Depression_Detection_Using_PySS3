I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place I'm now in 10th grade. It's a pretty hard time for me. Since I am doing online school. The problem is that I have to get good cus they will count in the end of high school. The problem is I am falling behind Maths, Science, Biology because I have missed several important info the last year and this has dropped my performance. Moreover, I have to decide this year where will I go. What I mean by that that there are 2 paths in high schools at least in Greece. Either Maths + Science, Biology etc. Or Language, History, Ancient Greek etc. I do not know what to follow. Furthermore the problem expands since in 2020 until I finished middle school I was great at Maths, etc now I get better and I prefer more History etc. I do not know what to do.
