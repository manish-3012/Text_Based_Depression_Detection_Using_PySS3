I got a girlfriend!!! And we're going to date! I met a girl through Overwatch. We were a pair of really good friends. We talked more and more.. and finally were a couple!! We live pretty far away but our parents told they'll help us and that it's not a problem. Probably nobody cares and maybe won't read it but I had to tell someone. Sorry about my English but I'm not a native speaker.
