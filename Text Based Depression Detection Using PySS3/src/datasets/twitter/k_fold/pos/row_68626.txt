Pray for me By the time I posted this, I have exactly 18 hours before I get ready to school for the first time in this year. Why does that matter you might ask? It's because I have a month worth of homework that I have not started doing. I live in Asia so some of the teachers can be a bit .... mad. One time, my English teacher said that some students didn't send their essay and the teacher said and I quote "if this would haven't been an online class, I could kill you right now" with a serious tone (well that's how I heard it). On top of that, I'm in a "top class" so the teachers gonna have a high expectations on every student and I am 100% not qualified for it. I wanted to change classes but the other ones have subjects that I'm not really interested. I am panicking idk what to do other then do some of the work but I honestly think I might just run away .... Pls if you have homework you feeling like ilu can do it later, DON'T . DO IT NOW . Try not to procrastinate.
