Iâ€™m tired of the whole trump hating rhetoric. I get it. He lost. He fucked up real bad in his final days in office. He wouldnâ€™t admit he lost. The hate he has faced isnâ€™t he past years as president has been mostly undeserved in my eyes. The tweets wishing death on him are horrid. However I feel everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I just feel as if the amount some people hate Trump is unhealthy. He wasnâ€™t the best president Iâ€™ll admit but he doesnâ€™t deserve all the hate he receives. 

Feel free to have a civil debate in the comments but if it becomes bad I will delete this post.
