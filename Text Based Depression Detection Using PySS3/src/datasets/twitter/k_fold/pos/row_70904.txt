I hate 2020 What day is it?
Actually, no. Fuck that. What MONTH is it?
Are we still in 2020 or did I die of a heart disease at some point and wind up in hell? It isn't like I'd know the difference.
We've been quarantined since march, and I still don't remember anything that happened in april, may or june. Did we hit some kind of a fucking time warp and skip ahead?
Now, it's bad enough that shit hit the fan. But the shit is smeared all over the walls and America won't clean it the fuck up.
Why is tiktok getting banned? People can just use PVNs to get back in. don't we have BIGGER issues? Is the pandemic all in my fucking head? Maybe I'm trapped in some wierd, fucked up coma.
Come to think of it, I can't remember doing half the shit I've done in the last few months.
When the fuck did I start playing halo?
Who even am I?
Is anyone actually reading this?
