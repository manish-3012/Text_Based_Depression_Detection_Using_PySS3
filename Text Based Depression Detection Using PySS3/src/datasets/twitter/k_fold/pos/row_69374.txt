Im not in a good place mentally due to college. 6 week progress reports dropped for my first semester. I have As in 2 classes, a B in 1 class, and a F in 2 classes (all letters are ranges). The Fs are stressing me, I'm scared of failure. In one class I could easily get it up (I missed 2 discussion questions out of 4 by accident and struggled with the first test out of 4 not knowing it was open book), but the other one I don't know (did all the work, terribly bombed 1 test though out of 3). I really don't wanna fail. I wanna pass and graduate on time. There's plenty of time to fix it, but I'm stressed. Obviously this is the first semester of college for me, but I don't want it to haunt me.
