People complain about not getting a gf or havent had a relation and all but. In your teenage years, relations are boring, i had a year long relation and most of the times all that happens is a kiss or something and sometimes a little attention  in my experience, im gonna wait till im 18 plus cuz then i can have a serious relation and think about things as marriage or buying a house, i think at this age friendships have more value

Your free to disagree, this is just my opinion
