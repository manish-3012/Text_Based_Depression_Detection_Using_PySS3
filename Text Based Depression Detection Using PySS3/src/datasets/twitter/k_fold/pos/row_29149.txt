need advice for breaking up with an abusive partner iâ€™ve been in a relationship with this person for a month and a half and itâ€™s been getting unhealthy. itâ€™s a long distance relationship and i donâ€™t know how to end it. i think i should call them but my friend thinks theyâ€™ll keep me in the relationship by talking me out of breaking up with them.

main question: do i call or text him to break up

(update: iâ€™m texting him)
