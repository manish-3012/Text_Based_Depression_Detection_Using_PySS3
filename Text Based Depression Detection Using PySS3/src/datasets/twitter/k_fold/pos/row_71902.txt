Alright can anyone give me some advice? So about a month ago I got hired at a retail store as a cashier. This is my first job so I had no idea what to expect (part time by the way, I'm 16 and in highschool). All was good until they started giving me more hours than what we had agreed upon. Alright no big deal I get more money. Well we have this system where we can put in requests for when we can work, and after I worked 5 days in a row, all 7+ hours, Thursday through monday, I asked to have one day off on the weekends. First one got cancelled for some reason and then I put in another one on the 3rd of September, its still pending so they havent even looked at it. I'm going to pick up my paycheck today and I wanna talk about it but I dont know if this is a normal thing or not. Anyone got advice about it? Originally I was told I would be working 3-4 days a week and around 25 hours a week and told I would have one day off on the weekends, I know some people work alot more but I signed up for this much and my parents also arent happy about it either.
