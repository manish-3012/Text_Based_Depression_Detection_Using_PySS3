Things people have done makes no sense. Read to find out. So, today is the first day of new year. I have an exam tomorrow and I should be studying. But I felt this needs to be said. 

First of all, making edgy and dark jokes is fine, but the same joke that 2021 isn't gonna be better and health bar in sky and time zone difference jokes seem kind of repetitive now. I feel I can take jokes but it is no credit to bring everyone down. This has saddened me to the core. 

I know making my voice heard here isn't gonna change anything and most people wouldn't even read it, but, I had to say it. Please stop.

Let's make 2021 good together.
