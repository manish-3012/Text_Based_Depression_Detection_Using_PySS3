Does this ever get you mad  

So Iâ€™m a straight A student, my parents check my grades every week on the school website. Now, Iâ€™m still a straight A student but Iâ€™ve submitted a few things late (only by like 10 minutes late) and they get mad over one wrong thing I do in school. Itâ€™s making me fucking tired of having â€œgoodâ€ grades. Itâ€™s like come on do you know how hard I work for those grades? Give me a break man

Anyway I'm being a bitch go listen to hot girl bummer ðŸ™„
