Why do I get so obsessed with stuff? Anyone else do it? Itâ€™s really annoying Most often an activity, show or animal. I get seriously obsessed with it. I research about it all day and night and the people around me wonâ€™t be hearing about much else for a couple months until the obsession is over. Thereâ€™s usually a two-five month break, then queue the next one.

Example, currently I am absolutely obsessed with snakes. Iâ€™ve watched 40+ hours worth of snake or reptile related videos in the last two months. Iâ€™ve also gotten obsessed with the Hog Island Boas and desperately want one. Iâ€™ve read all the information available on google about them, Iâ€™ve looked up all the breeders of them in my country(which I now know by name, where theyâ€™re located and what the price and quality of their animals are).

I constantly nag my parents about it. I canâ€™t help it. Theyâ€™re tired of it and often snap at me whenever I bring it or anything related up. I canâ€™t stop though, and I donâ€™t know how to handle it. If youâ€™re in a similar situation, please let me know how youâ€™re treating it, because this isnâ€™t fun anymore and itâ€™s really messing with my life and head, haha.
