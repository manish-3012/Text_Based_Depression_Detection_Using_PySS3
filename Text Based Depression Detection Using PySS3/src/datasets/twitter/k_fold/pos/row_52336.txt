I miss her so much I miss having someone telling me good morning every time I wake up. Having someone tell me goodnight and that they love me when ever I go to sleep. I miss all of the sweet paragraphs we sent through text and all the sweet names we'd call each other. I miss cuddling her on my hammock and she'd fall asleep in my arms. I loved her so much. I still love her. But now her nickname on messenger is back to her own name. Our chat emoji is now a thumbs up again, instead of the heart. Now we're just friends. And I'm just another one of her exes.

I've been told I'll get over it but I don't want to. I'm told I'll find another girl who I'll love but I only want her. I don't know who to talk to about this cause I'm not very open so I'm talking anonymously here, cause I want to say this to not just myself.
