My greatest fear This is a fear that's followed me my whole life and I've told no one.   
I've always had the fear that my friends just hate me. I know it's not true(I hope it's not) but what if my friends are just acting like friends to get me to host my mc server. I had that fear when I was 7 with me having a fear that my friends only liked me because they could play mc at my house.
