No body willcare or one peoble will reaf it but its ok but this weekend i say goodbye to my childhood house and the reason is bank debt and illness.   


When i mean bank debt is that if my mom waits more she cannot pay the debt and my house would be seized nad thats it the illness is cancer but no worries my mom es recovering very fast.   


Thank you for reading this, it may not be a good news or something impresive but at least a way to express certain sadness and let it out instead of leaving it rotting inside once again thank you
