Writing an Article About Online Class for High Schoolers Hi! Iâ€™m currently a student Journalist and I am writing a piece about the switch to online class and how that can effect studentsâ€™ mental health (whether that be a not-so-great home life, lack of counseling resources, lack of socialization, etc). This piece is meant to be centered around South Florida and due to consent rules put in place by my professor it would be better if you are already 18. If any of that resonates with you I would really love to talk to you about your experiences for my article. Please PM if interested!
