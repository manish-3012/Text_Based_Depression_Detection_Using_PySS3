I dont like alcohol, and i found out the hard way Last night i hung out with my friend in my garage and i pulled out my homebrewed alcohol. So we started drinking it, and 7 glasses in and im drunk. my vision starts to get somewhat blurry and i cant really balance. 2 hours later i feel sick and i throw up twice. We go back up to the house and go to sleep. The next morning i have a shitty hangover and just feel sick and throw up. I can still feel the hangover at this moment, and its not fun. 
I really dont like alcohol, weed is way fucking better. More fun, less risk
