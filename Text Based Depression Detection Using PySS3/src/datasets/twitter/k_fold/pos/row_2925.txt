It costs more to buy one of every award with euro than dollar To buy every award it costs 86490 coins. I live in Ireland so I worked out to buy the minimum required coins it would cost â‚¬241.97 ($285.04) but I did the math using the American prices and it costs $219.97 (â‚¬186.73) which is significantly differentboriginal price I got for just being a different currency. It costs more to buy coins with euro than US dollars even though a dollar is worth 0.85 euro.(I made this post before just I accidentally used subreddit specific awards so this is a repost with the correct values)
I understand that it wouldn't be the same amount but it shouldn't be so different
