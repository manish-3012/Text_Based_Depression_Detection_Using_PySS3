It seems its the end of my sports career Right so basically 2 years ago I started to have some crunchy noises in my knees everytime I did a squatting motion, it never pained so I called it a day feeling old lmao. Thing is I played Basketball andI am a runner too. Few days back, my right knee has some sort of dull pain (that too without any fall or injury except that I am practicing higher jumps these days) and my right knee is clicking/popping feeling everytime I straighten and unstraighten it. 

It seems I am fucked. Going to doc tomorrow probably going to get a death warrent :)

I am 17 ffs I don't wanna have arthritis or something already.

I also play the piano and I don't want my fingers to have some sort of arthritis

Or I would kms for sure. 

Pray for me F.
