How do I change for the better Not sure if this is the right sub but here I go, this might be a long one:

So recently, Iâ€™ve been feeling a bit down on myself, and Iâ€™m not the person that I want to be. I sit on my ass all day and play video games, or I watch YouTube, occasionally Iâ€™ll leave my room to do 1-2 chores but very rarely.

The only times I go outside is to and from the bus and at school. Iâ€™m unfit, unhealthy, and extremely unorganised and not motivated to do anything.

Iâ€™m starting to lose friends, hurt my relationship with my family, and Iâ€™m also going through people bullying me at school.

I just donâ€™t know what to do. I want to become more fit and active, I want to not sit on my ass all day, I want to start helping around the house more, I want better grades, I want to repair friendships, I just want to change everything about me but I donâ€™t know where to start.

Please, please someone help me, I canâ€™t do this on my own.
