I have a stupid idea so in home ed a few years ago I noticed that it didn't hurt if the sowing needle (we were doing sowing at the time) went just barely under the skin, and now I want to do something stupid.

I want to weave a pattern with red thread into my skin. and then to school.  
because why not.

also yes I will be disinfecting the needle, even though it won't be going under my epidermis.

if anyone knows any reason why I would likely die or otherwise have a bad time doing this please tell me.
