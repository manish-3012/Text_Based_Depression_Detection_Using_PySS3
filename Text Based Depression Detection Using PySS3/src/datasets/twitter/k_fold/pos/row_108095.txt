can't focus on what I need to do..or just finding it so hard atm So, I just organized a list of resources for learning Spanish and Chinese. My brain wants to do Russian as well, and I already speak it somewhat so why not. 

Ok..I also went and learned some Spanish and Chinese words. Made a decent sized list, posted it here. (Figured some of y'all might be interested as well)

Nice! Super productive, right? Yes and no....Im supposed to be doing homework atm....its due in a few hours but the only thing my brain wants to focus on is some language stuff. Code...thats a language, right? Well, im doing a bad job of focusing on that and im sitting here instead. 

Just....am....not...focusing...right....now
