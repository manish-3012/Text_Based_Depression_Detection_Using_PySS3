Anyone else get a package they never ordered? I got a package yesterday that I didnâ€™t order. Addressed to me and whatever. All it had inside was a dog whistle. It didnâ€™t come in the typical packaging you would get from most companies, it can in the PS Lightweight type of packaging, the cheapest kind. Itâ€™s also marked time sensitive material, even though itâ€™s just a dog whistle. The return address is p.o. box 6368 rosemead ca 91770, which is the return address for 10 different companies. Did anyone else get a package they didnâ€™t order from that address? I heard other people were having the same thing happen but Iâ€™m still hella confused and Iâ€™m trying to figure out what company it came from.
