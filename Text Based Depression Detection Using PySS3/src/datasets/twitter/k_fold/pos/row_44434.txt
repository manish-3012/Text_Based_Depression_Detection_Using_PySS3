Flashback to the time I dropped a lit match on my bed So about two years ago we had a really bad snowstorm where I lived. It knocked out our and most everyone in the county's power out for a day or so. So, to keep light in my room at night, I had a candle and a set of matches. I'd never actually lit a match before this point in my life, but I managed to light a match and tried lighting the candle with it.






My fingers were a bit too close to the flame, so my smooth brain dumbass thinks "ow fuck this match is hot" so I drop the match directly on my fucking bed. Instead of picking it up immediately, my dumbass did a double take, said to myself "I should probably do something about that" and then picked the match up. Thankfully my sheets weren't even burned but that could've gone down a very different road.
