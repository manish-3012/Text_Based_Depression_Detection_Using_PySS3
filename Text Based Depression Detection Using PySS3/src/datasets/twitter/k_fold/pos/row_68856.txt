Anyone else in a down state right now? Iâ€™m just realising this is a pattern with me and honestly feels like Iâ€™m broken, so I guess im reaching out to see if im alone in this or not.

Iâ€™ll have weeks where are fine and days where I can do everything and nothing can stop me and then Iâ€™ll have a few weeks if not a few months where everything is just negative but also so bland and neutral it doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m living just feels like Iâ€™m here, I hide away and feel as though I canâ€™t come out. Worst thing is when people ask if Iâ€™m okay I always say Iâ€™m fine, even though I have so much to day, yet and I canâ€™t ever pinpoint anything is actually wrong,so I feel stuck like im underwater chained to the sea floor. Not drowning but also not breathing.
