Mini rant I have to get out One of my friends is mad at our group of friends. I suck at making up and sticking with names, but Iâ€™ll try. So letâ€™s say Steve is who Iâ€™m ranting about. Steve wanted to play among us with all of us, but I was online playing other games with my friends Alex and Max. So anyway Steve gets really pissed when we say no, and he starts saying that we ignore him and he apologizes for existing. We explain to him that we just wanted to play our game, and we didnâ€™t feel like playing among us at the moment. Alex thinks itâ€™d be funny to kick Steve out of the chat as a joke, then Steve starts yelling at me that Iâ€™m toxic. I tell him that he shouldnâ€™t get upset that we didnâ€™t feel like playing a game that he always rages at (that last 4 times he yelled at us for one reason or another). Weâ€™ve decided to cut ties with him after this, because itâ€™s like the fifth time this has happened. Thatâ€™s all, not a big deal but I had to get it off my chest.
