Girls of reddit, do you feel comfortable using girl avatars? I love the new snoo avatar maker thing, and I find joy in making one's that look like me and people I know.But I hear so much on reddit about girls being harassed, that Im not sure if I should keep my avatar as a girl, and maybe change it to something more neutral.
I was curious how yall thought about it and why you do or don't use girl avatars
