I wish I was dead This has been happening on and off. I wish I was dead. I feel like a shame to everyone I feel like an idiot and a terrible person who doesnâ€™t know anything. Iâ€™m scared of killing myself so I think Iâ€™m just going to turn to hurting myself. I just feel like everyone I know would be better off without me, regardless of how positive they talk about me.
