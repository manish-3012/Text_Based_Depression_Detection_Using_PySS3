I gave my boyfriend a virtual hug and he sent me a meme. I sent him a virtual hug. The one where it goes *sending virtual hug*. then *virtual hug sent*. He said â€œHuhâ€ and then sent a meme. This rlly made me go ouch inside. It was so funny because it hurt and it felt like a rejection from my own boyfriend.
