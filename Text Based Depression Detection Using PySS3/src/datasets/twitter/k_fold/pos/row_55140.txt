Rant on my step-dad Im done trying to be friendly with my stepdad. Every time I think we're finally getting along he says or does something that just fills me up with anger. He sent ome of our dogs off to who knows where because he wasn't well trained ( even though HE bought the dog and never trained him), then joked about it being my fault the dog left, he said he can't wait for our other dog to die so he would have to deal with dogs anymore, but he still wants her to have puppies so he can sell them, he's homophobic amd said that kids who are gay just weren't disciplined well enough (making me want to stay in the closet), and I'm just done! I tired to be friendly with him so many time, I hug him when he gets home, get him birthday and fathers day presents, make jokes with him, i even knitted him 2 scarves. Because my mom loves him, so I just want to get along with him... But today he threatened to get rid of our dogs and called me a liar, and I cried, not because he wanted to get rid of the dogs but because it doesn't matter how much I try to get to know him, he either doesn't care or doesn't understand how his words and actions affect me. I'm going to sleep now, sorry for any typos, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading
