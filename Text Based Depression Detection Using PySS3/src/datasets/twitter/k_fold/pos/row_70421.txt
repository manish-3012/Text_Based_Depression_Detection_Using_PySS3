Tales of my old fuckwad of a teacher. Stories of the teacher my class was assigned from the 4th to the 6th grade.

â€¢ Gave detention on the first day to a boy who came late to class because he couldnâ€™t find the new classroom.

â€¢ Threw a pen at us in the middle of class.

â€¢ Iâ€™ve always had trouble with the multiplication table. I asked for help during a class. She just scoffed, walked to the board without helping me and gave the whole class multiplication table homework without ever helping me with the math problem.

â€¢ Wouldnâ€™t let us split up into boy vs girl teams for soccer that was just for fun during recess. She said it was unfair for the girls because we were boys. There were as many girls as boys and majority of the girls regularly played soccer or another sport.

Those are just a few off the top of my head that I remember right now. Sheâ€™s the top candidate of the many teachers who shouldnâ€™t have been teachers from my old school.

Some honorable mentions:

The woodcraft teacher who wasnâ€™t fired until heâ€™d groped three students(7-8th graders, he was 40-50). We had 105 minute lessons with him, he spent around 45 minutes each class bragging and talking about stories like how he once saved a choking kid in a car by making him throw up with his fingers.

The teachers assistant who constantly yelled at us. In domestic science I cut a banana and put the pieces on a paper towel to weigh them. She yelled at me and my work partner for this, we never got an explanation why. Later she was fired in the middle of a school day after gripping my friends arm hard enough for it to bruise.
