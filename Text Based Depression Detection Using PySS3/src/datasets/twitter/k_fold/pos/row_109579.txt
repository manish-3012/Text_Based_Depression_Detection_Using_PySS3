Damn I kinda don't fear death. I'm not like suicidal or anything. It's just the thought of dying doesn't sound terrifying. It's a fact of life. No reason to be scared. It's a natural thing, like eating or sleeping, and you don't fear those. You just cease to be, and it sounds peaceful in a way. If that makes any sense.
