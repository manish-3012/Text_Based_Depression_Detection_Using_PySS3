Explaining my dreams everyday until something cool happens (day 8) Almost forgot to do this today. This dream was a weird one, Iâ€™m in this weird world where there are massive carrots towering over everything, the rest was this land was bright green grass and one large concrete tunnel that spanned the entire area. The tunnel was half underground. I canâ€™t remember anything else besides the what the area looked like And one other person in it. The person was doofenschmirtz from phineas and Ferb. Donâ€™t know why he was there though.
