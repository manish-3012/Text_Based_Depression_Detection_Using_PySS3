Hey if youâ€™re a millennial hereâ€™s some advice! Please donâ€™t get your information from buzzfeed.

And no this isnâ€™t like passive aggressive, Iâ€™m being deadass

I keep seeing millennials being pissed off because â€œgen zâ€ told them that side parts and skinny jeans arenâ€™t cool.

Iâ€™ve asked all my friends. They didnâ€™t know what the fuck I was talking about. Neither did I. Neither did like any gen z on the internet.

Me: *vibing*

Random Millennial on Tiktok: â€œGEN Z YOU CAN **SUCK IT** YA CANT TELL ME WHAT TO WEAR ðŸ¤¬â€

No literally: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMehAoKTR/

Literally no one knows what sheâ€™s talking about

I guess the gen z that did say that are an extremely small portion because literally everyone is confused. And Iâ€™ve found that most of it is because buzzfeed blew it way out of proportion.

â€œMillennials fight back ðŸ˜Œâ€

In what fight? Because it seems very one sided ðŸ§â€â™€ï¸
