I'm a bit worried about my mental health and my future lol (13 y/o here)  So,

Around age 7 I started developing symptoms of personal anxiety and these quickly got worse.  I used to get upset after accidentally ripping a sheet of paper etc.  So here's the thing; whenever I triggered this, I would hit myself and usually banged my head against the wall. Not too hard though, I stopped when it hurt lol. (I got therapy  I dont do this anymore )BUT.  Recently I learned most mental things come from the front of the brain. And I've been thinking about this ALOT in the past couple of weeks probably cos of lockdown. I've found ways of coping with it like listening to music or watching yt. However, my worry is I caused permanent damage lol, that may sound stupid but then I start thinking about how much different my life could've been and it gets me upset and worried for no reason. Idm if no one sees this, I just need confirmation that I'm normal i guess lol
