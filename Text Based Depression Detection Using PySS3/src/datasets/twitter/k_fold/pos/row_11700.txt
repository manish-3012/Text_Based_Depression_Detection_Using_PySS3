I made my girlfriend stop talking to her male best friend and sheâ€™s salty Like tf sheâ€™s dating me not him why would she be mad, heâ€™s obviously trying to get with her like itâ€™s obvious and the fact sheâ€™s allowing it cheeses my soul. I told her itâ€™s either she cuts ties with him or Iâ€™m done with her ass and dumping her and she cried on the phone begging me not to but tbh I feel disrespected, itâ€™s like she was keeping her options open all this time and I thought she was a decent person but Idk now like I donâ€™t wanna be dating a thot. If I find out she cheated Iâ€™m getting with her friend Idgaf
