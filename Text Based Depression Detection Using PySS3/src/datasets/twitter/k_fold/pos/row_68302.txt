What are some artists, songs, soundtracks, OST you would reccomend I would reccomend 

&gt;Molchat Doma- especially their song Sudno, its really good

If you liked them, I would suggest IC3PEAK, their songs are so good

&gt;If you like rap, I would suggest Chikichu, his raps are really fun to listen to and his YouTube videos are amazing 

&gt;The Gentle Men

They are amazing, especially Obsession (a song from them)

&gt;Ashnikko is a vibe, especially her songs Daisy, Special, Tantrum 

&gt;Danny Gonzalez's music is amazing, IHATEMETOO, My dad is rich, Spooky Ho, all amazing 

&gt;Take a slice by Glass Animals is really really good

But the best thing I've listened to in my life is

&gt;DOOM 2016's soundtrack, it's a masterpiece, just go listen to everything 

&gt;Nier Automata's OST, it's still a masterpiece, but a very different vibe to Doom
