"don't go to college" I have noticed that the people who tell you to not go to college are either a) people who aren't good at anything but found success in youtube by sheer luck. Or b) billionaires who were accepted to the top universities in the world to drop out cause a better opportunity came up. And just so you know, the latter probably isn't going to happen to you. So before listen to them talk to some middle class people who didn't go to college and hear   their opinion on the matter, then make your decision.
