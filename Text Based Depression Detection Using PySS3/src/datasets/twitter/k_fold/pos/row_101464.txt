Getting em removed I had an incident 2 weeks ago which resulterade in both my arms being broken, got casts and haven't been able to fully use my arms without some pain. I'm getting them removed this week and then i'm going having 2 weeks without putting syrian on them. This post doesn't mean much but i just needed to get my excitement off my chest.
