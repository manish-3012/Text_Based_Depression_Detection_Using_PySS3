Iâ€™m low-key kinda depressed right now So I had a crush on this girl. My mom tells me that she likes me, and I think ok. So I start spending more time with her, and getting to know her better. She starts giving me mixed signals. She responds to my DMs, she is always happy to spend time with me, but she didnâ€™t say anything. Iâ€™m trying to play it cool and not tell her how I feel. I tell her I like her and it takes a week for her to respond. She says she likes somebody else. Iâ€™m like ok, never said I wanted to be with you. She ghosted me for half a month, and then says,â€Iâ€™m lesbian.â€ Needless to say, Iâ€™m pissed at my mom, because I just lost my best friend.

TL;DR:The girl I liked turned out to be a lesbian.
