Why do people do this? After about a month in a discord server, this dude got really close with some people. People knew him well and became good friends with him. One day, he seemed to have a bad day and all of the sudden, he just leaves the server. He just cut all contact with everyone. Is there a reason for this? Iâ€™m not sure why he did what he did.
