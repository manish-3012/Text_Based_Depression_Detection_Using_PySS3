Funny childhood story I remember that time in 1st grade when I loved my history teacher so much, so I wrote a letter to her that says 

"I love you teacher I hope you don't die"

then my teacher, who is my mom's friend showed the letter to my mom, and mom reminded me of it today

I was such a dumbass mofo.
