Not cleaning=death My family and I are moving house, so after all our stuff was moved out we hired a cleaning lady who ended up bailing. We started cleaning (vacuuming, moping, etc) when my siblings started calling me slurs (they werenâ€™t helping cleaning btw). I told them to stop, but they didnâ€™t. I eventually made my way to the car to take a break. My siblings said something to my mom and she came out and started yelling at me about how lazy I am. She was going off about how if I didnâ€™t help we were all going to die and be homeless (in that order). I  started crying whilst scrubbing the floors. My siblings then started calling me even more slurs. I canâ€™t wait until I can move out.
