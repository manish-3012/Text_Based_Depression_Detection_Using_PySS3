Online class &amp; Second Language I can not describe how much I forgot in french in the past year for being fully remote. the word "online-class" and "secondary-language" just do not go together. The teacher is telling the class how to conjugate imparfait for 20 mins and do some stuff on VHL, and everyone else is just chilling in the google meet not making a peep. This is not how you learn a language, we have to talk n' stuff. I... just want to vent this out.
