I (M) was texting with my friend girl friend (friend one) FRIEND ONE She said out of nowhere  â€œAre you homophobic?â€ My dumbass thought homophobic meant homosexual so I said â€œno.. i think?â€ And then she said â€œyouâ€™re heterosexual then?â€ I was then â€œyeahâ€ are we both dumbasses or did she just play it out?
