Who else has parents that get angry over anything that sounds even remotely annoyed? I don't try to annoy my mom and whenever she asks me to do something I'll do it but regardless if I'm doing something or just reply in a way that sounds like im annoyed she goes off on me, but of course if she's annoyed or in a bad mood its not a problem and she has every right to yell at me over nothing.
