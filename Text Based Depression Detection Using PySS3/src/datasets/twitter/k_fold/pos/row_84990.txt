I'm quitting Reddit *Emotional* *Sad* *Shocking* Hey guys, I'm quitting reddit 'cause I have too much fame here and I knew I shouldn't have had sex with the squirrel and I should have been better. I deeply regret posting that on youtube and I also wish I was a better human. My girl-friend who is 17 and I'm 60, we live together and we have sex everyday btw. She's hot and sorry guys. BYE.
