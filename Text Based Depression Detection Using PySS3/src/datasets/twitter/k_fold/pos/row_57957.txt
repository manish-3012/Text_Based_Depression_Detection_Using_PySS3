How do you balance work and school and social lifeâ€™s. Hey friends, Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™m currently working 40 hours a week in fast food, I also am enrolled in the hardest English and math classes that our school offers. I am failing English so bad because of not actually being in school and not being forced to do the work and my job makes it so hard to find time for homework. I also want to have a social life with my friends and girlfriend and I just donâ€™t know how to balance it all, any help would be appreciated! I figured the best people to ask would be the other teens of Reddit who may actually have it all figured out. I have a whole time management sheet for my weekly life yet following it hour by hour I still find myself being behind and never having time to breathe and relax.
