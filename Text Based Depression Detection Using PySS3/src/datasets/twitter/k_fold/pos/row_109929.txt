Why do people hate each other I mean specifically generalizing. 
Some women hate men
Some men hate women
Some people hate certain races 
Some people hate who you love 


Like do you not have a life? 
Isnâ€™t there anything better to do? 

If you hate Abbey (just an ex.) down the block because sheâ€™s a bitch- then okay. But if you hate every single female because of what Abbey did to you, you just look stupid.
