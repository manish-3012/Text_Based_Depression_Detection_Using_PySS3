I just had a super weird dream So I went to the cinema with my best friends. And it was a love film(I don't even watch those). In the middle of the film one of my friends starts to kiss me(at this point I can't move), he then just started to strip me and cuddle with me NAKED (almost sex). nobody in the cinema was paying attention. It didn't feel bad but I was confused. I have no idea what the fuck this means. 

Side note: I am not gay.
