Ok yeah so I want to stream But I have a romm with my brother, and listen here, it's great news for that, my brother is most likely gonna get a job soon which means that when he's working I'd be able to at least try to stream, or normally play/talk with my friends without him shouting/interrupting/saying something in the background/watching youtube etc. Which is actually pretty sick
