A teenager who lived in my City committed suicide a few days ago A dozen or so of my friends knew him somehow. He was 16 and he jumped in front of a train. He didnâ€™t go to my school but he went to a school nearby mine. This morning my school had an assembly about it and they told everyone that â€œa 16 year old tragically lost his life a few days agoâ€ which we all knew to be untrue. Idk why he did it. Can you guys pray for him or something that would be great.
