Which abilities should I focus on? Hey guys and gals,
I have been thinking of developing new skills. I'm in college rn so I don't really have much time, so I have to choose between some options because I can't do them all... would appreciate advice:
1. Piano
2. Animation
3. Skateboard
4. French/Languages 
5. Voice acting 
I would have a maximum of 3 hobbies due to my time constraint. Btw, I'm following an education degree. I'm just trying to determibe priorities, if I don't develop the skills now I would probably work on it on the future.
Thanks in advance
