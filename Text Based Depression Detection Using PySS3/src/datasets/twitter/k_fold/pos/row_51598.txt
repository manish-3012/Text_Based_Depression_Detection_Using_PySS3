Welp, there goes Prince Philip. As you may have heard, Prince Philip passed away today. Here is where you can post thoughts about him, comments, feedback, etc.

PPhil, thank you for that glorious zombie-face meme you spawned this year and for being husband of the longest-reigning monarch ever.

Yours sincerely,

The worldâ€™s teens
