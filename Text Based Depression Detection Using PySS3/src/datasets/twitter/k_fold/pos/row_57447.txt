Mods should be useful There has been countless posts of people in legitimate despair and depression talking about sad situations and these inconsiderate pricks make joke comments on [SERIOUS] flaired posts just to be douchebags. The flair exists for a reason and it states clearly in the rules that you are not to joke on posts with that flair, itâ€™s even commented by the bot. If itâ€™s a rule, why donâ€™t moderators enforce it? Are they just mods to fuck around and do nothing that theyâ€™re actually meant to do?

Youâ€™d get fired for not doing your job at a company, why is this any different? Moderators have a job to do, and they arenâ€™t doing it.
