Iâ€™m mad af rn. Preordered a game that came out today, wonâ€™t get it until the 23 So I preordered Mario 3D all stars WHEN it was announced at my Walmart. Had my mom go get it while I was in school, and sheâ€™s saying apparently I canâ€™t get it until the 23. Iâ€™m really mad because I thought the whole point of PREORDERING is that I would get the game on the release date guarantee before they can sell the other copies to the customers.
