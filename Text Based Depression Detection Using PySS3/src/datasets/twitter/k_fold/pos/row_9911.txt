Do you guys sometimes just get panic attacks when you start thinking about your future? I currently work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and earn 10.50 an hour. I help my parents out with rent, pay some services and keep the rest for myself. I spend a bit on some stupid stuff, but not too much

I spend my free time watching anime, reading manga, buying manga, and playing games with friends,  and I really enjoy all of that. The thing is, whenever I think about what I'll do with my life I just start panicking and my heart just goes ballistic. I don't want to study anything specific, and I don't want to work in any specific field. The only thing I've got sort of figured out is that I may be interested in serving in one of the branches of the military

In the future, I want to have a good, stable income to afford some more of that stupid stuff, housing for myself, a nice car, and to some day buy a house. Not knowing what to do with my life makes all of that seem so hard to obtain

My parents want me to study for the GED, but they also want me to keep working to help pay rent, so I feel completely lost and always find myself going back to my playstation or laptop to forget about my worries. It seems like a cycle that won't end
