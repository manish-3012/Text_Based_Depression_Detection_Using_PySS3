ALRIGHT SO STORY TIME BITCHES as per one of my previous posts. people know i mowed the lawn.  in an hour. and.

 let me tell yall sum before this continues. i aint scared of big ass spiders like tarantulas and huntsmen spiders. love those motherfuckers. 

let us continue. i was mowing, singin drop em out very loudly. when. one of these tiny ass spiders that leave yo ass alone showed up. in its BIG ASS WEB. and. fuckin. i scrEAMED. i hate those tiny mfs. and when i got it down. i realized. that. they were. all. over. the. fucking. yard. they were EVERYWHERE. so i had to individually burn the parts of the webs connected to the trees and get them down.

TLDR(pussy): small ass spiders spooked me while i mowed
