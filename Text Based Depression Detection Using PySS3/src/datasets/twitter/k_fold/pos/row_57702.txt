To anyone with steam trading cards Hey guys I'm trying to collect steam trading cards and I need people's help. Currently I have 280 cards and still growing if you guys have any cards you don't need or don't mind me having in order to grow my collection please tell me as it would be greatly appreciated and go to a good use.

Also I am down to trade sets of trading cards for other sets for people that want to do that
