I give up My life has been nothing but an uphill climb and for what. More drugs to keep me happy and have my nose bleed in the middle of class cause of it. Nothing has gone right for me and everything's just been a massive failure. I can't look at myself anymore I'll just work my shit job after school and buy more drugs over and over again until it kills me. I give up.
