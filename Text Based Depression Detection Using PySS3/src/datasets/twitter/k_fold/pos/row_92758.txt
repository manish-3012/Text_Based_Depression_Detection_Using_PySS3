Masahiro Sakurai needs a long break  This is just my opinion but I think Sakurai needs a long break, it took hin 8 years to make super smash bros ultimate, and his work finally paid off, and do. You know what he gets? Toxicity from the community, for example Byleth and Terry joined Smash a handful of people were really really mad, but in my opinion it was a good pick, mostly cuz every charachter in Smash Bros has a unique play style. And lets take a look back to 2019, Steve was in the top 10 of most requested fighters, and then in 2020 he recieves so much hate. This is my opinion so feel free to criticize
