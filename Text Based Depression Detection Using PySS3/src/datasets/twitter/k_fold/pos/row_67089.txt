I think Im gonna kms tonight Iâ€™m really considering suicide, I have a few diagnosed mental illnesses, these make it hard for me to to get my words out the way I mean and understand what people mean, my best friend misinterpreted what I meant and now she hates me, like really hates me.

Iâ€™ve hurt too many people like this, and Iâ€™ve realised how much life would be better for them if I didnâ€™t exist.

I also hate my appearance, I hate myself so much, I hate my body so much, Iâ€™m ugly af. My jaw is too strong and my chin is too wide and sticks out too much. Iâ€™m also completely flat and just all around ugly. 

I hate my life and it wonâ€™t get any better, not without my best friend, Iâ€™m absolutely heartbroken because of this, I just want to die.
