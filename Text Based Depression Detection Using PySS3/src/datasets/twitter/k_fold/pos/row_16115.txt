There's a girl in my school who could potentially be vaping, what should I do? So basically, a girl at my school today said that they saw a female student (we'll call her Karen) who goes to our school walking home vaping with her friend, and she's asking us what we think she should do about it (we're still in middle school btw, in grade 8). After reading enough r/AskReddit posts asking "What one huge mistake is that you've made" where the top 5 answers are relating to drugs, I quickly responded, telling her that she should probably tell the principal or other staff members about it. However, many others listening in on the conversation told her that telling school officials could get Karen's parents sued and jailed and put Karen through unbearable stress, likely to the point of trying vaping again. They told her that Karen could've been just trying it out once or just trying it out to escape from issues at home and that she really shouldn't report it unless she knows more about this. 

They told me that I probably shouldn't be telling her what to do and that it's her own choice to tell a school official about this, and I understand that this might just not be a problem that I'm suited to handle, being a 13-year-old idiot. She says that she isn't going to tell any authorities or staff members, which I disagree with but can't really object due to my ineptitude.

Although I've been told countless times that Reddit is not a place to get advice like this, I can't help but worry about Karen and wonder if anyone thinks I should act on this. What should I do?

If you need any more information I'll try to be as active as possible on Reddit, although I didn't see this girl vape myself so I'll likely not have all the information about this.

tl;dr: My friend caught a girl vaping, should I report the girl to the principal?
