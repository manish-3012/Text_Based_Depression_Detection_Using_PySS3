People who don't have any talents or especially redeeming qualities, how do you feel like your life is worth something? I'm not special in any sort of way other than the fact I get good grades, and honestly I'm just below average as a person. If there's anyone out there who can relate to this, how do you feel like your life is worth something and has value? Like what keeps you going and thinking the future will be better and you'll grow up to be anybody?

Also just to be clear I'm not suicidal in any way.
