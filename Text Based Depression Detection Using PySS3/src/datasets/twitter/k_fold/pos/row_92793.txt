Thing I do to make sure I donâ€™t get big headed about myself:    So I do tiktok not that big just 28k and yea all that stuff and that comes with a lot of people constantly giving you compliments via tiktok/Instagram/and w.e other platforms you post on. 

  To keep down to earth and remembering Iâ€™m a human just as everyone else I look in the mirror and point out everyone of my flaws (cause of course people who find a interest in you wouldnâ€™t do that.) and it helps like a lot, Iâ€™m not cocky about anything, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m better then anyone, and I treat everyone as they treat me.

   Iâ€™m only saying something about this because you would be surprised how many people would let a SINGLE compliment go to their heads and now they think itâ€™s alright to act as if theyâ€™re better then everyone.
