okay say whatever you want BUT what is wrong with so many people on here. it's not against the rules to repost memes on this subreddit. Sometimes I find a good-ass meme and I have nowhere to share it, so I share it here. And almost every other person in the comments is boo-ing and calling me out as if I claimed the credits for the meme. Like bro what. Stop already :|
