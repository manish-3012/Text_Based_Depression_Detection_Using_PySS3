I don't know what to do So, I like anime, and I red some manga online. But my parents don't know that. And I'd like to buy some manga, especially JoJo's bizarre adventure manga. The problem is that my parents would judge the manga in a negative way, especially a scene from the second volume where the protagonists are in a carriage (they are in 1890) and the bad guy decatipte cut the head of a horse, he hide in the horse body and he put the head horse in the head of the driver of the carriage. In the anime is censored, but in the manga is not censored, so I don't know what to do, do I have to hide my passion or I have to tell them? It's stupid, but I'd like to have some advice. Thank you for eventually answers!
