American teens: if given a choice, what state would you choose? I want to work in America someday. I'm studying very hard as of the moment so I could find a job and contribute to American society soon.

If ever given a chance to choose a state to live in, where?

Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire seem very nice places but I don't think it'd had the same opportunities as Massachusetts or New York. And also, as much as possible, I'm trying to avoid southern states like California, Florida or Texas (doesn't seem so appealing but a lot of work opportunities tho, too sunny i don't like humid weather). 

Any advice?
