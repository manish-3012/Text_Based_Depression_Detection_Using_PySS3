46/365 Well... yeah I know itâ€™s Monday, but what can we do about it? Itâ€™s not that we can time travel, itâ€™s trying I know, itâ€™s also stressing, some of us might be scared of what what might happen at the end of the week, or maybe weâ€™re scared because of an upcoming test, whatever it is, weâ€™re all going in the same boat, weâ€™re all sad and desperate so that COVID finally dies, we want to get out of our house and be with our friends, or just go to normal school, but we gotta hold on, stick together, cause if we donâ€™t then what else can you do.

Hope you have a good week.

Ps:donâ€™t know why yesterdayâ€™s post didnâ€™t upload to the sub, itâ€™s in my profile if anyone wants to see it.
