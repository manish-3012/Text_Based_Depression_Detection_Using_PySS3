Does anybody else think that r/DonaldTrump being banned was wrong? Iâ€™m not as left wing as most people on Reddit, and Iâ€™m definitely more right wing than most people our age, so maybe Iâ€™m biased. However, I don't even support Trump to be honest. But, it feels as if removing this subreddit is a 'fascist' move(in a light sense). Obviously the Capitol Hill events are terrible but did r/DonaldTrump even have anything to do with that? I don't see what every single person on that subreddit could have done to deserve being banned. Is there something so terrible that I've missed, which means the subreddit deserves to rot in hell?

I'm not gonna post this on r/politics or r/conservative because I don't want to be circlejerked out of existence.
