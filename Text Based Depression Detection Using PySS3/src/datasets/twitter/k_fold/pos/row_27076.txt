I personally think marriage is pointless Like seriously whats the point? Literally the only difference is that you have to wear finger jewellery and when the relationship ends then it ends up in financial downfall, so whats the point? Aren't people just happy enough being with someone they love without having the need to jinx yourself into divorce. Afterall 100% of all divorces are caused my marriage.

Does anyone else think this? If not please explain your reason, have a good day
