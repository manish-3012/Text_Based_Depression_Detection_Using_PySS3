I need a good wireless gaming headset for 40-60 â‚¬ Soo, my old headset has been destroyed because the cable was ripped apart after some time. Now I need a new one, a wireless one, because otherwise I'll just have thr same problem again. Also it should have a decent quality so it doesn't break after a few months. Since I don't have that much money and I only find expensive ones or pieces that I'm not sure are good enough, I hope one of you has some advice. It shouls be available on amazon tho
