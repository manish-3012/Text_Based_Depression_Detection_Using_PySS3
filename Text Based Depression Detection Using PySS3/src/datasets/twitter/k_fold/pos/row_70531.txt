I'm looking for new songs to listen to but in a fairly niche area I'm just kinda bored of the Playlist I have right now and I'm in the mood for some new songs. Some of the genres I listen to range between early 2000s pop, sea shanties, classic rock, a little bit of metal but like borderline if you know what I mean, songs that make you feel like a villain, songs that are similar to the vibe from Achilles Come Down, and songs that are typically listened to by the lgbt side of tiktok.

I know it sounds very obscure and weird, but it's niche. And if I'm part of that niche then I'm sure there are other people that are at least familiar with it.

In exchange I made a Playlist to share with y'all. I know my taste in music is weird, but hey you never know what you might like. [The Playlist in question](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4SJsuLVYSa6HT6R1y6k9QE?si=ZAfyo5GBRcOSle6yAOaYFQ)
