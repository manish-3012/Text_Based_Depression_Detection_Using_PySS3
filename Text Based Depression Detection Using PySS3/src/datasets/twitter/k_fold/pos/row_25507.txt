Crazy to think Iâ€™m almost done with Highschool and accomplished nothing Exactly what the title says. Iâ€™m just very stressed and using this as a way to vent, but I just feel completely useless. I havenâ€™t volunteered, I havenâ€™t joined any clubs, for godâ€™s sake the only thing I have going for me is my academic grade and even THAT isnâ€™t outstandingly good enough to get me through life. I know what I should be doing but I can never bring myself to do it because I have no self-discipline apparently. It makes me feel even worse since I KNOW that Iâ€™m not on the right track and Iâ€™m not doing anything to change myself. I canâ€™t even blame this on drugs or a bad living environment. I feel sorry for my mom, having to waste her time raising someone this worthless. The world would literally be the same whether Iâ€™m dead or alive since thatâ€™s how little I contribute to society. Iâ€™ll probably delete this soon. Ah, I wish I never existed.

TL;DR: I donâ€™t want to be alive
