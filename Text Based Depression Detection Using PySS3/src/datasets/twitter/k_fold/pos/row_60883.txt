A poem How can I help you?

When I'm already falling to the ground

I can stay here with you, broken, if you'd like

And I'll write a poem.

Have you seen the stars?
I know you have, but have you really?
What do they tell you?
What do you tell them?
The infinite sky can be trusted.
Let's send a secret together.

I can't let you see me

I don't want to hurt you by showing my wounds

I did it once.

I'm so sorry.

Snow falls so quietly
So innocently
So
Tranquil.
It's perfect.
I don't want to mess this up.
But it'll all melt anyway.

Broken
Darkness 
Snow
Stars

I love your smile.

Even if I can only see it in your eyes.




Do you feel better now?
