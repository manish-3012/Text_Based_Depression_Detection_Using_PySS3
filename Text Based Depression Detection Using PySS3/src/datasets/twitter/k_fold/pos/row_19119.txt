My 10 y/o TikTok addict brother has taken interest in Reddit I have tried to tell good him that this is not the way. He doesn't believe me. Most redditors hate TikTok, and usually it's just one or the other. 

I tell him: "It's either Reddit or TikTok, you can't have both. The Reddit community hates TikTok." But he can't get a grip 

I hope he realises soon.
