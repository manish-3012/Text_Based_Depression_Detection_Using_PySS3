I feel like those new awards are really dumb Why am I saying that? I have many reasons:

1- They cost a STUPID amount of coins and real life money

2- They are only given at Redditors who make memes and arguments referring to this award

3- Itâ€™s ugly (?)

4- The jokes about the award have absolutely no punchline and are made by awards-whores

If you have other reasons to hate this award just tell me
This wasnâ€™t made to offend anyone, have a good day.
