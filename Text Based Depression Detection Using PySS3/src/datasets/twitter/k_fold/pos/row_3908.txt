What I learned from being a middle child is "do everything by yourself because nobody will help you or even pay attention" I rearranged my room and asked for help 5 times because what I was moving was heavy my family ignored me. My mom walked into my room this morning and said "when did you rearrange your room".

Well I mean first she saw me do it and second she heard me ask her

I mean there is also times she comes back with break fast and when I ask what she got me she responds with "Oh I forgot to order you food" and when everyone is eating food from a restaurant at home I'm in the kitchen trying to find food

Being a middle child sucks especially whenever I bring it up she always responds with "I treat all of you the same". She treats my younger brother like hes way better
