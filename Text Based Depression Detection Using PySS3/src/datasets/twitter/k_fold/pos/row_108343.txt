i need help  so a few weeks ago my boyfriend came out to me as bigender (male and enby). for whatever reason i'm having trouble accepting him because homophobic parents and internalized homophobia, i'm really really trying to accept him, and i know you're all reading this thinking "wow shes a shit person for thinking that" and i am, i feel like such a shit person because it shouldn't matter but it does, it matters way too much and i really need help. i feel so bad because i'm afraid that my being internalized homophobic idiot is going to kill our relationship even though i really love him. ive been an emotional wreck for days because i feel like such a bad person and because i'm lying to him about this so i don't make him worried or sad, i feel like such a terrible person and i don't know how to fix it and my brain is such a toxic place right now
