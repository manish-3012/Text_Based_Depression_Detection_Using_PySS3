Everyone should be bisexual Everybody should be bisexual/pansexual/whatever else. Hear me out, relationships shouldnâ€™t be about sex or anything they should be about weather you like the person or not judging by their personality. And if you donâ€™t want to have sex thatâ€™s fine. Heck, you can even still have kids cause if adoption. So basically what Iâ€™m saying it donâ€™t give urself a sexuality just date whoever u want. The only problem I see with this is some people still might want to have sex but not with their partner so they might cheat but other than that idk what else. Plez let me know ur thoughts ðŸ‘‡
