What happened to this sub? I left this sub like 4 months ago when it was already going downhill, I come back and now it's just full of memes. Most of them aren't even related to teenagers! This sub used to be a place where people could vent or make posts discussing teen problems/situations they needed advice for, but now it's just a damn joke. I won't be surprised if the mods take this down for criticizing the state this crappy sub is in, but if they do, it just proves my point.
