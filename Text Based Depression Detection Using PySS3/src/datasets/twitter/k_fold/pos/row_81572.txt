Iâ€™m 14 and I have a question for u guys. Iâ€™m trying to understand a lot of concepts, one of them is â€œIn depth of how batteryâ€™s workâ€ (Ik how they work, thereâ€™s a anode a cathode and a electrolyte, the anode transfers negative ions thru a electrolyte to the cathode, and when â€˜chargingâ€™ the cathode transfers ions to the anode. What I donâ€™t understand is, what is the point of the electrolyte? Why canâ€™t the anode and cathode just be touching?
