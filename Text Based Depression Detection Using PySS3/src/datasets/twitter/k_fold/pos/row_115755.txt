I'm having sad boi hours ouff I think all the negativity on the internet and all the shit that's happening around the world has gotten the best of my mental health... Well that and my shortcomings irl.
I can't even go on most social media without having my face slapped with political shit and depressing stuff

Kinda struggling to talk to people I care about with this coz I figure they've got their own stuff on to deal with
So hence forth, instead of studying, I'm gonna scour the internet for some wholesome memes to hopefully end my sad boi hour:-)
