I just became an honorary femboy A few days ago when we could still post pictures and crap I posted a video of myself in a onesie and another of me eating an Icepop and talking to the camera. On both of them a bunch of people started calling me a femboy, I legit had to ask what it meant but I guess I am? But the reason it might be honorary is because I'm actually genderfluid. Can I call my self a femboy or not tho.
