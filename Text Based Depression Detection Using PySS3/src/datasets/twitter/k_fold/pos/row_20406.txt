At my work some old people were having a convo about poltics Right in the break room. We disinfect stuff at my job. It was my turn to do it. i wen't in to do it. And I walk in and they're talking about new world orders and how Obama did this and that and how Biden is bffs with Epstein. How socalism ruin New York and it's a war zone. Blah blah blah. The funny part was they asked for my thoughts on everything. They wanted perspective from a young person. I told them straight up it soujnded like a bunch of nonsense. They asked what part. I told them straight up all of it. Thankfully they took it well and said thank you for your opinion and didn't yell at me or something. But whoa you read about people like this online. But seeing and hearing them in persona  trip. 

The next few months and the aftermath of the election is gonna be pure hell. I'll leave you with this. People like this are gonna go vote. I for one am gonna go vote too. I'd recommend you do too.
