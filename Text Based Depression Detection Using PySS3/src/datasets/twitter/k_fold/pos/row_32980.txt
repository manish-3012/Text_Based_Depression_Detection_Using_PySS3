I accidentally sprayed my keyboard with WD40 
I thought I picked out compressed air but it was actually WD40 so now thereâ€™s WD40 all over my keyboard. I didnâ€™t notice it for a couple days but I was wondering why my keyboard was a bit more oily then usual and more shiny. I went and looked at the bottle and it was WD40 and not air blast. I already rinsed my keyboard with soap but what else can I do to get it washed off? Can you put it in washing machine?
