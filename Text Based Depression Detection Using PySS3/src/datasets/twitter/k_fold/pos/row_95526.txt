Imma bi dude and need advice on my ex. So I dated this one dude freshman year and it was fun, (ps everybody knew and accepted it) sophomore year we broke up and he said we never dated and that he wasnâ€™t bi and only liked girls so I just distanced myself from him. This video got airdropped around the High School of him and this girl, it didnâ€™t bother me cause itâ€™s his life, we not together anymore heâ€™s gonna do him....probably two or three weeks later I get a message from him â€œ-Im sorry I said we never dated and  that video meant nothing she was just a friend we was at a party and I got drunk and that happened but I miss you...I miss us, please I never stopped loving you-â€œI basically told him no and that we can be friends tho, cause if Iâ€™m being honest after he said we never dated I cut of all my feelings towards him but anyways.......Itâ€™s now Junior year and we speak from here and there but recently he texted me he wants to meet up and go out to a party......what should I do?
