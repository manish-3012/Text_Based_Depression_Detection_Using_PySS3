How do I masturbate? No, this isnâ€™t a troll.

I have suffered very unfortunate traumatic experiences throughout my life that have had devastating effects of my physical, emotional, mental and sexual health.

Iâ€™ve done a good job at overcoming them so far, but seriously, how do I masturbate?

I havenâ€™t had the desire to up until the past few months of quarantine.

I think certain traumas Iâ€™ve been through killed my sex drive before I even hit puberty. Only now Iâ€™m willing, but uneasy about it.
