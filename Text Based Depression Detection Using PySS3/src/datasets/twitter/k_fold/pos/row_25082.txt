College life Iâ€™m close to the end of my third week of college, and while things have been crazy, itâ€™s been amazing.  I started living on my own, Iâ€™ve made new friends, attended my first protest, and truly started learning what itâ€™s like to, well, just be me.  Iâ€™m fully out of the closet as non-binary and itâ€™s great, finding so many people just like me, so full of love.  I never thought Iâ€™d love to see the day.  But, just a reminder to everyone else....  it gets better.  You have to have darkness to see the light.  I love you.
