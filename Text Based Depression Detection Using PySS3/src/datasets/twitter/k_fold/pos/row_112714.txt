If you need someone to talk to or to rant to or just to know that someone is there to talk to that's my discord. I just recently realized that I had no one to talk to I was too scared to talk to anyone about how I hated myself about how I thought I was inferior to everyone. I thought so poorly of myself I didn't even realize how little I felt about myself I thought about suicide before I even knew what the word meant. It was my fault that I thought this it was my fault that I didn't tell anyone but I recently talked to my friend and it really did change my life. I don't care what your problem is or who you are everyone needs someone to talk to or to trust let me be that person please.
