I just taught an old man about rule 34 One of my coworkers was telling me that he overheard his son talking to his friend or something about rule 34 while he was on lunch break. When he got back he asked me about it, I knew at that moment there was a childâ€™s life in my hands. So I decided to tell him that rule 34 states: If something exists, there is â€œartâ€ of it. Not the best I could have come up with. But now thereâ€™s is a child on this earth who could continue living.
