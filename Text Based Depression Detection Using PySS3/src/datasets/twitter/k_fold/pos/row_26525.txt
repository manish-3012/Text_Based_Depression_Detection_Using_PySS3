Short Survey About Social Media Hi! I'm a student at the University of Illinois, and I'm recruiting teens (13 - 19 years old) who have not completed high school yet to participate in a survey about social media use! The survey should take roughly 10 minutes, and it will be completed online. I'm hoping to get to 100 responses, and I'm currently at 26. Thank you for your time!
