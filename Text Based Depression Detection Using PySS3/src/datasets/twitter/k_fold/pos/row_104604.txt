My teacher forgot to start the zoom meeting until an hour and a half into class lmao Like I know sheâ€™s bad at managing the online school stuff but Jesus this was a new one. I was sitting there for like an hour and a half waiting for the meeting to start and she starts it like four minutes before class ends, and sheâ€™s just like â€œuh hey I forgot to start the meeting sorryâ€
