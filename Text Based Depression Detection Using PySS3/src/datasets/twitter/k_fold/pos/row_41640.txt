went to irl school for the first time this school year it was pretty good. i just started middle school so im in 6th and my mom said that its gonna suck and everyone is gonna bully me but she was wrong. the people are great and i have good friends. the 8th graders are kinda intimidating bc they are bigger but they are actually really nice and help us with stuff like getting our lockers open. my english teacher is really nice and i love her already. but at the end of the day, i was gonna get on the bus to go home but i missed it so i had to sit outside for a half our waiting for my mom. other than that it was a really good day.
