I fucked up and I need a miracle So I have a speech tomorrow at 12 pm... itâ€™s an argumentative speech which has to be around 6 minutes and I have to submit the written part too so I have to make that good and uhhh thereâ€™s a problem.... I didnâ€™t do any of it. 

So here I am currently sitting in front of my computer bawling my eyes out trying to figure out how to do this in 2 ish hours so I still have time to practice it with my social anxiety and anxiety in general djdhdnsisjsowjsosiso also who the fuck gives a mastery assignment that counts as your final for the first semester the first day after winter break ends!?? ESPECIALLY AS A FUCKING SPEECH LIKE I AM ABOUT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF AT THIS POINT 

anyway Iâ€™m seriously freaking out and am hoping that some miracle arises where my teacher postpones the due date to next Tuesday instead because thatâ€™s when our actual midterms are supposed to happen (our school started early so our midterms are next week instead of before break) but yeah... I already scratched my entire arm out of anger and so now itâ€™s burning :) pls help
