Return to Monkey (a poem by me)     Nicotine floods my cranium
    The damp chill seeps down through my nerves
    I swerve the burdens placed on me
    For living in society.

    Perhaps there's no better outcome
    Returning to monkey might not be
    Quite what its been cracked up to be
    Online, where LEDs drag us 
    Through layers of digital muck and sludge
    And hypnotise us into trust.

    Just how did Mr Caveman feel?
    After a day at mammoths heel
    Returning to his cave to heal
    And 'round his fire spinning yarn 
    With clan and meat to comfort him
    Much better than the lonely one
    Who stares deep into black mirrors
    Missing herself, and yet transfixed
    By evil eyes in lingerie
    Or joyful words from stagnant minds
    Set upon by expectations
    That they can bear the weight they take
    Who eat three meals a day
    Have perfect health
    And regularly kill themselves.

    I suppose we all die anyway
    For what's a life without some death?
    It gives it meaning don't you think
    An end to the story we expect
    Our lives to be, I guess that's just
    What happens to kids raised on movies,
    Where the myth of resolution's real,
    Who spit their revolution schpiel
    But can hardly do a pull up
    Whilst caveman runs for miles and miles
    In search of flesh to feed his child.
    Perhaps a bit of monkeys soul 
    Was coaxed into that blinding screen,
    Self destroyer, depression machine,
    Return to Monkey, human beings!
