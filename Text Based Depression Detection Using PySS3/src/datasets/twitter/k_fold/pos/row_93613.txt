Terrible with Snapchat, what to do with my crush/advice please? Hey everyone, 19 here, I feel like all you younger kids have grown up with snap so you know what to do/what stuff means. I got it 2 years ago and barely used it until now.


So Iâ€™m terrible with Snapchat and have a streak with my crush for 30 days now. I barely use snap so normally I never have streaks longer than 2-3 days, and usually donâ€™t snap at all. This is the longest one Iâ€™ve had. We donâ€™t just send pics, weâ€™ve had a conversation every snap with flirting here and there, sheâ€™s called me cutie and told me that like sheâ€™s not like the other girls etc, and agreed to meet up but I never planned a specific day, and sheâ€™s wanted to come over to my place but I got nervous... yeah I know thatâ€™s on me.


So normally we snap the entire day and she will respond in 5-15 min maybe an hour tops, I usually respond fast but sometimes I take longer like 3 or 4 hours but she usually responds fast. However, today is the first time Iâ€™ve been left on delivered for more than an hour, itâ€™s at 4 hours currently and her snap score has gone up like 100 points since then so she definitely saw it. Whatâ€™s that suppose to mean? Is she not interested now/upset? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m suppose to double snap, right? Never had to do that before. She is honestly the most beautiful person out there, every guy at my school would and is probably trying to go after her so Iâ€™m not sure if I messed up Iâ€™m so bad w snap. Any advice/input? Thanks a bunch
