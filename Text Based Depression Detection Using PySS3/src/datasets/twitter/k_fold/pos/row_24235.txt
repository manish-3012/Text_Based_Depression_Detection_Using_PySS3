Can someone recommend Youtubers? I've gotten bored of the youtubers I currently watch and I wanna find someone who makes similar content. I like comedy, gaming, commentary, art etc. 

Some people I watch are: colliscool, Jenna Marbles and Julien Solomita , Unus Annus (markiplier and crankgameplays) , AmazingPhil, eboys (memeulous, WillNE, James Marriott and imallexx) , the dream team, Wilbur Soot, Emma Chamberlain, Moriah Elizabeth, Pewdiepie, Kurtis Conner, James Lee, Safiya Nygaard, Joana Ceddia and dollightful.

It's quite a long list (sorry about that)

But does anyone have any recommendations based on the people I watch?
