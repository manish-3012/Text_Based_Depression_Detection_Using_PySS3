The new "super straight" sexuality. It's stupid to say the least, I mean you're straight, you can have preferences but making an entirely new sexuality over it is stupid and it makes you look like someone who just wants attention for you are attracted to.

Being a certain sexuality shouldn't be your entire personality, I'm bisexual but it's not my entire personality because I have something other than my sexuality to flaunt because I have an actual personality.

For 1, you are not opressed because you're literally straight, while gays, bisexuals, and other parts if the LGBTQ+ community are actually punished for being the way they're born.

You are creating your own put down because you pity yourself for not even being a real sexuality because you are straight, you attracted to the opposite gender, I've seen the subreddit and I've seen the stupid posts there so please for the love of god stop it.

For 2, it's your preference, not an entire sexuality so please stop.

And I swear to god it started as a joke on 4chan and now people are taking it serious and the flag is a literal re-hashed Nazi flag.
