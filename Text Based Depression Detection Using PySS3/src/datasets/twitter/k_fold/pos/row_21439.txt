Friend's Friend Groups Don't you hate it when you're playing a game with your friend and they invite their friends and you don't have the same interests as you so you leave and your friends start joking about you (I didn't know another phrase for this so it sounds kinda weird) for no reason and none of it is true. That fucking sucks.
