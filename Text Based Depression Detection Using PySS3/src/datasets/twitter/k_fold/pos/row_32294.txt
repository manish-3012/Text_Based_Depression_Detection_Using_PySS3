Ok so listen to this before you downvote this to hell So, let me be clear, I have nothing against lgbt or anything, my sisters gay, and my uncle is gay and nothings wrong with that. But damn, why are they making 1000 genders? Like the other day I was visiting my younger brother that still lives at my moms because heâ€™s like 12. And I go up to him and Iâ€™m like â€œhey howâ€™s it going man?â€ And he looks me in the eye and goes â€œIâ€™m not a male, I identify as queer-gender.â€ Also, not to mention he has been dating the same girl for about 6 months, so idk how he is gay. Also since when does ur sexuality become your gender? Anyway so to stay true to the older sibling tradition, I smacked the F U C K out of him and kicked him in the nuts, then told him to man the fuck up.
