I need advice for dating someone who hates themself [serious] so I started dating a girl that honestly is really nice in every way.

She's funny, kind, and likes a lot of the stuff that I do... only problem is, she hates herself.

I've had a bit of experience with this sort of thing in the past, and I've made it a very important thing to complement her in the little things. She has told me that the complements help her a little bit, but I feel that I should be trying harder to help her with her situation. I know it's the middle of a pandemic (I'm in the USA... cringe, I know), but if anyone has tips for me, I would be so thankful.

also I'd like to add that she is self harming, but is getting over it thanks to legitimate professional help and a little bit of love from me, her family, and her friends.
