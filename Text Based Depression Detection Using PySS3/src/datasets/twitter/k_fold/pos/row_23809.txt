My younger brother did something... I figured that this experience deserves to be my first post here.

So, a little background before anything else.

We came from a normal family, he is only two years younger than me, and we have a common case of sibling rivalry.
While growing up, we are compared to each other and also, to other neighbor's kids. So we are both seeking our parents approval and to see who's better. 
We are constantly bickering, teasing and fighting each other for years and he never did something so good that made me cry until now.

You see, he bought me a milk tea, using his own money, for free. He didn't asked me anything, he just gave me that drink and left. 
Why is this a big deal? I always thought that he hated me. I'm the favored child and I know that he is kind of jealous to how our parents treated me.

After a good 4 hours of that incident, he again entered my room and gave me a balut. I really liked eating this.
And I said to myself, that's it, I want to share it with you. I'm just super happy to think that he thought of giving his ugly sister something while she's having a hard time. It's very considerate and thoughtful gesture.

I'm still not eating my balut tho because I opted to share it here first.

(For those who didn't know what balut is... I suggest to not search for it unless you don't easily get disturbed. Balut is not disgusting or anything yet some people that hated it. If you're really curious, who am I to stop you?)
