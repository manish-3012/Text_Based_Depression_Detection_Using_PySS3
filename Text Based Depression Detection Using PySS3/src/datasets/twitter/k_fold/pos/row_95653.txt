So i was talking to my friend... I was talking about how all my loved ones are either dead or dont love me back or it doesn't mean much. Then i was talking about how i have been alone most of my life and how i'm at the point to where nothing hurts me anymore and people can say as they please to me and i wont care. I then started talking about how i also just sit in my room watching netflix (i am doing that now actually) being alone and having nobody to talk to or love and he strays talking about his current girlfriend and his ex. Then he goes "you really need a girlfriend" and my brain went to "did you even fucking listen to what i said?"
