I'm so angry all the time and I just need a place to speak My dog just died today we just buried him in my garden. I'm back into home learning for two weeks I just had a fight with the rough popular kid and I'm worried his friends are going to jump me. I'm recently out a relationship of 18 month relationship. And I just want to go into school and just hit everyone I don't like with a hammer.
