I need help, but dont know what kind I'm having some trouble with getting over my ex, even though I really shouldn't. I just cant help it, I fucking miss her even if she did treat me like shit and use me.

I know that's not right but I dont know what to do about it and I just want it to stop before I do something seriously stupid over a girl who doesn't even care
