Haha...I promised myself at 13 that once I reach 18 years old I'd commit suicide...and it's 7 months away. I can't wait to just postpone my suicide and do absolutely nothing in regards to planning it, reach 18, then self-harm at myself for being such a pathetic degenerate for not taking my plan seriously.
