I got bullied again... I was just looking at the phone in class and they grabbed my phone and threw it on the floor and then asked for money.  When I said I had no money, they said "Are you poor baby boy?"  to me.  When he did not answer, one of them punched me and my nose was bleeding.  the person who punched me, "Are you so flimsy, bless yourself!" and laughed.  I could not stand it and cried. They dragged me out, threw me to the ground and kicked me, then the teacher came and they  ran away.  it still hurts, I can't stand it.

(sorry if my english is bad. im trying the doing better)
