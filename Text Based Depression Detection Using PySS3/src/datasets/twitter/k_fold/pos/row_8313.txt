i guess i can't go 2 months without death, can i so my grandpa passed 2 months ago, and my dogs were poisoned a week ago, resulting in their deaths. im too afraid to tell my mom that im feeling depressed, and frankly i dont know what to do to cope. ive lost motivation to do the things i liked to do and i think she's starting to notice. I can't go a night without crying anymore.

im hesitant to post this, but i feel like i just had to get some things off my chest. i know this isnt the best place to do it, where literal strangers will see it, but i feel more comfortable ranting to people i dont know than to people im close with. thanks for understanding.
