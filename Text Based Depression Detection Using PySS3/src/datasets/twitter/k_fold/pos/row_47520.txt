The most toxic, abusive person I have ever met Iâ€™m going to bed now. My Reddit account is known by several people; and Iâ€™m paranoid. So Iâ€™ll probably delete this post when I wake up. Whether you just read the Tl; dr at the bottom, or you actually read the entire post, I thank you for taking the time to listen to me rant/vent.

Iâ€™m not sure where to start, so Iâ€™ll just go over it from the beginning.

In 2016 my dad died. In 2017 my cat died, and in 2018 my grandfather (whom I was very close with) died. I know it may seem ridiculous to place my cat among some of the worst losses of my life, but I had him and loved him since I was just a few years old. 

I could have made it through each loss, but they happened in such succession that it really began to wear me down. Around 2018, I was starting to become depressed. (I donâ€™t have depression, but I have been in a depressed mindset before). It also didnâ€™t help that I hardly had any friends., and I was no good at maintaining the ones I had because Iâ€™m anxious and have a hard time talking to people. There was really only one person I would hang out with at school.

Then I met my ex. He asked me out, and I said yes. We started dating and it felt really nice to have something significant happen to me that wasnâ€™t something awful. To top it all off, he was a massive extravert. He got along with almost everyone, and he introduced me to his friends. Then his friends became my friends, too.

Thatâ€™s where things started going downhill.

Whether he knew it or not, he engaged in a tactic known as love-bombing. Itâ€™s when you give someone a lot of love and affection very early in a relationship, give them gifts, etc. For reference, he said â€œI love youâ€ on the first date. Tactics like these make you feel instantly compelled to return the favour, and sort of keep you locked in the relationship.

I had just one real friend before this, as I mentioned, and I slowly began to realize that things werenâ€™t great between them. I couldnâ€™t understand why. I thought they were both good people whom I cared for. My ex would sometimes pull me aside or wait until she was gone and say something like â€œwow, sheâ€™s a bitch.â€

About a month into our relationship is when we started fighting. It would always start as some small disagreement or misunderstanding, then he would start screaming at me. 

Then he picked a fight with a teacher at our school. He didnâ€™t like his teaching style, so he figured heâ€™d start a campaign to get him fired. My friend, who actually thought he was an ok teacher, and who certainly thought he didnâ€™t deserve to lose his job, tried to tell him it was a bad idea. This was the beginning of the end for them.

He lost it on her for â€œconstantly raining on his paradeâ€, sent her messages that we were better off without her, threatened suicide, and whenever she tried to stand up for herself heâ€™d berate her for â€œplaying the victim card.â€

He convinced some of his friends that she was a psycho bitch. She realized how toxic he was, and had to distance herself from him. And by extension, me. He ruined her reputation and she sat alone at school every day. And I knew full well that she didnâ€™t have any friends outside of school, too. He also forbid me from interacting with her, and said that he would be mad at me if I was caught.

My friend had experienced the suicide threats, but it wasnâ€™t just her. I experienced them too. At least twice a week. I would have to stay up on call with him until 3 AM **every day**, and if I left or passed out from exhaustion, he made me feel like a piece of shit. He would always say stuff like â€œyou can leave if you wantâ€, but actions speak louder than words. There was a right answer and a wrong answer. If you didnâ€™t give the right answer, heâ€™d say â€œok, somethings going to happen to me though.â€ Or something along those lines. 

**He did this for the entire year I was dating him.** One 4 month stretch was so bad that I was falling asleep in the middle of the day. I was completely overwhelmed and beyond my limits mentally, and it had begun to physically affect me.

I notified the right people when he told me he was actively planning to harm himself, though. And of course he blamed me for that. I was an asshole who was trying to get him sent off to a psyche ward.

But suicide threats werenâ€™t the only thing I received. He did the sleep deprivation and suicide threats to other people, and traumatized them by showing them unwanted self harm pictures. But as far as I know, Iâ€™m (thankfully) the only person who received death threats.

I lost track of how many death threats I got just a few months into our relationship. I remember one threat in particular stood out to me. He had previously told me he liked to cut open stuffed animals and pull their stuffing out to calm himself down. Then he mentioned when he was mad at me that heâ€™d â€œlike to turn me into a stuffed animal.â€ He told me many times that I â€œwouldnâ€™t live to be 15/16.â€ (I was 14/15 at the time.)

Thankfully, I never truly thought I was going to die. He was and still is a spineless coward, and even if he did try to kill me, Iâ€™m taller and stronger than him. But it just goes to show you what kind of a person he was.

He kept me locked in the relationship through the cycle of abuse:

1. Tensions would build. Heâ€™d have a bad day, or heâ€™d be on edge. I would be doing whatever I could to appease him and prevent things from reaching stage two:

2. Heâ€™d verbally/emotionally abuse me, and occasionally physically abuse me.

3. Heâ€™d make excuses for his actions and gaslight me into thinking it was my fault for making him angry in the first place. At this stage, heâ€™d make **me** apologize for â€œmy actionsâ€. Heâ€™d forgive me, and then stage four:

4. In stage four, it was more lovebombing. 

This went on for over a year.

I remember two times he caused and then berated me for having a panic attack. 

I remember another time he stayed at my house for three nights in a row and wanted to stay a fourth night. For high school students, this is a really long time. And I didnâ€™t want to have to get my mom to agree because I knew it was an unreasonable request. I said no, and he lost it on me. 

I also remember just how many times he hurt me, then played the victim card to the point that I would have to comfort HIM. (Spoilers: it happened a lot.)

I always hated playing games with him, too. That is, unless I could find a way to let him win without making it too obvious.

We played Mario Kart, and if I beat him, heâ€™d get angry. So angry, in fact, he would hit me. I think he realized he wasnâ€™t very good at punching, so he would just use the Wii remote. Then I would ask him if he wanted to stop, and heâ€™d get angry. Then I would try to let him win, but he thought that was patronizing and often would lose it on me.

I remember two incidents where it was really bad. It was more than one or two snacks with a Wii remote, it was more than just death threats, it was him trying to stab me with a broken pool cue. And I couldnâ€™t fight back because I didnâ€™t want my family to be alerted. I took it from him, I blocked his hits and tried to pin him down, but I never hit him back.

I think this was A) because of the level of psychological control he had cover me, and B) because I knew if I ever actively fought back, heâ€™d take that as the fight being both ways and pin it on me.

It would end with me sobbing and him comforting me. Those two physical attacks were the only times he ever offered a full apology, and judging by the fact that his behaviour never really changed, it was just empty words anyways. No different from when he gaslit next and forced **me** to apologize for almost every other fight.

He constantly used his mental health problems as justification for his actions. Heâ€™d use that to minimize his responsibility in any conflict we had, and heâ€™d pin the blame on me as a result.

His problem, and the problem that he still has to this day, is that he could never accept any blame, ever. He would minimize his own actions, think about things out of context, and re-word things until he had found a narrative where he was, in fact, the victim.

He does this because he if he ever accepted what he did to me, what he did to others as well, then he wouldnâ€™t be able to sleep at night. He tries to be a good person. Heâ€™s passionately pro LGBT and POC rights, heâ€™s opposed to any and all injustice, he loves animals, heâ€™s nice to strangers, etc. His mother was extremely abusive, and if he ever thought he was anything like her, he wouldnâ€™t be able to live with himself. Thatâ€™s what I think, anyways.

He did that with our entire relationship. 

He ignores that fact that I never laid a finger on him, but he did. He ignores the fact that I never once threatened his life, but he did. All he thinks about is the times I yelled and screamed at him, and even that heâ€™s taken out of context.

You see, you can only be hit, told â€œyouâ€™re worthless, nobody else will ever love you, and I want to kill youâ€ so many times before you eventually lose your shit. Heâ€™d treat his mental health as a get out of jail free card for his actions, ignore all the other terrible things he did to me, and boom. He was left with screaming and yellingâ€” and he rounded that up to emotional abuse.

So then, last year, he went around telling everyone that HE was the abuse victim. That I was a monster who hurt him. And I mean, who are you going to believe? A suicidal trans kid who youâ€™ve known for a long time, or his quiet, tall, and strong ex boyfriend?

He managed to turn all of our mutual friends against me. So many people that I once cared for were suddenly brainwashed by him and now hated me. And I couldnâ€™t even bring myself to tell my side of the story because A) I donâ€™t like talking about the graphic details. It makes me feel weak, stupid, gullible, and like I deserved it. It also just isnâ€™t pleasant to relive that. And B) Theyâ€™d already chosen their side at that point.

Oh, but he wasnâ€™t going to stop there. No, he wanted to completely ruin my reputation. So I went up to him, and said something like: 

â€œIf you donâ€™t stop spreading rumours about me, then Iâ€™ll tell everyone my side of the story.â€

I just wanted to leave the past in the past. â€œI wonâ€™t tell the truth about you if you donâ€™t tell lies about meâ€ sounds like a pretty fair deal, right?

Well, he attempted suicide after that. That part is nobodyâ€™s fault.

But then he did the same thing he did with our relationship. You see, heâ€™d already twisted the facts and created a narrative where he was an abuse victim. Building off that, Iâ€™m pretty sure his thought process was something like this:

â€œThis person doesnâ€™t want me to spread rumours about him.â€

Turned into:

â€œThis person blackmailed me into staying silentâ€

Which then turned into:

â€œThis person coerced me into suicideâ€

Which finally turned into:

â€œThis person tried to kill me. Theyâ€™re an attempted murderer.â€

Obviously, I donâ€™t know his exact thought process. But he started saying I tried to murder him after that incident, so Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s what happened. He also conveniently leaves out the information that **I** was the one who he reached out to after he swallowed all those pills, and the person who told him to call the hospital, (or else I would), and get into contact with his friends who could support him.

Again, I really think he believes heâ€™s in the right. That heâ€™s a blameless victim. As I said before: if he ever accepted any fault, if he ever thought he **wasnâ€™t** a good person, he wouldnâ€™t be able to function any more. So he desperately finds ways to be the victim, instead.

So then things cooled off over the summer because we had little to no interaction. We had split up partway through tenth grade, and going into this eleventh I really didnâ€™t want anything to do with him. But he reached out. He wanted things to be better between us; to be friends.

Now, given our history, and everything I have detailed here, I was extremely hesitant. But I figured that having him as a friend certainly couldnâ€™t be worse than having him as an enemy. At least then he wouldnâ€™t be going around claiming I abused and attempted to murder him. Besides, what could it hurt to try to improve things with him? Plus, Iâ€™d get my friends back by extension. 

So I tried. I tried really hard to be friends with him. And things were going well for about a month and a half. Suspiciously well.

I canâ€™t say I was disappointed nor surprised when it happened, but eventually he broke the peace. He confessed his homicidal thoughts to me the night before everything went to shit, and needless to say I was a little on edge. He never said anything explicitly, but he talked about wanting to hurt â€œa really bad personâ€, and warning me not to mess with him. 

You canâ€™t just say you want to kill somebody, then expect them to be fine the next day.

But, anyways, I tried. He seemed better that day, so we hung out with another of my friends Iâ€™d made and introduced him to. I wasnâ€™t really feeling up to it, but it was prearranged. 

It happened over a video call, actually. It was a three way conversation, and everything was fine.

About halfway through, my ex started texting me so that my friend wouldnâ€™t hear. It was personal stuff, about his depression and all that. He also went really quiet at this point.

And thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t notice when his audio cut out. I donâ€™t know how or why, but for some reason me nor my friend could hear anything coming from his end. Everything else worked fine. I could hear my friend, my ex could hear us, etc. 

Then my ex started having a siezure. This happens frequently, and I would have said something or helped if I knew it was going on. But again, the audio had cut out.

20 minutes pass and I get a call from him. I decline it, because I still am not aware of what has happened. As far as I know, he was texting me personal stuff that he didnâ€™t want my friend to hear, went quiet for a bit, then called me privately. I assumed that what he was calling about must have also been personal stuff, so I didnâ€™t want to answer it in front of my friend.

I wrapped up my conversation with said friend, and called my ex back within just a couple of minutes.

But in that time he had already gone on a huge rant to every one of our friends in our group chat/discord server. Something along their lines of:

â€œSo this person just ignored me having a seizure for 20 minutes while he talked with his friend, and he declined my call just now.â€

Immediately, I realized some kind of misunderstanding had occurred. I immediately rushed in to try and clear things up, but he **refused** to hear my side of the story. And he wouldnâ€™t let me say anything to our friends either, he would delete my messages as moderator and mute me from the chat. 

He made me seem like an asshole to a lot of people that I cared about and refused to hear me out. That, coupled with the experience I had last night, made me really upset/worried. So obviously I try to work things out, but he refused to listen to me for days. He actually said I was harassing him, and that I was being an asshole for not leaving him alone or something like that.

So then I get a call from him one night: â€œItâ€™s time to terminate our friendship.â€

Once again, he had convinced himself that he was the victim. He said he was on edge, and that my â€œharassmentâ€ hurt his mental state. He still wasnâ€™t really listening to my side of the story, and said that even if I was telling the truth, it was still 90% my fault. 

Of course, this meant that he started slandering me again, and I lost most of my mutual friends AGAIN. I only managed to keep two; the only ones who were willing to listen to my side of the story.

Since then, Iâ€™d recovered a little bit. I strengthened ties with the people I knew who werenâ€™t friends with him, and reconnected with the friend I mentioned at the beginning of this story. I have a nice little friend group now, and I was ready to just forget about my ex and never have to deal with his bullshit again.

Then, on Wednesday, I get a message from the two mutual friends I still have. Heâ€™s still trying to ruin my reputation. He wants to create a video â€œexposingâ€ me to the entire school for â€œattempted murder and abuseâ€. He didnâ€™t specify a length, only that it would take him weeks to make.

I had a mental breakdown as a result of this. I really thought the bullshit with him was over. I wanted to leave the past in the past, and I didnâ€™t want a war. But he insists on waging it. I heard that multiple people were trying to talk him down, so I waited to see if they would be successful. But by Thursday evening, it became clear he wasnâ€™t going to stop.

I tried to put a stop to it on Friday. I wanted to end his slander campaign the same way I ended the first one: â€œYou donâ€™t spread lies about me, I donâ€™t tell the truth about you.â€

But that didnâ€™t work. So on Monday (Tomorrow), Iâ€™m trying plan B. (Getting school staff involved.)

This situation is ongoing, and it just feels like itâ€™s never going to end. Iâ€™m exhausted emotionally. I mean, I spent two hours writing this stupid vent just to try and cope.

Tl;dr:

My ex boyfriend abused me, and now heâ€™s trying to slander me by claiming **I** abused **him**, and that I tried to murder him. This situation is ongoing and Iâ€™m currently doing my level best to put it to an end. Wish me luck.
