My teacher 'swore' a week ago my english teacher (im romanian) asked my friend in class to say in english which school he goes to and he said it in romanian. (we're pretty good at english but there isnt really a translation)

he started saying the name of the school and she stopped him with 'Eh, bullshit!' knowing full well me and him would be the only ones actually understanding

&amp;#x200B;

we started cracking up the 2 of us and she said it in english and thats the end
