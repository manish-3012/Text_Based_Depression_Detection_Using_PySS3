I get offended when people call me cisgender Iâ€™m a WOMAN. There is nothing you can do to erase my femininity. Iâ€™m not a â€œcis womanâ€ because that diminishes my femininity. Suffragettes have fought so hard for the rights of women and using the word â€œcisgenderâ€ for both men and women erases our identity.
