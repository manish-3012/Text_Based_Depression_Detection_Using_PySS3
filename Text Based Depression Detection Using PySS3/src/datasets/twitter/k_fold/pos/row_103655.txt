Damn it I'm questioning my future So originally the plan was engineering and I do like it but if you couldn't tell any realistic post I make has nothing to do with engineering it's usually some sort of physics or chemistry which I find very interesting so now I'm in this place where I'm questioning my choices and what's going to happen is extremely unclear. Shit I'm confused again
