i need a bit of advice because iâ€™m scared so my friend group consists of me, friend1, friend2, and femalefriend (i mention this because itâ€™s relevant)

soo we only became friends with femalefriend recently and i didnâ€™t say anything to my parents because i knew they would make it weird

so last night me, friend2, and femalefriend were watching funny videos and reading funny books in a call. we lost track of time and my dad came upstairs made at me at 3am about how i canâ€™t be up that late 

and soo. tonight i come downstairs for water. and my mom is giving me the most intense glare. sheâ€™s desthglaring so hard her face is shaking, she asks â€œWERE YOU IN A CALL UNTIL 3AM WITH A GIRL!??â€ i said no because i donâ€™t even know if iâ€™m allowed to have female friends or not. and she then says â€œDOES FRIEND2 HAVE A GIRLFRIENDâ€ and i said no because he doesnâ€™t. and then my mom says â€œSO YOU DONT KNOW ANYONE NAMED FEMALEFRIENDâ€ 
and she was furious and told me im being suspicious. 
i was gonna go to town with my friends on friday and now iâ€™m too scared to do it and i donâ€™t know what to do
