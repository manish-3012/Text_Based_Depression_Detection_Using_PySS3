Hey you! Im trying to change my life for the better and am challenging people to see who can do something longer (Aka weaponizing pride against my friends) and am looking for one more challenge to complete. If you give me a reasonable long term challenge (working out for 10 minutes a day, cleaning my room for 10 minutes a day, practicing a skill, etc) then i will try and do it. I will select my favorite challenge, even if i only get one haha. I will try to document my progress daily. May the odds be ever in my favor.
