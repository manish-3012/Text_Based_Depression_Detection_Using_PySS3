Long rant time because Iâ€™m super mad So I was going to get an Xbox series x for my last real birthday before I save up for a car and get a job and whatnot. My parents agreed as long as I have my younger brother my old one. Wonderful idea I can game share to him and we all have a great time. Today I went downstairs to my little brother and said please come upstairs we have something to tell you. He was playing roblox arsenal (shooter) and he said he was in a match. I said come on we donâ€™t have all day. Then he started raising his voice. I didnâ€™t one time because if I did I would be in trouble too. I went upstairs to tell my parents I couldnâ€™t get him upstairs so they called him up. He had a meltdown when he had to stop playing is game. So my dad blamed the video game (which in this instance was correct). But hereâ€™s the problem. My little brother has a condition that make things a little...tough. So my dad used him to think â€œoh this is happening to him that means itâ€™s allllll the video gamesâ€. So now theyâ€™re rethinking getting me an Xbox that I was going to pay at least half of. I literally offered my brother a Xbox and he yelled at me and now I canâ€™t get what I was really looking forward to.
