SOME HELP GUYS ?  i really dunno if this is the right subreddit for this, so forgive me

ok, so i am 17(M) and live in asia, where questions even vividly related to sex arent allowed. My mom has been going to the gynecologist for the past 2 months, doing various ultrasound tests. Recently she said that she has to undergo surgery in order to remove a stone from her body.

 I was confused about why she was consulting a gynecologist for this thing until i found out that through eavesdropping that she intends to remove her uterus.

 My mom is over 40 yrs old. I heard something about *fibrous(*not sure that's how u pronounce it) being removed and that the surgery will take 1 month to recover from.

 I also know that she isn't doing this on purpose.

 I also heard that something is growing bigger but she has 2 months to think and act. the surgery can also be done within one year but then the surgery can go painful. can someone pls tell me what the hell is going on in my house? any and all help is appreciated

(forgive my grammer, this is written hastily)
