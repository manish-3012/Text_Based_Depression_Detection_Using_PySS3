my bff keeps hitting on me i hope this isn't against the rules but my bff is a boy nd he just recently started hitting on me. the thing is imma lesbian nd it kinda makes me uncomfortable but i don't want to tell him cause his whole family his homophobic nd i rlly value our friendship. also he asked me to go out with him tmr (i hope its not a date) nd said he has smthn to tell me. should i tell him tmr or before we go out  or should I just not tell him at all
