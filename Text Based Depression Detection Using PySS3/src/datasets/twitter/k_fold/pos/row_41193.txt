What is up with the idea that youâ€™re â€˜too youngâ€™ to have a mental illness?? It makes no sense, somebody can be 12 and want to die, their entire mental state isnâ€™t invalidated by the fact theyâ€™re not an adult yet and so canâ€™t seek help until they become an adult
For context, teenager with a lot of depressed (most likely, weâ€™re all against self diagnosis) and suicidal friends, and our mental states are constantly invalidated because weâ€™re too young for depression apparently and we should just â€˜be happyâ€™ 
Does anyone else find this disturbing?
