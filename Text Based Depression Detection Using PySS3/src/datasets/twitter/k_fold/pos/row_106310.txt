Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 58: Kaiser Wilhelm II Kaiser Wilhelm II was the third, and final, German Kaiser. He ruled at a time when the oldest fought Napoleon, and the youngest would fight the Allied Powers. Even when he fell from German ruler to simple Dutch farmer, he was the biggest critic if Hitler for a time, and lived until the later days of World War Two. What about his rule, though?

When he took power, he had the mightly Otto Von Bismarck as his right hand. Bismarck was the man who united the German provinces and basically lead them to this point. Bismarck, though he would not live to see it, knew that a world war was a-brewing. He had multiple predictions for how this would be, many of then were right. For example "it will probably be over some silly thing in tha Balkans." Perhaps his most important one was "There are 5 major countries in Europe. The winners will be one one the side with at least 3."

And wadayaknow, both of those were true.

The young Kaiser wanted to make his own mark and not rely on the great people of his ancestor's rule, so he went out of his way to clash with Bismarck until he resigned. The world may look a lit different if he hadn't.

Not to say that he completely ignored Otto, he actually took a page from his book as the work war came closer. Wilhelm was actually a skilled diplomat, so he could negotiate a treaty in time. Germany already had Austria-Hungary, so he needed one more friend to break the stalemate with the Anglo-French pact. 

Now, just to find out who the fifth power was... Russia? Italy? Spain?

Nope. It's definently that Middle Eastern country that  has been in decline for 200 years.

And hence the Turko-German friendship was born.

When the Kaiser took power, he had a deep resentment for Britain. The reason is that Britain was ruled by a woman: Queen Victoria.

This fact was held in many places. It's just abnormal that he held it because Queen Victoria was his grandma.

For something personal, the Second Wilhelm famously had a bad left arm. Perhaps this is the reason he sought compensation in the arms of his mates.

It is said that most if the time he spent having sex was spent kissing the arms of the woman he was having sex with. He even wrote a love letter once that was soley about kissing the palms if the woman it was to.

Personally, I think his least wise decision was to wax his moustache so that he would have to be stuck with that sad, little, curly one as if they would remain in style for more that 2 seconds.
