I think I need help I've been thinking about suicide every night and cut myself for the first time and it barley hurt, which I don't think is good. The thing is I like to make myself miserable. Idk what to do. I don't really want to talk to someone because I felt comfortable with someone and then we kinda ditched each other, and I feel like it would happen again.(not out of anger, other reasons).
