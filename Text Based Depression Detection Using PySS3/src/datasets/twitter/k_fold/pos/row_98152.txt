I think Iâ€™m going crazy Every day Iâ€™ve been having conversations with myself, pretending like Iâ€™m talking to someone else about my issues. Sometimes they go one for over an hour. Sometimes in the moment they almost seem real. Usually Iâ€™m pretending to talk to a therapist, but sometimes I pretend to talk to my friend (weâ€™ve been drifting apart, thanks to me) Iâ€™ve isolated myself from others so much that I legitimately fantasize about opening up to someone, what the actual fuck. 

I guess itâ€™s my fault, I isolate myself in my own mind when Iâ€™m struggling with things, saying stuff like â€œI donâ€™t need other people to (insert life goal here)â€ But the problem is, when you donâ€™t have anyone else to compare yourself with other than whatâ€™s shown online, you get utterly lost. I need someone to pull me down, I feel like Iâ€™m floating away from reality, but I one will. Because I havenâ€™t let anyone get that close. No one has ever seen me weak, cry, complain, or even swear irl. Not even my closest friend. (Parents donâ€™t count) 

Iâ€™m becoming more and more antisocial as the person I am internally mismatches with who I am on the outside, I stutter more and always wear ugly clothes and have been wearing my hair up for the past 5 years. I donâ€™t talk to anyone new anymore, even people who I have talked to a lot in the past I get so nervous to talk to now. Tbh, I donâ€™t think this is as degrading for guys, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m jealous of them sometimes 

I could ramble for hours because Iâ€™ve already said this all in my mind countless times and Iâ€™m still continuing the cycle by just venting it online where no one actually cares, but whatever. At least Iâ€™ll be able to look through these posts like snapshots of my mental state in a few years and hopefully be able to laugh at them
