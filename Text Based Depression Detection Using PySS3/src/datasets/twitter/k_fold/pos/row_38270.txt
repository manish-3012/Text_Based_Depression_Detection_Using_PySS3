I love Minecraft Minecraft is so simple yet so complicated once you get into things like redstone. Iâ€™ve been playing Minecraft basically all my life and it is still my favorite game ever. Itâ€™s a beautiful game with a beautiful art style. Sometimes I wish I had a pc so I could use graphic mods to make it better, but the original graphics are good enough for me. Thanks for listening to me rant on how perfect this game is.
