I just slept with my own mom..... So a little bit of background: i share a room with my brother, im extremely introverted, my dad most of the times sleeps on the couch because his bed is "too comfortable", my mom sleeps at around 10pm, and were not from Alabama. Anyways, so yesterday i was super tired at like 4pm unlike any other day and my brother was gaming super loudly but my parents room was empty so i decided to pass out in their room on my dads side for 5 hours except it was 10 hours so i slept with my mom for a couple of hours
