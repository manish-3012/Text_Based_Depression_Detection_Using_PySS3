Something my mom made me believe lol- So when I was above 8 years old I was normally going to school with my mom and someone was building something- using a chainsaw- you know these shits that the chainsaws drop like that glows- (idk its name) so my mom saw it and said â€ Don't look at that it hurts your eyesâ€, so I just freaked out and immediately looked at the other side. Like- I thought that I was going to be blind if I looked at that. So, there was I everyday trying to not see chainsaws in action afraid to be blind. And today I still kinda afraid of that but not that much.

(sorry if there are some grammar errors English is not my first language )
