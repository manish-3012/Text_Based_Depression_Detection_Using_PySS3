I still have feelings for my ex Like I said in the title, I still have feelings for my ex, but sheâ€™s moved on, and she thinks I have too. I want to tell her, but I have no idea of what it would mean for our relationship together. I donâ€™t know if it would get us back together, her hate me, or what... I donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to my family about this, and Reddit is my only consistent social media. What do you guys think I should do? Sheâ€™s in another relationship, whereas Iâ€™m still single, and I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, especially her. I want so badly to get back together with her, but I feel like it hangs in the balance with her. I guess it does really, Iâ€™m super desperate but I donâ€™t want to do anything devious or malicious towards her current BF
