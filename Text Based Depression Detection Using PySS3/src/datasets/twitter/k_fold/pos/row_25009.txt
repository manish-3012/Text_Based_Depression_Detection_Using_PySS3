Racist shit being an Asian Okay so throughout school i had to deal with racism and itâ€™s from black people
And it pisses me off cause the same people that are racist as fuck to me (the only Asian tbh enrolled at the schools) talking about black rights I feel like thatâ€™s shit not the black rights idea but the situation of a black people being racist to me cause Iâ€™m Asian and then going off about black rights like if you want to be treated equally then treat others equally cause Jesus fucking Christ and what pisses me off when black people call each other n*gga but no other race canâ€™t say it cause itâ€™s racist but youâ€™re using it and their like we have a pass cause weâ€™re black that honestly just is total bullshit so what am I allowed to say gook cause Iâ€™m Vietnamese and no other race can say it i have no respect for people like this but Iâ€™m the fucking racist one and gotta have lectured about racism if you wanna be racist to me Iâ€™m gonna be racist back
Anyways thereâ€™s my rant hereâ€™s also some shitty questions and phrases I heard from people
â€œOmg youâ€™re Asian I thought you were Chineseâ€
â€œHave you been to China?â€ I reply, â€œI was born thereâ€ â€œI know have you been there?â€
â€œDo they call Chinese food in China Chinese food or just food?â€
â€œwhat type of ese are you?â€
â€œIf your Chinese and Vietnamese why donâ€™t you have the small eyesâ€
I FUCKING HATE PEOPLE
