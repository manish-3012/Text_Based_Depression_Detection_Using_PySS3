Ph.D Research on Sleep and Smartphone Usage with Adolescents Aged 18-24 Hi guys. Thanks so much for those of you who have already participated in our research! Our Ph.D team at the University of Limerick, Ireland, are exploring the sleep patterns and smartphone usage of people aged 18-24. We are particularly interested in hearing from users of devices with sleep tracking capability (e.g. Fitbit, Garmin etc.). However, ownership of these devices is not a requirement! If you would like to contribute to this study, please click on the link below to complete a 15-minute questionnaire.

Full details of the study objectives are provided in the participant information sheet. Thanks so much for your time guys!
