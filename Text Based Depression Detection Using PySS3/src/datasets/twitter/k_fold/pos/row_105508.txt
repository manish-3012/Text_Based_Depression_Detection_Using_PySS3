the most scariest thing that happened to me today my family and I were out we came back home at 12am on our way home we stopped a gas station and when my dad left the car to pump gas a guy ran to him screaming and saying "PLEASE HELP ME THEY WANT TO KILL ME" and his head was all bleeding my dad said go in the store and my dad ran to the car door and we drove off we seen one of the dudes that wanted to kill him pointing at his pocket and making the gun sign to the gas station worker so he could open the door hopefully that guy is safe and the 2 people got arrested. I'm scared bc our lives were in danger we could've gotten shot any time yesterday I'm a teen and this thing that happened is alot to handle. any tips u guys have so i could forget it
