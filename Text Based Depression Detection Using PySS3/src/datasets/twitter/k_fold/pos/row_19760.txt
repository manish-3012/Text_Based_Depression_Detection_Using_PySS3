Do people have a staring problem? Hey guys, this is an alt account. 

I apologize if this isnt the right sub for this question. 

So Ive been trying to get out more lately. Its a long story but it involves losing my first car.  Ive always had a fear of driving. Ive been getting better at getting over my fear though. 

I have a really nice paying job. When I say that, I mean I can afford many, many various types of clothing. Really expensive. Lately whenever I go out, Ive been noticing people staring at me. Is it because of my nice clothes? Do they think Im cute or something? I dont understand why they keep looking at me. I dont mind it at all, I just wanna know why. 

Any help?
