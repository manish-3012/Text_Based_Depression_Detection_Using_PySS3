A request for helpful people Hello! My name is Meaghan and I am a high school senior. For my research project I need to collect data to prove that my problem statement is actually a problem. I will link two surveys, one long survey and one short survey. You can take both surveys or just one but I would really love if you took both

Please share my surveys with as many people as possible, I am aiming for 100 responses to prove to my friend that reddit can actually be helpful so please help me prove my friend wrong XD

Short survey link: https://forms.gle/8HUU254z2njp1c516

Long survey link: https://forms.gle/kVUDZcypvzB9KvoN6

Thank you for taking the time to answer my survey(s) if you have any questions or comments please ask. Please share these links :D have a great day/night
