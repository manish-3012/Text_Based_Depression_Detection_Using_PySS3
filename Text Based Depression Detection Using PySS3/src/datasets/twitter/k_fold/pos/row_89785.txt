four months left until i fail because i actually failed all of my classes and now school starts next week and i canâ€™t log into any of my school accounts!! idk who to email about this

anyway yeah four months until iâ€™m supposed to graduate. i donâ€™t know what iâ€™ve been doing this whole time. i feel like iâ€™ve been daydreaming for the past 6 years because i really canâ€™t recall anything

so when iâ€™m not watching netflix. i canâ€™t even finish the sentence because i donâ€™t do anything. i space out at work. space out during everything. no wonder i say i spend my days sleeping. i day dream all the time and iâ€™ve let my life pass 

have i really spent the last 18 years spaced out ??
