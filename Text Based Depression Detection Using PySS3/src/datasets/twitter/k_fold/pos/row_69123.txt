I spoke to my ex He was my first boyfriend and I loved him with all of my heart. I talked to him on and off after we split but, a few hours ago, I told him how I feel and that I never stopped loving him prompting the biggest emotional breakdown I've ever had. There is a chance we'll get back together but I'm not sure and honestly I'm still kinda rattled.
