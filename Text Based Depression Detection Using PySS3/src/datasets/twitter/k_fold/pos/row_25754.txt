tips for you guys and gals from a long time user of this subreddit dear teenagers of reddit, Im a long time user of this sub, probably since october 2017 and I have seen everything on new. Recently I turned 18 years of age and let me tell you, please, for the love of God, enjoy these amazing years because you will eventually grow up and have a shit ton to do, more responsibilities, college... I spent my teen years never going to parties or hanging on with my buddies, I wasted them and I urge you not to do what I did. If you get socially anxious, I get it, it was my case, but do not chicken out like I did always and try, get out of your comfort zone. There is no need to be obsessed with romantic love, eventually you will find someone, you will have to put yourselves out there. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT date someone you fell in love via online, it will never work, the chances are very slim, I personally know what it is like to be in a Long Distance Relationship and I kind of wasted my time for 5 months with this girl, have though about her everyday since the day we met and that was on the 15th September 2018. Search for girls in your area, not online like I did. Avoid using social media like instagram, only use it to communicate with you buddies, specially girls, social media is cancer and someday you will understand what I mean. Do not spend a lot of time here, I did and regret it, avoid using your phone too much. Study hard, thats the only way you will get a life in the future. Stay safe from covid, have protected sex if you end up doing it lol, spend time with your friends, leave girls or boys for university, you won't regret it.
