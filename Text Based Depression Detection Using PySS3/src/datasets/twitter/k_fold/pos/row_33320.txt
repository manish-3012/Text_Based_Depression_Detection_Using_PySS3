So im 5'9 (13m) and my gf (13f) is 5'4 but only 6 months younger and were in the same grade. And people refuse to leave us alone Like I said. People talk too much for my liking and I need to vent. Its fucking bs when I'm just sitting down with her and I get asked if im in highschool or the a he gap between us. Like for real? Its all the damn time about how tall I am. Just give me peace. I hate being so tall. God forbid I get a moment alone with my own girlfriend. Is it just the people in my area or is this a common thing? Thanks for reading guys.
