How far-fetched is it to send a plushie to space? Hi, this might sound dumb, but I saw the story of SpaceXâ€™s launch with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, where a stuffed dinosaur served as a zero-g indicator. Thereâ€™s more information on this here - https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/5/30/21272222/spacex-launch-toy-stuffed-animal-dinosaur-zero-g-indicator

I have a very strong love for a manga series, Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun. Coming from somebody who is neurodivergent, Hanako-kun is a huge comfort character for me. Hanako is a ghost who, when he was alive, had a strong interest in space. He wanted to go to the moon, and was supposed to be a science teacher when he grew up, but he died at the age of 13, losing any hope of ever leaving earth. While this may be fictional, I still have a lot of sympathy for this character, and I own a plushie version of him in which I carry with me all over the place. 

The use of plushies as zero-gravity indicators is tradition among astronauts. I probably sound crazy for considering this, but do you guys think the Hanako plushie could be sent to someone that could get him up in space? Doesnâ€™t matter how high up/how long he would be up there, just the thought of getting him up in space like he dreamed is a concept that makes me so happy and emotional. If a stuffed dinosaur can go to space, maybe a Hanako plushie could too.
