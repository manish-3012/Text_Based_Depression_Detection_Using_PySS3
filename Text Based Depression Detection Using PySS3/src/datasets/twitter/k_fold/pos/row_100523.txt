How do I convince my Mom that I don't like snake girls? Alright friends, I need some advice. I'm using a throwaway, of course, and I'm going to start off with some expository bullhonkey, so here's the short version:

TL;DR: I was listening to some music from [This](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfqu2jaOn9bYi03RtHY-0sQ) channel when it was recommended to my mom. Mom asks me why I've been looking at snakegirls.

The first video game I've ever played was Plants vs. Zombies on my Nintendo Ds. I personally believe that Plants vs. Zombies is one of the greatest video games of all time, and I am lucky that it was my first video game experience.

Last year, I was bored and a little nostalgic, so I grabbed my 3Ds and put my old Plants vs. Zombies cartridge in it. I was looking through my first file owned by 7 year old me, and I found that I had almost 100%-ed the game! All I had left to do to get my golden sunflower trophy was beat the Bomb-all-together minigame (which was easy enough) and the Fog(Hard) survival challenge.

Oh. My God. I spent the whole afternoon trying to beat that level. For those of you who don't know, I had to survive 10 sets of 4-5 waves of zombies with little breaktime and little room for mitsakes. I didn't beat it that day, nor the next, but I was never mad. I believed that Plants vs. Zombies is a well designed and fair game, but I also found that I really enjoyed the music.

The fog level music was incredible, and after I finally beat the Survival Fog challenge, I replayed the game for the 3rd time on my file, just to hear the whole game's music.

I found myself suddenly obsessed with the Plant's vs. Zombies ost, silently praising the game's composer and listening to the songs while I worked and jogged outside.

I had been listening to the game's ost on youtube, and during my week of obsession, youtube began recommending me remixes of the Plants vs. Zombies themes. They were all garbage, none of them captured what made me like the originals. Eventually though, I had had enough and my spark for Plants vs. Zombies had died out.

A few weeks later, youtube recommended me remix of Rigor Mormist, (The fog level song) and when I listened to it I was surprised. The remix was actually good!

I clicked the channel that made the video, and I found that it was owned by a small composer who liked to remix songs from video games, mostly Pokemon and Plants vs. Zombies. I ended up subscribing to her channel (which is something I never do) and I was happy with the high-quality remixes that came out regularly [(Here's the channel by the way)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfqu2jaOn9bYi03RtHY-0sQ). I fell into a cycle:

1. Get notification that a new remix is out.
2. Listen to remix
3. Say "woah"
4. happy.
5. add remix to my playlist.

**Here's where it all went wrong:**

I got one of those community blog post things youtube does, where a channel that you watch regularly can send out messages, polls, or pictures and you can like and comment on them n stuff.

The remix channel I was actively listening to had some news...

The old logo of a faceless girl wearing headphones had been retired, the channel had a new banner and icon of a *Tank-top wearing, sunburnt, Suggestive drawing of a girl with snakes for hair that* the channel owner called "Seiiccubus."

This didn't affect me at all, the channel continued to make remixes and I continued to listen. The icon was recently changed to the same snake girl but in a different style, and the channel name was changed from 'Seii' to 'Seiiccubus'

Again, I didn't care, and continued to listen the channel. There's one more thing I forgot to mention though...

My Mom had two e-mails, and she let me use her old e-mail for whatever I wanted, I never got around to changing it because I didn't see a reason to, and I used this e-mail for my youtube account. You know, the one that frequently sends me notifications that a composer with a suggestive Icon of a snake girl has made a new video.

I didn't worry about it too much though. Why would my Mom would use her old e-mail? And besides, what are the odds that this channel, which uploads only two times in a month, would make a new video while Mom is using her old e-mail?

Guess what happened...

My mom was using her ancient e-reader yesterday(which was still connected to her old e-mail) because her newer e-readers\*\*(plural)\*\* were dead. It was during this afternoon when the composer I've been talking about uploaded a new remix.

My mom called me inside and asked me why she was being recommended videos by a channel with a suggestively-drawn snake girl who's name is a portmanteau of 'succubus' as it's icon and banner.

"Uh, I like her music."

"..."

I got a long and awkward lecture about what I should and shouldn't be looking at on the internet. I tried to defend myself a little but she clearly didn't believe that I was just watching the music channel for the music.

She ended it with telling me not to use my phone for those things, and that she doesn't want to see me viewing inappropriate content anymore.

I need advice guys, If I wanted to look at snake girls I would do it under the safety of incognito mode, and now I can't listen to the music on this channel anymore around her.

How do I convince my mom that I'm watching for the songs, not the drawings of girls?
