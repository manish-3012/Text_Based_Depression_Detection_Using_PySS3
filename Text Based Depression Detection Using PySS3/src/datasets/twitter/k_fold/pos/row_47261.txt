I am once again asking for your financial support. (Please feel no obligation, as this is obviously 100% voluntary) Hi. I spent all my paycheck on this. Unfortunately my mom cut me off after a few hours. I feel terrible that I couldn't get to everybody, and I dont know if this is the place to ask for help, but if you could just award some of the people that didnt get any it would really make my day!
