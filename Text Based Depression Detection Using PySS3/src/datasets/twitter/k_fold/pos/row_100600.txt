I flunked my first ever test I just feel so awful and I need to write.

I have my Elearning finals this week and was really not looking forward to them. I took one of my test last week though and did absolutely horrible with a 50%. Luckily today the teacher let the whole class take a retake. The problem is even after taking it again I got the exact same score. It just sucks so much. I worked hard, I studied I asked my teacher questions and I still failed. I've been a straight A student my whole life and I've never gotten below a C on a testand all of a sudden I fail this one twice. I still have a B+ in the class so I don't know why im complaining, but I just feel so awful. My heart hurts and I just want to hibernate until the school year is over. I feel like I'm missing something that everyone else gets and I'm worse than all of my friends. I feel like I did everything write and I still just couldn't do it. I feel lost and confused and want to sleep so I guess ill just do that for a while.
