Small streamer appreciation post If you haven't ever joined a small streamer with 1-20 viewers or whatever then you are missing out. I love how close you are. I found this small streamer, plays all the games I like, we chat a lot, not many viewers, very kind, helped me choose parts for a pc and he even changed his whole schedule so we could chat on his streams, I'm 5 hours ahead of him btw. So yeah. Go find yourself a small streamer and show them some love.
