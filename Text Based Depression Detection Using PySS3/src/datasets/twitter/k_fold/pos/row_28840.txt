Am I the only one? So I recently got to talking to my gf, and I asked some other girls their kinks, ans they said rapeplay, bdsm, etc., and I started to look around Redd it for some stuff, I keep coming up with stuff about chicks liking dudes that are dom, big dicked, and extremely aggressive, and they cheat on their bf for them, and become a cumdump and other stuff, I had a panic attack because my gf likes that stuff, she said its ok because im not a hard dom, I'm soft with her, and I began having panic attacks and crying, it just hurt, are girls really like that or is my mind just messing with me?....
