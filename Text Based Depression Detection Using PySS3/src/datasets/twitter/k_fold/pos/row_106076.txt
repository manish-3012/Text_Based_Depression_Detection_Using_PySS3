Math is the bane of my existence rn Anyone ever get those hw questions where you get STUCK. Like Iâ€™ve been working on this awful question for the past hour. Like - literally in its intended sense. I couldnâ€™t even search up the answer because itâ€™s a word problem kslldlsl. Then I had a eureka moment where I finally figured it out :/ but I donâ€™t even feel good about it because it took so long like Iâ€™m internally crying rn ;-;
