Iâ€™m scared about exam results and honestly donâ€™t know how to stop worrying So in December i took mock tests which are very important as we donâ€™t have GCSES anymore. I feel like Iâ€™ve done terrible and itâ€™s eating me up inside. As much as Iâ€™m scared about the results which will cone in a couple weeks Iâ€™m scared about my mum. Sheâ€™s strict when it comes to my grades. No matter how many times I tell her to just be supportive and not put pressure, she puts pressure. She knows i struggle yet she still wants me to get 9s all the time (like an A**). Ive never gotten a grade that high yet so idk where sheâ€™s getting this from. Tbh i would talk to my friends about it but all they literally say is to stop worrying which is aight but i need more than that. I just needed to get this off my chest but thanks for reading this if you have :)
