There is something just mad about the weather I live in rural wales and there is loads of beautiful views here and I'm really grateful I was born into such a beautiful place but so many times I've looked out the window at the sky with the tress crossing into it and its made me feel this weird emotion and I'm not even sure whether or not the emotion feels happy or sad it just feels kinda weird but i sorta like it, it always makes me feel kinda sad but i also feel other things too and i can't even pinpoint why it makes me feel like this. I don't know why I posted this here but this has been proper on my mind and i needed to put it somewhere.
