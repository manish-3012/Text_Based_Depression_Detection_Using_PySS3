Iâ€™ve gotten to the point of stress sad tired angry that Iâ€™ve just let go and my posture is bad my voice is low and slow Iâ€™m tired literally everyday and everyone is tired of me Itâ€™s not my fault, I think I mean I just got over huge mental health issues (that I barely survived btw) abs now math comes right in to push my back down and Iâ€™m all weak again and I get so overwhelmed I feel like I canâ€™t do anything but cry, but I have to not cry because â€œboys shouldnâ€™t cryâ€ and anytime someone tried to teach my anything they just repeat themselves and I never understand, i lost all my friends and I have nothing, I have nothing to live for, I donâ€™t mean to sound like a pity party I just feel like thereâ€™s nothing anymore
