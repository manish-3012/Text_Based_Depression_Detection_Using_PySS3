My class just randomly developed class conciousness and unionized against the teachers So, our teachers have been treating us like shit lately, and some of the students have had the udea to just one day not join inline school. They realized that the school needs us to get higher grades just as much as we need the school, and that if we all just stop abiding they will have to bow to us. As of now there's a huge debate weather we should go on and strike or not, the class seems to be divided approximately in half.

My class is going through a socialist revolution right now.

Arise, ye workers from your slumbers, arise, ye prisoners of want...
