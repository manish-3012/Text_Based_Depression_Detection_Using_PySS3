No, you dont need friends. Stop lying to yourself. A lot of people think that you need to socialize to be healthy, but Im starting to think thats a myth. First of all, you cant trust them. Trust is stupid and you should always be skeptikal of someone, there is a chance they want to hurt you. When youre isolated, you dont have that risk. Having close friends is also dangerous. If you have a friend you tell a lot of stuff too, or even a girlfriend, there is a high chance they will use anything you say to them about yourself to bully you later in life. No one cares about you and you shouldnt care about anyone.
