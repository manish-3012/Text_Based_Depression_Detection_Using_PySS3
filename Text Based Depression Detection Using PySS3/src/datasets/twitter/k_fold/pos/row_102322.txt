I feel like telling a true story that happened to me. I'm not sure why I do but here we go. In my 8th grade, the students would go outside after lunch to just chill and wait for the next class. I was just existing by myself because I was too lazy to see what my idiotic friends were up to and a small group of girls approached me. They were some of the popular girls, I honestly didn't care enough to remember their names so all I knew was that they were popular or something. One of said girls was someone I was friends with in elementary school for a while, we were good friends but lost touch in like 3rd or 4th grade. The girl I actually knew was standing behind the other girls and acting flustered and a bit embarrassed. The popular girls who I didn't care enough to memorize the identities of told me that the girl I was friends with a long time ago had a crush on me. In this moment, I'd imagine I would have a deer in headlights response. However, this wasn't the case, I did the most reasonable thing possible. I laughed, said something along the lines of "I'm not falling for that" and walked away. I didn't trust nor like at least 99% of people at my school at the time. That's the story though. If you think I responded in the wrong way, then that's a damn shame because this story was like two years ago.
