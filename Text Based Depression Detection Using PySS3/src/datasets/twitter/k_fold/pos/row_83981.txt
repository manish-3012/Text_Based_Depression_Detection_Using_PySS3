Iâ€™m crying I appreciate anybody who reads to the end of this.

Whenever Iâ€™m alone and I have no distractions I always end up getting really sad and crying. Thinking about my past just messes me up. Iâ€™ll be talking about the difficulties in my life below, and just knowing that one person listens to this makes me feel better as if Iâ€™m not alone, even if itâ€™s strangers on reddit.

Starting with my earliest memories of elementary school, I remember not being included with all the other kids and always being an outcast. Iâ€™m assuming it was either because of how annoying I was, my passion for bugs, or how unkept I looked. Well, moving forward, I didnâ€™t have any friends in kindergarten.

In first grade I made one friend, her name was Kayla. I was fitting in with the other kids more. Although my dad and mom were constantly fighting which made me, in a way, separate myself from the other kids. Eventually they lived in different houses and me and my siblings took turns living with each of them for a week.

Experiencing this made me more weird as a kid, and I started fitting in even less. I became attention-seeking from the lack of attention my parents gave me but I tried earning it in a bad way by annoying everybody. Eventually I got on everybodyâ€™s bad side and nobody liked me, except my one friend Kayla.

Second grade my parents were having a lot of problems with each other and my siblings were being affected by it too. In turn, they became aggressive and fought and fought. I was bullied constantly by my two older siblings. Eventually I grew used to being by myself since Iâ€™m always isolated. I didnâ€™t pay too much attention to it.

Third grade was the last time I ever spoke to my dad before he disappeared to a different country. The last thing I remember saying to him was â€œWhen are you gonna come back?â€ And he said â€œNever.â€ And I started crying so my mom took the phone away from me and I couldnâ€™t communicate with him ever again.

Fourth grade Iâ€™m always alone. My only friend doesnâ€™t hang out with me as much. I was isolating myself completely from everybody else. My mom was depressed and always working because my dad took away all of our money and left us in debt. I didnâ€™t ever see my mom and the only love I got was from my aunts which I rarely ever see.

Fifth grade I was bullied by another girl. She told other people bad things about me and would hit me. I kept crying to my mom about it and my teacher but it didnâ€™t stop. Eventually my mom near the end of the grade finally talked to my bullies mom and she never talked to me again.

Sixth grade I wanted to change my life and get more friends. And it worked, I got friends. Although my mom is still broken from the divorce, and my siblings still bully me and laugh at me when Iâ€™m hurt.

Seventh grade I had severe anxiety and depression problems. I was mean to my friends sometimes too, which I really regret. I didnâ€™t really talk to anybody except my small circle of friends. My mom finally recovered from the debt we had.

Eighth grade I realized my dad started a new family. I looked up his Facebook account and saw videos of him teaching a little girl how to ride her bike. I also saw my mother cry in front of me for the first time during a therapy session.

Ninth grade my two closest friends lost someone who was even closer to them than me to suicide. I partially blame myself for his suicide, I donâ€™t want to go into detail.

Tenth grade and Iâ€™m depressed as fuck, Iâ€™m not the greatest person and life hurts.

Love anyone who bothered to read all this
