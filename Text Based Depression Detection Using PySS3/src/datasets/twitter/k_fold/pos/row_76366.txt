Ok I need your opinion Ok Iâ€™m really on edge on something. So my brother has some bald spots (heâ€™s 8 years old) we donâ€™t really know why we have sent him to a doctor and said itâ€™s just stress and so we did not know he had 3 other spots so my mom shaved his hair so we can see the other bald spots so my dad did the same thing and shaved his head to show that my brother isnâ€™t alone on this and so my dad wants me to do the same and donâ€™t really want to but I want to support my brother so if I get enough comments telling me to shave my head to support him I will and my hair is like 3 inches long so please let me know what I should do.
