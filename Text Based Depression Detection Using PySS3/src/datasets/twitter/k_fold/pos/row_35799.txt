So I'm in 9th grade biology right? And were righting definitions and it's so annoying as you have to be formal and not make it sound like your a weirdo who Jack's off daily. Like we were in meiosis a bit ago and instead of saying the sperm goes into the egg to create offspring its shit like "The male reproductive cell enters the female reproductive cell to create offspring of the organism" dumbass shit.
