No, late-teens working 70+ hrs weeks in total shouldn't be normal. I just turned 20 not long ago, and I just thought about the massively insane idea that some kids are spending 8+ hrs a week on travel to and from school, waking up early meaning more lost time because you cant realistically stay up late, homework, 40+ hrs a week at school minimum not including extra-curricular, and have a part time job while also usually being called lazy for not doing enough chores by parents at home. How did we normalize this? For those in that situation now, hang in there. Your work ethic is probably better than mine.
