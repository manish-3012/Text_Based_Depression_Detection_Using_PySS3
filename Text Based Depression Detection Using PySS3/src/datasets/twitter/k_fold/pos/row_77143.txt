Guys I need help so a few days ago me and my mom got into a major argument and it got to the point where we were shouting at each other. it was at this time that I finaly had enough and told here how much of a horrible parent she has been, that she has been emotional abusing me since the day i was born and how i havent called CPS i a miracle. and ou wanna know what she said in response? "omg i dont know who you are. you are such a lair. you are not my son." it was at this point i started to cry and tell her that why would I lie about something like this to which she keept saying that I was lying.

idk what to do, reddit is the only thing i have left, she took away everything I own from me and is now not letting me leave the house. (I know there is a pandmic and all but still) I am writing this on a school laptop so i cant text any of my irl friends for help. so I am asking you guys for help
