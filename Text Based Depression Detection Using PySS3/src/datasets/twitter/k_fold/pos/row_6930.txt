I slept over at a friends house for the first time in years I'm 14 and a very paranoid person and I have anxiety. I know for others this might seem like nothing but for me it is a big accomplishment. I successfully had a sleepover at a friends house for 2 nights. That is the first time I have ever done that. Usually when I try to have a sleepover at a friends house I get too anxious to stay so sleeping over for 2 nights was huge. Anyway I just wanted to say I'm proud of myself for this little thing :)
