Every day, we stray further from God. A teenager got stalked and harassed by another Redditor on r/teenagers. If I said who did the stalking, I'd be banned just like the victim. However, I am sure I can say who the victim is.

u/Thesavagepotato06 was stalked and harassed, called a bitch, and "invited" to a threesome. In the DMs she was called a whore, and the stalker threatened her with created twelve extra accounts to stalk her. She tried to warn this subreddit, but only got banned from it in the process. Her story is on her profile if you want to see it. The victim lost. Why?

I'm putting my account on the line to try to give justice to this fellow teenager. I am rising up against this tyranny, and I am asking you to join me.
