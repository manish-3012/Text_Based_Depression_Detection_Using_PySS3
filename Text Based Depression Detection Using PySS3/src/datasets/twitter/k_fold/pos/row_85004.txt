Hey, housabout we don't try to encourage a specific body type? Fr. If someone is expected to obtain a certain body type, but can't, it can be really detrimental to their personal image. Don't try to be muscle chonk. Don't try to be dummy thicc. Go to a gym for a year, see how you look then. If you see yourself able to obtain a certain physique THAT IS HEALTHY in the near future, and you WANT TO, then go for it. But try to see how u get in shape with a year of 45-1hr of basic strength training/hypertrophy exercises, about 30 mins of cardio, and a healthy diet that is well researched and can give you all of the minerals/nutrients you need. If you physically can't do that workout, make it a goal to do that workout. If you can't afford an amazing diet, try to see what you can get. But please; the gym is meant to be where you IMPROVE mentally and physically, not DETERIORATE. stay safe, stay happy, and stay 6ft/1.80m apart. Love y'all.





*also, if you have over 30% bodyfat, try to lose some of that when you go as well. It may not affect you now, but trust me, it'll affect you later.
