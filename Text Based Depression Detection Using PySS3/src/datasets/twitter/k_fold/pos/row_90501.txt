It's 2 AM I just did something so fucking stupid I made a 311 call because I heard a scream through my headphones while watching a video, in my neighborhood, and I got really fucking scared. 

Sounded like a woman screaming "No" in the distance.

I rewinded the video five seconds to make sure it wasn't from that, and then got up to stand at my window for a bit, trying to see if there was anything going on.

Dead silence. I get steadily more anxious and consider whether or not to call someone. Even made a post asking for advice as to what to do.

I have serious anxiety about making phone calls, especially if it's about reporting something to authorities, but I got over it and called anyway. Gave my address, name, number, described everything.

I sit for a while, ruminating on everything. Worried about that person I heard.

I decide to continue watching my video to calm myself down before trying to go to bed.

...With a sneaking horror, I rewind the video again, a bit further this time.

**There was no fucking person. It was in the video. I'm so fucking sleep deprived I mistook it for a real life person, and for some goddamn reason also heard it as higher pitched.** 

I scared the shit out of myself. called 311. and gave myself even more anxiety, over **a fucking let's play video**

I want to fucking die, someone just come and kill me please. Oh my god.
