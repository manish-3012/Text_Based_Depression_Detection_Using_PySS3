I quit Reddit back awhile ago but today something pretty crazy happened to me and my friend today. My name is Andrew Iâ€™m a teenager and I usually go to the field by my school when we get out school and I hang out with people but today I hanged out with my best friend at the field which didnâ€™t tell their parents that they were going to the field so after awhile of walking together to their house we got their after walking around my neighborhood and saying hi to another friend but after they got to their house I checked my phone to see almost 100 notifications from my parents saying that I was last seen with a missing person which was my friend and that they need to know where I am and so I called them told them my friend is safe and Iâ€™m by local field so they picked me up and from there thatâ€™s pretty much that. Not very good writing but Iâ€™m no writer
