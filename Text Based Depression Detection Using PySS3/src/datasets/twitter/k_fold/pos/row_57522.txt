I'm so freaking tired [this is filler text ignore it] but I can't sleep cause this girl asked something about school and I told her I'd tell her when I found out but I also happen to have a massive crush on her  but anyways I know now but it doesn't really matter anymore and it's late and I also don't think she cares but also what if she does like bro. I keep thinking of when we could talk to eachother which was for 4 hours per week for this thing we did together that way 6th-9th grade and now she's in 10th and I'm in 8th so we probably will never see eachother again. Fuck Coronavirus. It doesn't even matter though cause she has a boyfriend and idek if she even likes girls but I know she doesn't like me and I've been in love with her since literally the moment I saw her and I want to get over her but I can't 

anyways if you read this far you must really be bored lol have a good day/night/afternoon
