I think a restaurant I went to a year ago was sexist. For context, I'm a male.

I went to this restaurant in my city for my aunt and uncle's wedding anniversary. The food wasn't bad. I had to go to the bathroom, and this is February, so pre-virus restrictions. There were three dudes waiting in line, so I waited behind them. The bathroom setup went like this: There was a women's bathroom and an all-gender bathroom. I thought it was weird that there was no men's bathroom. As I waited for the three dudes to finish up, I think six or seven women passed me and used the bathroom in the women's room. I got a peek inside the women's bathroom (I didn't go in) but from the view I got, it looked like a nice and modern bathroom with two stalls, a flower pot (with fake flowers) and mints. Then the guy in front of me stepped out and I stepped into the all-gender bathroom. It was... crap. The tile had cracks and was crappy. There was one toilet and a sink, and the bathroom in general was dirty. The broom and dustpan were still in there too. The toilet had some scratches and so did the mirror. The entire time as I sat there taking a dump, I was thinking, "what the fuck?" 

The fact that the women got their own restroom which was nice and clean and had two stalls and the men were stuck with an all-gender bathroom which was crap just pissed me off so much.

If I'm being sexist let me know, but I just think this is outrageous, this is unfair.
