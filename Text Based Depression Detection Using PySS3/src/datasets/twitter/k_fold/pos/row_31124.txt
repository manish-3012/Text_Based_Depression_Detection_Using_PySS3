I think I found someone Ok, Iâ€™m keeping this vague for reasons.  But thereâ€™s this girl in my math classes who seemed pretty smart and cute and all that shit, and I was talking to her today.  She was really vibe-able, I was talking to her and she wasnâ€™t opposed to my sense of immature humor and shit and me and the boys were taking about hentai and shit and she didnâ€™t make it awkward.  And sheâ€™s a gamer.  AND SHE LIKES ANIME.  So yeah, sheâ€™s pretty tuff, and I kinda like her, Iâ€™m still gonna see if I can get to know her better or if something else happens then it happens, but this is probably going to get deleted if it gets big bc sheâ€™s on this sub.  But yeah, whatever happens happens, but sheâ€™s tuff.
