Does anyone remember a life calculator website? I remember when we were learning about money and stuff in middle school we went on a website where we went step by step with how expensive a home we wanted, how much a pet would add, how much a car payment would be, how expensive entertainment and movies would be, how much babies are, ect. It added up into an approximation of how expensive a life you would have and what jobs could support that lifestyle.

 I can't seem to find this anywhere, and I think it would be very useful right now.
