My inconsiderate neighbor Merry Christmas, everyone. I'm writing this from about 12:10 am December 25 my time, because my inconsiderate neighbor has been shooting fireworks all night and I haven't been able to get ANY SLEEP AT ALL. I JUST WANT TO PUNCH HIM/HER. This isn't the first time they have done this, though. Major news sources call the election for Biden? FIREWORKS. Thanksgiving? FIREWORKS. Absolutely no reason at all? FIREWORKS!!!! IT DRIVES ME SO INSANE AND I JUST WANT THEM TO FUCKING STOP BECAUSE I HAVEN GOTTEN ANY SLEEP AND IT IS CHRISTMAS FUCKING EVE EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING!!!!
