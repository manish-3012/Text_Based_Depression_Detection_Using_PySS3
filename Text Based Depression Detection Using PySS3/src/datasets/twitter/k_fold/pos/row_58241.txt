My crush has a crush on me. Right before school got out in March of 2020, I had met this girl in my History class. She's tall, blonde, pretty, and has blue eyes, and I'm sorta attracted to her. Me, an Asian dude, wouldn't have guessed she really liked me. During class, we sat at the same table, and we talked a bit about our lives. Unfortunately, I have no way to contact her because we didn't get each other's addresses and phone numbers. And I'm not sure if school is ever going to return back in session this school year. Next year, I  will be going into High School, and it's gonna be hard trying to find her in the crowd.
