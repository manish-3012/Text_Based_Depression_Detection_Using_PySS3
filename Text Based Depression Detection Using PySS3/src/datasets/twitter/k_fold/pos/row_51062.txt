You are a cat You thought I was going to list emotional or behavioral similarities between you and a cat but no, it was me, you share 90% of your DNA with a cat. Your cells run on the same sort of energy and act the same, there are such things as cat girls. You are made of the same elements and atoms as a cat, the same chemical reactions. If cat girls are able to reproduce with humans hypothetically, then they too are technically humans (one can usually only make fertile offspring of a given individual of their own species), but that would mean that humans are cats, therefore, humans are cats. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
