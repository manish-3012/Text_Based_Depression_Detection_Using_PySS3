I tried to jump on it and my legs hit it and i fell on my head So this happened in my school today. So i jumped to this railing. And first time i managed to jump on it. But the second time my both legs hit the railing and i fell on my head to the ground next to th raling. My head didn't hurt at all but my legs did so yeah. I didn't know where to post this so i posted it here. This wasn't very exciting but whatever.
