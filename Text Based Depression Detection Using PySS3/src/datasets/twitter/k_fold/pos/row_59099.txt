Having a girl over this Saturday, mom said sheâ€™s gonna be â€œa nosey parentâ€. What do Ok so hopefully if she doesnt flake, im gonna be having a girl come over to my house this Saturday to lets say, netlfix and chill. 

My house is pretty big, 3 parts, downstairs, upstairs, thats where my mom stays, then the attic, thats where i stay. Its 3 big rooms up here tho so its really not even like an attic, when you come up theirs a kitchen, then bedroom 1, living room, then bedroom 2. So i have a lot of space and my mom is cool with having the girl come up here with me to hang out since my mom doesnt let me out the house due to covid.

She didnt set too many restrictions, but she did say â€œno getting on beds, and no mushy stuff, cuz i will be a nosey parentâ€. To be fair i wasnt really planning on having sex or anything cuz i dont have any condoms, but we might want to make out or if im lucky sheâ€™ll suck me up, but now im kind of scared cuz my mom might force it. I mean, im 17 can you at least let me have a lil bit of privacy alone with someone? 

She hardly comes upstairs due to the fact her lungs are horrible so she canâ€™t do stairs like that.  I feel like at most sheâ€™ll probably just call me down to check on how weâ€™re doing but idk. What yall think?
