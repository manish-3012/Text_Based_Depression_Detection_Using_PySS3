I can post now. yay I can finally post on this sub after being here for 7 days now. I have made enough karma to post. To be honest I have way too much karma than I deserve but you guys are amazing. This is a second account for doing whatever I want without being recognised by friends.

You might have seen my shitty comments but probably not I'm not particularly significant. Thanks for helping me get the karma I need. This account has nearly the same amount as my other one and I've had that for nearly 2 years. I must comment a lot.

Anyway, expect to hear from me soon. Appreciate ya
