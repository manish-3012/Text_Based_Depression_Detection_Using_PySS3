Idk, I'm just thinking So I used to have a playlist of music that played on the radio during a drive on the 2nd with my most recent ex, is it weird that when any of those songs come on now on my main playlist, I still get the feels? 

We broke up a few months before quarantine started, so I'm kinda stuck in a rut, not exactly self-pity because I've found a ton of stuff to do, and though there was a lot of animosity between us after we broke up, we have a tenuous friendship sort of forced upon us by life situation and academic similarities (we both TA for the same teacher and have a lot of the same periods  \*again\*)

This is kind of my non-upset, just mildly musing rant

Also, she's the reason my senior quote is "Don't look at the mariachi man", someone let me know if they want that story ig
