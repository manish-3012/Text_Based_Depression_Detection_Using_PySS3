Please help me find this guy I played among us with on Saturday I played among us on Saturday as I was bored, and I found this guy that I had played a few games with. He had the color black and the plague doctor hat and his username was doggy69, and he was so nice to. My username was onee-chan. I had the cyan color and red horns. I know it seems silly to try to find him as a lot of people play among us, but I would really like to play with him again. Please, if you should meet him, can you say hello for me? I would be really grateful! And Doggy, of you're reading this, Please DM Me!
