Why is YouTube Mobile so inconvenient? I can think of 4 things off the top of my head that would make YouTube almost perfect (from a viewer's perspective, at least)

1. The ability to either translate or filter out comments that aren't in your language

2. Putting comment notifications and video notifications under two different tabs

3. Being able to loop videos

4. A comment history feature
