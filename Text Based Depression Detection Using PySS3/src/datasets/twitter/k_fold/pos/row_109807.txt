Tips on appearing more interesting to a girl? I 14M have been texting with a girl 14F for a while, though she doesnâ€™t seem too interested in me.
We know ourselves pretty good, we went to the same school for four years, have got Latin, PE, school trips etc. together and are relatively good friends, but we actually donâ€™t talk that much, because she is a little shy.
I need to add that  I am a pretty popular dude in my class, if not the most popular, especially with girls, and I often get told that many girls are interested in me. 
So it starts when I once sent this girl a snap, and she send one back, so we got into a little conversation. The problem is I canâ€™t really tell if she is interested,because it sometimes takes her a long time to respond,around 15-30 mins even though she is online. 
Now do some of you guys have tips on how to appear more interesting to her, so we can chat more regularly and even get to talk sometimes? Because I have to admit I kinda like her, but I canâ€™t really tell if she is interested too, because she is so shy.
