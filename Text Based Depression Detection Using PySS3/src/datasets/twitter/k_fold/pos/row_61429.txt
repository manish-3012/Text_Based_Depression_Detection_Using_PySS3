How do i tell my crush that i find her really cute without it sounding like i'm just trying to cheer her up? The thing is we're kinda like step-brothers, and she has a low self-esteem over her body, but i find her really cute, like, very much, Da vinci has some competence with the masterpiece she is, and i want to tell her that.

I already did once, it was smth like "you're really pretty", an she said "yeah sure...", how can i make it sound genuine?
