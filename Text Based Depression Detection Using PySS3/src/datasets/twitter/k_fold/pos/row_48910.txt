So I want to try something but I kind of need a wee bit of help I want to keep track of when I have bad thoughts or really bad days so I thought since I like art I could fill a page with shapes or something to colour and mark the date of the bad thought on, but I donâ€™t really know what I could do. All I know I want to do is have wee sections big enough to colour and write a date. If anyone has any ideas on like shapes or designs I could do that would be really helpful. Thanks, also I hope you had a nice day
