SURVEY FOR PEOPLE WHO PLAY THE GUITAR Hey so I'm doing a school project so I have a couple of questions for guitar players if anyone doesn't mind answering them. I would really appreciate it!

1) How often do you play the guitar?

2) do you clean your strings? If so how often?

3) when was the last time you cleaned them?

4) how does your strings feel now (ie. is it sticky etc)

6) what method do you use for cleaning?(be kind specific pls)

7) would you say that method is effective?

Also say what type of guitar you have (i.e bass , electric etc.)
