Accepting people of religion is something most of you need to do I want to start off by saying Iâ€™ll be friends with anyone. Black, white, gay, straight, cis, trans, Christian, Buddhist, whatever. Iâ€™ll be friends with you, as long as your nice to me. Iâ€™ll even be best friends if we connect. You can try to change anything you want about me (even though it might not work), but never, ever try to change my religious beliefs. Itâ€™s not just something I believe in, itâ€™s something my whole life revolves around, and you really need to understand that. You have different beliefs than us, and thatâ€™s okay. But donâ€™t call my religion an â€œancient hideous death cultâ€ (which is something that has been said to me multiple times) and donâ€™t call my God an â€œinvisible magic skydaddyâ€. Itâ€™s offensive and also very hurtful. Please, respect my religion and donâ€™t insult it. Thatâ€™s all I ask for.
