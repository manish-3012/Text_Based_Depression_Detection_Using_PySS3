I heard footsteps outside my house I could hear them in the snow, and the automatic light thingy turned on meaning there was some movement, so naturally I am a little spooked. I waited a bit and then went to the window, and there were fresh tracks in the snow going from around the front of my house to the back gate, which is very odd. I donâ€™t really know what reason anyone would have to be walking around at 2am going into peoples gardens. I donâ€™t live anywhere dangerous so itâ€™s just strange. Anyway, this happened about an hour ago, and I havenâ€™t gotten to sleep.
