I created a new subreddit about online school where you can put stories, videos and images from online classes r/OnlineClassesEvents

Rules: 
1. Try(not forced, but to keep clean) to not put other things than those mentiones above(but I will not enforce to much this)

2. English is preffered

I will put this post again for non-American(because of timezones)
