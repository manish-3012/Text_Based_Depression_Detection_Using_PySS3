anybody else feel like their life is boring? watching tiktoks of people my age or even younger going out with friends, on adventures or whatever and i just cant help but feel like im wasting my time on the internet 8 hours a day. i cant remember the last time i left the house without my parents and did something. i have friends dont get me wrong but its never a close relationship, its enough that i dont eat alone at lunch but not enough that we hang out after school or text eachother. i barely talk to anyone and im awkward; im afraid that this will be how i spend the rest of my teenage years. hearing all this talk about how i should cherish this time and that its the best moments of your life are making me depressed.
