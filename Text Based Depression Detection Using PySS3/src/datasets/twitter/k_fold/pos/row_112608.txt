Help me beat/screw this competition lmao Okej bored quarantined mfs.

I begrudgingly was forced to participate in this government simulation BS. So far I've been winging it as much as is possible. We have the crappiest political party that is boring asf. Now the voting procedure takes place through a google form that is accessible to ANYONE, which we all know is a GREAT idea. Now I've been trying to find a way to screw with this as much as possible. Now I honestly don't give two shits but it'd be fucking hilarious if we won the election, just to screw with the tryhards:

Just fill in whatever email, and on this option: "Svoj hlas vo voÄ¾bÃ¡ch do dolnej komory parlamentu fiktÃ­vneho Å¡tÃ¡tu Costa di Educatio udeÄ¾ujem strane:" Select the option that says "hades".

(this aint data harvesting, the competition is a real thing, compliant with GDPR and all that shit)
