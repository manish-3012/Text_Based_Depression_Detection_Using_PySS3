Tik Tok is not bad. I'll get downvoted straight to the deepest depths of hell, but fuck it.

Tik Tok isn't bad. Despite whatever the dumbass bandwagon that you are all following states about Tik Tok, it isn't bad. I genuinely fucking hate all of the posts on this subreddit and this website about Tik Tok being bad. It's not. If you guys would just spend more than five fucking minutes on the app, then you would know. Let me break it down for you.

The whole "pressuring minors into twerking on camera" thing don't exist.

LITERALLY FUCKING NOWHERE IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE APP THAT PRESSURES MINORS TO TWERK ON CAMERA!

If a minor decides to twerk on camera, it's the parent's fault. Not Tik Tok's.

Tik Tok is a good ap with good people and good content, but for some reason, only the cringy shit makes it on the front page of the internet.
