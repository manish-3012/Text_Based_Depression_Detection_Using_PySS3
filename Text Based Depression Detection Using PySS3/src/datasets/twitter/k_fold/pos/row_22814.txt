Girlfriend Application! ! ! H e l o I'm Rachel, i'm lonely and want a snuggle buddy (i'm 15)

i'm sweet, a democrat, short, my friends say i'm funny, i have good memes, shy, kinda awkward, and i don't have tiktok 

I am a feminist but i also don't think guys are evil, and i think a lot of women have "equality" mixed up. Because I want equality, but I also don't think women are above guys and I think a lot of women are sexist towards dudes and that's just hypocritical

I lowkey look like a pixar mom so if that's your thing&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I will answer any questions you have about me **thank you for coming to my ted talk**
