I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do for colleges. Can anyone please help? Iâ€™m currently a junior in highschool and I need information about colleges and such and I donâ€™t even know where to began. I live in SoCal and Iâ€™m either planning for a business major in accounting/actuary or premed. Please send me resources or anything. Thank you
