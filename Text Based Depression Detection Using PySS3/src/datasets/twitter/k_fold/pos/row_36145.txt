Chemistry teacher pulled a "im not an artist" I am in online class and the yeacher sends a photo of the lesson of today, in the middle of the photo is a drawing with electrons and neutrons and other stuff, when the teacher got to that part she said "well as you can see im not an artist but thats no problem"
