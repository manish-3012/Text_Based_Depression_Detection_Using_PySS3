I really want to drop out of high school I don't want anything. I don't want to do anything. I really couldn't care less about my own future.

I'm concidering dropping out of high school. There's nothing for me there. I don't want to do anything with my life so the diploma is useless. I don't associate with other people there so that's not a reason for me to stay either.

But it's not really my decision to make. I'm still living in my parent's house. They pay for everything so they get to decide what I'm doing.

I'm inadequate to take care of myself so moving out isn't an option.

I'm just going to have to get this diploma and then decide whether to work at McDonald's or jump off a bridge.
