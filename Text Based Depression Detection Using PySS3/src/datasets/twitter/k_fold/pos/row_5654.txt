Guys I need help. I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. 
Any time I see violence or some shit, I get massive adrenaline bursts, and I get really violent when I'm pissed off. Like I used to have control, but now I'm losing it, and I don't want to hurt someone and regret it later. Anything I can do?
