The hell just happened? My best friend that is lesbian was having a really bad day, and I was talking to her trying to comfort her when my phone goes off. I use the excuse of I need to use the bathroom brb, and look at my message and it's from our other friend. she said that earlier our lesbian friend wouldn't stop talking about me during school, and she thinks she likes me.  I said no way she is gay.  I came out of the bathroom and she said "thank you, you're the only person that even tried to help me.". [the reason she was upset was because her girlfriend broke up with her] I went in for a hug and I noticed her blushing, and she wasn't hugging me back so I let go of her asking what's wrong did I cross the line and she said no. I thought she went to hug me, but instead she kissed me.  I'm not sure if she was caught up in the moment or she was serious about it. But I don't think the timing was a coincidence.
