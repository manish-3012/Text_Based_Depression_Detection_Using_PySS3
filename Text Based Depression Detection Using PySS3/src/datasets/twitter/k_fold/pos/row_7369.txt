My life is crap So a while ago I was asking for advice of her to confess to my crush that I like her and well I manned up and did it, not using any of the advice as I thought that would end badly. But it would have probably been better then what actually happened.

So I texted her expressing my feelings she replied â€œokâ€ then left me on read for every message after that so fuck me and my life. I would have probably been ok if she said I donâ€™t feel that way back or you know anything that actually tells me what she actually feels about me saying that but no she put ok and Iâ€™m now more depressed then ever and it doesnâ€™t help that she is in almost every one of my classes within a few meters from where I sit.

Hopefully this doesnâ€™t seem like Iâ€™m making her out to be a bitch because she isnâ€™t, this was just a way for me to vent
