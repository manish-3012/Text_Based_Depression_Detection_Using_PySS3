Well my parents are transphobic I asked for a binder (because Iâ€™m gender fluid and afab) and they said no. I asked why and they said shitty and cringey things like â€œhealth reasonsâ€ and â€œyouâ€™re still growingâ€. I understand the health reasons one because itâ€™s dangerous to bind for too long because it might bruise your ribs. But the â€œyour still growingâ€ reason I do not understand. People who were literally ten wore the same binder that I wanted to buy. They only fucking reason why it would do any damage is because we used it wrong. They also say things like â€œbut youâ€™re our DAUGHTERâ€ (they emphasize the daughter part) and â€œwhat makes you think this wayâ€ and â€œitâ€™s a phaseâ€ and â€œwe donâ€™t understand you and why this has happened. Weâ€™re bad parentsâ€ WHAT THE LITERAL FUCK!! YOU SAID YOUâ€™D SUPPORT ME THROUGH ANYTHING AND WHEN I CAME OUT AS GENDER FLUID YOU SAID IT WAS A FUCKING PHASE AND THAT I WASNâ€™T QUALIFIED TO SAY HOW I FELT!  Anyways fuck that shit and have a good day to whoever is reading this!
