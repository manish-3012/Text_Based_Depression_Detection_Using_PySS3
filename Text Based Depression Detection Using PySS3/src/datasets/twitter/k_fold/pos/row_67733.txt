My krush seems to be in yet another shitty relationship I kant do this anymore, I kant keep waiting and hoping. 

I was going to ask her out in a week or so, as soon as I got some alone time with her. 

But that doesnt seem likely anymore, she has another boyfriend, who from what I've heard her say is a childish dumbass. 

What's more, if it got out that I asked, my friends would judge me for liking her, she isnt the sort of person you want to get involved with, from their perspektive, they dont know as much about her as I do. 

I feel like it might even work between us, but I'm too skared, and I kant keep hoping for a mirakle. 

Would I be an idiot if I just sent her a text saying I kant talk to her anymore. 

Its eating me away, and I kant take it. 

I'm klearly obsessed, but with nothing to distrakt me, I'd at least appresiate if she said no. But I dont want to ask her bekause she has a boyfriend, and that's just rude.
