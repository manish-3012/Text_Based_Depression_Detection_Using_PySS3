I just released a full-scale song on Spotify through a label! This song is all about getting both sides of a story from everyone involved, and I did my best to capture it all. I used a lot of studio magic and synthesizers to bring it to lofe. It was so much fun to produce this and I hope everyone loves it as much as I loved making it!
