Oh boy sure do looove being the oldest child Nothing quite like getting 3x the responsibilities but 1/3 of the emotional support because you are the more responsible smart one. Where as your little brother gets at least 5 hours a week one on one time, a therapist, and help cuz â€œhe needs itâ€ but you donâ€™t cuz you have straight Aâ€™s even though you have the same freaking mental disorder. So even though you are mentally breaking down you canâ€™t just freaking talk about it cuz youâ€™re the easy child.

I donâ€™t care if they fake it. I just want them to be interested in my hobbies too. It may not be as fun to listen to as video games, but I want to talk about my sports practice and my current craft projects too. I want someone to listen to me.

So yeah, Iâ€™m having a mental breakdown in the bathroom at 10 pm. How are yâ€™all doing?
