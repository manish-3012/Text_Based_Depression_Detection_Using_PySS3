when did this subreddit become such a shitty place?! I just lost 100 karma and was being attacked for basically stating one of the more alternative beliefs. Now me being a whole ass  goth, punk, and gay did not expect so many toxic people here.  Geez yall **IF** **you disagree with someones statement you can just fing scroll-**

This is just a very toxic place. There is nobody with morals. It was fun ig for the first few days but now its a chore. bye yall \*blows kiss\*

Edit:I will be sticking around for another day just for ppl to react to this post but after that im gone-

# Edit #2: thats it most of yall are stupid af. You are not getting my point and I have lost 100 sum karma. yall are too ignorant to listen to what I have to say- instead of listening you are attking. 

# now good riddance with this subreddit-

*^(\*bows\*)* *I will now take my leave.*
