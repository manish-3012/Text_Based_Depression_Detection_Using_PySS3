Feel better if youâ€™re rejected I literally just have two simple points.
1- If they said something that made you feel even worse like â€˜ewâ€™, then you should be glad they did because youâ€™ve dodged a bullet.

2- Just think for a minute: why do you care that youâ€™ve been rejected? Probably because now itâ€™s gonna be hella awkward when you see them again, right? But if you donâ€™t care you got rejected, itâ€™s not gonna be awkward
