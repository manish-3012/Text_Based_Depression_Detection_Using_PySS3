Guess who spewed up for 2 hours on their first date... YOU GUESSED, IT WAS ME. Pretty horribly embarrassing and I felt like absolute garbage too but honestly it wasnt thattt bad. She looked after me and drove me back to her house so I could lay in her bed while she gave me head scritches.

She also said she'd like me to see her weekly, after school. I'm feelings better because of this
