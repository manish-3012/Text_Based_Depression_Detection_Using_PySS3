Poting here because my post on r/casualconverstion got delited_________i wanna cut my wrists (English is my 2nd language, so some words may be spelled wrong)Im currently in bed typing this, because my parents never come into my room. Lately sience school started, ive been seeing frends from my school, wich brings me a bit of joy, but it gives me a lot of anxaeaty to say a wrong word anywhere wich makes me wanna curl up into a ball, and die. I dont think i have depression, i may do, but i dont think so. the only thing that takes my mind of from it is pain, wheter ist poking myself with a pen to a point where i penetrate skin, or biting my hand to the point where blood starts coming out. Sence im a teenager, my parents have been putting a lot of pressure on me, to do tasks, chores, school and so on, my mom has even been making fun of me over the pandemic for not having any friends, and now when scholl is back, i cant hang out with anyone because im always buisy. My stepdad, instead of explaining what to do with tasks he gives me, he lectures me on how bad i am at everything, it gives me anxaety. Im constantly paranoid about evrything and i just want eberything to stop. I read that instead of cutting my wrists i draw on it. It didnt help, i just wanna cut my hands off and just let the blood bleed out, if anyone on reddit has been through this, please do you have any sugestions on what to do. Please
