Why I hate online school Iâ€™ve never liked online school, and I never will. The only reason I give a f*ck about school is because of friends. But because of corona, we have to do online school, which means no more friends. That also means fare f*cking well my social life. Now I know that I can also text, call, or face time my friends, but itâ€™s just not the same. Also, I f*cking hate having to get up early in the morning. Before I didnâ€™t really care since my reward for doing so was getting to see my friends. But now, Iâ€™m getting up early just to go to â€œclassâ€, listen to a boring as hell lesson, and do work that I donâ€™t give two sh*ts about. Also, online school has made me feel unmotivated. I just want to be able to not feel like a worthless piece of sh*t by cleaning up, getting up in the morning, exercising, study Japanese, or whatever else. But after school, I always just donâ€™t want to do anything. 
On that note, the school never really feels done. Like, in actual school, you get that feeling of, â€œItâ€™s over.â€ But I never get that in online school. All I get is moving from my desk to my bed. Alright, rant over.

Tldr: I hate online school because I canâ€™t see my friends and I feel unmotivated.
