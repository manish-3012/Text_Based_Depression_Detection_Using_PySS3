Classroom Jeopardy In my Freshman and Sophomore years of high school, I had this awesome teacher who made history really fun. And before every test, he would have us play Jeopardy in class as a sort of review. I always won because I was the only one among my classmates who realized that the squares with the daily double were in the exact same place every time, and I strategically picked out squares so that I could get them when they were available.

Side note: My History teacher had a rule in Jeopardy that we could only pick a square if it was the lowest available one in that collumn, so we couldn't just start off by getting 500's.
