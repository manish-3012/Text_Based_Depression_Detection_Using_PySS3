Anyone with siblings who have left for college, Has your parents been more nitpicky with you. My sister went to college this past year and I knew that I was going to get more attention from my parents. But my parents used to never care what the state of my bedroom was like(cloths, trash,etc.) but they now 1 month after she left I have been screamed at by my parents because my bedroom was messy.
