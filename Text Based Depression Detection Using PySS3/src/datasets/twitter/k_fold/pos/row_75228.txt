This subreddit messed up my mind Like im reading all these posts about ppl and relationships, and suicides, and lgbtq, people being sad, people being really happy etc. And like i gave soo much of my thoughts, i dont know what i want anymore, like i dont know what i think about gay people or about girls or like what friends i actually prefer, almost anything. Idk how why or what happened, and i cant stop reading the posts. Im feeling weird. Anyone else?
