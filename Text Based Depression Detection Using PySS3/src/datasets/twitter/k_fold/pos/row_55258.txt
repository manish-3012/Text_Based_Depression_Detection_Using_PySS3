For anyone that wants to ask someone out, but is too scared to, then I have a quote for you (It is not my quote, and I cannot give credit sadly... No name was listed. Oh, and of course this quote goes for many other things too, I was just using a relatable example). â€œI do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.â€ (This is gender neutral. I would change the words but I wanted it to be exact).
