might come out to my mom as trans tomorrow Well, at least tell her iâ€™m questioning. Iâ€™ve been questioning whether iâ€™m actually a girl the past few months and recently I havenâ€™t had nearly as much doubt. Maybe thisâ€™ll help me get to a definitive answer, but Iâ€™m very excited and nervous at the same time aaaa 

Not sure how the rest of my family would react, but I know at least my mom is pretty open minded, so iâ€™m hoping itâ€™ll go well if I do decide to go through with it. I also just really wanna try out fem clothing and all that so iâ€™m hoping thisâ€™ll open that door for me
