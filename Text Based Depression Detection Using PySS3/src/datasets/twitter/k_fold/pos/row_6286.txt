My post blew up, and it's stupid I have such little karma. The other day, on r/todayilearned I posted about something I learned about a burger place. I got 100K upvotes and a crap ton of awards. Before that day I had around 13K karma, but now I have 28.1K karma. This is dumb. I should be getting a lot more karma. I don't cause that much controversy to the point where I get downvoted to hell all the time either, I got maybe 200 downvotes at most. I should have at least 50K or even 75K karma.
