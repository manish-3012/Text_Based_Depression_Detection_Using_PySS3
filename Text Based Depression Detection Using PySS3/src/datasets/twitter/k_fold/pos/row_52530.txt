Am I close minded or is this stupid I have two friends that have decided they're both two different people. I respect their pronouns and all and call them whatever name they want to be, but the fact that people take this seriously, that these friends of mine take this seriously boggles my mind. The names they have for their alternative persons are so fucking pretentious and stupid too lmao. Am I bigoted or do others also think this is stupid? Maybe I just don't understand it fully? Idk I just think it's a bit odd to identify as two people and the fact that it's two of my friends (they're closer with each other than they are with me) makes me wonder if they're just doing this to be cool or smthing
