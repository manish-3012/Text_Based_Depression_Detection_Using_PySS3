Hijacking of body positivity. I havent done full research just yet, but wanted to hear some opinions. Was looking at some r/fatlogic posts and body positivity came up a lot. Wasnt the body positivity movement meant to be like for disabled people? Not for fat slobs who blame their laziness on other people. Am I right on this
