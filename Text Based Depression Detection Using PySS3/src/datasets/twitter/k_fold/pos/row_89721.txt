NNN NNN NNN NNN EVERYWHERE. I am so fucking tired of NNN everywhere. Itâ€™s just stupid. â€œOh yeah this is a cool idea, I wonâ€™t masturbate during a month for literally no reason whatsoeverâ€

The first posts were funny... But Iâ€™ve been scrolling through new for more than half an hour and guess what?

EVERY SINGLE POST IS NNN RELATED.

Pls, can we go back at the normal shitposting?
