I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my life and have nothing to give 
So basically I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my life so far, particularly my teenage years. Iâ€™m 18 now and have just realised what Iâ€™ve missed, being me. 

I havenâ€™t been able to express myself, I was always too afraid to come out as gay and be me. Iâ€™m living an alternative version of me, one that pretends Iâ€™m strong, one that pretends Iâ€™m not interested in relationships, one that pretends Iâ€™m ok. But Iâ€™m not ok, I want to be me but I feel like I canâ€™t, I feel like Iâ€™ve missed the time I was supposed to develop and find myself, instead I still live in a lie. 

Iâ€™m sad, pathetic and weak. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends and my relationship with my family has deteriorated. I think sometimes I just want to fold myself up as tight as possible and cry, but then I remember my mum tell me that boys donâ€™t cry, boys are strong, but Iâ€™m not. 

Iâ€™ve failed at everything, I have no skills to speak of and no way to continue my life as it is. I canâ€™t even write properly. I just donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much point to my life anymore, Iâ€™m just a burden on people. When ever I text people I feel guilty that they have to take time to talk to ME the useless, shy and sad kid. I have nothing to give to the world but I am taking everything. People include me in things not because they want to but they feel they have too.

Iâ€™ve resorted to posting pictures of myself on online in an attempt to give me validation, a reason to keep going. But then I look at myself as think â€˜what is that why would anyone like thatâ€™. People tell me Iâ€™m cute but Iâ€™m not, at least I donâ€™t think I am. Im just another annoying person filling up space that could be occupied by someone useful. 

I canâ€™t bring myself to keep going, I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s anything for me here. I donâ€™t want to die, Iâ€™m scarred of death but I sometimes think thatâ€™s really the only option left. I donâ€™t like to think that Iâ€™m depressed, just sad and lonely. 

Iâ€™m an imposter in my own body. I want to be able to paint my nails with the girls and go drinking with my buddies but I donâ€™t have any buddies to talk of. Iâ€™m just lonely, sad, and useless. 

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing this here, cause I know not many people will see it, I know people will just say empty words to make me feel better, I know Iâ€™m just waisting mine and everybody elseâ€™s time just like Iâ€™ve wasted my life. I have no confidence and no friends and no skills. 

I have nothing to give but take everything, thatâ€™s what I tell myself. I want to cry but boys donâ€™t cry. I want to go but Iâ€™m scarred.
