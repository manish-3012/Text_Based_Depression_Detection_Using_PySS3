Weird dream I had that I donâ€™t understand So I picked my friend up so my parents could drive us to go snowboarding. When we got their I realized I also forgot a bunch of things. For some reason we didnâ€™t get a ski pass, and I made one run. I got out of my snowboard in the middle of the hill and slide the rest of the way. When I got back down I saw mi friend was being taken away by ski patrol inside the lodge. A women came out and asked me if I had a ski pass. I said no. I had to wait for her outside of the lodge while she was talking. I was really scared and wanted my parents. She came back out and made me get in her car. She seemed really nervous. She drove me through a trail through the woods. Once we got to the end we pulled up to a beach. There was three huge mansions. She told me donâ€™t talk to her because sheâ€™s scared. All of a sudden she drove into the water and the car sunk. I woke up right then.
