I'm 14m and still like it to talk about sex I think that's more a being-11-13yo-topic.
Yes, I am a virgin, and I find it interesting to discuss it with people. I know, it sounds weird, but a friend if mine, not a virgin anymore, and, mostly, I talk about that topic, because, mostly, I find it interesting to hear where, how, why,...
I know, it's kinda normal to talk about that topic when you started to get into puberty, but I'm already round about 3-4 years in it.

Well, now I'd find it cool to hear your opinion about that. 
Maybe there are even other people in my age that still listen/talk to/about that and so on...?
