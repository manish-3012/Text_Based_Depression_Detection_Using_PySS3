This shit needs to stio So yesterday, my friend had a girl texting him that she liked him. My friend was also interested in the girl, so they started flirting a little bit. Today, the girl out of the blue says that it was a dare and that she doesn't actually like him. This is the fucking reason people have trust issues. People get hurt by this and it's all for a stupid game. People should only have relationships or attempt one if they actually like the person. It makes me so fucking mad that people do this shit all the time and just dont care about other people. People need to understand that, a simple I'm sorry barely does shit. If you ever get dared to do something like this, say no. It fucks people up emotionally. Please, stop making games out of other people. Its sickening and cruel. Sorry for bad format/typos I'm on mobile.
Tl;Dr dont play games with feelings
