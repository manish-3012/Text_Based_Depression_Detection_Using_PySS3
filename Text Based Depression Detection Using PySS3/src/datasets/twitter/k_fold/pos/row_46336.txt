Does anyone else call Chick-fil-A â€œJesus Chicken?â€ Or is it just my family and I? I really need to know. Some of my friends donâ€™t understand what I mean when I call it that, but I donâ€™t know if the friends that do understand just make the connection that Chick-fil-A is religious or actually call it that
