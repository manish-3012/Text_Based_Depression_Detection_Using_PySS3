I have a boo-boo Me my friends went to a nearby highschool right after online classes since they end early. We went on a bike trail and it had a fun dip. We went down one side came up the other. There are two entrances for the other side. One entrance on the other side was blocked by a giant branch so moved it out of the way so me and my friend could go down but the other didn't want to. My friend went down first I went down second which resulted in me getting a boo boo.  I at first was fine until I got the death wobble making me fall with my bike at pretty fast speeds and tumbling this severely hurting my knee ( my knees are very sensitive so once I landed on I could barely walk at first), I scraped my left leg a bunch, hurt by wrist, and elbow. Now I barely can stand on my knee without it hurting. That's what happened...yeah I was stupid but it was fun... kinda
