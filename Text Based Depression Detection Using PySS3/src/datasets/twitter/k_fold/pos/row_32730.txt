asking for help iâ€™ve come to the conclusion i need help with a problem thatâ€™s really draining me mentally 

i donâ€™t want to make a big post about it because i donâ€™t want to upset anyone who may come across it unknowingly, i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone or bring them down because of my problem 

but if anyone likes picking people apart or listening to their problems, please dm me

processing and understanding emotions isnâ€™t my strong point etc etc but i need to cry, i need someone to be blunt and real with me so i can fix my problems

to everyone else, i wish you a wonderful day. try to smile &lt;3
