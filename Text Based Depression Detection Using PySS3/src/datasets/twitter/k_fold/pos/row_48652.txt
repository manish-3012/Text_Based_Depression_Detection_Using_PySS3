Is it normal to not have emotions when something happens? Whenever i encounter a Sad thing i simply not really feel anything. I dunno but this is usually the case.  


Also, How do i suppress my Emotions when needed to? I want to get rid of a Human Part (Emotions) if the situation calls to prevent me from doing something or affecting my life.
