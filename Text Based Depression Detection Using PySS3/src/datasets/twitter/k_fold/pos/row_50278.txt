Itâ€™s actually crazy I grew up at the exact right time for Marvel Movies Born in 02 I was 10 when I saw Avengers in theaters, loved it. A few years later Middie School Ultron hit, My homies and I discussed our favorite superheroes and shit. Back then Iron Man was the coolest, but the others like Cap and Thor caught up

Civil War hit my freshman year right when I was mature enough to understand the plot. I had intense Team Iron Man vs Team Cap debates. Homecoming was also fun and its high school setting most relatable to me right at the time it happened to come out.

Saw Infinity War with my friends Sophomore. One of the most exciting movies of my life honestly. 

And capped it off seeing Endgame in theaters with my friends, old and new, at age 17, and felt that same amazing emotion. This time with nostalgia too.

I grew up with these movies and I think Iâ€™m gonna love them for life. Thor, Hulk, Iron Man Cap, Black Panther, Black Widow, yessir. Might get a Black Panther poster for my dorm tbh
