How do I find motivation? Iâ€™ve found recently, especially since the shutdown, that it is extremely hard to find motivation to do almost anything even if it is something I enjoy. This has started to really affect me now that school has started back up for me and I struggle to find the motivation to do my work or pay attention. Do you guys have any tips on how to find motivation? Thanks.
