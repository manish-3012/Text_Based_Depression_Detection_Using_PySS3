Can any native english speaker help me with my english homework?? So basically I'm learning English as my second language and I have to transform some phrases from the passive to active voice

Here they are:
1- lunch is served between 12:00 and 1:30 
2- much plastic is recycled everyday
3- much time is spent in traffic
4- this tshirt was made in China 
5- English is spoken all over the world 
6- our house will be built next year
7- our car was stolen yesterday 
8- nothing was done to prevent this

If someone could help me with at least one or two maybe I can do the rest...
