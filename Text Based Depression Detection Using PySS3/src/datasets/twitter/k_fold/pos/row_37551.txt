I did something really bold and I feel great I had this girl on Insta for a while that I thought was really cute and so I added her on snap and made an attempt to talk to her and get to know her. She just left me on open and clearly wasn't interested and so I just shook it off and said oh well better luck next time. I felt so proud of myself for making an attempt. I could care less that she ignored me, I had the confidence to add a girl by search and shoot my shot. 
       Before quarantine I put no effort into my appearance and had no skills when it came to girls. That changed when I decided I would glow up while nobody was looking. What happened is a sign that my work is paying off and yours can too. My piece of advice is to not lose hope and work on yourself and keep shooting.
